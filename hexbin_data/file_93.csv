155,The effect of network mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and the efficacy of disease contact tracing,2007-12-04,"In networks, nodes may preferentially contact other nodes with similar (assortatively mixed) or dissimilar (disassortatively mixed) numbers of contacts. Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics, potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing, which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts. We used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact-tracing efficacy. For uncontrolled epidemics, outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks, with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low, but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates. For assortatively mixed networks, disease spreads first to highly connected nodes, but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes. The converse is true for disassortative mixing, where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes. For small epidemics, contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal. Multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single-step tracing for assortative mixing, but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks.","Kiss, Istvan Z; Green, Darren M; Kao, Rowland R",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386895/,93
393,How necessary is a fast testkit for mitigation of pandemic flu?,2010-07-06,"It is widely feared that a novel, highly pathogenic, human transmissible influenza virus may evolve that could cause the next global pandemic. Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.","Chin, Juxin; Koh, Geoffrey; Lee, Dong-Yup",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880075/,93

Since the reemergence of Ebola virus in Central Africa, the CIRMF “Emerging Viral Disease Unit” developed diagnostic tools and epidemiologic strategies and transfers of such technology to support the response of the National Public Health System and the World Health Organization to epidemics of Ebola virus disease. The Unit carries out a unique investigation program on the natural history of the filoviruses, emergence of epidemics, and Ebola virus pathogenesis. In addition, academic training is provided at all levels to regional and international students covering emerging conditions (host factors, molecular biology, genetics) that favor the spread of viral diseases.","Leroy, Eric; Gonzalez, Jean Paul",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499821/,93
1112,The Impact of Model Building on the Transmission Dynamics under Vaccination: Observable (Symptom-Based) versus Unobservable (Contagiousness-Dependent) Approaches,2013-04-12,"BACKGROUND: The way we formulate a mathematical model of an infectious disease to capture symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can greatly influence the likely effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of vaccine effect for preventing clinical illness. The present study aims to assess the impact of model building strategy on the epidemic threshold under vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We consider two different types of mathematical models, one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness (hereafter, the “observable model”) and the other based on unobservable information of infection event and infectiousness (the “unobservable model”). By imposing a number of modifying assumptions to the observable model, we let it mimic the unobservable model, identifying that the two models are fully consistent only when the incubation period is identical to the latent period and when there is no pre-symptomatic transmission. We also computed the reproduction numbers with and without vaccination, demonstrating that the data generating process of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness is consistent with the observable model only and examining how the effective reproduction number is differently calculated by two models. CONCLUSIONS: To explicitly incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of symptomatic illness into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression. More modeling studies based on observable epidemiological information are called for.","Ejima, Keisuke; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Nishiura, Hiroshi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3625221/,93
1760,Using the Pathogenic and Nonpathogenic Nonhuman Primate Model for Studying Non-AIDS Comorbidities,2015-01-22,"With the advent of antiretroviral therapy that can control virus replication below the detection levels of conventional assays, a new clinical landscape of AIDS emerged, in which non-AIDS complications prevail over AIDS-defining conditions. These comorbidities are diverse and affect multiple organs, thus resulting in cardiovascular, kidney, neurocognitive and liver disease, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and cancers. A common feature of these conditions is that they are generally associated with accelerated aging. The mechanism behind these comorbidities is chronic excessive inflammation induced by HIV infection, which persists under antiretroviral therapy. Progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) closely reproduces these comorbidities and offers a simplified system in which most of the traditional human risk factors for comorbidities (i.e., smoking, hyperlipidemia) are absent. Additionally, experimental conditions can be properly controlled during a shorter course of disease for SIV infection. As such, NHPs can be employed to characterize new paradigms of AIDS pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of interventions aimed at alleviating non-AIDS-related comorbidities.","Pandrea, Ivona; Landay, Alan; Wilson, Cara; Stock, Jennifer; Tracy, Russell; Apetrei, Cristian",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369284/,93
2609,Perspectives on model forecasts of the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa: lessons and the way forward,2017-03-01,"The unprecedented impact and modeling efforts associated with the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa provides a unique opportunity to document the performances and caveats of forecasting approaches used in near-real time for generating evidence and to guide policy. A number of international academic groups have developed and parameterized mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak. These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data to derive key transmission and severity parameters, which are needed to calibrate mechanistic models. Here, we provide a perspective on some of the challenges and lessons drawn from these efforts, focusing on (1) data availability and accuracy of early forecasts; (2) the ability of different models to capture the profile of early growth dynamics in local outbreaks and the importance of reactive behavior changes and case clustering; (3) challenges in forecasting the long-term epidemic impact very early in the outbreak; and (4) ways to move forward. We conclude that rapid availability of aggregated population-level data and detailed information on a subset of transmission chains is crucial to characterize transmission patterns, while ensemble-forecasting approaches could limit the uncertainty of any individual model. We believe that coordinated forecasting efforts, combined with rapid dissemination of disease predictions and underlying epidemiological data in shared online platforms, will be critical in optimizing the response to current and future infectious disease emergencies.","Chowell, Gerardo; Viboud, Cécile; Simonsen, Lone; Merler, Stefano; Vespignani, Alessandro",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5331683/,93
2676,Two Sides of Emotion: Exploring Positivity and Negativity in Six Basic Emotions across Cultures,2017-04-20,"We employ a novel paradigm to test whether six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness; Ekman, 1992) contain both negativity and positivity, as opposed to consisting of a single continuum between negative and positive. We examined the perceived negativity and positivity of these emotions in terms of their affective and cognitive components among Korean, Chinese, Canadian, and American students. Assessing each emotion at the cognitive and affective levels cross-culturally provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the positivity and negativity of emotions. Affective components were rated as more divergent than cognitive components. Cross-culturally, Americans and Canadians gave higher valence ratings to the salient valence of each emotion, and lower ratings to the non-salient valence of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans. The results suggest that emotions encompass both positivity and negativity, and there were cross-cultural differences in reported emotions. This paradigm complements existing emotion theories, building on past research and allowing for more parsimonious explanations of cross-cultural research on emotion.","An, Sieun; Ji, Li-Jun; Marks, Michael; Zhang, Zhiyong",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397534/,93

3765,Psychometric assessments of Persian translations of three measures of conspiracist beliefs,2019-04-18,"Several self-report measures of conspiracist beliefs have been developed in Western populations, but examination of their psychometric properties outside Europe and North America is limited. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of three widely-used measures of conspiracist beliefs in Iran. We translated the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI), Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), and Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale (GCBS) into Persian. Factorial validity was examined using principal-axis factor analysis in a community sample from Tehran, Iran (N = 544). Further, the relationships between scores on these measures and hypothesized antecedents (i.e., education, schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation) were examined. Overall, we failed to find support for the parent factor structures of two of the three scales (BCTI and GCBS) and evidence of construct validity for all three scales was limited. These results highlight the necessity of further psychometric work on existing measures of conspiracy theories in diverse culturo-linguistic groups and the development of context-specific measures of conspiracist beliefs.","Atari, Mohammad; Afhami, Reza; Swami, Viren",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472751/,93
4534,Emergence of oscillations in a simple epidemic model with demographic data,2020-01-29,"Eliciting protective titers of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development, but current vaccine strategies have yet to induce bnAbs in humans. Many bnAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals are encoded by immunoglobulin gene rearrangments with infrequent naive B cell precursors and with unusual genetic features that may be subject to host regulatory control. Here, we administer antibodies targeting immune cell regulatory receptors CTLA-4, PD-1 or OX40 along with HIV envelope (Env) vaccines to rhesus macaques and bnAb immunoglobulin knock-in (KI) mice expressing diverse precursors of CD4 binding site HIV-1 bnAbs. CTLA-4 blockade augments HIV-1 Env antibody responses in macaques, and in a bnAb-precursor mouse model, CTLA-4 blocking or OX40 agonist antibodies increase germinal center B and T follicular helper cells and plasma neutralizing antibodies. Thus, modulation of CTLA-4 or OX40 immune checkpoints during vaccination can promote germinal center activity and enhance HIV-1 Env antibody responses.","Bradley, Todd; Kuraoka, Masayuki; Yeh, Chen-Hao; Tian, Ming; Chen, Huan; Cain, Derek W.; Chen, Xuejun; Cheng, Cheng; Ellebedy, Ali H.; Parks, Robert; Barr, Maggie; Sutherland, Laura L.; Scearce, Richard M.; Bowman, Cindy M.; Bouton-Verville, Hilary; Santra, Sampa; Wiehe, Kevin; Lewis, Mark G.; Ogbe, Ane; Borrow, Persephone; Montefiori, David; Bonsignori, Mattia; Anthony Moody, M.; Verkoczy, Laurent; Saunders, Kevin O.; Ahmed, Rafi; Mascola, John R.; Kelsoe, Garnett; Alt, Frederick W.; Haynes, Barton F.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031230/,93
5540,A model of bi-mode transmission dynamics of hepatitis C with optimal control,2013-12-30,"Several nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs), particularly PCR and real-time PCR, are currently used in the routine clinical laboratories. Such approaches have allowed rapid diagnosis with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. However, conventional PCR methods have several intrinsic disadvantages such as the requirement for temperature cycling apparatus, and sophisticated and costly analytical equipments. Therefore, amplification at a constant temperature is an attractive alternative method to avoid these requirements. A new generation of isothermal amplification techniques are gaining a wide popularity as diagnostic tools due to their simple operation, rapid reaction and easy detection. The main isothermal methods reviewed here include loop-mediated isothermal amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and helicase-dependent amplification. In this review, design criteria, potential of amplification, and application of these alternative molecular tests will be discussed and compared to conventional NAATs.","Sidoti, Francesca; Bergallo, Massimiliano; Costa, Cristina; Cavallo, Rossana",Mol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091206/,93

Due to evolving knowledge about special aspects of these patients and optimized supportive therapy, the prognosis has substantially improved during the last decades. General reluctance to admit cancer patients to an intensive care unit is therefore no longer justified. Reasons for admission are often infections and/or respiratory failure. Extensive diagnostic measures, causal and supportive therapy of sepsis according to current guidelines has led to improved outcome even in cancer patients. In respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation is the key to improved prognosis if used early enough and indications, contraindications and break-off criteria are strictly followed.

7267,From Bench to Cageside: Risk Assessment for Rodent Pathogen Contamination of Cells and Biologics,2008-01-01,"Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-mediated exon skipping is among the more promising approaches to the treatment of several neuromuscular disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main weakness of this approach arises from the low efficiency and sporadic nature of the delivery of charge-neutral PMO into muscle fibers, the mechanism of which is unknown. In this study, to test our hypothesis that muscle fibers take up PMO more efficiently during myotube formation, we induced synchronous muscle regeneration by injection of cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior muscle of Dmd exon 52-deficient mdx52 and wild-type mice. Interestingly, by in situ hybridization, we detected PMO mainly in embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating fibers. In addition, we showed that PMO or 2′-O-methyl phosphorothioate is taken up efficiently into C2C12 myotubes when transfected 24–72 h after the induction of differentiation but is poorly taken up into undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts suggesting efficient uptake of PMO in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. Next, we tested the therapeutic potential of PMO for laminin-α2 chain-null dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice: a model of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) with active muscle regeneration. We confirmed the recovery of laminin-α2 chain and slightly prolonged life span following skipping of the mutated exon 4 in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice. These findings support the idea that PMO entry into fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on dystrophinless muscle membranes and provide a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.","Aoki, Yoshitsugu; Nagata, Tetsuya; Yokota, Toshifumi; Nakamura, Akinori; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Partridge, Terence; Takeda, Shin'ichi",Hum Mol Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108576/,93

9458,Data sharing and outbreaks: best practice exemplified,2020-01-24,"Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins are crucial for fine-tuning a cell’s response to both intracellular and extracellular cues. ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, which occurs in two flavours: modification of a target with multiple ADP-ribose moieties (poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or PARylation) or with only one unit (MARylation), which are added by the different enzymes of the PARP family (also known as the ARTD family). PARylation has been relatively well-studied, particularly in the DNA damage response. This has resulted in the development of PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, which are increasingly employed in cancer chemotherapeutic approaches. Despite the fact that the majority of PARP enzymes catalyse MARylation, MARylation is not as well understood as PARylation. MARylation is a dynamic process: the enzymes reversing intracellular MARylation of acidic amino acids (MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1) were discovered in 2013. Since then, however, little information has been published about their physiological function. MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1 have a ‘macrodomain’ harbouring the catalytic site, but no other domains have been identified. Despite the lack of information regarding their cellular roles, there are a number of studies linking them to cancer. However, some of these publications oppose each other, some rely on poorly-characterised antibodies, or on aberrant localisation of overexpressed rather than native protein. In this review, we critically assess the available literature on a role for the hydrolases in cancer and find that, currently, there is limited evidence for a role for MACROD1, MACROD2, or TARG1 in tumorigenesis.","Feijs, Karla L.H.; Cooper, Christopher D.O.; Žaja, Roko",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139919/,93

9679,Species groups can be transferred across different scales,2006-06-12,"Summary: The mucosae and exocrine glands harbour the largest activated B‐cell system of the body, amounting to some 80–90% of all immunoglobulins (Ig)‐producing cells. The major product of these immunocytes is polymeric (p)IgA (mainly dimers) with associated J chain. Both pIgA and pentameric IgM contain a binding site for the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), or secretory component (SC), which is a requirement for their active external transport through secretory epithelia. The pIgR/SC binding site depends on covalent incorporation of the J chain into the quaternary structure of the polymers when they are produced by the local immunocytes. This important differentiation characteristic appears to be sufficient functional justification for the J chain to be expressed also by most B cells terminating at secretory effector sites with IgD or IgG production; they probably represent a ‘spin‐off’ from sequential downstream C(H) switching on its way to pIgA expression, thus apparently reflecting a maturational stage of effector B‐cell clones compatible with homing to these sites. Observations in IgA‐deficient individuals suggest that the magnitude of this homing is fairly well maintained even when the differentiation pathway to IgA is blocked. Certain microenvironmental elements such as specific cytokines and dendritic cells appear to be required for induction of IgA synthesis, but it remains virtually unknown why this isotype normally is such a dominating product of local immunocytes and why they have such a high level of J chain expression. Also, despite the recent identification of some important requirements in terms of adhesion molecules (e.g. integrin α4β7 and MAdCAM‐1) that explain the “gut‐seeking” properties of enterically induced B cells, the origin of regionalized homing of B cells to secretory effector sites outside the gut remains elusive. Moreover, little is known about immune regulation underlying the striking disparity of both the class (IgD, IgM) and subclass (IgA1, IgA2, IgGI, IgG2) production patterns shown by local iinmttnocytes in various regions of the body, although the topical microbiota and other environmental stimuli might be important. Rational design of local vaccines will depend on better knowledge of both inductive and migratory properties of human mucosal B cells.","Brandtzaeg, Per; Farstad, Inger Nina; Johansen, Finn‐Eirik; Morton, H.

Dyspnoeic cats often have significant underlying disease. Underlying aetiologies in cats that presented with dyspnoea were reviewed, and associations with patient signalment and outcome were investigated. Methods: The case records of 90 dyspnoeic cats were retrospectively reviewed and separated into different groups depending on aetiology (cardiac, respiratory, neoplastic and trauma). Duration of clinical signs, presentation, hospitalisation length and survival were analysed. Results: Cardiac (38 per cent), respiratory (32 per cent) and neoplastic (20 per cent) diseases were common causes of feline dyspnoea. Cats with respiratory causes had longer duration of clinical signs (P<0·001) before presentation. Cats with neoplasia were significantly older (P<0·001). No significant difference in respiratory rates was present between the groups (P = 0·154). High heart rates (P<0·001) and abnormalities on cardiac auscultation were more likely in the cardiac group. Clinical Significance: Frequent causes of dyspnoea in cats were cardiac disease followed by respiratory causes and neoplastic conditions. Heart rate on presentation and presence of heart murmurs or gallops are useful to identify cardiac causes. Improved proportion surviving was found in the respiratory group (P = 0·027), whereas cats with neoplasia had the worst outcome.","Swift, S.; Dukes‐McEwan, J.; Fonfara, S.; Loureiro, J.

10515,Ensuring Equitable Access to School Meals,2020-04-23,"PURPOSE: Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is characterized by sudden onset, painless, and massive hemorrhage from rectal ulcer(s) in patients with serious underlying illnesses. It is a matter of controversy whether acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a distinct clinical entity. This is the first Asian report on acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome to be made outside Japan. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1999, 8,085 patients underwent total colonoscopy at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and colonoscopic files. The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome was made by means of the clinical, histologic, and colonoscopic findings. RESULTS: Among the 8,085 patients, 19 patients (11 males; mean age, 71.2 ± 10.1 years) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome, which accounted for 2.8 percent of the patients with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The duration from hospitalization to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9 ± 3.3) days. Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance were solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s), with round, circumferential, geographical, or Dieulafoy-like lesions located within a mean of 4.7 cm ± 1.5 cm from the dentate line. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, which is considered to be similar to stress-related mucosa injury. Successful hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients with direct therapeutic maneuvers. Prognosis was largely dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSIONS: We assert that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare but important entity and stress that awareness of this clinical entity should lead to a high index of suspicion resulting in early detection, diagnosis, and appropriate therapy.","Tseng, Chang-An; Chen, Li-Tzong; Tsai, Kun-Bow; Su, Yu-Chung; Wu, Deng-Chyang; Jan, Chang-Ming; Wang, Wen-Ming; Pan, Yong-Sang",Dis Colon Rectum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177015/,93

STUDY DESIGN: A 10-year retrospective study at a single hospital. Primary outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and development of end stage renal disease (ESRD). RESULTS: Of 35 infants, 50% developed eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 15% progressed to ESRD. Nadir creatinine, need for invasive ventilation in the newborn period, and need for surgical diversion after catheter diversion were associated with worse outcomes. 50% of infants requiring invasive ventilation as neonates developed eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Half of infants with early presentation and intervention developed significant renal insufficiency in childhood, similar to children with later presentation or who had fetal intervention. Invasive ventilation in the newborn period and need for surgical urinary diversion are associated with worse outcomes.","Coquillette, Madeline; Lee, Richard S.; Pagni, Sarah E.; Cataltepe, Sule; Stein, Deborah R.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223871/,93

11938,Implementing the chick embryo model to study vestibular developmental disorders,2019-12-01,"Parietal cells are responsible for gastric acid secretion, which aids in the digestion of food, absorption of minerals, and control of harmful bacteria. However, a fine balance of activators and inhibitors of parietal cell-mediated acid secretion is required to ensure proper digestion of food, while preventing damage to the gastric and duodenal mucosa. As a result, parietal cell secretion is highly regulated through numerous mechanisms including the vagus nerve, gastrin, histamine, ghrelin, somatostatin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and other agonists and antagonists. The tight regulation of parietal cells ensures the proper secretion of HCl. The H(+)-K(+)-ATPase enzyme expressed in parietal cells regulates the exchange of cytoplasmic H(+) for extracellular K(+). The H(+) secreted into the gastric lumen by the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase combines with luminal Cl(−) to form gastric acid, HCl. Inhibition of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase is the most efficacious method of preventing harmful gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors and potassium competitive acid blockers are widely used therapeutically to inhibit acid secretion. Stimulated delivery of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase to the parietal cell apical surface requires the fusion of intracellular tubulovesicles with the overlying secretory canaliculus, a process that represents the most prominent example of apical membrane recycling. In addition to their unique ability to secrete gastric acid, parietal cells also play an important role in gastric mucosal homeostasis through the secretion of multiple growth factor molecules. The gastric parietal cell therefore plays multiple roles in gastric secretion and protection as well as coordination of physiological repair.","Engevik, Amy C.; Kaji, Izumi; Goldenring, James R.",Physiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327232/,93
11978,Development and Challenges in Animal Tuberculosis Vaccination,2020-06-15,"Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK–STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host.","Kurokawa, Cheyne; Lynn, Geoffrey E.; Pedra, Joao H.

Second, his dialectical focus on a “struggle” between humans and technologies reveals the limits of neo-Marxism. Political philosophy of technology needs to return “to the things themselves”.

12836,Development of a knowledge translation platform for ataxia: Impact on readers and volunteer contributors,2020-09-01,"(1) Purpose: To assess the oral health literacy (OHL) of parents and its association with the caries experience of their preschool children attending the Hospital University Sains Malaysia (HUSM), Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia. (2) Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study involving a systematic random sampling method, using a sample of 230 parent/preschool child dyads. Among 230 parents, 24 were males and 206 were females (mean age 31.43 ± 5.82); among 230 children, 92 were boys and 138 were girls (mean age 4.82 ± 1.04) attending the pedodontics clinic, HUSM, who participated and met the inclusion criteria. A structured, self-administered oral health literacy questionnaire including sociodemographic factors was used in this study. A child’s oral examination was performed to check the dmft (decayed, missing, filled teeth) status. Statistical analysis was done using descriptive and Spearman’s correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis. (3) Results: The mean dmft score of children in relation to the OHL level of parents showed a significant difference (p < 0.00). The mean dmft score of children in relation to the OHL level of parents showed the following relationships: Inadequate (7.49 ± 4.10) followed by marginal (3.28 ± 2.67) and then adequate (0.55 ± 1.55). The incidence of caries amongst children in relation to parental employment was more associated with unemployed parents (6.11 ± 4.43) than with employed parents (2.79 ± 3.65). The caries experience amongst children in relation to education of their parents revealed a significant difference (p < 0.001), and the mean dmft score was high amongst preschool children with primary school qualified parents (10.7 ± 4.10) followed by high school (7.04 ± 3.68), vocational (5.81 ± 3.57), diploma (2.61 ± 2.81), and university (1.29 ± 2.27), respectively. The results revealed a valid significant difference (negative correlation, r(s) = −0.753 **) between the OHL of parents with the dmft score of their preschool children. The age and gender of parents was not significantly associated with OHL, whereas ethnicity (positive correlation, r(s) = 0.283 **), education (positive correlation, r(s) = 0.865 **), and employment (negative correlation, r(s) = −0.490 **) were found to be significant. Conclusion: We conclude that there is a significant association between the OHL of parents with the dmft score of their preschool children. The logistic regression showed that after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, parents’ gender (OR = 0.067, 95% CI: 0.012–0.360), parents’ employment status (OR = 3.247, 95% CI: 0.897–11.754), parents’ OHL score (OR = 0.042, 95% CI: 0.016–0.114), and child age (OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.249–3.857) were significantly associated with dental caries in children. Our study concluded that parents’ employment status, age, gender, OHL, and child’s age were significantly associated with the caries experience of their preschool children.","Adil, Abdul Habeeb; Eusufzai, Sumaiya Zabin; Kamruddin, Aimi; Wan Ahmad, Wan Muhamad Amir; Jamayet, Nafij Bin; Karobari, Mohmed Isaqali; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7464453/,93

14330,The effect of autophagy and mitochondrial fission on Harderian gland is greater than apoptosis in male hamsters during different photoperiods,2020-11-30,"The chicken immune system has provided an immense contribution to basic immunology knowledge by establishing major landmarks and discoveries that defined concepts widely used today. One of many special features on chickens is the presence of a compact and simple major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Despite its simplicity, the chicken MHC maintains the essential counterpart genes of the mammalian MHC, allowing for a strong association to be detected between the MHC and resistance or susceptibility to infectious diseases. This association has been widely studied for several poultry infectious diseases, including infectious bronchitis. In addition to the MHC and its linked genes, other non-MHC loci may play a role in the mechanisms underlying such resistance. It has been reported that innate immune responses, such as macrophage function and inflammation, might be some of the factors driving resistance or susceptibility, consequently influencing the disease outcome in an individual or a population. Information about innate immunity and genetic resistance can be helpful in developing effective preventative measures for diseases such as infectious bronchitis, to which a systemic antibody response is often not associated with disease protection. In this review, we summarize the importance of the chicken MHC in poultry disease resistance, particularly to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections and the role played by innate immunity and inflammation on disease outcome. We highlight how future studies focusing on the MHC and non-MHC genes can potentially bring clarity to observed resistance in some chicken B haplotype lines.","da Silva, Ana P.; Gallardo, Rodrigo A.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711580/,93

The viral diversity of wildlife may be best described with discovery-driven approaches to the study of viral diversity that broaden research efforts towards non-canonical hosts and remote geographic regions. Birds have been key organisms in the transmission of viruses causing important diseases, and wild birds are threatened by viral spillovers associated with human activities. However, our knowledge of the avian virome may be biased towards poultry and highly pathogenic diseases. We describe and compare the fecal virome of two passerine-dominated bird assemblages sampled in a remote Neotropical rainforest in French Guiana (Nouragues Natural Reserve) and a Mediterranean forest in central Spain (La Herrería). We used metagenomic data to quantify the degree of functional and genetic novelty of viruses recovered by examining if the similarity of the contigs we obtained to reference sequences differed between both locations. In general, contigs from Nouragues were significantly less similar to viruses in databases than contigs from La Herrería using Blastn but not for Blastx, suggesting that pristine regions harbor a yet unknown viral diversity with genetically more singular viruses than more studied areas. Additionally, we describe putative novel viruses of the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and Hepeviridae. These results highlight the importance of wild animals and remote regions as sources of novel viruses that substantially broaden the current knowledge of the global diversity of viruses.","Truchado, Daniel A.; Llanos-Garrido, Alejandro; Oropesa-Olmedo, David A.; Cerrada, Belén; Cea, Pablo; Moens, Michaël A.

14954,Management of Microbiological Contamination of the Water Network of a Newly Built Hospital Pavilion,2021-01-16,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Morphological changes are common in populations of animals in response to environmental and evolutionary forces. This is the case for salamanders, which can adapt to most environments on earth. On the Korean Peninsula, Hynobius salamanders are widespread, with several species overlapping in distribution. In addition, while there are seven segregated clades based on mitochondrial DNA, only four of them have been described as segregated species and the three others are candidate species for which the species level of divergence has not been tested yet. Here we measured 329 individuals from all seven clades, in areas of range overlap or not, on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A), and tested for the species status of the three candidate species. Individuals on the mainland had a generally broader morphology than those on the islands (Graphical Abstract B), and individuals in the range overlap differed from the individuals from the same species that were not found in presence of another clade (Graphical Abstract C). Despite a significant impact of the island effect and the sympatric areas, all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we describe Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. ABSTRACT: Closely related individuals from different areas can see their morphologies change based on differences between clades, but also ecological variables such as the island effect or sympatry. This is the case of salamanders, which have adapted to a broad range of ecological niches, ranging from underground dwellers in xeric landscape to tropical arboreal habitats. On the Korean Peninsula, salamanders from the Hynobius clade are widespread on the mainland and islands, with several partially sympatric clades and candidate species. Currently, seven lineages have been identified based on mtDNA, four of them matching named species and three others for which the species status remains untested. While the morphology of Korean Hynobius is known to be variable between genetically segregated clades, we hypothesise that (1) the candidate species are morphologically different, and that (2) the island effect and (3) the sympatric status have significant impacts on the morphology of individuals within the genus. Here we measured 329 Hynobius salamanders from all seven clades, in areas of sympatry and allopatry, and on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A). We determined that the island effect had a significant impact on the morphology of the genus, with mainland individuals generally displaying a broader range of morphology than islandic individuals (Graphical Abstract B). We also determined that sympatry had an impact on morphology, with the sizes of individuals from clades in sympatric areas diverging from each other (Graphical Abstract C). Finally, we demonstrated that all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we described the three candidate species that had already been isolated based on mtDNA and microsatellite data: Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. We conclude that looking at morphology alone would be misleading about the true diversity of Hynobius species, and species in general, because of the island and patry effects.","Borzée, Amaël; Min, Mi-Sook",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830202/,93
15082,The forty-year journey of Zoological Research: advancing with the times,2021-01-18,"In the early stages of an outbreak, the term ‘pandemic’ can be used to communicate about infectious disease risk, particularly by those who wish to encourage a large-scale public health response. However, the term lacks a widely accepted quantitative definition. We show that, under alternate quantitative definitions of ‘pandemic’, an epidemiological metapopulation model produces different estimates of the probability of a pandemic. Critically, we show that using different definitions alters the projected effects of key parameters—such as inter-regional travel rates, degree of pre-existing immunity, and heterogeneity in transmission rates between regions—on the risk of a pandemic. Our analysis provides a foundation for understanding the scientific importance of precise language when discussing pandemic risk, illustrating how alternative definitions affect the conclusions of modelling studies. This serves to highlight that those working on pandemic preparedness must remain alert to the variability in the use of the term ‘pandemic’, and provide specific quantitative definitions when undertaking one of the types of analysis that we show to be sensitive to the pandemic definition.","Singer, Benjamin J.; Thompson, Robin N.; Bonsall, Michael B.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7844018/,93

Therefore, the optimal choices for both the type of initial fracture stabilisation (external fixation/EF, early total care/ETC, conservative treatment/TC) and the best time point for conversion from temporary to definitive fixation are challenging factors. PATIENTS: Patients aged ≥ 16 years with moderate and severe trauma documented in the TraumaRegister DGU(®) between 2002 and 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Demographics, ISS, surgical treatment strategy (ETC vs. EF vs. TC), time for conversion to definitive care, complication (MOF, sepsis) and survival rates were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 13,091 trauma patients were included. EF patients more often sustained high-energy trauma (car: 43.1 vs. 29.5%, p < 0.001), were younger (40.6 vs. 48.1 years, p < 0.001), were more severely injured (ISS 25.4 vs. 19.1 pts., p < 0.001), and had higher sepsis (11.8 vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) and MOF rates (33.1 vs. 16.0%, p < 0.001) compared to ETC patients. A shift from ETC to EF was observed. The time until conversion decreased for femoral fractures from 9 to 8 days within the observation period. Sepsis incidences decreased in EF (20.3 to 12.3%, p < 0.001) and ETC (9.1–4.8%, p < 0.001) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the changes in the surgical treatment of severely injured patients with femur fractures over a period of almost two decades caused by the introduction of modern surgical strategies (e.g., Safe Definitive Surgery). It remains unclear which subgroups of trauma patients benefit most from these strategies.","Bläsius, Felix M.; Laubach, Markus; Andruszkow, Hagen; Lichte, Philipp; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Lefering, Rolf; Horst, Klemens; Hildebrand, Frank",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883956/,93

Swine ‘jackpot shows’ that occur before county fairs each summer intermix large numbers of exhibition swine from diverse geographic locations. We investigated the role of jackpot shows in influenza zoonoses. METHODS: We collected snout wipe or nasal swab samples from 17,009 pigs attending 350 national, state, and local swine exhibitions across eight states during 2016-2018. RESULTS: Influenza was detected in 13.9% of swine sampled at jackpot shows, and 76.3% of jackpot shows had at least one pig test positive. Jackpot shows had 4.3-fold higher odds of detecting at least one influenza-positive pig compared to county fairs. When influenza was detected at a county fair, almost half of pigs tested positive, clarifying why zoonotic infections occur primarily at county fairs. CONCLUSIONS: The earlier timing of jackpot shows and long-distance travel for repeated showing of individual pigs provide a pathway for the introduction of influenza into county fairs. Mitigation strategies aimed at curtailing influenza at jackpot shows are likely to have downstream effects on disease transmission at county fairs and zoonoses.","McBride, Dillon S; Perofsky, Amanda C; Nolting, Jacqueline M; Nelson, Martha I; Bowman, Andrew S",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989509/,93

Here we report a protective role of GPR37 in multiple models of infection and sepsis. Mice lacking Gpr37 exhibited increased death and/or hypothermia following challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Listeria bacteria, and the mouse malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Sepsis induced by LPS and Listeria in wild-type mice is protected by artesunate (ARU) and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), but the protective actions of these agents are lost in Gpr37(−/−) mice. Notably, we found that ARU binds to GPR37 in macrophages and promotes phagocytosis and clearance of pathogens. Moreover, ablation of macrophages potentiated infection, sepsis, and their sequelae, whereas adoptive transfer of NPD1- or ARU-primed macrophages reduced infection, sepsis, and pain-like behaviors. Our findings reveal physiological actions of ARU in host cells by activating macrophages and suggest that GPR37 agonists may help to treat sepsis, bacterial infections, and malaria.","Bang, Sangsu; Donnelly, Christopher R.; Luo, Xin; Toro-Moreno, Maria; Tao, Xueshu; Wang, Zilong; Chandra, Sharat; Bortsov, Andrey V.; Derbyshire, Emily R.; Ji, Ru-Rong",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969930/,93

Using mobile instant messaging (IM) for family communication is increasingly popular, but its association with family functioning and family well-being has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association of the use of family IM chat groups with family functioning and well-being, and the mediating effect of family communication quality among Chinese adults in Hong Kong. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Family and Health Information Trend Survey (FHInTS), a territory-wide, probability-based telephone survey conducted in 2017. The quality of family communication, family functioning, and well-being was assessed using the Family Communication Scale; Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve (APGAR) Scale; and Family Well-Being Scale (family heath, harmony, and happiness), respectively. Respondents also reported the number of family IM chat groups (0, 1, 2, ≥3), and numbers of IM messages received (<1, 1-2, 3-10, 11-20, >20) and sent (<1, 1-2, 3-10, 11-20, >20) daily. The frequency of family IM chat interaction (range 0-8) was calculated by combining the number of messages received from and sent to the family IM chat groups daily. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and the frequency of family face-to-face communication (often, sometimes, seldom, or never). Data were weighted by sex, age, and education of the general population. Adjusted β coefficients of family functioning and well-being in relation to having a family IM chat group, and numbers of messages received and sent were calculated. The mediation effects of family communication on these associations were assessed, controlling for the covariates. RESULTS: A random sample of 1638 Chinese adults (45.6% men; 78.1% aged 25 to 64 years) were interviewed (response rate: 74.4%). Female, younger age, being married or cohabiting, higher education, higher income, better family functioning, and well-being were associated with having at least one family IM chat group (all P<.01). Higher scores of family communication, family APGAR, and family well-being were associated with having more family IM chat groups and more messages received from and sent to family IM chat groups daily (all P for trend <.01). More frequent family IM chat interaction was associated with higher scores of family communication, family APGAR, and family well-being (β=.16-.83, all P for trend <.001). The associations of family IM chat interaction with family functioning and well-being were moderately (51.0%-59.6%) mediated by family communication. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a family IM chat group was associated with higher family functioning and well-being, and the association was partially mediated by family communication.","Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Luk, Tzu Tsun; Guo, Ningyuan; Wang, Man Ping; Lai, Agnes Yuen Kwan; Wong, Bonny Yee Man; Fong, Daniel Yee Tak; Chan, Sophia Siu Chee; Lam, Tai Hing",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8074847/,93

Health policy has increased staffing targets, yet effective intervention strategies are lacking. This research aimed to systematically map the rheumatology workforce to improve the evidence for interventions and explore possibilities for more effective health workforce management. METHODS: The WHO National Health Workforce Accounts provided a conceptual framework for the mapping exercise. Four major sets of indicators were selected, comprising staffing levels, health labor market flows, composition and education/training. A comparison of age groups and time series was applied to explore trends. Public statistics and other secondary sources served our analysis using descriptive methodology. RESULTS: In Germany there are 1076 physicians specialized in internal medical rheumatology. Absolute numbers have nearly doubled (91%) since 2000 but with a strong demographic bias. Between 2000 and 2019 numbers markedly increased in the group aged 50 years and older but only by 9% in the younger group under 50 years; since 2010 the group aged 40–50 years even faces a decrease. In 2019, the absolute numbers of rheumatologists in retirement age exceeded those aged 40 years and under. Since 2015 an expanding workforce trend has overall flattened but this was strongest in the hospital sector; the numbers in resident training did not show any relevant growth. CONCLUSION: Health workforce trends reveal that an available number of rheumatologists cannot meet new health policy planning targets. There is a need for effective health workforce management, focusing on innovation in resident training, improved task delegation and gender equality.","Kuhlmann, Ellen; Bruns, Luzia; Hoeper, Kirsten; Witte, Torsten; Ernst, Diana; Jablonka, Alexandra",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8129704/,93

Here, we review the contribution of these changes in microglia morphology in distantly related species, in homeostatic and non-homeostatic conditions, with three principal goals (1): to review the phylogenetic influences on the morphological diversity of microglia during homeostasis (2); to explore the impact of homeostatic perturbations (Dengue virus challenge) in distantly related species (Mus musculus and Callithrix penicillata) as a proxy for the differential immune response in small and large brains; and (3) to examine the influences of environmental enrichment and aging on the plasticity of the microglial morphological response following an immunological challenge (neurotropic arbovirus infection). Our findings reveal that the differences in microglia morphology across distantly related species under homeostatic condition cannot be attributed to the phylogenetic origin of the species. However, large and small brains, under similar non-homeostatic conditions, display differential microglial morphological responses, and we argue that age and environment interact to affect the microglia morphology after an immunological challenge; in particular, mice living in an enriched environment exhibit a more efficient immune response to the virus resulting in earlier removal of the virus and earlier return to the homeostatic morphological phenotype of microglia than it is observed in sedentary mice.","Carvalho-Paulo, Dario; Bento Torres Neto, João; Filho, Carlos Santos; de Oliveira, Thais Cristina Galdino; de Sousa, Aline Andrade; dos Reis, Renata Rodrigues; dos Santos, Zaire Alves; de Lima, Camila Mendes; de Oliveira, Marcus Augusto; Said, Nivin Mazen; Freitas, Sinara Franco; Sosthenes, Marcia Consentino Kronka; Gomes, Giovanni Freitas; Henrique, Ediely Pereira; Pereira, Patrick Douglas Côrrea; de Siqueira, Lucas Silva; de Melo, Mauro André Damasceno; Guerreiro Diniz, Cristovam; Magalhães, Nara Gyzely de Morais; Diniz, José Antonio Picanço; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa; Diniz, Daniel Guerreiro; Anthony, Daniel Clive; Sherry, David Francis; Brites, Dora; Picanço Diniz, Cristovam Wanderley",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250867/,93

Health data are potentially useful for a variety of purposes. Yet information about health remains sensitive. A balance therefore has to be struck between these opposing considerations in a number of contexts. The attitudes among those whose data is concerned will influence the perceived legitimacy of policies regulating health data use. We aimed to investigate what views are held by the general public, and what aspects matter for the willingness to let one’s data be used not only for one’s own care but also for other purposes. We found that while there is a broad willingness to let one’s data be used, the possibility to influence that use is considered important. The study also indicated that when respondents are required to balance different interests, priority is typically given to compulsory schemes ensuring that data are available where needed, rather than voluntary participation and data protection. The policy implications to be drawn from this are not self-evident, however, since the fact that a majority has a certain attitude does not by itself determine the most adequate policy.","Belfrage, Sara; Lynöe, Niels; Helgesson, Gert",Public Health Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254641/,93

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 147 patients with stage II-IVB squamous cell OPC participating in patient-reported outcomes assessments, a prespecified secondary aim of a randomized phase II/III trial of IMPT (n = 69) versus IMRT (n = 78), we compared absenteeism, presenteeism (i.e., the extent to which an employee is not fully functional at work), and work productivity losses. We used the work productivity and activity impairment questionnaire at baseline (pre-CRT), at the end of CRT, and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. A one-sided Cochran-Armitage test was used to analyze within-arm temporal trends, and a χ(2) test was used to compare between-arm differences. Among working patients, at each follow-up point, a 1-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare work-productivity scores. RESULTS: Patient characteristics in IMPT versus IMRT arms were similar. In the IMPT arm, within-arm analysis demonstrated that an increasing proportion of patients resumed working after IMPT, from 60% (40 of 67) pre-CRT and 71% (30 of 42) at 1 year to 78% (18 of 23) at 2 years (P = 0.025). In the IMRT arm, the proportion remained stable, with 57% (43 of 76) pre-CRT, 54% (21 of 39) at 1 year, and 52% (13 of 25) working at 2 years (P = 0.47). By 2 years after CRT, the between-arm difference between patients who had IMPT and those who had IMRT trended toward significance (P = 0.06). Regardless of treatment arm, among working patients, the most severe work impairments occurred from treatment initiation to the end of CRT, with significant recovery from absenteeism, presenteeism, and productivity impairments by the 2-year follow-up (P < 0.001 for all). Higher magnitudes of recovery from absenteeism (at 1 year, P = 0.05; and at 2 years, P = 0.04) and composite work impairment scores (at 1 year, P = 0.04; and at 2 years, P = 0.04) were seen in patients treated with IMPT versus those treated with IMRT. CONCLUSION: In patients with OPC receiving curative CRT, patients randomized to IMPT demonstrated increasing work and productivity recovery trends. Studies are needed to identify mechanisms underlying head and neck CRT treatment causing work disability and impairment.","Smith, Grace L.; Fu, Shuangshuang; Ning, Matthew S.; Nguyen, Diem-Khanh; Busse, Paul M.; Foote, Robert L.; Garden, Adam S.; Gunn, Gary B.; Fuller, Clifton D.; Morrison, William H.; Chronowski, Gregory M.; Shah, Shalin J.; Mayo, Lauren L.; Phan, Jack; Reddy, Jay P.; Snider, James W.; Patel, Samir H.; Katz, Sanford R.; Lin, Alexander; Mohammed, Nasiruddin; Dagan, Roi; Lee, Nancy Y.; Rosenthal, David I.; Frank, Steven J.",Int J Part Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270077/,93

20219,A seasonal model to assess intervention strategies for preventing periodic recurrence of Lassa fever,2021-08-11,"PURPOSE: Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is proven to be effective in the majority of patients with acute exacerbation COPD (AECOPD) complicated with respiratory failure. NIV could be lifesaving but also can delay mechanical ventilation if its efficacy is not assessed in a timely manner. In this study, we analyzed potential predictors of NIV failure in AECOPD in a tertiary medical intensive care unit (MICU). In particular, we wondered whether duration of NIV among those who eventually failed was associated with poor outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of AECOPD requiring NIV admitted to the MICU was conducted for the period between 2012 and 2017. Baseline data included demographics, APACHE III score, albumin level, blood lactate, and blood gas elements. Additional chart review was performed to collect NIV setting parameters on presentation to the MICU. Clinical outcome variables collected included outcome and duration of NIV, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, MICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine independent variables associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There were 370 patients who met the inclusion criteria; 53.2% were male. Mean age was 64.7 ± 11.2 years old. Mean baseline FEV(1) was 34 ±17% of predicted. Patients had mean pH of 7.20 ± 0.54 and P(a)CO(2) of 70.3 ± 28.7 on presentation; 323 patients (87.3%) were successfully weaned off NIV; 47 patients (12.7%) failed NIV and required invasive mechanical ventilation. APACHE III score was higher among patients who failed NIV (68.3±18.9 versus 48.8± 15.2, P < 0.001). In the subset of 47 patients who failed NIV requiring intubation, duration of NIV was 25.0 ± 58.8 h. Multivariate regression analysis yielded a model consisting of APACHE III score and body mass index as predictive variables for NIV failure (C-statistic = 0.809). Duration of NIV was not associated with worse clinical outcomes among patients who failed NIV. CONCLUSIONS: NIV is successful in preventing invasive mechanical ventilation in majority of patients with acute respiratory failure due to COPD. Patients with worse clinical status at presentation are more likely to fail NIV and require mechanical ventilation. In the subgroup of patients who failed NIV, duration of NIV prior to intubation was not associated with poor clinical outcomes.","Ghazala, Laith; Hatipoğlu, Umur; Devnani, Tanya; Covert, Erin; Hanks, Justin; Edwards, Katelyn; Macmurdo, Maeve; Li, Manshi; Wang, Xiaofeng; Duggal, Abhijit",Can J Respir Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8372872/,93

Critical care providers play a major role in treating severe malaria and its complications, which has management particularities that might not be readily apparent. Fluid resuscitation should be carefully tailored to avoid complications, and dysperfusion seems more related to degree of parasitemia than hypovolemia. Antimalarial agents are effective, but resistance is growing. Complications can be found in nearly every organ, including cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury.

24840,Acronyms and Abbreviations,2009-04-07,"Viral-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disease is a complex spectrum of clinical syndromes that result from viral tropism and individual immune responses and genetic susceptibility of patients. The epidemiology of the pathogens is constantly influenced by the availability, or non-availability, of health care services; preventative strategies; and the process of globalization, with rapid movement of people, animals and products. It is further complicated by natural disasters, wars and changes in lifestyle. The effects of the neurotropic viruses are discussed against the background of the epidemiology. The pathogenesis is a chain of events with the point of departure when the virus enters the body to spread and reach the different sites of the CNS. The blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier are then overcome by captivating mechanisms. Once the different viruses have settled at the preferred site or sites, and have sidestepped the initial immune surveillance, the phases of injury commence. The cytopathic effect of the viruses elicits a para- and post-infectious inflammatory response and a vicious circle of continued damage, viral entry and inflammation results in a process not merely of inflammation, but of intense inflammation. The different clinical syndromes are then identifiable and should be interpreted against their own specific and appropriate epidemiological backgrounds. Clinicians face the challenge of problematic management decisions while awaiting results on gravely ill patients and differential diagnostic considerations have to be taken into account. Establishing a diagnosis is a two-tier process: first it requires the integration of cerebrospinal fluid findings, imaging results, electrophysiological studies, serology and ancillary blood tests, for example full blood count, liver function tests and other appropriate microbiological investigations, and then these should be correlated with the clinical condition of the patient. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. General treatment principles for stabilizing and maintaining vital functions are crucial and empiric treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. This usually includes a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as third-generation cephalosporin and acyclovir. As soon as specific etiologies have been excluded antibiotics can be stopped. The use of acyclovir is discussed. In the last section of the chapter specific characteristics of the neurotropic viral families are summarized.","Smuts, Izelle; Lamb, Gregory V.","Viral Infections in Children, Volume II",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121290/,93

Medical management is critical to actualizing the individual or family’s intent to donate and maximizing the benefit of that intent. This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high. The brain dead organ donor is in a distinct and challenging pathophysiologic condition that culminates in multifactorial shock. The potential benefits of aggressive medical management of the organ donor may include increased number of donors providing transplantable organs and increased number of organs transplanted per donor. This may improve graft function, graft survival, and patient survival in those transplanted. In this chapter, pathophysiologic changes occurring after brain death are reviewed.

Usually primary infections occur during the first 2 years of life and are symptomatic, causing from mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe ALRI, and in some cases pneumonia and bronchiolitis may occur simultaneously. Recurrent infections throughout life are common but normally cause milder upper respiratory tract illness. Several studies also associated severe RSV infections during infancy with permanent lung function reduction in adulthood, with higher risk of asthma.

25667,Introduction to Bioterrorism Risk Assessment,2007,"Innovation in the services area — especially in the electronic services (e-services) domain — can be characterized by six decision-oriented attributes: decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuously-adaptive, customer-centric and computationally-intensive. These attributes constitute the decision informatics paradigm. In turn, decision informatics is supported by information and decision technologies and based on the disciplines of data fusion/analysis, decision modeling and systems engineering. Out of the nine major innovation enablers in the services area (i.e., decision informatics, software algorithms, automation, telecommunication, collaboration, standardization, customization, organization, and globalization), decision informatics is shown to be a necessary enabler. Furthermore, four innovation drivers (i.e., collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation) are identified; all four are directed at empowering the individual — that is, at recognizing that the individual can, respectively, contribute in a collaborative situation, receive customized or personalized attention, access an integrated system or process, and obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. In addition to expanding on current innovations in services and experiences, white spaces are identified for possible future innovations; they include those that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations, safeguard our rights to privacy, protect us from the always-on, interconnected world, provide us with an authoritative search engine, and generate a GDP metric that can adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation.","Tien, James M.",Service Enterprise Integration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122330/,93
25706,Reisemedizin,2017-02-01,"Food safety is a concern worldwide and according to the World Health Organization, developing countries are probably more at risk of foodborne illness because many of these, including those in the Middle East, have limited disease surveillance and prevention and control strategies. Specifically, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the third highest estimated burden of foodborne diseases per population, after the African and South-East Asia regions. However, it is difficult to determine what the burden is since little is published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports for public access. This chapter reviews 16 autonomous nations, namely, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. Countries range in size from Bahrain with 1.8 million inhabitants to Pakistan with a population of 184 million. Agriculture and local food production is much influenced by water availability for irrigation. Water shortages are most severe in the Gulf countries which rely on aquifers, desalination, and recycled waste water for most of their water supplies. This means that most food is imported which is expensive if not subsidized through petrodollars. This impacts food security which is a particular concern in countries under conflict, particularly, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in this region from Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, parasites, and more rarely from Aeromonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reports indicate that children are the most susceptible and that many isolates are multidrug resistant. Chemical contamination of water supplies and crops are probably more of a concern than published reports indicate, because of widespread indiscriminate use of fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides, coupled with increased industrial pollution affecting the water supplies. Like many other parts of the developing world, foodborne disease surveillance is limited and outbreaks are most often reported through the Press but with insufficient detail to determine the etiological agents and the factors contributing to the outbreaks, leading to speculation to the cause by those interested or responsible for food prevention and control. However, there are some well investigated outbreaks in the region that have those details, and reveal where the shortcomings of both the establishments and the inspection systems have been. Where the causative agents are known, the kinds of pathogens are generally similar to those found in the West, e.g., Salmonella, but many outbreaks seem to have short incubation periods that point to a toxin of some kind of chemical or biological origin, but these are almost never identified. Because of sectarian warfare, residents and refugees have been given food that has made them sick and solders? have been deliberately poisoned. Research has been focused on microbial contamination of locally-sold foodstuffs and manager and employee knowledge of food safety and hygienic conditions in food preparation establishments. An innovative pilot project in Qatar is to use seawater and sunlight for raising crops through the Sahara Forest Project. All countries have some kind of food establishment inspection system, but they tend to be punitive if faults are found in management or employees on the premises rather than being used for their education for improving food safety. Restaurants may be closed down and owners and employees fined for often unspecified infringements. However, some food control agents are moving towards employee training through seminars and courses before problems occur, which is a good disease prevention strategy. Unfortunately, many of the food handlers are from Asian countries with languages other than Arabic and English, which makes effective food safety communication and training difficult. Tourists visiting popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt have suffered from foodborne illnesses, usually of unknown origin but poor hygienic conditions are blamed with law suits following, and the adverse publicity affects the long-term viability of some of these resorts. Food exports, important for local economies, have occasionally been contaminated resulting in recalls and sometimes illnesses and deaths, notably fenugreek seeds from Egypt (E. coli O104:H4), pomegranate arils from Turkey (hepatitis A virus), and tahini from Lebanon (Salmonella). Overall, in recent decades, the Middle East has made strides towards improving food safety for both residents and foreign visitors or ex-pat workers. However, within the countries there are large discrepancies in the extent of effective public health oversight including food safety and food security. Currently, almost all of the countries are involved to a greater or lesser extent in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, or are affected through political tensions and strife in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Turkey. In addition, the current overproduction of oil on a world-wide scale has led to a rapid decrease in revenues to most Gulf states. All this points to a severe setback, and an uncertain foreseeable future for improvements in obtaining both sufficient and safe food for residents in this region.","Todd, Ewen C.

26092,China’s Prevention and Control and Policy Changes to the Influenza A (H1N1) Pandemic,2018-11-24,"Despite major advances in basic and applied research and the availability of several vaccines, viral diseases still account for a large proportion of the human infectious disease burden. Many viruses cause self-limiting and relatively mild infections, but several, including human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus, are responsible for millions of deaths every year throughout the world. Several factors contribute to the enormous impact that viruses have on human health. For example, there are very few therapeutic options available for the treatment of viral infections, and many of those that are available possess a limited spectrum of activity or are designed for the treatment of diseases caused by specific viruses (e.g., oseltamivir is intended for the treatment of influenza only). In addition, the rapid evolution of viruses has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains against which no currently available therapeutics are effective. Coupled with these and other issues are the appearance of never before seen viruses and the emergence of known but previously underappreciated viruses. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, numerous “new” viruses, including the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus, and Lujo hemorrhagic fever virus, have made their debut and have proved to be formidable threats to human health. Recently, the appearance of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) in West Africa, a region that has not previously seen an outbreak of this virus, was marked by an epidemic that afflicted nearly 30,000 individuals and killed more than 11,000 of those who were infected. Most recently, the far-reaching and rapid spread of Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that was discovered in the 1940s in Uganda, in the Western Hemisphere has invoked considerable public and scientific attention and has given rise to perhaps the largest concerted effort by scientists to rapidly develop a vaccine to halt the transmission of a virus. Each of these points underscores the importance of further research into improved surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of viral diseases.","Relich, Ryan F.",Atlas of Infectious Disease Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122910/,93
26222,Biological and Chemical Weapons,2016-03-30,"As the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, l-glutamateparticipates not only in standard fast synaptic communication, but also contributes to higher order signalprocessing, as well as neuropathology. Given this variety of functional roles, interest has been growingas to how the extracellular concentrations of l-glutamate surroundingneurons are regulated by cellular transporter proteins. This review focuses on two prominent systems, eachof which appears capable of influencing both the signaling and pathological actions of l-glutamatewithin the CNS: the sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and the glutamate/cystineexchanger, system x (c) (−)(Sx (c) (−)). Whilethe family of EAAT subtypes limit access to glutamate receptors by rapidly and efficiently sequesteringl-glutamate in neurons and glia, Sx(c) (−)provides a route for the export of glutamate from cells into the extracellular environment. The primaryintent of this work is to provide an overview of the inhibitors and substrates that have been developedto delineate the pharmacological specificity of these transport systems, as well as be exploited as probeswith which to selectively investigate function.

In the present study, the dynamic mesh model was used to predict the dynamic change of the flow field in the tunnel induced by the train motion. The DPM model was employed to simulate the interaction between the continuous phase of the air and the discrete phase of pollution particles. Accordingly, the dispersion of sudden pollutants released in the ventilation shaft was investigated. The results show that the submicron particles have a good following performance with the air. The dispersion characteristics of the particles highly depend on the unsteady flow field in the tunnel, which is significantly affected by the piston effect induced by the train motion. It can be concluded that particle diffusion experiences three stages: vertical forward and reverse diffusion in the wind shaft, vertical positive diffusion in the wind shaft, and longitudinal stable diffusion in the interval tunnel. It hopes that the study can provide guides for future biochemical protection in the subway system.","Lu, Xinyi; Wu, Yan; Wu, Jingwei; Zang, Jianbin","Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (ISHVAC 2019)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123675/,93
26714,Is Peking Man Still Our Ancestor?—Race and National Lineage,2019-02-07,"Highly contagious pustular skin infections of sheep, goats and cattle that were unwittingly transmitted to humans from close contact with infected animals, have been the scourge of shepherds, herdsmen and dairy farmers for centuries. In more recent times we recognise that these proliferative pustular lesions are likely to be caused by a group of zoonotic viruses that are classified as parapoxviruses. In addition to infecting the above ungulates, parapoxviruses have more recently been isolated from seals, camels, red deer and reindeer and most have been shown to infect man. The parapoxviruses have one of the smallest genomes of the poxvirus family (140 kb) yet share over 70% of their genes with the most virulent members. Like other poxviruses, the central core of the genomes encode factors for virus transcription and replication, and structural proteins, whereas the terminal regions encode accessory factors that give the parapoxvirus group many of its unique features. Several genes of parapoxviruses are unique to this genus and encode factors that target inflammation, the innate immune responses and the development of acquired immunity. These factors include a homologue of mammalian interleukin (IL)-10, a chemokine binding protein and a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor /IL-2 binding protein. The ability of this group to reinfect their hosts, even though a cell-mediated memory response is induced during primary infection, may be related to their epitheliotropic niche and the immunomodulators they produce. In this highly localised environment, the secreted immunomodulators only interfere with the local immune response and thus do not compromise the host’s immune system. The discovery of a vascular endothelial growth factor-like gene may explain the highly vascular nature of parapoxvirus lesions. There are many genes of parapoxviruses which do not encode polypeptides with significant matches with protein sequences in public databases, separating this genus from most other mammalian poxviruses. These genes appear to be involved in inhibiting apoptosis, manipulating cell cycle progression and degradation of cellular proteins that may be involved in the stress response, thus allowing the virus to subvert intracellular antiviral mechanisms and enhance the availability of cellular molecules required for replication. Parapoxviruses in common with Molluscum contagiosum virus lack a number of genes that are highly conserved in other poxviruses, including factors for nucleotide metabolism, serine protease inhibitors and kelch-like proteins. It is apparent that parapoxviruses have evolved a unique repertoire of genes that have allowed adaptation to the highly specialised environment of the epidermis.","Fleming, Stephen B.; Mercer, Andrew A.",Poxviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123698/,93
26833,Human Security in Practice: The Chinese Experience,2018-12-07,"Pneumonia is the most important respiratory infection in mechanically ventilated patients. It is defined as the presence of microorganisms in the pulmonary parenchyma leading to the development of an inflammatory response by the host, which may be localized in the lung or may extend systemically. Nosocomial pneumonia is an infectious process which develops within 48 hours after admission to the hospital and that was not incubating at the time of hospitalization. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is considered as a subgroup of nosocomial pneumonia and is an infectious pulmonary process which develops 48 hours after the presence of an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation. Since a large proportion of the patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia are intubated and receive mechanical ventilation, most epidemiological and clinical studies on nosocomial pneumonia have been focused on critically ill patients and those receiving mechanical ventilation. From a clinical point of view, nosocomial pneumonia is of great importance not only because of the consequences of the important morbidity and mortality but also due to the high costs associated with development of this disease.","Ferrer, M.; Valencia, M.; Torres, A.",Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123849/,93

Such ecological overlap, along with our shared evolutionary histories, makes human-nonhuman primate interfaces hot spots for the acquisition and transmission of parasites. In this chapter, we bring to light the importance of human-macaque interfaces in particular as hot spots for infectious disease ecological and epidemiological assessments. We first outline the significance and broader objectives behind research related to the subfield of primate infectious disease ecology and epidemiology. We then reveal how members of the genus Macaca, being among the most socioecologically flexible and invasive of all primate taxa, live under varying degrees of overlap with humans in anthropogenic landscapes. Thus, human-macaque interfaces may favor the bidirectional exchange of parasites. We then review studies that have isolated various types of parasites at human-macaque interfaces, using information from the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD: http://www.mammalparasites.org/). Finally, we elaborate on avenues through which the implementation of both novel conceptual frameworks (e.g., Coupled Systems, One Health) and quantitative network-based approaches (e.g., social and bipartite networks, agent-based modeling) may potentially address some of the critical gaps in our current knowledge of infectious disease ecology at human-primate interfaces.","Balasubramaniam, Krishna N.; Sueur, Cédric; Huffman, Michael A.; MacIntosh, Andrew J.

26884,CYBER NEWS,2014-12-29,"Viruses are ideal objects for studying evolutionary processes because of their short generation time, high numbers of offspring that they produce during infection and not least because of their simple structure. Viruses must continuously adapt to the conditions of their host or their host populations, so selection mechanisms are accessible to experimental approaches. In this context, different criteria play an important role, such as the antigenic diversity, the extent of virus excretion, and the degree of virulence. The complete adaptation of a virus to its host, which leads to a minimization of virulence of the infectious agent, is for both parties the desirable consequence: i.e. a problem-free coexistence and survival. For example, hepatitis G virus (GB virus C) which was initially isolated from patients with liver inflammation, seems to persist in many people without causing illnesses. A similar situation is observed with torque teno viruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). Spumaviruses are also found in many animal species and humans without causing symptomatic infections (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). For many viruses, the maximum exploitation of genetic variability is not always useful. Viruses reach a limit at which a greater variance is no longer advantageous: the proportion of non-infectious virus variants among the progeny becomes too high, whereby the potentially possible error limit is reached.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123911/,93

30579,Legal Briefs,2020-03-12,"To understand the factors that structure ectomycorrhizal—basidiomycete communities at a local scale, we measured the strength of the relations among the fungal communities, the tree communities, and the environment of a series of forest ecosystems in southern Quebec. We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal—basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae—forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.","Natel, Patrick; Neumann, Peter",Ecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159350/,93

Lactose malabsorption was also associated with more frequent hospitalizations in affected children. Coronavirus‐like particles were the commonest agent isolated from Aboriginal children. The majority of the Aboriginal children were malnourished (< 80% standard weight for age) which may have been contributed to by their lactose malabsorption and explain why this failed to recover in the same way as European children.

The study included broiler, layer and backyard rearing units. Overall occurrence of E. necatrix, E. maxima and E. acervulina was 64.5%. E. necatrix was detected in 55% (11/20) broiler farms, 66.7% (4/6) layer farms and 100% (5/5) backyard rearing units studied. Thus, occurrence of E. necatrix was detected in 64.5% (20/31) farms studied. E. maxima and E. acervulina were detected in droppings of 65% (13/20) broiler farms, 66.7% (4/6) layer farms and 60% (3/5) back yard rearing units. Genome counts of each Eimeria species revealed maximum parasite load of E. necatrix followed by E. acervulina in broiler farms and least in layer farms. The mean parasite load (genome) copies for these parasite species were intermediate for backyard units while E. maxima had the lowest number of genome copies in droppings. Mean E. maxima counts were highest in boiler farms, while it was similar for layer and back yard units. However, statistically no significant differences were observed for parasite load existing either between the broiler, layer or back yard units or between the genome counts of E. necatrix, E. acervulina or E. maxima.","Kundu, Krishnendu; Kumar, Saroj; Banerjee, Partha Sarathi; Garg, Rajat",J Parasit Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223584/,93

First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robots’ ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.","Yew, Gary Chan Kok",Int J Soc Robot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245509/,93

33643,Leveraging Wettability Engineering to Develop Three-Layer DIY Face Masks From Low-Cost Materials,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: China still suffers heavily from rabies, although reported human cases continue to decrease year over year. There are far fewer laboratory-confirmed human cases than clinically diagnosed cases, which is a big problem that needs to be addressed. In this report, we summarize analyses of all specimens from human cases tested in our laboratory over the past 15 years, in order to promote laboratory diagnosis of rabies. METHODS: From 2005 to 2019, a total of 271 samples from 164 suspected rabies cases were collected from local hospitals by the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China. Saliva, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum (blood) and urine were collected for ante-mortem diagnosis, and brain tissue, neck skin tissue and cornea were collected for post-mortem diagnosis. All of the specimens were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and brain tissues were also tested using fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The number of positive test results obtained using different fluids or tissues, and at different stages of the disease, were compared using a chi-square test and a more effective sampling program is recommended. RESULTS: As the national reference laboratory for rabies surveillance in China, our laboratory has tested 271 samples from 164 suspected rabies cases collected by local CDCs since 2005. We found that saliva gave the highest number of positive test results (32%), compared with CSF and other fluids. We also found that serum or blood specimens collected in the last 3 days of life can test positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum or blood samples collected in the last 3 days of a patient’s life can be used to measure viral RNA, which means that serum samples, as well as saliva and CSF, can be used to detect viral RNA for anti-mortem diagnosis of rabies. Because of our findings, we have modified our “National Surveillance Project for Human Rabies”, by adding the collection and testing of serum samples from the end of the survival period. This will improve our national surveillance and laboratory diagnosis of human rabies.","Li, Hao; Liu, Jia-Jia; Ding, Shu-Jun; Cai, Liang; Feng, Yun; Yu, Peng-Cheng; Liu, Shu-Qing; Lu, Xue-Xin; Tao, Xiao-Yan; Zhu, Wu-Yang",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266119/,93
33690,Lockdown Maths: Part 1: Why We Must Comply,2020-06-04,"This article critically examines the role new media can play in the political engagement of young people in Australia. Moving away from “deficit” descriptions, which assert low levels of political engagement among young people, it argues two major points. First, that there is a well-established model of contemporary political mobilisation that employs both new media and large data analysis that can and have been effectively applied to young people in electoral and non-electoral contexts. Second, that new media, and particularly social media, are not democratic by nature. Their general use and adoption by young and older people do not necessarily cultivate democratic values. This is primarily due to the type of participation afforded in the emerging “surveillance economy”. The article argues that a focus on scale as drivers of influence, the underlying foundation of their affordances based on algorithms, and the centralised editorial control of these platforms make them highly participative, but unequal sites for political socialisation and practice. Thus, recent examples of youth mobilisation, such as seen in recent climate justice movements, should be seen through the lens of cycles of contestation, rather than as technologically determined.","Chen, Peter John; Stilinovic, Milica",JAYS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266648/,93
33746,AFRICAN UNION: Testing Gap,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND: The involvement of Besnoitia bennetti in skin pathologies was investigated in a series of 20 donkeys from the Donkey Sanctuary in England, in the 2013–2019 period. METHODS: The initial histopathological finding of Besnoitia cysts in skin lumps that were presumed to be sarcoids in 2013 triggered our cognisance of this parasite and resulted in identification of a total of 20 cases. Histopathological examination of surgical biopsy samples collected from 8 live donkeys and tissue specimens from 12 deceased donkeys at post-mortem examination revealed the presence of Besnoitia cysts in all 20 donkeys. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and immunoblotting analysis showed the presence of anti-Besnoitia antibodies in archived serum samples from 4 deceased donkeys. Additionally, infection was evidenced in one live donkey based on IFAT and immunoblot analysis of tissue fluid of a dermal mass containing Besnoitia cysts, and real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and microsatellite genotyping of DNA isolated from the tissue of the same dermal mass confirmed the infection specifically as B. bennetti. RESULTS: Both serological and microsatellite analyses confirmed the aetiology to be B. bennetti. Our findings suggested that in cases of skin masses such as sarcoids, the suspicion of B. bennetti infection should be borne in mind even when clinical and histopathology examination results are negative in order to avoid misdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case series documents, to our knowledge, the first report of B. bennetti infection in donkeys in the UK, indicating that donkey besnoitiosis has become noteworthy in the UK. Further investigations of the occurrence, epidemiological characteristics, and clinical manifestations of B. bennetti infection in donkeys and other equids are warranted.

In the case of solvable systems, we provide solutions of the systems. Two standard systems of fuzzy relational equations – namely the systems built on the basic composition and on the Bandler-Kohout subproduct – are considered under the assumption of partiality. Such an extension requires to employ partial algebras of operations for dealing with undefined values. In this investigation, we consider seven most-known algebras of undefined values in partial fuzzy set theory such as the Bochvar, Bochvar external, Sobociński, McCarthy, Nelson, Kleene, and the Łukasiewicz algebra. Conditions that are sufficient for the solvability of the systems are provided. The crucial role will be played by the so-called boundary condition.","Cao, Nhung; Štěpnička, Martin",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274352/,93

In this paper, we explore how interval-based approaches can be used to obtain a solution to the inverse problem, in particular when measurements are inconsistent with one another. We show on a set of experiments, in which we compare the set-based approach with the Bayesian one, that this is particularly interesting when some measurements can be suspected of being outliers.","Shinde, Krushna; Feissel, Pierre; Destercke, Sébastien",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274699/,93

The aim of this study was to analyse barriers and challenges in the process of including critically ill patients in clinical studies. METHODS: Data from critically ill patients considered for inclusion in an observational study of venous thromboembolism in Norway were analysed. This included quantitative and qualitative information from the screening log, consent forms and research notes. RESULTS: Among 279 eligible critically ill patients, 204 (73%) were omitted from the study due to challenges and barriers in the inclusion process. Reasons for omission were categorised as practical in 133 (65%), medical in 31 (15%), and legal or ethical in 40 (20%) of the patients. Among 70 included patients, 29 (41%) consents were from patients and 41 (59%) from their next of kin. Several challenges were described herein; these included whether patients were competent to give consent, and which next of kin that should represent the patient. Furthermore, some included patients were unable to recall what they have consented, and some appeared unable to separate research from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers and challenges in the inclusion process led to the omission of near three out of four eligible patients. This analysis provided information about where the problem resides and may be solved. The majority of challenges among included patients were related to issues of autonomy and validity of consent.

A range of molecular components and cellular pathways, have been implicated in its pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on the TGF-β and WNT signaling pathways, and their mutual interaction, which have emerged as important factors involved in cardiac pathophysiology. The molecular and cellular processes involved in the initiation and progression of cardiac fibrosis are summarized. We focus on TGF-β and WNT signaling in cardiac fibrosis, ECM production, and myofibroblast transformation. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the main players in the regulation of multiple pathways and cellular processes. MicroRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular long non-coding RNAs can all interact with the TGF-β/WNT signaling axis to affect cardiac fibrosis. A better understanding of these processes may lead to new approaches for diagnosis and treatment of many cardiac conditions.","Yousefi, Fatemeh; Shabaninejad, Zahra; Vakili, Sina; Derakhshan, Maryam; Movahedpour, Ahmad; Dabiri, Hamed; Ghasemi, Younes; Mahjoubin-Tehran, Maryam; Nikoozadeh, Azin; Savardashtaki, Amir; Mirzaei, Hamed; Hamblin, Michael R.",Cell Commun Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281690/,93

However, the most explored variant is looking at how to choose a seed set of a given size, that maximizes the number of activated nodes for selected model of social influence. This has been studied mostly in the area of static networks, yet other kinds of networks, such as multilayer or temporal ones, are also in the scope of recent research. In this work we propose and evaluate the measure based on entropy, that investigates how the neighbourhood of nodes varies over time, and based on that and their activity ranks, the nodes as possible candidates for seeds are selected. This measure applied for temporal networks intends to favor nodes that vary their neighbourhood highly and, thanks to that, are good spreaders for certain influence models. The results demonstrate that for the Independent Cascade Model of social influence the introduced entropy-based metric outperforms typical seed selection heuristics for temporal networks. Moreover, compared to some other heuristics, it is fast to compute, thus can be used for fast-varying temporal networks.","Michalski, Radosław; Jankowski, Jarosław; Pazura, Patryk",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303715/,93

To that end, a case study of Frankfurt Airport is carried out with simulations of different disruptions during a peak-activity period similar to the 2018 Gatwick drone incident. With data on passenger traffic and airline schedules, we developed a passenger recovery algorithm to determine the amount of delays caused by the disruptions and the costs for the airport operator and the airlines. Results show that the investment in a drone-defence system is offset by the costs of a 48-h continued closure or several smaller closures, but since the largest share of costs is borne by the airlines, investments should be shared between both stakeholders.","Wendt, Philippe; Voltes-Dorta, Augusto; Suau-Sanchez, Pere",J Transp Secur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341997/,93

It has also exposed a deep crisis in modeling and exposed a lack of systems thinking by focusing mainly on only the short term and thinking of this event as only a health crisis. In this paper, authors from several of the key countries involved in COVID‐19 propose a holistic systems model that views the problem from a perspective of human society including the natural environment, human population, health system, and economic system. We model the crisis theoretically as a feedback control problem with delay, and partial controllability and observability. Using a quantitative model of the human population allows us to test different assumptions such as detection threshold, delay to take action, fraction of the population infected, effectiveness and length of confinement strategies, and impact of earlier lifting of social distancing restrictions. Each conceptual scenario is subject to 1000+ Monte‐Carlo simulations and yields both expected and surprising results. For example, we demonstrate through computational experiments that maintaining strict confinement policies for longer than 60 days may indeed be able to suppress lethality below 1% and yield the best health outcomes, but cause economic damages due to lost work that could turn out to be counterproductive in the long term. We conclude by proposing a hierarchical Computerized, Command, Control, and Communications (C4) information system and enterprise architecture for COVID‐19 with real‐time measurements and control actions taken at each level.","de Weck, Olivier; Krob, Daniel; Lefei, Li; Lui, Pao Chuen; Rauzy, Antoine; Zhang, Xinguo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7461451/,93

METHODS: Patients whose orthopaedic restorative surgeries were postponed as well as those within 3 months postoperative completed electronic questionnaires assessing physical health, emotional health, virtual care and access to resources. The EuroQoL-five-dimensional-three level (EQ-5D-3L) was included as a quantitative and standardised measure of general health status. Data were descriptively analysed using means, SD and qualitative measures. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients whose surgeries were postponed completed the survey. Notable findings included that 41.7% of patients reported an increase in their symptoms during the COVID-19-related closures, and 68.7% described a negative impact on their physical health. Furthermore, 62.6% of patients reported that the postponement of their surgery would negatively affect their ability to return to work. A substantial percentage of patients (71.3%) reported that postponement of their surgery had an overall negative impact on their physical and/or emotional health. The mean health state on the EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale (VAS) scale was 69.9 (SD=18.7). A total of 198 patients within 3 months postoperative completed the survey. A majority of patients (69.7%) indicated that COVID-19-related healthcare closures had an overall negative affect on their recovery. One-third of patients (35.4%) stated that they experienced increased symptoms as a direct result of limited postoperative follow-up. Less than half (41.4%) of patients accessed virtual physiotherapy, and only 42.9% of those that did found it to be helpful in some way. Virtual orthopaedic follow-up was deemed helpful by 61.3% of patients but many commented that it did not replace inperson visits. The mean health state reported on the EQ-5D-3L VAS scale was 76.9 (SD=15.6). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significant impact of COVID-19-related healthcare closures on preoperative and postoperative orthopaedic sport medicine patients. It revealed that restorative procedures play an important role in maintaining physical and emotional health, as well as returning individuals to work and leisure activities. It also showed that virtual care did not adequately replace the hands-on assessments of allied care and orthopaedic specialists.

39956,Featured papers in the October Issue,2020-09-28,"Direct observation of antigen–antibody binding at the nanoscale has always been a considerable challenging problem, and researchers have made tremendous efforts on it. In this study, the morphology of biotinylated antibody-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) immune complexes has been successfully imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping-mode. The AFM images indicated that the individual immune complex was composed of an IgE and a biotinylated antibody. Excitingly, it is the first time that we have actually seen the IgE binding to biotinylated antibody. Alternatively, information on the length of IgE, biotinylated antibodies and biotinylated antibody-specific IgE immune complexes were also obtained, respectively. These results indicate the versatility of AFM technology in the identification of antigen–antibody binding. This work not only lays the basis for the direct imaging of the biotinylated antibody-IgE by AFM, but also offers valuable information for studying the targeted therapy and vaccine development in the future.

The treatment of chronic HCV has been revolutionized with the introduction of oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. We aim to determine the outcomes of treatment by the combination of sofosbuvir-daclatasvir with or without ribavirin in patients with HCV-related arthritis. RESULTS: Post-therapy, all group I patients had sustained viral response. Significant improvement of the outcome parameters was found 12 weeks post-treatment in group I compared to baseline and group II. Complete and partial remission of articular symptoms in group I patients was observed in 80% and 5%, respectively, while 85% of patients in group II showed no remission. Few mild side effects were encountered with therapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of sofosbuvir-daclatasvir with or without ribavirin is an effective and safe therapy for eradication of HCV infection and amelioration of HCV-related arthritis.","Alian, Samah M.; Wahba, Mohamed Othman; Gomaa, Ahmed Fathy; Khalil, Sahar S.",Egypt Rheumatol Rehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521947/,93

40821,Healthcare wearable devices: an analysis of key factors for continuous use intention,2020-10-15,"Adolescence is a challenging time when emotional difficulties often arise. Self-esteem, good relationships with peers, and emotional competences can buffer the effects of these difficulties. The difficulties can be even greater when coupled with the presence of a chronic physical illness (CD). Our goal is to analyze psychosocial factors and CD as predictors for anxiety and depression. It was compared the results of structural equation models (SEM) with models based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to analyze the possible influence of these variables on levels of anxiety-depression in adolescents with and without CD. The sample consisted of 681 adolescents, between 12 and 16 years old (M = 13.94, SD = 1.32). 61.50% were girls and 13.40% (n = 222) presented a CD (mainly pneumo-allergic and endocrine). They were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Self-esteem Questionnaire, the Emotional Competences Questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The results obtained by SEM show that low self-esteem, problems with peers and low emotional competencies predict anxiety in 41% of the variance and depression in 72%. The results obtained by QCA show that the different combinations of these variables explain between 24 and 61% of low levels of anxiety and depression and 47–55% of high levels. Our data show how the presence of a CD, low self-esteem, problems with peers and problems in emotional skills play a fundamental role in explaining levels of anxiety and depression. These aspects will help provide increased resources for emotional adjustment in the educational context, facilitating the transitions to be made by adolescents.","Lacomba-Trejo, Laura; Valero-Moreno, Selene; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada; Pérez-Marín, Marián",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530906/,93

40920,"On the Occasion of an Anniversary, Eh: Confessions of a Canadian Math Ed Editor",2020-10-16,"Simian adenoviral and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vectors used in heterologous prime-boost strategies are potent inducers of T cells against encoded antigens and are in advanced testing as vaccine carriers for a wide range of infectious agents and cancers. It is unclear if these responses can be further enhanced or sustained with reboosting strategies. Furthermore, despite the challenges involved in MVA manufacture dose de-escalation has not been performed in humans. In this study, healthy volunteers received chimpanzee-derived adenovirus-3 and MVA vaccines encoding the non-structural region of hepatitis C virus (ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut) 8 weeks apart. Volunteers were then reboosted with a second round of ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut or MVA-NSmut vaccines 8 weeks or 1-year later. We also determined the capacity of reduced doses of MVA-NSmut to boost ChAd3-NSmut primed T cells. Reboosting was safe, with no enhanced reactogenicity. Reboosting after an 8-week interval led to minimal re-expansion of transgene-specific T cells. However, after a longer interval, T cell responses expanded efficiently and memory responses were enhanced. The 8-week interval regimen induced a higher percentage of terminally differentiated and effector memory T cells. Reboosting with MVA-NSmut alone was as effective as with ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut. A ten-fold lower dose of MVA (2 × 10(7)pfu) induced high-magnitude, sustained, broad, and functional Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific T cell responses, equivalent to standard doses (2 × 10(8) pfu). Overall, we show that following Ad/MVA prime-boost vaccination reboosting is most effective after a prolonged interval and is productive with MVA alone. Importantly, we also show that a ten-fold lower dose of MVA is as potent in humans as the standard dose.","Capone, Stefania; Brown, Anthony; Hartnell, Felicity; Sorbo, Mariarosaria Del; Traboni, Cinzia; Vassilev, Ventzislav; Colloca, Stefano; Nicosia, Alfredo; Cortese, Riccardo; Folgori, Antonella; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Swadling, Leo",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550607/,93

41103,Historical geographies of the 21st century: Challenging our praxis,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Ageing is associated with worse treatment outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This association may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy that affects treatment efficacy. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of treatment bias in patient outcomes by studying the intensity of diagnostic procedures, treatment, and overall 30-day mortality in different age groups of patients with TBI. METHODS: Included in this study was consecutively admitted patients with TBI, aged ≥ 15 years, with a cerebral CT showing intracranial signs of trauma, during the time-period between 2015–2018. Data were extracted from our prospective quality control registry for admitted TBI patients. As a measure of management intensity in different age groups, we made a composite score, where placement of intracranial pressure monitor, ventilator treatment, and evacuation of intracranial mass lesion each gave one point. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses were performed using logistic multinomial regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,571 patients with TBI fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age was 58 years (range 15–98), 70% were men, and 39% were ≥ 65 years. Head injury severity was mild in 706 patients (45%), moderate in 437 (28%), and severe in 428 (27%). Increasing age was associated with less management intensity, as measured using the composite score, irrespective of head injury severity. Multivariate analyses showed that the following parameters had a significant association with an increased risk of death within 30 days of trauma: increasing age, severe comorbidities, severe TBI, Rotterdam CT-score ≥ 3, and low management intensity. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the management intensity of hospitalised patients with TBI decreased with advanced age and that low management intensity was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality. This suggests that the high mortality among elderly TBI patients may have an element of treatment bias and could in the future be limited with a more aggressive management regime.","Skaansar, Ola; Tverdal, Cathrine; Rønning, Pål Andre; Skogen, Karoline; Brommeland, Tor; Røise, Olav; Aarhus, Mads; Andelic, Nada; Helseth, Eirik",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7568018/,93
41126,Perspectives of individual-worn sensors assessing personal environmental exposure,2020-10-22,"Immediate lockdown (March 24–May 31, 2020) of industrial activity and traffic flows has been announced by the government of India across the country after the declaration of World Health Organization that the Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is pandemic. In this study, we tried to estimate the air quality improvement during the pre-lockdown period (January 1–March 23, 2020) by comparing the lockdown period (March 24–May 31, 2020). From the results, we found the highest reduction in the concentration of NO(2) (81.98%) during the lockdown period. The average concentration of NO(2) was 51.57 µg/m(3) during pre-lockdown has changed to 9.29 µg/m(3). The average PM(2.5) concentration was 80.09 µg/m(3) during the pre-lockdown period has reduced to 20.24 µg/m(3) with 74.72% of reduction during the lockdown period. From the overall analysis of various parameters, we observed significant improvement with the range of 73.27–78.26% in PM(2.5), 69.01–82.55% in PM(10), 72.12–87.62% in NO(2), 18.61–63.19% in SO(2) and 47.16–72.11% in CO with the highest improvements in Ballygunge, Rabindra Bharati University, Ballygunge, Bidhannagar, Rabindra Sarobar and Rabindra Bharati University, respectively, with an overall average reduction in air pollutants of 53.61%. Reduction in the concentration of PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, NO(2) and SO(2) is mainly due to the closure of on-road vehicle emission, industrial activities, shut down of malls, shops etc. This reduced level of air pollutants may help in the modification of all the environmental policies for better air quality in future.","Kabiraj, Sabyasachi; Gavli, Nitin Vyankat",Aerosol Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7568842/,93

Its basic understanding as well as diagnostic and therapeutic aspects have greatly benefited from the use of monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, camelid‐derived single‐domain antibodies (sdAbs), also known as V(H)H or nanobodies, have become available during the previous 2 decades as alternative tools in this regard. Compared to classic antibodies, sdAbs are easier to produce and their small size facilitates their engineering and functionalization. It is not surprising, therefore, that sdAbs are increasingly used in hemostasis‐related research. In addition, they have the capacity to recognize unique epitopes unavailable to full monoclonal antibodies. This property can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests identifying conformational variants of hemostatic proteins. Examples include sdAbs that bind active but not globular von Willebrand factor or free factor VIIa but not tissue factor–bound factor VIIa. Finally, sdAbs have a high therapeutic potential, exemplified by caplacizumab, a homodimeric sdAb targeting von Willebrand factor that is approved for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this review, the various applications of sdAbs in thrombosis and hemostasis‐related research, diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies will be discussed.","Peyron, Ivan; Kizlik‐Masson, Claire; Dubois, Marie‐Daniéla; Atsou, Sénadé; Ferrière, Stephen; Denis, Cécile V.; Lenting, Peter J.; Casari, Caterina; Christophe, Olivier D.",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590285/,93

WSP-H torch was used to deposit two complete thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with multilayered top-coat. NiCrAlY was used as bond-coat and deposited on nickel-based superalloy substrates. Top-coat consisted of up to three sublayers: (i) yttria-stabilized zirconia (ZrO(2)-8 wt.%Y(2)O(3)-YSZ) deposited from solution, (ii) gadolinium zirconate (Gd(2)Zr(2)O(7)-GZO) deposited from suspension, and (iii) optional yttrium aluminum garnet (Y(3)Al(5)O(12)-YAG) overlayer deposited from suspension. Each of the sublayers was intended to provide different functionalities, namely improved fracture toughness, low thermal conductivity, and high erosion resistance, respectively. High-temperature performance and thermal shock resistance of the deposited coatings were tested by thermal cycling fatigue “TCF” test (maximum temperature 1100 °C, 1 h dwell per cycle) and “laser-rig” test (maximum temperature ~ 1530 °C, 5 min dwell per cycle) exposing samples to isothermal and gradient thermal conditions, respectively. In both tests, coatings endured around 800 test cycles which shows great potential for further development of these layers and their application in demanding thermal conditions. Analysis of the samples after the test showed microstructural changes and identified reason of ultimate coating failure.","Musalek, Radek; Tesar, Tomas; Medricky, Jan; Lukac, Frantisek; Lima, Rogerio S.",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608318/,93

This involves blending insights from climate science about what the future climate will look like with experiences of the social science of response through adaptation, based on practical applications in a variety of contexts. In this chapter, we reflect on these conversations and what they mean for the growing adaptation agenda. We consider who needs to be involved in conversations about adaptation, how such conversations can be structured and the need to assess their outcomes. We profile important considerations relevant for tailoring climate information to make adaptation decisions and discuss the outcomes of different types of conversations. We conclude by noting the significance of recent major climate events and the rapidly evolving risk landscape in sub-Saharan Africa, and arguing that the need for these conversations is ever more evident.

How has this leadership role evolved over time, particularly with the recent global crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic? In addition, will China’s rising role in providing badly needed global public goods reinforce its rivalry with a declining US, present the opportunity of co-leading with its BRICS counterparts, or mediate and foster co-operative solutions among all? This study seeks to address these critical questions using quantitative analysis based on G20 compliance data since its start in 2008, and especially at the recent Osaka Summit in June 2019 and the emergency virtual summit on March 26, 2020. Specifically, this study analyses China’s changing compliance levels over time and across issue areas, in comparison with its key G20 partners (or rivals): the US, India and Russia. Observing China’s compliance trends alongside those of other major G20 powers provides important insights into the characteristics, evolution and interactions of China’s leadership. This analysis finds that China’s leadership role has increased over time but that China remains largely a flexible and co-operative leader. From 2008 to 2018, China’s compliance rose while that of the US declined. Overall, China leads more with its BRICS partners than with the US. China’s leadership model has been characterized by flexibility and cooperativeness, as China has never led alone, and China’s closest compliance companions vary across different issue areas. China and other G20 members’ compliance in 2020 largely confirms these trends and the causal strength of the shock activated vulnerability of COVID-19 and members’ relevant specialized capabilities in response.","Kirton, John J.; Wang, Alissa Xinhe",Chin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953376/,93

47156,Public Engagement with Drought and Water Scarcity Research,2020-12-30,"Computer-aided detection, localisation, and segmentation methods can help improve colonoscopy procedures. Even though many methods have been built to tackle automatic detection and segmentation of polyps, benchmarking of state-of-the-art methods still remains an open problem. This is due to the increasing number of researched computer vision methods that can be applied to polyp datasets. Benchmarking of novel methods can provide a direction to the development of automated polyp detection and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, it ensures that the produced results in the community are reproducible and provide a fair comparison of developed methods. In this paper, we benchmark several recent state-of-the-art methods using Kvasir-SEG, an open-access dataset of colonoscopy images for polyp detection, localisation, and segmentation evaluating both method accuracy and speed. Whilst, most methods in literature have competitive performance over accuracy, we show that the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a better trade-off between an average precision of 0.8000 and mean IoU of 0.8100, and the fastest speed of 180 frames per second for the detection and localisation task. Likewise, the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a competitive dice coefficient of 0.8206 and the best average speed of 182.38 frames per second for the segmentation task. Our comprehensive comparison with various state-of-the-art methods reveals the importance of benchmarking the deep learning methods for automated real-time polyp identification and delineations that can potentially transform current clinical practices and minimise miss-detection rates.",,IEEE Access,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968127/,93

For this purpose, the bandwidth was tested on a highly complex urban scenario, where a number of mobile nodes were used with random conditions both in mobility and in resources of transmission. The results of the tests show that the stability of the bandwidth available in each region is proportional to the number of real mobile nodes in the region. However, a considerable bandwidth is also reached with a smaller number of mobile nodes, but there is no stability in the region, thus causing the network to collapse. The VANET network simulation tool was NS-3, since it is currently one of the most commonly used free software that allows configure the simulation parameters in a vehicular environment. The urban simulation scenario is the historic center of the City of Bogotá, Colombia, which was created with SUMO for obtaining the mobility traces.","Viloria, Amelec; Lezama, Omar Bonerge Pineda; Varela, Noel; Martínez, Jorge Luis Diaz","Computing Science, Communication and Security",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971760/,93

Rather than sliding a finger across a touch screen on a smart phone, it will be possible to make things happen by moving our eyes or by brainwaves. Talking with someone or playing an online game will involve seeing that person in the same room and being able to touch and feel him/her via tactile technology.

The main goal of the E2R Methodology is to present clear and easily understood documents. This methodology includes a set of guidelines and recommendations that affect the writing of texts, the supporting images, the design and layout of documents, and the final editing format. Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. The process of adapting existing documents is cyclic and implies three activities: analysis, transformation, and validation. All these activities are human resource consuming, due to the need of involving people with cognitive disabilities as well as E2R experts. In order to alleviate such processes, we are currently investigating the development of methods, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, to perform the analysis and transformation of documents in a (semi)-automatic fashion. In this paper we present our AI-based method for assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines as well as an initial implementation of such a method; our research on the transformation of documents is out of the scope of this paper.

To overcome such limitation, this research proposes a workflow able to analyze shadowed zones, by processing Pléiades and World-View 2 images. The case study is the archaeological site of Maltai, in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, which presents shadowed areas to be detected. Applying de-shadowing workflow has been tested over multispectral and panchromatic images, with different invariant color spaces. The proposed methods exploit the techniques of automatic thresholding and spectral ratio in the detection of shadow regions. This approach shows a clustering of shadow pixels for an enhanced images visualization and proves its suitability for archaeological settings.","Chiappini, Stefano; Di Stefano, Francesco; Malinverni, Eva Savina; Pierdicca, Roberto",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974348/,93

While we have survived numerous crises over centuries, this event called into question a desire for answers like never before. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged professionals from all disciplines to act. While epidemiologists researched and physicians treated, the philosophers and existentialists began to ponder mortality and search for answers. There were those who pontificated about politics and oppression. All the while hospital beds were filled to capacity, and cities around the world stood still; social workers were among a group of essential workers who also had to grapple with many challenges; some even called into question our profession’s code of ethics. For many social workers, it was the first time having to confront issues related to social justice and their personal values and consider ethical issues from providing services through digital technology and a test of their competence during this tumultuous time. As social workers, this is part of our calling, our mission to serve, and our responsibility to be where our clients are at, both emotionally and physically. Yet, what about the risks? What about the fears? Could we still instill a sense of hope in the face of despair?

Development of computer algorithms for calculating the geomorphometric properties of the Earth’s surface has allowed for expanding of some methods in the semi-automatic recognition and classification of landscape features. In such a way, several papers have been produced, documenting the applicability of the landform classification based on map algebra. The Topographic Position Index (TPI) is one of the most widely used parameters for semi-automated landform classification using GIS software. The aim was to apply the TPI classes for landform classification in the Basilicata Region (Southern Italy). The Basilicata Region is characterized by an extremely heterogeneous landscape and geological features. The automated landform extraction, starting from two different resolution DEMs at 20 and 5 m-grids, has been carried out by using three different GIS software: Arcview, Arcmap, and SAGA. Comparison of the landform maps resulting from each software at a different scale has been realized, furnishing at the end the best landform map and consequently a discussion over which is the best software implementation of the TPI method.","Giano, Salvatore Ivo; Danese, Maria; Gioia, Dario; Pescatore, Eva; Siervo, Vincenzo; Bentivenga, Mario",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978517/,93

The digital revolution is not only making fundamental changes to how we live, but it is also having a profound impact on how we conduct business. The global market is adapting to new trends and faster turnaround times, and all sectors, including the energy and extractives sector (oil and gas, and mining sectors), will be forced to adapt to the transition. This change aligns with the clean energy developments and the global move to transition to a low-carbon economy which is characterized by technological advancements. The world is gradually discovering new things to do with technology, as its potential is beginning to be embraced. The present COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has altered the way we use technology, with many people spending more time online, thus creating the impetus to fast track the implementation of the 4IR. These changes will affect gender inclusivity and the future of work. Apart from the above issues, this chapter examines: why it is essential to include women in the workforce and along the different value chains, the need for automation in the extractives sector and how it will affect how we work. Lastly, the proposed solutions to address the challenges of gender disparity and promote inclusivity in the energy and extractives sector will be explored from the perspectives of the different role players in this sector, i.e. the public sector/governments; the private sector, including business entities; and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO’s).","Lugonzo, Alaka; Chege, Kennedy",Energy Transitions and the Future of the African Energy Sector,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978832/,93

For many years, cytotoxic compounds have been the front line of cancer chemotherapy, but their action of destroying rapidly dividing cancer and healthy cells in the gut, bone marrow, and hair follicles causes undesirable side effects like mucositis, stomatitis, myelosuppression, and alopecia. Hypersensitivities commonly occur. Drugs with high potential to provoke hypersensitivity are platinum compounds, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins, L-asparaginase, and procarbazine. Those with low potential include the anthracyclines. Drugs only occasionally implicated include cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. Immediate type I allergic reactions are few with L-asparaginase, the platinum salts, and methotrexate most often implicated. Type II hypersensitivities are thrombocytopenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and drug-induced anemia. Small-vessel vasculitis is the most frequently seen form of a type III reaction. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a combined type III and type IV hypersensitivity. Drug-induced liver injury may occur, and drug-induced lung disease may be due to drug-specific antibodies or drug-specific T cells. Drug-induced cutaneous reactions include maculopapular exanthemas, allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, AGEP, DRESS, fixed drug eruptions, erythema multiforme, SJS, and TEN. A variety of other cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions associated with chemotherapy include stomatitis and mucositis, acral erythema, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, eccrine squamous syringometaplasia, extravasation reactions, and radiation-associated reactions. For the prevention of allergic reactions, three strategies are generally employed: premedication, skin testing, and desensitization. Up to 30% of patients have been found to develop acute infusion reactions to the taxanes; rapid desensitization protocols have been developed for both drugs. Three platinum drugs, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are often used in chemotherapy. Reactions to platinum agents are mainly type I or type IV hypersensitivities; IgE antibodies reactive with carboplatin and oxaliplatin have been detected. Skin testing with the three platinum drugs is now finding widespread acceptance and application as a routine diagnostic procedure. A number of different desensitization protocols for the platinum drugs are currently employed.","Baldo, Brian A.; Pham, Nghia H.",Drug Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979052/,93

The diagnosis of lung infection is generally based on clinical findings associated with the detection of parenchymal infiltrate at chest X-ray or CT scan. However, in some instances, radiological imaging alone cannot distinguish an acute exacerbation from sequela of a prior infection. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques have been extensively used in patients with lung infection, mostly for TB-associated or HIV-associated infections. Single-photon emitting agents used for identifying lung infection include (67)Ga-citrate, (111)In-oxine-leukocytes, (99m)Tc-HMPAO-leukocytes, preferably employing SPECT/CT imaging. More recently, the use of [(18)F]FDG for PET imaging (currently PET/CT) has been steadily growing and is now the preferred radionuclide imaging modality not only for identifying sites of lung infection but also for assessing the efficacy of therapy, especially in TB infection and in HIV-associated infections.

By 2050 it is estimated that 9.6 billion humans will cover the earth (Gerland et al. 2014). In almost all countries where NHPs naturally occur, humans have converted forest habitats into an agriculture-dominated landscape to serve the demand for meat, palm oil or fruits (Estrada et al. 2017). This dramatic shift in landscape ecology has resulted in an ever-growing human–domestic livestock–NHP interface. Estrades et al. (2017) estimated that approximately 60% of all known NHP taxonomic families are threatened with extinction and a further 75% of all NHP species-populations are decreasing. The speed and the extent of these anthropocentric ecological changes are the main drivers for emerging infectious diseases of wildlife (Daszak et al. 2000) and spillovers from wildlife to humans (Karesh et al. 2012).","Knauf, Sascha; Jones-Engel, Lisa",Neglected Diseases in Monkeys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979160/,93

We compare the approach against state-of-the-art techniques, over polynomial and non-polynomial dynamical models: the outcomes show that we can synthesise sound BCs up to two orders of magnitude faster, with in particular a stark speedup on the verification engine (up to three orders less), whilst needing a far smaller data set (up to three orders less) for the learning part. Beyond improvements over the state of the art, we further challenge the new approach on a hybrid dynamical model and on larger-dimensional models, and showcase the numerical robustness of our algorithms and codebase.","Peruffo, Andrea; Ahmed, Daniele; Abate, Alessandro",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979189/,93

49343,#decolonization2point0: Follow the Star,2020-11-26,"Viruses attach and adhere surface receptors to target host cells, and the receptors determine viral tropism of hosts and tissues. Cell surface glycans are used as the virus receptors. The enveloping viruses generally recognize surface receptors of hosts as the initial step in the viral infection cycle to host and further define the viral host range determinant. From the linkage diversity and carbohydrate structure motifs, which are apparently distinct from proteins, most pathogens or viral agents use glycans as infection receptors. The molecular structure of the virus receptors is topical in the field of virus research, but no concrete consensus logics have emerged yet. The viral interaction with the host cell surface is rather the complexed phenomenon with a multiple stage. Such multiple processes possess multiple recognitions and interactions with multiple cell surface molecules as well as accompanying conformational shifts in the virus-produced proteins. In the enveloping viruses, the adhesion-strengthening attachment strategy is affordable for virus-host receptor recognition and interactions to give higher affinities between the receptor and ligand interaction. In that meaning, gangliosides may function in virus-host cell interaction as primary receptors or co-receptors. The co-receptor concept has well been exampled in HIV infection.","Kim, Cheorl-Ho",Glycosphingolipids Signaling,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979554/,93

49557,Cognitive Enhancement and Moral Bioenhancement: Becoming Smarter and More Moral,2020-11-12,"Cybersecurity is essential for the protection of companies against cyber threats. Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company’s capabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB’s hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users’ willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB’s motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB’s business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption.","Shojaifar, Alireza; Fricker, Samuel A.; Gwerder, Martin",Information Security Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980891/,93
49598,The Hard Budget Constraint as the Pillar of the Economy,2020-08-07,"Financial institutions remain one of the key industries making use of information and communication technologies to transform their products and services and their business in general. As the Internet becomes pervasive, most banks, in addition to their traditional mobile banking, have introduced mobile banking apps, which ride on smart devices and the Internet to offer banking services remotely to customers. However, given some contextual factors such as unstable Internet, adoption of this innovation may be a challenge in an emerging economy. Thus, the study sought to find out the factors, which could affect the adoption of mobile banking app in a less digitalized environment. To this end, data was sourced via the intercept approach on a sample of the entire population in Ghana for the analysis. By using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique, the study found that performance expectancy and hedonic motivation were the key factors that influence mobile banking app adoption. Contrary to our expectation, effort expectancy, perceived transaction cost, and privacy and information concerns were found to have no effect on consumers’ intention to adopt mobile banking app. Implications for further research and practice are presented and discussed.","Ntsiful, Alex; Kwarteng, Michael Adu; Jibril, Abdul Bashiru; Popesko, Boris; Pilik, Michal",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980932/,93

They are encouraging marketplace stakeholders to engage in sustainable production and consumption behaviours by urging them to reduce , reuse, restore, refurbish, remanufacture, and recycle resources in all stages of their value chain. Therefore, this chapter presents a cost-benefit analysis of the circular economy strategy. Afterwards it features a critical review of some of the latest European regulatory guidelines, instruments and principles appertaining to the CE agenda. It sheds light on EU ’s (2020) new circular economy plan for a cleaner and more competitive Europe. Therefore, this research examines the EU ’s key propositions on the value chains of different products. The findings suggest that the circular economy’s sustainable development model and its regenerative systems are increasingly minimising industrial waste, emissions, and energy leakages through the creation of long-lasting designs that can improve resource efficiencies. This contribution implies that successful CE practices are sustainable in the long run as they will ultimately add value to the business as well as to our natural environment .

However, there is a silver lining in the midst of such challenges in that it invigorated intensive and unlimited academic cooperation at grass-roots level between the world’s two most ancient civilizations, India and China. It was a year of 1st Indo-China Research Webinar Series featuring over 5000 participants, 16 technical sessions and 10 Special Guests. Under normal circumstances, this clearly would not be possible. After all, generally, it would have required at least a year of detailed planning coupled with significant funding. The success of the series stood on the foundation of the past several years of scientific collaborations. This chapter describes this scientific cooperation in terms of youth exchange (2-way) between outstanding universities from both countries. In addition, the impact of such cooperation in terms of Joint International Research Awards has also been presented. Still, what is presented here is still only the tip of iceberg of the impact of scientific cooperation between the youth of both countries in past few years. Undoubtedly, a great deal still needs to be done to further deepen relations in people to people exchange at the scientific level between both countries, especially in seeking solutions to scientific issues of mutual interest, especially in the global existential challenges of climate change and the economic future of sustainable infrastructure development for humanity.","Feng, Da Hsuan; Garg, Ankit",Proceedings of the 1st Indo-China Research Series in Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981132/,93

In order to ensure safe and efficient flight operations, air navigation service providers need to ensure that enough capacity is available for airspace users. For this purpose, reliable traffic forecasts are necessary to avoid capacity shortages or excesses and subsequently costs. However, the provision of air navigation services is hampered by several effects, i.e., unpredictable traffic patterns and trends. Despite awareness of such problem, there is not a common definition or metric yet to measure the so-called ‘volatility.’ The aim of this paper is twofold: to set out an approach addressing volatility measures for different spatial and periodical scopes, and to show the effects of demand fluctuations on the ATM system from a holistic point of view.","Standfuss, T.; Whittome, M.; Ruiz-Gauna, I.",Air Traffic Management and Systems IV,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7985955/,93

Columbia University Press, New York, 1986) re-articulation of Jürgen Habermas’s notion of critique to ascertain how the practice of academic activism ought to be amended. According to Benhabib (Critique, norm and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory. Columbia University Press, New York, 1986: 279), Habermas’s theory of communicative action is a justifiable form of critique as it re-establishes the relation between self -reflection and autonomy and it explains autonomy in communicative terms, that is, autonomy is not synonymous with self-legislation or self-actualisation or mimesis, but rather ‘the cognitive competence to adopt to a universalist standpoint and the interactive competence to act on such a basis’ (Benhabib, Critique, norm and utopia: a study of the foundations of critical theory. Columbia University Press, New York, 1986: 282).

Diabetes is a major risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in people infected in the recent pandemic of COVID-19, especially in presence of diabetes complications. People with diabetes in developing countries have higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases due to the higher prevalence of smoking, uncontrolled hypertension and uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Healthcare systems in developing countries that do not include routine screening for diabetic retinopathy face the burden of proliferative retinopathy and blindness, taking a huge toll on the limited resources. The prevalence of end stage renal disease requiring dialysis is ten times higher in diabetes compared to non-diabetes population. Diabetic foot ulcers and amputations are more common in low- and middle-income countries. Direct and indirect costs related to diabetes and its complications exert enormous burden on the budgets, threatening to bankrupt the healthcare systems and countries. Frequent screening for diabetes complications results in early diagnosis and treatment, and is a cost-effective approach compared to treatment of advanced complications, particularly under conditions with limited resources.","Smokovski, Ivica",Managing Diabetes in Low Income Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991155/,93

After Nightingale died, her commemoration expanded into the emerging media forms of the early twentieth century. The first film of Nightingale’s life appeared in 1915, and many plays, other films, and television programmes followed. Full-size statues, busts, and memorial plaques appeared in, on, or near buildings and places connected with her life and work. Nightingale’s image has featured on coins, banknotes, plates, cups, T-shirts, bath toys, and, from 2020, a barbie doll.

In parallel, a programme of research has focused on communicating with and managing large numbers of contaminated casualties at the scene of an incident. We present an accessible overview of the evidence underpinning current casualty decontamination strategies. We highlight where research outcomes can directly inform response planning, including the critical importance of beginning the decontamination process as soon as possible, the benefits of early removal of contaminated clothing, the evidence under-pinning dry and wet decontamination and how effective communication is essential to any decontamination response. We identify a range of priority areas for future research including establishing the significance of the ‘wash-in’ effect and developing effective strategies for the decontamination of hair.

As Hubei province was mostly affected, we employ a difference-in-differences approach with the propensity score matching (PSM-DID) and compare Hubei SMEs’ credit responses before and after the outbreak relative to those of non-Hubei SMEs. Our results suggest that Hubei SMEs’ credit demand reduced significantly compared to that of non-Hubei SMEs, and the adverse effects were more pronounced for the non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and the SMEs without prior bank relationships. Moreover, we show a negative impact on non-Hubei SMEs having supply chain relationships with Hubei province. Such effects rippled through the supply chain and exerted an intensified strike on the SMEs with Hubei customers.

We developed a single-plasmid cDNA-launch infectious clone of SHFV (rSHFV) and modified the clone to rescue an enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing rSHFV-eGFP that can be used for rapid and quantitative detection of infection. SHFV has a narrow cell tropism in vitro, with only the grivet MA-104 cell line and a few other grivet cell lines being susceptible to virion entry and permissive to infection. Using rSHFV-eGFP, we demonstrate that one cricetid rodent cell line and three ape cell lines also fully support SHFV replication, whereas 55 human cell lines, 11 bat cell lines, and three rodent cells do not. Interestingly, some human and other mammalian cell lines apparently resistant to SHFV infection are permissive after transfection with the rSHFV-eGFP cDNA-launch plasmid. To further demonstrate the investigative potential of the infectious clone system, we introduced stop codons into eight viral open reading frames (ORFs). This approach suggested that at least one ORF, ORF 2b’, is dispensable for SHFV in vitro replication.

52528,Initial-boundary Value Problem for a Time-fractional Subdiffusion Equation with an Arbitrary Elliptic Differential Operator,2021-05-06,"A Rare Cause of Diabetes: COVID-19 Introduction: Environmental factors like viruses have been described in the mechanism of pancreatic beta cell destruction. Various viruses can trigger autoimmunity in individuals genetically predisposed to diabetes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has been shown to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) which is expressed throughout the body, including pancreatic cells, leading to direct injury of the endocrine pancreas. We report a case of coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing a new onset of diabetes mellitus presentation with hyperglycemia, polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss. Case Presentation: A 53 year-old, previously healthy, male presented with five days of fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea and diarrhea. On admission he was hypoxic, with a body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) and no evidence of insulin resistance on physical exam. He was diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 and admitted for high requirements of oxygen without the need of the intensive care unit. He was treated with tocilizumab, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, full dose anticoagulation and azithromycin. Dexamethasone 4 mg every 8 hours was given for three days. During this admission, his fasting glucose was 75–108 mg/dL. Once started on steroids his fasting and prandial glucose was 85–96 mg/dL and 140 mg/dL on one occasion. He was eventually discharged with 2 liters of nasal cannula which he required for one week. One and a half months after, he presented to the emergency department due to a 6 kg weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, malaise and fatigue. On arrival his glucose was 549 mg/dL, without anion gap or ketones. He had no evidence of new infection and SARS CoV-2 test was negative. He was started on insulin glargine at night and insulin Humalog before each meal with corrections. Hemoglobin A1c was 13.4% with a C-peptide 0.36 ng/mL and glucose of 195 mg/dL at the time of C-peptide test. His antibodies, anti-islet cell antibody, zinc transporter 8 and glutamic acid decarboxylase-65, were negative. He was discharged with basal/bolus regimen and followed up outpatient with Endocrinology. During follow-up, his c-peptide normalized and he was tapered off insulin. Discussion: In 2003, atypical pneumonia caused by SARS CoV-2 was reported to be associated with hyperglycemia in patients without prior history of diabetes. At 3 year follow-up, the patients no longer had diabetes. Moreover, patients with mild SARS CoV-2 during the first day of hospitalization had a higher fasting plasma glucose than patients admitted for other causes of pneumonia. It is known that SARS CoV-2 binds to ACE 2 which downregulates the receptor, leading to impairment of insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. SARS CoV-2 also produces a direct injury in beta pancreatic cells. It is imperative to monitor patients post COVID-19 to evaluate for new onset diabetes and likely resolution.","Rida, Rima; Rios, Paola; Manzano, Alex",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089837/,93

The novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor to infect human cells, allowing it to target organ systems with such receptors including the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and endocrine system. The purpose of this case report is to describe the long-term implications COVID-19 may cause in the endocrine system. A 46-year-old woman was referred to our clinic due to abrupt uncontrolled blood glucose levels ranging from 200-550mg/dL after being infected with COVID-19 for approximately 10 weeks. She has a past medical history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 which was diagnosed 3 years ago and was well controlled with diet. Present history reveals polyuria, polydipsia, tiredness and a decreased appetite. Laboratory values show HbA1C 12, negative islet cell antibodies/GAD antibodies, low C-peptide, high TSH, normal FT4 and positive anti-TPO antibodies/thyroglobulin antibodies.

The case study focuses on describing what is needed with regards to the risk factor eligibility test (RFET) as well as for implementing a data pool to lower capital charges. By establishing a consortium of banks per region to implement a data pooling solution, participants can prove a wider breadth of modellable risk factors per asset class and use the Internal Models Approach (IMA) of valuing risk to lower capital charge requirements significantly. CASE DESCRIPTION: First, a description on the historical context surrounding the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book rules and the business requirements needed to comply with the risk factor eligibility test is made. Then an examination is conducted on the innovative data pooling initiative implemented by CanDeal, TickSmith Corp., and the 6 largest Canadian banks to lower capital charge requirements under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: A description is made on what types of data, expertise, and technology is needed to calculate for risk factor modellability. It is up to each firm to decide if the benefits to using the Internal Models Approach to lower capital charges outweighs implementation and running costs of the underlying data platform. Implementing a data pool for each region comes with challenges that include anti-competition law that may block the initiative, varied benefits to each competitive participant, and data security concerns. CONCLUSION: It is evident that the data pool innovation provides benefits to lowering capital charges as the Canadian banks have seen an increase of modellability by several factors using the sample bond asset class. While each firm must still determine internally if the benefits outweighs the technological costs they will incur, it is clear that regulators are pushing for increased data retention and scrutiny.","Huang, Jimmy Yicheng",Financ Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116640/,93

53025,Editor's Note,2021-05-19,"The number of family members caring and caregiving for a loved one undergoing physical and mental changes continues to increase dramatically. For many, this ongoing experience not only involves the “burden of caregiving” but also the “burden of grief” as their loved-one’s newfound medical condition can result in the loss of the person they previously knew. Dramatic cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes, often leave caregivers bereft of the significant relationship they shared with the affected person prior to the illness or injury. This results in what we term conditions of acquired “non-death interpersonal loss” (NoDIL). Current approaches to these losses use an amalgam of models drawn from both death and non-death loss. Despite their utility, these frameworks have not adequately addressed the unique processes occurring in the interpersonal sphere where the grieving caregiver needs to reach some modus vivendi regarding the triad of “who the person was,” “who they are now,” and “who they will yet become.” In this paper we propose a process-based model which addresses cognitive-emotional-behavioral challenges caregivers meet in the face of their new reality. These require a revision of the interpersonal schemas and the relationships that takes into account the ongoing interactions with the affected family member. The model and its utility to identify adaptive and maladaptive responses to NoDIL is elaborated upon with clinical material obtained from caregivers of people diagnosed with major neuro-cognitive disorder and pediatric traumatic brain injury. The article concludes with implications for theory, research and clinical intervention.","Yehene, Einat; Manevich, Alexander; Rubin, Simon Shimshon",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8119762/,93

It has been posited that the identification of care workers with immunity or increased resistance could be important in developing future strategies. METHOD: This was a retrospectively conducted survey of general surgical staff at a tertiary surgical unit. RESULTS: We surveyed 215 staff that had undergone antibody testing. Of the 175/215 who reported contact with COVID-19 positive patients, 6/215 had a positive PCR result and 15/215 reported a positive antibody test. Only 3/6 that had a positive PCR test demonstrated antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our “immunity” rate of 7% is extremely low and is concerning especially in respect of the anticipated “herd immunity” which would mitigate many of the issues presently being confronted and it is likely to be many months at least before this makes realistic contribution. Continued testing for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies will contribute to crucial seroprevalence data that can be used by public health bodies whose advice will necessarily evolve as increasing data sets become available.","Isheerwood, J; Winyard, J; Bekhyat Karki, B; Chung, W Y; Layton, G; Issa, E; Garcea, G; Dennison, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135893/,93

METHOD: This international multi-centre cohort study included patients undergoing elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until 19 April 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19 free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theatre, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with COVID-19 patients). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Of 9171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2481 were operated in COVID-19 free surgical pathways. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.2% versus 4.9%, OR: 0.62 [0.44-0.86]). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses and a propensity-score matched model. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.1% versus 3.6%; OR 0.53 [0.36-0.76]). CONCLUSIONS: Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19 free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.",,Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135936/,93

We identified the need to seek feedback from patients relating to their perceptions on care received at a virtual clinic compared to a face-to-face clinics. METHOD: Patients who attended a virtual clinic in General Surgery were selected at random from a database of 627 patients. They were called and asked to complete a google survey which was sent via email. A shorter survey was also conducted over the phone for patients who did not have an email address. RESULTS: 79.6% (n = 43) of patients felt their care did not suffer because of non-face-to-face contact. 63% (n = 34) reported that their symptoms were fully assessed during the virtual clinic. 77.8% (n = 42) did not feel rushed by the virtual clinic, 92.6% (n = 50) answered that they had the opportunity to ask questions. 68.5% (n = 35) answered their care did not suffer by not being examined. 72.2% (n = 39) felt that the outcome of the clinic was not changed because of non face-to-face contact. CONCLUSIONS: Patient feedback on the care received in the virtual clinic was positive. This may suggest that virtual clinics could be utilised in outpatients care with good reception from patients.","Fanning, S; Palmer, H; Sturrock, B; Hussain, A; Carney, C; Jaunoo, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135990/,93

While the emergence of a new grammar and its complexity for experienced teachers is acknowledged, the ramifications for initial teacher education (ITE) are under-researched. With practicum at the heart of ITE it is vital that teacher educators become conversant with the grammar of an ILE practicum so they can support student teachers to thrive in these environments. Utilising Gislason’s (Gislason, Learning Environments Research 13:127–145, 2010; Gislason, Alternator and Deed (eds), School space and its occupation: Conceptualising and evaluating innovative learning environments, Brill Sense, The Netherlands, 2018; Gislason, Learning Environments Research 13:127–145, 2010) school environment model and an instrumental case study design we identified key influences for three key participant groups within the ecology of practicum—student teachers, associate teachers and teacher educators. Our findings suggest the conventional grammar of practicum is incongruous with a collaborative grammar that underpins an ILE practicum. Such a grammar amplifies the importance of relational, leadership, and collaborative skills for student teachers as well as highlighting a necessity to re-imagine practicum traditions such as full management.","Nelson, Emily; Davies, Lynn; Johnson, Leigh; Jones, Kirsty; O’Connor, Nikki",NZ J Educ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8152186/,93
53742,"Establishing the Medication Therapy Services Clinic: Goals, challenges and future directions",2021-04-13,"Although the effect of hearing loss on years lived with disability (YLD) is quite substantial, occupational hearing loss among migrant workers is significantly under-studied. In Kuwait, where nearly two-thirds of the population are migrant workers, the burden of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) is unknown. The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of ONIHL among migrant workers in Kuwait and explore workplace and individual risk factors that are associated with ONIHL. We obtained data of annual physical exams for the year 2018 conducted by the Shuaiba Industrial Medical Center (SIMC) for all industrial workers in the area. We applied univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the effects of individual and occupational characteristics on ONIHL. A total of 3474 industrial workers visited the SIMC for an annual exam. The vast majority were men (99%) and non-Kuwaitis (98%) with a median age of 38 years. A total of 710 workers were diagnosed with ONIHL with a prevalence of 20.4%. Age, years of experience, and self-reported exposure to noise were associated with statistically significant higher odds of ONIHL. When adjusted for age, years of experience, and other individual level factors, type of industry was not a statistically significant predictor of ONIHL. The study uncovers the significant burden of hearing loss among the migrant worker subpopulation in Kuwait, an area of occupational health that is often underestimated or unrecognized. Although laws and regulations are in place to prevent and control noise in the workplace, the onus is on local authorities to ensure the necessary training and controls aimed to reduce noise exposure.","Buqammaz, Mariam; Gasana, Janvier; Alahmad, Barrak; Shebl, Mohammed; Albloushi, Dalia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156043/,93

55197,Pandemics and firms: Drawing lessons from history,2021-05-19,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging research and clinical evidence suggest that severe COVID‐19 is a microvascular disease, where SARS‐CoV‐2 infection triggers a rapid inflammatory vascular response that leads to endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Underlying medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have been associated with increased risk for severe illness. SARS‐CoV‐2 enters cells by surface spike protein binding to host cell receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Isolated S protein of SARS‐CoV‐1 has been shown to induce an innate immune response. Here we investigate the cytokine response of monocytes with and without comorbidities (obesity and hypertension) exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, and the effects of this response on endothelial barrier function. METHODS: Human CD14+ monocytes (Lonza, Precision for Medicine) from two Caucasian males in their 50s, one with obesity and hypertension (HTN) and one without, were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL [positive control]), recombinant spike receptor‐binding domain (RBD, 10 ug/mL) or serum‐free media (negative control) for 48 hours. Monocyte conditioned media (MCM) was collected and cytokines (IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, IL‐12p70, IL‐1beta, IFN‐gamma, TNF‐alpha, IL‐4) were analyzed by multiplex ELISA. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) from a healthy donor were exposed to MCM from healthy or HTN subjects. Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell‐substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Briefly, HLMVECs were seeded on ECIS chambers to proliferate until impedance plateaued. Half of the media was then replaced with MCM. Differences in impedance drops were compared among various conditions. Western blotting was used to investigate Spike RBD internalization. RESULTS: Spike RBD and resulted in increased IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐12p70, and TNF‐alpha compared to negative control (Fig1A). Monocytes from HTN subject showed increased secretion of IL‐6, IL‐8 and IL‐12p70 compared to those from the healthy subject (Fig 1B). HLMVECs showed moderate long‐term barrier disruption, when treated with Spike RBD alone and Spike RBD with MCM from healthy subjects and no difference in transient barrier disruption or recovery. HLMVECs exposed to MCM from HTN subjects showed increased long‐term barrier dysfunction, especially with Spike RBD present, and recovery of barrier function was also hampered (Fig 2). Spike RBD was observed to be internalized by both monocytes and HLMVECs. DISCUSSION: Spike RBD alone induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by CD14+ monocytes and is further increased in monocytes from the obese/HTN subject. Exposure to Spike RBD and MCM from both healthy and HTN subjects caused significant long‐term endothelial barrier dysfunction in HLMVECs with increased dysfunction seen for the obese/HTN MCM. These results are consistent with clinical experience with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased disease severity, and worse outcome in COVID‐19 patients with comorbidities. Further work is being done to characterize the cytokine profile and mechanisms of barrier dysfunction.","Wang, Huilei; Dante, Siddhartha; Nandakumar, Kavitha; Khoury, Elizabeth; Tucker, Elizabeth; Steppan, Jochen; Kannan, Sujatha; Santhanam, Lakshmi",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239560/,93
55295,Is Canada warming up to “vaccine passports”?,2021-06-14,"PURPOSE: The COVID‐19 pandemic altered global humanity via economic and political challenges. It evoked a vigorous response in clinical medicine, as it required rapid development and delivery of COVID‐19 vaccines in less than a year (Le et al., 2020). Similarly, medical education also adapted with the same rate and intensity as its clinical counterparts. Infection control and mitigation measures evolved to limit viral spread. The CDC issued stay‐at‐home orders and directives to close non‐essential places. This included medical schools, which are considered high population density (CDC, 2021). Consequently, traditional in‐person didactics were compromised; educational delivery went to socially‐distanced online modes. Remote online‐learning of medical education includes video conferences for lectures, assessments of diagnostic and clinical skills via online modes, and virtual‐simulation use to aid problem‐based learning. Adaptive online‐learning for medical education boosts strong cooperation from faculty and students to meld curriculum to retain competency and accreditation requirements for students to graduate and become physicians. This study examines online lecture effectiveness during COVID‐19, specifically pathology, as medical students shift to optimize learning for board exam preparation and transition to clinical settings. METHODS: In this preliminary study, second year medical students at a US osteopathic medical school were anonymously surveyed in 2020‐2021 academic year. Target demographic was medical students required to use online learning due to COVID‐19; students had live, in‐person instruction in previous academic year, 2019‐2020, until the shift to online learning started March 2020. Data from survey included quantitative data on effectiveness of online learning versus in‐person lecture for medical students, impact of online learning on students’ foundational pathology preparation for board exams, and students' abilities to apply pathology knowledge with diagnostic reasoning in a clinical setting. Preliminary results show online learning of pathology in preparation for board exams elicited moderate confidence from 58% of second‐year medical students; a majority of students to report online learning as quite effective. Ninety‐two percent of students used external pathology resources (review books, video series, etc.) with online learning. However, more than half of students report low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting. DISCUSSION: Overall, medical students showed moderate confidence in pathology board exam preparation via online learning. A study conducted by Mukhtar et al. (2020) supported online learning in medical schools due to increased student‐centered learning. Students using external board review resources found online learning provides efficient pathology curriculum management with time for board exam review during the pandemic. Most students reported low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting because online learning constraints include lack of integration of clinical pathology and clinical competency skills. Future studies will assess effectiveness of online learning with improved methods to implement pathology curriculum in clinical settings.","Tran, Elena; Torelli, Vincent; Lomiguen, Christine",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239886/,93

In this review study, we collected all reported AMPs with antidiabetic activity. We also analyze the sequence and structure of these peptides for evaluation of sequence and structure effect on their antidiabetic activity. Based on this review, the biggest peptide family with antidiabetic activity is temporins with nine antidiabetic peptides. Frogs are the most abundant source of antidiabetic peptides. Bioinformatics analysis showed that an increase of positive net charge and a decrease of hydrophobicity can improve the insulinotropic effect of peptides. Peptides with higher positive net charge and Boman index showed higher activity. Based on this review article, AMPs with antidiabetic activity, especially those isolated from amphibians, can be used as novel antidiabetic drug for type 2 diabetes disease.

We aimed to evaluate whether intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion impacted inflammatory response in patients undergoing CRS with HIPEC. Fifty-six patients scheduled for CRS with HIPEC were randomly assigned to the control (n = 28) and dexmedetomidine (n = 28) groups. The primary endpoint was the effect of dexmedetomidine on the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level measured at pre-operation (Pre-OP), before HIPEC initiation (Pre-HIPEC), immediately after HIPEC; after the end of the operation; and on postoperative day (POD) 1. In both groups, the IL-6 levels from Pre-HIPEC until POD 1 and the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on PODs 1, 2, and 3 were significantly higher than the Pre-OP values (all Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.001). However, total differences in IL-6 and CRP levels, based on the mean area under the curve, were not detected between the two groups. The continuous intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.4 μg/kg/h) in patients undergoing CRS with HIPEC did not significantly lower the inflammatory indices.

56416,Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on transfers of personal data by Union institutions and bodies to third states and international organisations,2021-08-04,"Filamentous fungi such as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, the main causative agents of onychomycosis, have been recognized as biofilm-forming microorganisms. Nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticles (NO-np) are currently in development for the management of superficial and deep bacterial and fungal infections, with documented activity against biofilms. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the in vitro anti-T. rubrum biofilm potential of NO-np using standard ATCC MYA-4438 and clinical BR1A strains and compare it to commonly used antifungal drugs including fluconazole, terbinafine and efinaconazole. The biofilms formed by the standard strain produced more biomass than those from the clinical strain. NO-np, fluconazole, terbinafine, and efinaconazole inhibited the in vitro growth of planktonic T. rubrum cells. Similarly, NO-np reduced the metabolic activities of clinical strain BR1A preformed biofilms at the highest concentration tested (SMIC(50) = 40 mg/mL). Scanning electron and confocal microscopy revealed that NO-np and efinaconazole severely damaged established biofilms for both strains, resulting in collapse of hyphal cell walls and reduced the density, extracellular matrix and thickness of the biofilms. These findings suggest that biofilms should be considered when developing and testing new drugs for the treatment of dermatophytosis. Development of a biofilm phenotype by these fungi may explain the resistance of dermatophytes to some antifungals and why prolonged treatment is usually required for onychomycosis.","Costa-Orlandi, Caroline Barcelos; Martinez, Luis R.; Bila, Níura Madalena; Friedman, Joel M.; Friedman, Adam J.; Mendes-Giannini, Maria José S.; Nosanchuk, Joshua D.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319823/,93

56568,The rise in inequality after pandemics: can fiscal support play a mitigating role?,2021-07-01,"Empirical studies in the creative arts therapies (CATs; i.e., art therapy, dance/movement therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, psychodrama, and poetry/bibliotherapy) have grown rapidly in the last 10 years, documenting their positive impact on a wide range of psychological and physiological outcomes (e.g., stress, trauma, depression, anxiety, and pain). However, it remains unclear how and why the CATs have positive effects, and which therapeutic factors account for these changes. Research that specifically focuses on the therapeutic factors and/or mechanisms of change in CATs is only beginning to emerge. To gain more insight into how and why the CATs influence outcomes, we conducted a scoping review (N(studies) = 67) to pinpoint therapeutic factors specific to each CATs discipline, joint factors of CATs, and more generic common factors across all psychotherapy approaches. This review therefore provides an overview of empirical CATs studies dealing with therapeutic factors and/or mechanisms of change, and a detailed analysis of these therapeutic factors which are grouped into domains. A framework of 19 domains of CATs therapeutic factors is proposed, of which the three domains are composed solely of factors unique to the CATs: “embodiment,” “concretization,” and “symbolism and metaphors.” The terminology used in change process research is clarified, and the implications for future research, clinical practice, and CATs education are discussed.","de Witte, Martina; Orkibi, Hod; Zarate, Rebecca; Karkou, Vicky; Sajnani, Nisha; Malhotra, Bani; Ho, Rainbow Tin Hung; Kaimal, Girija; Baker, Felicity A.; Koch, Sabine C.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8336579/,93
56653,A Lift: A Recommended Necessity in 2020,2020-12-15,"BACKGROUND: Despite legal and adopted frameworks purporting access to healthcare and rehabilitation services, which are both a human right and key to developmental issues, women who are deaf and/or hard of hearing (HoH) are still excluded and experience barriers when accessing healthcare services. Largely, this is attributed to communication barriers between healthcare professionals and women who are deaf and/or HoH. There have been limited research studies carried out on women with invisible disabilities, such as deafness, especially amongst African women. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to gain insights into the communication experiences of women who are deaf or HoH when accessing public healthcare services in hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A qualitative research study employing semi-structured interviews with 10 African women who are deaf and/or HoH residing in Johannesburg, South Africa and attending government healthcare facilities was conducted. Participants were purposively selected. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Data revealed the following themes: communication barriers resulting in compromised quality of care and infringement on participants’ right to confidentiality; accommodation that is not accommodative and negative attitudes of healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study confirm the alienating, exclusion, marginalisation, discrimination, invisibility, lack of independence and autonomy of women who are deaf and/or HoH when accessing healthcare services. Therefore, this study argues for a need for the conscientisation of healthcare professionals on communication needs of persons who are deaf and/or HoH. This has implications for the implementation of training programmes that will address communication, reasonable accommodation and attitudes of healthcare professionals.","Masuku, Khetsiwe P.; Moroe, Nomfundo; van der Merwe, Danielle",Afr J Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335767/,93

Correspondingly, MAO inhibitors are used for the treatment of severe neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. A commonly prescribed drug against refractory depression is tranylcypromine, however, the side effects are poorly understood. In order to decipher putative off-targets, we synthesized two tranylcypromine probes equipped with either an alkyne moiety or an alkyne-diazirine minimal photocrosslinker for in situ proteome profiling. Surprisingly, LC–MS/MS analysis revealed low enrichment of MAOA and relatively promiscuous labeling of proteins. Photoprobe labeling paired with fluorescent imaging studies revealed lysosomal trapping which could be largely reverted by the addition of lysosomotropic drugs.","Drechsel, Jonas; Kyrousi, Christina; Cappello, Silvia; Sieber, Stephan A.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8341850/,93

Studying the history of patients can help physicians to consider patients’ needs in healthcare system designing and offering service, which leads to an increase in patient satisfaction. Therefore, healthcare is becoming a growing contesting market. With this significant growth in healthcare systems, such challenges as huge data volume, response time, latency, and security vulnerability are raised. Therefore, fog computing, as a well-known distributed architecture, could help to solve such challenges. In fog computing architecture, processing components are placed between the end devices and cloud components, and they execute applications. This architecture is suitable for such applications as healthcare systems that need a real-time response and low latency. In this paper, a systematic review of available approaches in the field of fog-based healthcare systems is proposed; the challenges of its application in healthcare are explored, classified, and discussed. First, the fog computing approaches in healthcare are categorized into three main classes: communication, application, and resource/service. Then, they are discussed and compared based on their tools, evaluation methods, and evaluation metrics. Finally, based on observations, some open issues and challenges are highlighted for further studies in fog-based healthcare.","Ahmadi, Zahra; Haghi Kashani, Mostafa; Nikravan, Mohammad; Mahdipour, Ebrahim",Multimed Tools Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418296/,93

This quality improvement project aimed to plan, organise and sustain a regular HBPC service in a government cancer centre in Southeast India. The aim was to regularise and increase the number of home care visits among the patients identified for HBPC services through sustainable interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The A3 methodology with its team-based, structured problem-solving approach was the tool used. The situational process map at baseline was followed up with a sequential cause and effect analysis and team discussions to create sustainable and reliable interventions. These included creating the electronic data system for data collection in PC, allocation of resources and implementation of systems to coordinate HBPC services. The roles and ownership to maintain improvement were established by designation and this requirement has been included in the job description to ensure reliability and sustainability. RESULTS: The regularisation of home care services with a consistent increase in the number of home visits from 2/week to over 6/week helped achieve the Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time bound goal. Better documentation, coordination and accountability were also positive outcomes. Working with different departments and teams along the project helped build trust and understanding along with a sound base for collaborative research. CONCLUSION: The A3 way of problem solving through dialogue and consensus helped to organise HBPC services and this methodology can be extended to other areas in future.","Viswanath, Vidya; Digumarti, Leela; Raju, Nadimpalli Satyanarayana; Lokanandi, Usha Rani Venkata; Dasu, Mohana Rao; Bolem, Satya Kumari Venkata; Katta, Naresh; Vemula, Srinivasa Rao; Sharma, Vaduguru Venkata Lakshmi Narasimha; Digumarti, Raghunadharao",Indian J Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8428891/,93

METHODS: This retrospective analysis assessed clinical data of 21 patients who died owing to COVID-19. Disease severity and mortality risk were assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II); Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hypertension and age (MuLBSTA); and pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 66 ± 14 years and 15 (71.4%) patients were men. Sixteen (76.2%) patients had chronic medical illnesses. Twelve (57.1%) patients were overweight. Decreased lymphocyte proportions were observed in 17 (81.0%) patients on admission. Elevated D-dimer levels were observed in 11 (52.4%) patients, and the levels significantly increased when pneumonia deteriorated. The initial APACHE II and SOFA scores demonstrated that 18 (85.7%) and 13 (61.9%) patients, respectively, were in the middle-risk level. MuLBSTA and PSI scores after admission were associated with higher risks of mortality in 13 (61.9%) patients. Most patients developed organ failure and subsequently died. CONCLUSIONS: Older, overweight, male patients with a history of chronic illnesses and continuously decreased lymphocyte proportions and increased D-dimer levels might have higher risks of death owing to COVID-19. The combination of general scoring (SOFA) and pneumonia-specific scoring (MuLBSTA and PSI) systems after admission might be sensitive in assessing the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19 who are in critical condition.","Yang, Feihong; Zou, Hao; Gan, Jiaohong; Zhang, Zhongxiang; Zhao, Yan; Jiang, Cheng; Xia, Jian",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8447734/,93

While climate events are one of the many contributing drivers of conflict, feedback from conflict increases vulnerability, thereby creating conditions for a vicious cycle of conflict. In this study, we carry out a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, taking from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) dataset to documenting climate change adaptation occurring in 15 conflict-affected countries and compare the findings with records of climate adaptation finance flows and climate-related disasters in each country. Academic literature is sparse for most conflict-affected countries, and available studies tend to have a narrow focus, particularly on agriculture-related adaptation in rural contexts and adaptation by low-income actors. In contrast, multilateral and bilateral funding for climate change adaptation addresses a greater diversity of adaptation needs, including water systems, humanitarian programming, and urban areas. Even among the conflict-affected countries selected, we find disparity, with several countries being the focus of substantial research and funding, and others seeing little to none.

In this study, we explore the link between remittance, remittance volatility and macroeconomic performance to make a case for the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the study examined the impact of remittance volatility on some macroeconomic variables [real gross domestic product (RGDP), consumption, investment, export and exchange rate] in a panel of seven African countries with the highest remittance–GDP ratio. This was done within a fixed effects and random effects model, using annual secondary data from 2004 to 2018. Our results show that remittance volatility exerts a negative but insignificant impact on RGDP, consumption, investment, export and exchange rate; while remittances itself has positive significant impact on RGDP, consumption and investment. Based on these findings, while any COVID-19-induced volatility in remittances flow into Africa may yield negative macroeconomic consequences, it is not likely to significantly affect the macroeconomic fundamentals of the most remittance-dependent African countries due to strong kinsmanship and the altruistic nature of remitting African migrants.","Awode, Segun Subair; Akpa, Emeka Okoro; Okwu, Andy Titus",SN Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475383/,93

The most common symptoms of a disease are fever, cough, generalized body ache, weakness, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Among vascular complications of COVID-19, the venous thrombotic complications, like pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep veins thrombosis, are not uncommon. But data about arterial thrombotic complications of COVID-19, especially carotid thrombosis, are still limited. We are describing a case of stroke due to thrombosis of the right carotid arteries, in a patient who had recovered from asymptomatic COVID-19. A 66-year-old male with arterial hypertension presented to the emergency department with a history of repeated collapse, dysarthria, weakness in the left extremities, and a drop in the left angle of his mouth (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]-4). The patient was swabbed for COVID-19 which was negative. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was obtained which showed thrombosis in the branching point of the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT) continuing into the right subclavian artery (SA) and also into the right common carotid artery (CCA), with a subtotal occlusion of the right CCA, extending into the internal carotid artery (ICA) as well. From the apical lung tissue caught during the CT scan, bilateral, irregular widespread ground-glass opacifications, as well as consolidations and small reticular changes were seen in the lungs, which is typical for COVID-19 infection. A quantitative antibody test for COVID-19 infection was performed with the results showing a strong positivity for IgG antibodies, indicating previous COVID-19 infection. The patient was indicated for a standard carotid thrombectomy, which was performed without complications. It seems that one of the important factors that led to the formation of the thrombus in the carotid arteries was COVID-19 infection-induced inflammation in the atherosclerotic carotid vessels and generalized hypercoagulability as well as hyperviscosity. COVID-19 infection is an independent and important risk factor for the formation of an arterial thrombus during the acute illness and in the early post-COVID-19 period also, regardless of the severity of its course. Prophylactic anticoagulation is needed not only at the time of acute illness but also at the early post-COVID-19 time.","Bakirli, Ilkin; Tomka, Jan; Pis, Marian; Bakirli, Hasan; Bakirova, Gultakin; Osusky, Matej; Gazi, Andrej; Bakirov, Ifrat",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502242/,93

The aim of this paper was to summarize current literature studies on COVID pandemic and EDs. Methods: Literature search, study selection, methods, and quality evaluation were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A systematic search allowed the initial selection of 172 papers; 21 (12.2%) papers were eligible and included in the review. In selected studies, a total number of 29,108 subjects were enrolled (range: 10–11,391; mean/SD: 1,386 ± 2,800), 6,216 were men (21.4%), 22,703 were women (77.9%), and 189 (0.7%) were gender fluid or not declared. The mean age/SD of subjects was 30.2 ± 7.7. About 12 studies (57.1%) were online surveys, 4 (19.0%) were retrospective studies, 2 (9.5%) were qualitative studies, 2 (9.5%) were longitudinal cohort studies, and 1 was a social media survey (4.8%). Their analysis revealed five main findings: (1) changes in the routines of physical activities were related to the worsening of preoccupation on weight/body shape; (2) food access limitation during pandemic represented the risk factors for both triggering and exacerbating EDs; (3) restriction in healthcare facilities contributed to increase anxiety levels and to modify treatment compliance; (4) social isolation was related to the exacerbation of symptoms in patients with EDs who are home-confined with family members; and (5) conflicts and difficulties in relationships with “no way out” were the maintenance factors for ED symptoms, especially in adolescents and young adults. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on EDs that might be triggered by the exceptional conditions derived from COVID-19-related stress in predisposed subjects.

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Fujian Maternal and Child Health Hospital, China. A total of 301 women aged 60 years and older who were diagnosed with gynaecological malignancies from January 2019 to August 2020 were recruited. Participants were randomly divided into the HBM education and basic nursing groups. The participants in the HBM education group received perioperative rehabilitation education based on the HBM, and the participants in the basic nursing group received routine basic nursing. Rehabilitation training compliance, psychological resilience, psychological flexibility, self-efficacy, self-care ability, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT) incidence were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-three women were excluded based on the exclusion criteria, and 268 participants were eventually included and randomly divided into two groups: 134 participants in the HBM education group and 134 participants in the basic nursing group. Before HBM education, there were no significant differences in the mean scores of psychological resilience (50.43 ± 3.29 vs. 50.55 ± 2.29, P = 0.738), psychological flexibility (48.98 ± 3.45 vs. 49.29 ± 3.59, P = 0.465), self-efficacy (26.49 ± 5.26 vs. 26.29 ± 6.41, P = 0.781), or rehabilitation training compliance (28.4% vs. 27.8%, P = 0.922) between the two groups. After HBM education, the scores of training compliance (80.6% vs. 30.1%, P < 0.001), psychological resilience (55.47 ± 5.01 vs. 50.46 ± 2.62, P < 0.001), psychological flexibility (56.53 ± 4.51 vs. 49.13 ± 3.62, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (30.79 ± 4.56 vs. 26.41 ± 6.37, P < 0.001), self-care knowledge (43.36 ± 7.60 vs. 34.05 ± 6.99, P < 0.001), self-concept (29.57 ± 5.67 vs. 20.11 ± 3.86, P < 0.001), self-care responsibility (27.54 ± 5.09 vs. 20.86 ± 4.53, P < 0.001), and self-care skills (34.51 ± 5.62 vs. 21.62 ± 5.64, P < 0.001) were higher in the HBM education group than those in the basic nursing group. Additionally, the incidence of LEDVT was lower in the HBM group than that in the basic nursing group (2.2% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that perioperative HBM education can improve the cognition and self-care ability of elderly gynaecological malignancy patients and reduce postoperative complications.","Liu, Chenyin; Chen, Xianjing; Huang, Mengli; Xie, Qun; Lin, Qiaoming; Chen, Siai; Shi, Danfeng",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516589/,93

In the present study, in situ hybridization of RNA was used to study differential HEPIS expression levels in different types of cancer and normal tissues. A total of six truncated lengths of the HEPIS promoter regulatory sequences were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that HEPIS expression levels differed across four breast cancer cell lines. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that the activities of the reporter gene fragments spanning -1334/+373, -1203/+373, -1060/+373 and -899/+373 bp were higher compared with the reporter gene fragments spanning -759/+373 and -279/+373 bp. A search of the transcription factor database TRANSFAC identified numerous octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), nuclear factor (NF)-κB and C-JUN transcription factor binding sites located on the HEPIS promoter (pHEPIS). Furthermore, the results revealed that mutations of the OCT-1 (-1236/-1223 bp), NF-κB (-1186/-1176 bp) and C-JUN (-856/-846 bp) sites on the human pHEPIS resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN bound to pHEPIS in a site-dependent manner at the basal state. The TRANSFAC database was used to analyze the pHEPIS of multiple species and several activator protein-1, NF-κB and OCT-1 transcription factor binding sites were predicted. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that HEPIS is expressed at different levels in multiple organs and breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these findings indicate that OCT-1, NF-κB and C-JUN transcription factors are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene.","Hu, Fen; Zhang, Yunfeng",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2017.5374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399063/,93

60327,Resiliency Recovery Post COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"Regenerative capability of the peripheral nervous system after injury is enhanced by Schwann cells (SCs) producing several growth factors. The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SC-like phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs. ACh, via M2 muscarinic receptors, contributes to the modulation and maturation of NGF, improving the regenerative properties of dASCs.","Piovesana, R; Faroni, A; Taggi, M; Matera, A; Soligo, M; Canipari, R; Manni, L; Reid, A J; Tata, A M",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63645-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346125/,93
61276,Can cats become infected with Covid-19?,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND The positive impact that physical activity has on patients with cancer has been shown in several studies over recent years. However, supervised physical activity programs have several limitations, including costs and availability. Therefore, our study proposes a novel approach for the implementation of a patient-executed, activity tracker-guided exercise program to bridge this gap. OBJECTIVE Our trial aims to investigate the impact that an activity tracker-guided, patient-executed exercise program for patients undergoing radiotherapy has on cancer-related fatigue, health-related quality of life, and preoperative health status. METHODS Patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer (OnkoFit I trial) or neoadjuvant, definitive, or postoperative treatment for other types of solid tumors (OnkoFit II trial) will be randomized (1:1:1) into 3-arm studies. Target accrual is 201 patients in each trial (50 patients per year). After providing informed consent, patients will be randomized into a standard care arm (arm A) or 1 of 2 interventional arms (arms B and C). Patients in arms B and C will wear an activity tracker and record their daily step count in a diary. Patients in arm C will receive personalized weekly targets for their physical activity. No further instructions will be given to patients in arm B. The target daily step goals for patients in arm C will be adjusted weekly and will be increased by 10% of the average daily step count of the past week until they reach a maximum of 6000 steps per day. Patients in arm A will not be provided with an activity tracker. The primary end point of the OnkoFit I trial is cancer-related fatigue at 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy. This will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire. For the OnkoFit II trial, the primary end point is the overall quality of life, which will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General sum score at 6 months after treatment to allow for recovery after possible surgery. In parallel, blood samples from before, during, and after treatment will be collected in order to assess inflammatory markers. RESULTS Recruitment for both trials started on August 1, 2020, and to date, 49 and 12 patients have been included in the OnkoFit I and OnkoFit II trials, respectively. Both trials were approved by the institutional review board prior to their initiation. CONCLUSIONS The OnkoFit trials test an innovative, personalized approach for the implementation of an activity tracker-guided training program for patients with cancer during radiotherapy. The program requires only a limited amount of resources. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04506476; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04506476.

We developed a Lean quality improvement intervention for knee and hip arthroplasty patients encompassing the recognition, readiness, restoration and recovery phases of care. The intervention included standardised, evidence-based pathways, shared decision making, patient and family member engagement, and transdisciplinary rounding, implemented successively through a series of rapid process improvement workshops. We evaluated the intervention through run charts and time series analysis for 2005-2014. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, discharge disposition, postsurgical complications and patient satisfaction. Included were 4253 total joint arthroplasty procedures, 1659 hip and 2594 knee. LOS decreased from 3.2 to 2.4 days postintervention for both hip and knee patients (p<0.001). The 30-day hospital readmission rate for hip patients decreased from 3.1% (18/576) to 1.1% (5/446, p=0.032) with knee patients unchanged. Discharge to home (vs rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility) increased from 72% (415/576) to 91% (405/446) (p<0.001) for hip patients, and from 70% (599/860) to 87% (578/663) for knee patients (p<0.001). Our standardised multifaceted Lean quality improvement programme was associated with reduced LOS, decreased readmission rates and improved discharge disposition in total knee and hip arthroplasty patients.","Sorensen, Lyle; Idemoto, Lori; Streifel, Janet; Williams, Barbara; Mecklenburg, Robert; Blackmore, Craig",BMJ open quality,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2019-000664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363504/,93

The primary objective of this observational study was to describe the thromboprophylactic strategy implemented in routine practice. The main secondary objective was to assess the incidence of outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients admitted to public or private hospitals for abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery were included between November 2009 and November 2010; endoscopic route for surgery was the only exclusion criterion. Study outcomes were recorded at hospital discharge and at routine follow-up (generally 9±3weeks). RESULTS 2380 patients (mean±SD age: 66.4±11.6years, women: 36.8%) admitted to hospital for abdominal (47.8%), urological (41%), or gynaecological (11.2%) cancer surgery were included in the analysis. Of these, 2179 had data available at study end. Perioperative antithrombotic prophylaxis, consisting mainly of low-molecular-weight heparin, was given to 99.5% of patients. At hospital discharge, thromboprophylaxis was continued in 91.7% of patients, 57.4% receiving a 4-6week prophylaxis. This management strategy was associated with an overall venous thromboembolic event rate of 1.9%, 34.7% of events occurring after discharge. Incidences of fatal bleeding, bleeding in a critical organ and bleeding necessitating re-intervention were 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Overall mortality was 1.5%. CONCLUSIONS Thromboprophylaxis is routinely used in French patients undergoing major cancer surgery. For more than a third of patients, however, treatment duration did not comply with best-practice recommendations, which might explain the non-negligible rate of thromboembolic complications still observed in this patient population.","Samama, Charles-Marc; Boubli, Léon; Coloby, Patrick; Debourdeau, Philippe; Gruel, Yves; Mariette, Christophe; Mottier, Dominique; Rischmann, Pascal; Toubiana, Laurent; Steib, Annick",Thrombosis research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2013.10.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24231117/,93

First, in the absence of explicit guidance for responding to cases in which there is significant uncertainty or disagreement about the relative therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic merits of available interventions they perpetuate self-defeating practices. Second, without addressing the role of advertising in shaping patient and community preferences they risk creating moral loopholes that bypass and undermine professional duties of fidelity, honesty and transparency. In both cases, these flaws are exacerbated by an individualism that ignores the critical role of health systems in managing and reducing uncertainty and conflict over best practices, and in communicating with and shaping the expectations of the public.

62642,"Covid-19: Assess the effects of extending Pfizer vaccine dosing interval, expert urges.",2021-01-19,"PURPOSE The primary aim of this review was to summarize the evidence on the relationship between being a daycare worker working with children and the possible increased risk of cytomegalovirus infection. METHODS We searched the Medline and Embase databases using search strings defined according to the population, exposure, comparison, and outcomes (PECO) applicable to our research questions in order to find studies published since 2000. Two independent reviewers evaluated the search hits using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A manual search was performed to identify additional relevant literature. We extracted the resulting studies and assessed them in eight domains of bias. The pooled CMV seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to the general population was calculated. RESULTS After evaluating the 6879 records, six methodologically adequate studies were identified: five cross-sectional studies and one cohort study. The pooled seroprevalence of daycare workers was 59.3% (95% CI 47.6-70.9). The four studies investigating risk of infection indicated an increased seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to a reference population (prevalence ratio, PR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.33-1.77). No study evaluated CMV seroconversions for daycare workers. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a higher CMV seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to the general population. Notwithstanding the need for longitudinal and intervention studies, preventative efforts are needed. A pooled PR of 1.54 is compatible with a doubled seroconversion risk corresponding to a vocational probability of 50% if the substantial underestimation of the actual occupational seroconversion risk by prevalence-based estimators is considered.","Romero Starke, Karla; Kofahl, Marlen; Freiberg, Alice; Schubert, Melanie; Groß, Mascha Luisa; Schmauder, Stefanie; Hegewald, Janice; Kämpf, Daniel; Stranzinger, Johanna; Nienhaus, Albert; Seidler, Andreas",International archives of occupational and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-019-01464-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359142/,93

The cat had a grossly enlarged and oedematous vulva with pronounced superficial pyoderma of the perivulvar area, which responded favourably to systemic antibiotics, analgesics and local corticosteroids. A month after the initial examination, the cat was re-presented owing to pollakiuria, stranguria and dyschesia. The oedema of the vulva had disappeared and the vulvar labia were fused together; there was only a fistulous tract with a diameter of 1 mm present in the area of the vulva, and the cat strained to urinate through that opening. A contrast study revealed normal transit through the lower urinary tract, but labial adhesions resulted in the development of dilation cranially, where the vaginal vestibule was supposed to be. Vaginoplasty was subsequently performed, the cat recovered normally and, 10 months after the procedure, the lumen of the vaginostoma is preserved and the cat is urinating without difficulty.","Plavec, Tanja; Pavlin, Darja",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x12470653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23253882/,93

66176,"An overview of chemical additives present in plastics: Migration, release, fate and environmental impact during their use, disposal and recycling.",2018,"BACKGROUND Preclinical data indicate that anesthesia and surgery may promote cancer growth. We previously found no increased risk of malignant disease within 5 years regarding duration of general anesthesia (TANESTH) and time with Bispectral Index (BIS) under 45 (TBIS < 45) in patients without any diagnosis or history of malignancy before or within 1 month after surgery. Because immunocompetence may be different in patients with previous malignant disease, we investigated the corresponding risk in patients with earlier or existing malignant disease at the time of surgery. METHODS In a prospective cohort of 766 BIS-monitored patients anesthetized with sevoflurane, new malignant diagnoses and death within 5 years after surgery were retrieved. Cox regression was used to assess the risk of new cancer and all-cause death during follow-up in relation to (TANESTH) and (TBIS <45). RESULT Fifty-one patients (6.7%) were assigned 54 new malignant diagnoses within 5 years after surgery. Cancer surgery comprised 387 (51%) of the index operations. Two hundred ninety-three (38 %) of the patients died during follow-up. No relation between TANESTH or TBIS <45 and new malignant disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64-1.11 and 0.76-1.30, respectively) or death was found (HR 0.85-1.05 and 0.94-1.16, respectively). Nor were any corresponding significant relations obtained when other thresholds for BIS (i.e., < 30, 40, and 50, respectively) were investigated. CONCLUSION In patients with previous or existing malignant disease, neither duration of anesthesia nor increased cumulative time with profound sevoflurane anesthesia was associated with an increased risk for new cancer or death within 5 years after surgery. Monitoring ""depth of anesthesia"" is not expected to alter the risk of cancer proliferation after surgery.","Lindholm, Maj-Lis; Brudin, Lars; Sandin, Rolf H",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651233/,93

By combining microscopy, electron microscopic analysis, biophysical and in vivo models, we report that ATR-defective cells exhibit altered nuclear plasticity and YAP delocalization. When subjected to mechanical stress or undergoing interstitial migration, ATR-defective nuclei collapse accumulating nuclear envelope ruptures and perinuclear cGAS, which indicate loss of nuclear envelope integrity, and aberrant perinuclear chromatin status. ATR-defective cells also are defective in neuronal migration during development and in metastatic dissemination from circulating tumor cells. Our findings indicate that ATR ensures mechanical coupling of the cytoskeleton to the nuclear envelope and accompanying regulation of envelope-chromosome association. Thus the repertoire of ATR-regulated biological processes extends well beyond its canonical role in triggering biochemical implementation of the DNA damage response.","Kidiyoor, Gururaj Rao; Li, Qingsen; Bastianello, Giulia; Bruhn, Christopher; Giovannetti, Irene; Mohamood, Adhil; Beznoussenko, Galina V; Mironov, Alexandre; Raab, Matthew; Piel, Matthieu; Restuccia, Umberto; Matafora, Vittoria; Bachi, Angela; Barozzi, Sara; Parazzoli, Dario; Frittoli, Emanuela; Palamidessi, Andrea; Panciera, Tito; Piccolo, Stefano; Scita, Giorgio; Maiuri, Paolo; Havas, Kristina M; Zhou, Zhong-Wei; Kumar, Amit; Bartek, Jiri; Wang, Zhao-Qi; Foiani, Marco",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18580-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973141/,93

METHODS Outer (1,006,512 RT-PCR tests results for SARS-CoV-2) and proprietary (34,660 respiratory samples) epidemiological data was used. Fifteen European countries were studied. Dates of research: March 2 - May 22, 2020. RESULTS As of April 21, 2020, the mean population infection rate (PIR) for the European countries considered, was 9.66%. It decreased to 6.85% by May 22, 2020. The model predicted 5.68% PIR, giving accuracy of 79.40%. SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is limited by an extremum that may be observed for closed communities. A concept of effective reproduction number is introduced as a function of r0 with maximum at r0 = 4.671 and value reff. = 0.315 for the full-lockdown mode and r0 = 5.539 and reff. = 0.552 for the no-lockdown mode of SARS-CoV-2 containment. Full-lockdown and no-lockdown modes resulted in the outcomes not strikingly different from each other in terms of herd immunity values. CONCLUSION In case of a second wave of COVID-19 disease in Europe, it will coincide with seasonal common cold surge, spanning from mid-September 2020 to mid-February 2021, with a median in November-December 2020.

By examining the rise of measles cases following disinformation campaigns connected to the US 2016 presidential elections, the rise of disinformation in the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the impact of misinformation on public health interventions during the 2014-2016 West Africa and 2019-2020 Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola outbreaks, we ask whether the potential impact of these campaigns-which includes the undermining of sociopolitical systems, the delegitimization of public health and scientific bodies, and the diversion of the public health response-can be characterized as analogous to the impacts of more traditional conceptions of biowarfare. In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns. By doing so, we anticipate the advent of a combined cyber and biological warfare. The latter is not dependent on the existence of a manufactured biological weapon; it manages to undermine sociopolitical systems and public health through the weaponization of naturally occurring outbreaks.","Bernard, Rose; Bowsher, Gemma; Sullivan, Richard; Gibson-Fall, Fawzia",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090030/,93

In the United States, allocation frameworks are determined by each of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 64 jurisdictions (50 states, the District of Columbia, five cities and eight territories). In this study, we analyzed vaccine allocation plans published by 8 November 2020, tracking updates through to 30 March 2021. We evaluated whether jurisdictions adopted proposals to reduce inequity using disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. By 30 March 2021, 14 jurisdictions had prioritized specific zip codes in combination with metrics such as COVID-19 incidence, and 37 jurisdictions (including 34 states) had adopted disadvantage indices, compared to 19 jurisdictions in November 2020. Uptake of indices doubled from 7 to 14 among the jurisdictions with the largest shares of disadvantaged communities. Five applications were distinguished: (1) prioritizing disadvantaged groups through increased shares of vaccines or vaccination appointments; (2) defining priority groups or areas; (3) tailoring outreach and communication; (4) planning the location of dispensing sites; and (5) monitoring receipt. To ensure that equity features centrally in allocation plans, policymakers at the federal, state and local levels should universalize the uptake of disadvantage indices and related place-based measures.","Schmidt, Harald; Weintraub, Rebecca; Williams, Michelle A; Miller, Kate; Buttenheim, Alison; Sadecki, Emily; Wu, Helen; Doiphode, Aditi; Nagpal, Neha; Gostin, Lawrence O; Shen, Angela A",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01379-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007071/,93

The purpose of this study was to evaluate delayed thromboembolic events (DTEs) that developed more than 30 days after Enterprise stent-assisted embolization (SAC) and its associated risk factors. METHODS There were 125 consecutive patients (90 women and 35 men; mean age, 56.1 years) who received endovascular treatment for 126 complex intracranial aneurysms using the Enterprise stent during December 2008 to May 2011. A DTE was defined as a symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic stroke with positive findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging in the territory of the treated aneurysm and transient ischemic attack. Asymptomatic in-stent stenosis and occlusion were excluded. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 32.4 months, DTEs occurred in 10 patients (7.93%). DTEs occurred on antiplatelet therapy (dual medication, n = 2, 2 months after embolization; single medication, n = 6, 10-20 months after SAC) or after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (n = 2, 14 months after embolization). Multivariate analysis showed that current smoking (p = 0.005) and maximum parent artery diameter >4.5mm (p = 0.003) were associated with DTE. CONCLUSIONS SAC with the Enterprise stent poses a considerable risk of DTE. Our results suggest that a longer duration of antiplatelet therapy and clinical follow-up may be warranted for cases with suggested risk factors. The protocol for antiplatelet therapy after SAC should be determined in a large prospective trial.","Song, Jihye; Yeon, Je Young; Kim, Jong-Soo; Hong, Seung-Chyul; Kim, Keon-Ha; Jeon, Pyoung",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2015.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038280/,93

69133,Surgery Grand Rounds: Perspectives of the 21st Century Attendee.,2020-08-17,"Background Most Chinese Blood Centers adopted mini pool (MP) nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HBV screening due to high cost of Individual donation (ID) NAT, and different proportions of MP-reactive but ID-non-reactive donations (MP+/ID-, defined as non-resolved donations) have been observed during daily donor screening process. Some of these non-resolved donations are occult HBV infections (OBIs), which pose potential risk of HBV transmission if they are not deferred. This study is aimed to further analyze these non-resolved donations. Methods The non-resolved plasma samples were further analyzed by serological tests and various HBV DNA amplification assays including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and nested PCR amplifying the basic core and pre-core promoter regions (BCP/PC; 295 base pairs) and HBsAg (S) region (496 base pairs). Molecular characterizations of HBV DNA+ non-resolved samples were determined by sequencing analysis. Results Of 17,226 MPs from 103,356 seronegative blood donations, 98 MPs were detected reactive for HBV. Fifty-six out of these 98 (57.1%) reactive MPs were resolved as HBV DNA+, but the remaining 42 pools (42.9%, 252 donations) were left non-resolved with a high rate (53.2%) of anti-HBc+. Surprisingly, among 42 non-resolved MPs, 17 contained one donation identified as OBIs by alternative NAT assays. Sequence analysis on HBV DNAs extracted from these OBI donations showed some key mutations in the S region that may lead to failure in HBsAg detection and vaccine escape. Conclusion A total of 53.2% of the non-resolved donations were anti-HBc+, and OBIs were identified in 40.5% of these non-resolved pools. Therefore, non-resolved donations with anti-HBc+ might pose potential risk for HBV transmission. Our present analysis indicates that anti-HBc testing in non-resolved donations should be used to identify OBIs in order to further increase blood safety in China.","Ye, Xianlin; Zhao, Yu; Li, Ran; Li, Tong; Zheng, Xin; Xiong, Wen; Zeng, Jinfeng; Xu, Min; Chen, Limin",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.699217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394093/,93

69755,Our Shared Purpose: Leaving a Legacy of Caring.,2020-11-01,"Exosomes and other extracellular microvesicles (ExMVs) have important functions in intercellular communication and regulation. During the course of infection, these vesicles can convey pathogen molecules that serve as antigens or agonists of innate immune receptors to induce host defense and immunity, or that serve as regulators of host defense and mediators of immune evasion. These molecules may include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. Pathogen molecules may be disseminated by incorporation into vesicles that are created and shed by host cells, or they may be incorporated into vesicles shed from microbial cells. Involvement of ExMVs in the induction of immunity and host defense is widespread among many pathogens, whereas their involvement in immune evasion mechanisms is prominent among pathogens that establish chronic infection and is found in some that cause acute infection. Because of their immunogenicity and enrichment of pathogen molecules, exosomes may also have potential in vaccine preparations and as diagnostic markers. Additionally, the ability of exosomes to deliver molecules to recipient cells raises the possibility of their use for drug/therapy delivery. Thus, ExMVs play a major role in the pathogenesis of infection and provide exciting potential for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","Schorey, Jeffrey S; Harding, Clifford V",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci81132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035809/,93

Our aim was to report an extremely rare two cases of primary malignant melanoma of the spine one of them is sacral melanoma which represents the second reported case in the literature and to conduct a systematic review of the relevant literature. METHODS The diagnosis and management of these cases were retrospectively reviewed. Using the PRISMA guideline, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to analyze different management strategies and the prognosis of such pathology. RESULTS All two patients were operated on, and received gross total removal of their tumors, with extended follow up for tumor recurrences. One of the cases involved a sacral tumor, which was resected without adjuvant therapy. The other one was seen by oncology and received post-operative chemo- and radio- therapy. In addition to the aforementioned cases, we present a comprehensive review of the literature on PSM from 1950 to the present, demonstrating that PSM is a very rare tumor, with a limited counted number of cases reported worldwide. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we report an exceedingly rare two cases of primary malignant melanoma of the spine. Early surgical intervention is key to the management of these rare and aggressive tumors. GTR should be attempted if possible.","Haberfellner, Erika; Elbaroody, Mohammad; Alkhamees, Abdullah F; Alaosta, Abdelfatah; Eaton, Sydney; Quint, Elise; Shahab, Saba; O'Connor, Avalon; Im, Jacob; Khan, Asham; El-Gohary, Yasser; Lotfy, Mohamed; Sawan, Mohamed; Shamisa, Abdalla; Soliman, Mohamed A R",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932774/,93
71405,President's Message: The Fabric of the World.,2020-07-01,"Up to 6% of men who have undergone vasectomy will ultimately elect for reversal in the form of vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for various reasons. Vasovasostomy performed to regain fertility is a technique that has undergone numerous advances during the last century, including the use of microsurgical equipment and principles to construct a meticulous anastomosis. It is important during vasovasostomy to ensure good blood supply to the anastomosis as well as to build as a tension-free anastomosis. Visual inspection to ensure healthy mucosa and inner muscularis as well as atraumatic handling of tissues is helpful. With vasovasostomy, it is essential to create a watertight anastomosis to prevent secondary scar formation. The microdot technique of vasovasostomy allows for markedly discrepant lumens to be brought together more precisely. Thereby, the planning is separated from suture placement, which prevents dog-ears and avoids subsequent leaks. In the age of in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), it becomes even more important to clarify outcomes after vasectomy reversals, as patients now have a choice between surgical sperm retrieval coupled with IVF/ICSI versus vasectomy reversal. Little data on long-term outcomes for vasectomy reversals exist. Therefore, further research in this field needs to evaluate the rate of late failures and the predictors of late failures.","Herrel, Lindsey; Hsiao, Wayland",Asian journal of andrology,https://doi.org/10.1038/aja.2012.79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147468/,93

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was initially represented as a severe acute respiratory illness, with eventual dramatic complications. However, over time it revealed to be a complex systemic disease with manifestations derived from viral-induced inflammation and hypercoagulability, thus liable to affect any body organ or system. As a result, clinical presentation is variable, in addition to variations associated with several individual and collective risk factors. Given the extreme variability of pathology and clinical manifestations, a single, or a few, universal homeopathic preventive Do not split medicine(s) do not seem feasible. Yet homeopathy may have a relevant role to play, inasmuch as the vast majority of patients only exhibit the mild form of disease and are indicated to self-care at home, without standard monitoring, follow-up, or treatment.

To our knowledge, no meta-analyses have been published on cognitive impairment in first-degree relatives of individuals with MDD. Objective To compare cognitive performance between individuals with and without family history of MDD. Data Sources Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase using combinations of search terms for depression, first-degree relatives, and cognition from January 1, 1980, to July 15, 2018. Study Selection Original articles that reported data on cognition in first-degree relatives of individuals with MDD compared with controls with no family history of major mental illness. Data Extraction and Synthesis Means and SDs were extracted, and standardized mean differences (SMD) between relatives and controls were calculated for each measure of cognitive performance. The relative-control differences in overall cognition and in specific cognitive domains were synthesized in random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation that allows including multiple correlated measures of cognition within each study. Heterogeneity was quantified with τ2. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger intercept. Main Outcomes and Measures Performance on cognitive tests. Results Across 284 measures of cognition in 54 nonoverlapping samples including 3246 relatives of people with MDD (mean age 15.38 years, 57.68% females) and 5222 controls (mean age 14.70 years, 55.93% females), relatives of people with MDD performed worse than controls across all measures of cognition (SMD = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.11; P < .001). Domain-specific meta-analyses showed similar size of relative-control difference in most domains of cognition, including Full-Scale IQ (SMD = -0.19), verbal intelligence (SMD = -0.29), perceptual intelligence (SMD = -0.23), memory (SMD = -0.20), academic performance (SMD = -0.40), and language (SMD = -0.29). Study characteristics were not significantly associated with observed between-group differences. There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions and Relevance A general impairment in cognition is a feature of familial disposition for MDD.

METHODS The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 challenged pregnant women's mental well-being due to a concern for their unborn child and their need for healthcare services through pregnancy and birth. To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and the intensified measures such as the lockdown of Denmark impacted pregnant women's well-being and mental health, we conducted a questionnaire survey in the spring of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its first peak, and the consequences for pregnant women and the unborn child were very uncertain. All women residing in Denmark and registered with an ongoing pregnancy on 24 April 2020 were invited to participate. The questionnaire included background information, variables on COVID-19 symptoms and validated batteries of questions on loneliness, anxiety, stress, quality of life, meditation and prayers. Additional questions were included to examine concerns related to pregnancy and childbirth during the pandemic. COHORT CHARACTERISTICS Almost 18,000 women answered the questionnaire, which represents 60% of all invited women who experienced a national lockdown for the first time. Their median age was 30 years, and they were more likely to be multiparous. CONCLUSIONS Data from the COVIDPregDK Study will enable us to gain valuable knowledge on how the pandemic, the intensified measures from the health authorities and the national lockdown affected pregnant women's mental health and their concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stokholm, Lonny; Schrøder, Katja; Nør, Ellen A; Rubin, Katrine H; Jørgensen, Jan S; Petersen, Lone K; Bliddal, Mette",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211048746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641709/,93

Physical examination demonstrated an abdominal mass in the left flank and an irreducible, painless scrotal mass. He had a history of left sided inguinal hernia surgery six years ago. Computed tomography revealed a large enhancing left sided retroperitoneal mass invading the colon, pancreas and kidney and it was going down towards the left scrotum. Unblock tumor resection including the neighboring organs (left kidney, left colon, distal pancreas with spleen) was performed. Scrotal extension of the tumor was also excised and the inguinal canal was repaired primarily. Histopathology of the mass was myxoid-liposarcoma. The patient has disease free, without hernia recurrence but poor in renal function after twenty months follow-up. DISCUSSION Large retroperitoneal tumors may grow towards the inguinal region and they can mimic an inguinal hernia.

To test the extent to which RMSIT improves respiratory muscle performance compared with a conventional respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET), a novel incremental respiratory muscle test (IncRMT), loading inspiratory and expiratory muscles, was designed to assess performance changes associated with respiratory muscle training (RMT). METHODS Healthy, moderately trained males and females (age: 26 ± 5 yr, V˙O2peak: 47 ± 12 mL·min·kg) were randomized and balanced to three groups (RMSIT 5m/5f; RMET 6m/6f; PLAT 5m/6f). Lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and IncRMT performance were tested before and after 1 month of RMT. During the IncRMT, muscle activity and muscle deoxygenation were assessed via surface EMG and near-infrared spectroscopy of sternocleidomastoid (STERNO), intercostal (INTER), and abdominal (ABDO) muscles. RESULTS Two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of training for increased maximal voluntary ventilation (P = 0.001) and maximal inspiratory pressure (P = 0.017). Both RMT groups increased work of breathing during training sessions to the same extent (RMSIT: +17.4 ± 8.9 kJ; RMET: +26.2 ± 16.1 kJ; P = 0.143) with a larger increase in average mouth pressure in RMSIT (RMSIT: +20.0 ± 15.0 cm H2O; RMET: +3.3 ± 1.5 cm H2O; P = 0.001). After training, IncRMT duration increased in both RMT groups compared with PLAT (RMSIT: +5.6 ± 2.1 min, P = 0.0006 vs PLAT; RMET: +3.8 ± 4.2 min, P = 0.020 vs PLAT). At similar work, only INTER activity during inspiration increased after RMET. Higher performance after RMSIT was associated with higher activity in STERNO and ABDO, but after RMET, STERNO, INTER, and ABDO showed higher activity. CONCLUSION One month of RMSIT and RMET shows similar improvements in respiratory muscle performance despite different duration of training sessions. Also, muscular adaptations might differ.","Schaer, Corina E; Wüthrich, Thomas U; Beltrami, Fernando G; Spengler, Christina M",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000001782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216239/,93

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to report our experience with 31 patients who were treated with transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer. DESIGN This is a retrospective review of prospectively gathered data. SETTINGS This study was conducted at the Department of Surgery of Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital between April 2009 and April 2010. Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained single-institution laparoscopic colon cancer database. PATIENTS Thirty-one consecutively selected patients (mean BMI, 22.5 ± 2.3) were evaluated. INTERVENTIONS All patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer. Two different approaches were used for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy: the trocar insertion method and the SILS port method. The trocar insertion method was adopted in 22 of 31 patients, and the SILS port method was used in 9 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main measures of outcomes were intraoperative findings, postoperative course, and oncological outcomes. RESULTS The most common procedure was sigmoid colon resection performed in 12 of 31 (39%) patients. The mean skin incision was 2.72 ± 0.79 (range, 3-5) cm. The operating time ranged from 101 to 263 (mean, 156 ± 45) minutes. The volume of bleeding ranged from 5 to 60 (mean, 27 ± 19) mL. No intraoperative complications were observed in this series. Postoperatively, there was no mortality. Wound infection was observed in 1 patient. The number of harvested lymph nodes was 18 ± 2.1, and the mean tumor-free resection margin was 11 ± 4.8 cm.

79993,Scientists call for pandemic investigations to focus on wildlife trade.,2020-07-10,"Background Light pollution is inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light. Nighttime sky radiance is an effective measure to study its effects on individual sleep quality. Objectives The study is aimed to measure the effect of light pollution on the sleep quality and compare among people residing in selected rural and urban areas of West Bengal, India. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted during September-October 2018 in 10 villages of Barasat II block and 10 wards of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Two hundred and sixty-three participants from urban and 249 participants from rural areas were selected through multi-stage sampling. Data regarding sleep quality and other selected factors were geotagged along with the radiance data. Multi-level linear regression models were built. Results The mean age of the participants from rural and urban areas were respectively 37.65 (±10.77) years and 38.10 (±11.02) years. Gender-wise the participants were distributed almost evenly in urban and rural areas. Among the urban and rural population, the observed mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were 12.63 (±3.04) and 9.23 (±2.27), respectively. Poorer sleep quality was observed to be statistically significant with increasing level of exposure. Multi-level models show that, at an exposure of >40.0 nW/cm2/sr the adjusted coefficient was 11.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.65, 13.40) in the overall model and 12.84 (95% CI: 12.31, 13.37) for urban participants. Conclusion The disturbance in sleep is associated with higher levels of night-time radiance of the sky strongly observed among the urban population.","Lahiri, Arista; Chakraborty, Arup; Roy, Amal Kumar Sinha; Dasgupta, Urmila; Bhattacharyya, Krishnadas",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_265_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985422/,93

80375,Differences in final product of a bowel anastomosis of male and female novice surgeons.,2011,"BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment (EVT) has greatly improved the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with a proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO) of the anterior circulation. Currently, there is clinical equipoise concerning the added benefit of intravenous alteplase administration (IVT) prior to EVT. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of omitting IVT before EVT in patients with AIS caused by an anterior circulation LVO. METHODS MR CLEAN-NO IV is a multicenter randomized open-label clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design). Patients ≥ 18 years of age with a pre-stroke mRS < 3 with an LVO confirmed on CT angiography/MR angiography eligible for both IVT and EVT are randomized to receive either IVT (0.9 mg/kg) followed by EVT, or direct EVT in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective is to assess superiority of direct EVT. Secondarily, non-inferiority of direct EVT compared to IVT before EVT will be explored. The primary outcome is the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Ordinal regression with adjustment for prognostic variables will be used to estimate treatment effect. Secondary outcomes include reperfusion graded with the eTICI scale after EVT and stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) at 24 h. Safety outcomes include intracranial hemorrhages scored according to the Heidelberg criteria. A total of 540 patients will be included. DISCUSSION IVT prior to EVT might facilitate early reperfusion before EVT or improved reperfusion rates during EVT. Conversely, among other potential adverse effects, the increased risk of bleeding could nullify the beneficial effects of IVT. MR CLEAN-NO IV will provide insight into whether IVT is still of added value in patients eligible for EVT. TRIAL REGISTRATION www.isrctn.com : ISRCTN80619088 .

80486,Impact of Covid-19 on animal welfare.,2020-08-19,"Treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has been revolutionized by the advent of endovascular Flow Diverters (FDs), which disrupt blood flow within the aneurysm to induce pro-thrombotic conditions, and serves as a scaffold for endothelial ingrowth and arterial remodeling. Despite good clinical success of FDs, complications like incomplete occlusion and post-treatment rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported. In silico computational fluid dynamic analysis of the pre- and post-treated geometries of IA patients can shed light on the contrasting blood hemodynamics associated with different clinical outcomes. In this study, we analyzed hemodynamic modifications in 15 IA patients treated using a single FD; 10 IAs were completely occluded (successful) and 5 were partially occluded (unsuccessful) at 12-month follow-up. An in-house virtual stenting workflow was used to recapitulate the clinical intervention on these cases, followed by CFD to obtain pre- and post-treatment hemodynamics. Bulk hemodynamic parameters showed comparable reductions in both groups with average inflow rate and aneurysmal velocity reduction of 40.3% and 52.4% in successful cases, and 34.4% and 49.2% in unsuccessful cases. There was a substantial reduction in localized parameter like vortex coreline length and Energy Loss for successful cases, 38.2% and 42.9% compared to 10.1% and 10.5% for unsuccessful cases. This suggest that for successfully treated IAs, the localized complex blood flow is disrupted more prominently by the FD as compared to unsuccessful cases. These localized hemodynamic parameters can be potentially used in prediction of treatment outcome, thus aiding the clinicians in a priori assessment of different treatment strategies.","Paliwal, Nikhil; Damiano, Robert J; Davies, Jason M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui",Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2254584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515570/,93

Conversion of the two spot-tests in an upper limb musculoskeletal anatomy unit of study from FR to a novel MC format, where one of five tagged structures on a specimen was the answer to each question, provided a unique opportunity to assess the comparative validity and reliability of FR and MC formatted spot-tests and the impact on student performance following the change of test format to MC. Three successive year cohorts of health science students (n=1,442) were each assessed by spot-tests formatted as FR (first cohort) or MC (following two cohorts). Comparative question difficulty was assessed independently by three examiners. There were more Higher Order Cognitive Skill questions and more of the course objectives tested in the MC-formatted tests. Spot-test reliability was maintained with Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients ≥ 0.80 and 80% of the MC items of high quality (having point biserial correlation coefficients > 0.25). These results also demonstrated guessing was not an issue. The mean final score for the MC-formatted cohorts increased by 4.9%, but did not change for the final theory examination that was common to all three cohorts. Subgroup analysis revealed that the greatest change in spot-test marks was for the lower-performing students. In conclusion, our results indicate spot-tests formatted as MC are suitable alternatives to FR tests. The increase in mean scores for the MC-formatted spot-tests was attributed to the lower demand of the MC format.","Douglas-Morris, Jan; Ritchie, Helen; Willis, Catherine; Reed, Darren",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683830/,93
80725,Can companion animals become infected with Covid-19?,2020-03-28,"PURPOSE To develop and demonstrate a cardiac gating method for repeatable in vivo measurement of total retinal blood flow (TRBF) in humans using en face Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT) at commercially available imaging speeds. METHODS A prototype swept-source OCT system operating at 100-kHz axial scan rate was developed and interfaced with a pulse oximeter. Using the plethysmogram measured from the earlobe, Doppler OCT imaging of a 1.5- × 2-mm area at the optic disc at 1.8 volumes/s was synchronized to cardiac cycle to improve sampling of pulsatile blood flow. Postprocessing algorithms were developed to achieve fully automatic calculation of TRBF. We evaluated the repeatability of en face Doppler OCT measurement of TRBF in 10 healthy young subjects using three methods: measurement at 100 kHz with asynchronous acquisition, measurement at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition, and a control measurement using a 400-kHz instrument with asynchronous acquisition. RESULTS The median intrasubject coefficients of variation (COV) of the three methods were 8.0%, 4.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. All three methods correlated well, without a significant bias. Mean TRBF measured at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition was 40.5 ± 8.2 μL/min, and the range was from 26.6 to 55.8 μL/min. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT can achieve smaller measurement variability than previously reported methods. Although further validation in older subjects and diseased subjects is required, precise measurement of TRBF using cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT at commercially available imaging speeds should be feasible.","Lee, ByungKun; Choi, WooJhon; Liu, Jonathan J; Lu, Chen D; Schuman, Joel S; Wollstein, Gadi; Duker, Jay S; Waheed, Nadia K; Fujimoto, James G",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.14-16119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744974/,93

We also explored perspectives around using peer support and digital health strategies for delivering mental health support. METHODS This study recruited 38 adults with T1D to complete a self-report survey and participate in focus groups. We conducted six 90-minute focus groups that addressed the following: current and past mental health needs, social media use for T1D support, peer supporter recruitment and training, and support delivery features for virtual care platforms. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, quality checked, coded, and analysed to develop themes and subthemes. RESULTS Four core themes emerged: (1) emotional challenges linked to T1D management, (2) unique T1D-related concerns in rural and remote communities, (3) previous support experiences and future support needs, and (4) diabetes-related mental health support interventions involving peer support and digital health strategies. Existing support services are inadequate in meeting the needs of T1D adults in Interior BC. Some have turned towards social media as a way to connect with the T1D community for support. CONCLUSIONS Though T1D adults living in rural and remote settings experience distress associated with the ongoing burdens, frustrations, and fears of managing a complex chronic condition, many have not been offered support and do not know how to seek services in the present/future. Peer support and digital health strategies are two potential solutions to address this care gap.","Ashrafi, Shadan; Taylor, Deanne; Tang, Tricia S",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524209/,93

Alongside multiple intra-abdominal and musculoskeletal injuries, the patient sustained a type VI acromioclavicular joint dislocation. This injury was not picked up on the initial clinical assessment or described in the initial radiology report, with the diagnosis only made upon subsequent repeat review of the imaging by the admitting team. Fortunately, this delay did not increase the time to the patient receiving appropriate treatment.

82810,Possible method for the production of a Covid-19 vaccine.,2020-03-28,"Haemodynamic assessment during the transitional period in preterm infants is challenging. We aimed to describe the relationships between cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation (CrSO2), perfusion index (PI), echocardiographic, and clinical parameters in extremely preterm infants in their first 72 h of life. Twenty newborns born at < 28 weeks of gestation were continuously monitored with CrSO2 and preductal PI. Cardiac output was measured at H6, H24, H48, and H72. The median gestational age and birth weight were 25.0 weeks (24-26) and 750 g (655-920), respectively. CrSO2 and preductal PI had r values < 0.35 with blood gases, lactates, haemoglobin, and mean blood pressure. Cardiac output significantly increased over the 72 h of the study period. Fifteen patients had at least one episode of low left and/or right ventricular output (RVO), during which there was a strong correlation between CrSO2 and superior vena cava (SVC) flow (at H6 (r = 0.74) and H24 (r = 0.86)) and between PI and RVO (at H6 (r = 0.68) and H24 (r = 0.92)). Five patients had low SVC flow (≤ 40 mL/kg/min) at H6, during which PI was strongly correlated with RVO (r = 0.98). CONCLUSION CrSO2 and preductal PI are strongly correlated with cardiac output during low cardiac output states. What is Known: • Perfusion index and near-infrared spectroscopy are non-invasive tools to evaluate haemodynamics in preterm infants. • Pre- and postductal perfusion indexes strongly correlate with left ventricular output in term infants, and near-infrared spectroscopy has been validated to assess cerebral oxygenation in term and preterm infants. What is New: • Cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation and preductal perfusion index were strongly correlated with cardiac output during low cardiac output states. • The strength of the correlation between cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation, preductal perfusion index, and cardiac output varied in the first 72 h of life, reflecting the complexity of the transitional physiology.","Janaillac, Marie; Beausoleil, Thierry P; Barrington, Keith J; Raboisson, Marie-Josée; Karam, Oliver; Dehaes, Mathieu; Lapointe, Anie",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-018-3096-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374830/,93

The numbers of these NCD cases are predicted to rise over the next decade. However, in the context of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, with the rising cases, lockdowns and deaths recorded worldwide, many people living with NCDs may find accessing care more difficult. The majority of the available resources on the subcontinent have been diverted to focus on the ongoing pandemic. This has caused interruptions in care, complication management, drug pick-up alongside the almost neglected silent NCD epidemic, with major consequences for the health system post the COVID-19 era.

Inactivated SARS-CoV has been explored as a vaccine against SARS-CoV; however, current knowledge of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine is quite limited. We attempted to investigate the effects of different immunization protocols and adjuvant on the antibody responses to inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. With an intraperitoneal (IP) immunization protocol, inactivated SARS-CoV alone induced significant amounts of SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies in sera and a small quantity of SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in the genital tract and feces, but failed to induce any detectable SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera, saliva, lung, and intestine, and the addition of CpG ODN 2006 had only a marginal effect on antibody production. In contrast, with an intranasal (IN) immunization protocol, inactivated SARS-CoV alone failed to induce any detectable SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera, saliva, lung, and intestine, except for a small quantity of IgA antibodies in fecal extracts and the genital tract, along with IgG antibodies in sera, but when given with adjuvant CpG ODN 2006, inactivated SARS-CoV induced significant amounts of SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies in sera, and a detectable amount of SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera and all tested mucosal secretions and tissues (i.e., saliva, the genital tract, fecal extract, lung, and intestine). On a neutralization assay, neutralizing activity with the IP immunization protocol was detected in sera and mucosal secretions (from the saliva and genital tract), but sera from the IN protocol failed to show any neutralizing activity.

83483,On privilege and fragility.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVE The hypothesis that gender stereotypes influence human behaviour and relational well-being is widely accepted in the literature. However, a comparison based on scientific assumptions is necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms activated by stereotypes in conditions of stress. The global health emergency from COVID-19 offers the opportunity to compare countries with different socio-cultural conditions, whose population has been subjected to the same stressful event during the lockdown phase. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The same questionnaire was disseminated in both Italy and Turkey during their respective lockdown phases. 140,000 interviews were collected in Italy and 10,000 in Turkey, a number big enough to obtain useful information for a comparative analysis in relation to behaviours, attitudes and well-being, also using the recursive regression models. RESULTS The results, based on scientific data, show that gender stereotypes are much more rooted in Turkey than in Italy, where the emancipation process of the population is more advanced, producing profound social changes and decreasing differences between men and women in terms of behaviour and reactions to difficult situations, such as the present one. CONCLUSIONS Stereotypes, which are hostile to any opposite evidence, affect individual behaviours and attitudes to the point that, within a specific context, they play a protective role against the uncertainty during a period of health emergency, inducing people to seek shelter in pre-established and widespread behavioural models. According to the data analysis, this has happened in Turkey more than in Italy. The results show that within a culture still strongly pervaded by these social conditioning, especially at the presence of low levels of education, the adherence to gender roles constitutes a ""protective factor"" of the individual well-being against external stress factors.","Tintori, A; Ciancimino, G; Oksay, A; Senal, S; Bulgan, G; Büyüker İşler, D; Cerbara, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378055/,93
83485,Glow in the dark: Using a heat-sensitive camera for blind individuals with prosthetic vision.,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND Serum D-dimer is frequently used to rule out a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a recognised complication following total knee replacement (TKR). TKR is known to cause a rise in D-dimer levels, reducing its specificity. Previous studies have demonstrated that D-dimer remains elevated within 10 days of TKR and therefore should be avoided. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum D-dimer tests are clinically appropriate in identifying VTE when performed within 28 days of TKR. METHODS Case notes for patients who had a serum D-dimer test performed for clinically suspected VTE at ≥ 28 days following TKR were retrospectively reviewed for a 6-year period. Demographics, D-dimer result, time after surgery and further radiological investigations were recorded. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent D-dimer tests at ≥ 28 days following surgery (median 60 days, range 29-266); 48 of these patients had a positive result. Of these, five had confirmed VTE on radiological investigations. Serum D-dimer was raised in 96% of the patients. Only 10.42% of these patients had confirmed VTE. No patients with negative D-dimers had confirmed VTE. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that serum D-dimer remains raised for at least 28 days and possibly considerably longer following TKR. Serum D-dimer should not be used in patients with clinically suspected VTE within this period because of its unacceptably low specificity of 4.44% and positive predictive value of 10.42%, which can lead to a delay in necessary further radiological investigations, waste of resources and unnecessary exposure to harm.","Toner, Ethan; Oputa, Tobenna; Robinson, Heather; McCabe-Robinson, Olivia; Sloan, Andrew",Knee surgery & related research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43019-020-00068-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962751/,93

84735,Providing support and raising awareness of a delicate subject.,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND Postoperative mortality has been associated with cumulative anesthetic duration below an arbitrary processed electroencephalographic threshold (bispectral index [BIS] <45). This substudy of the B-Unaware Trial tested whether cumulative duration of BIS values lower than 45, cumulative anesthetic dose, comorbidities, or intraoperative events were independently associated with postoperative mortality. METHODS The authors studied 1,473 patients (mean ± SD age, 57.9 ± 14.4 yr; 749 men) who underwent noncardiac surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine whether perioperative factors were independently associated with all-cause mortality. RESULTS A total of 358 patients (24.3%) died during a follow-up of 3.2 ± 1.1 yr. There were statistically significant associations among various perioperative risk factors, including malignancy and intermediate-term mortality. BIS-monitored patients did not have lower mortality than unmonitored patients (24.9 vs. 23.7%; difference = 1.2%, 95% CI, -3.3 to 5.6%). Cumulative duration of BIS values less than 45 was not associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.14). Increasing mean and cumulative end-tidal anesthetic concentrations were not associated with mortality. The multivariable Cox regression model showed a good discriminative ability (c-index = 0.795). CONCLUSIONS This study found no evidence that either cumulative BIS values below a threshold of 40 or 45 or cumulative inhalational anesthetic dose is injurious to patients. These results do not support the hypothesis that limiting depth of anesthesia either by titration to a specific BIS threshold or by limiting end-tidal volatile agent concentrations will decrease postoperative mortality.","Kertai, Miklos D; Palanca, Ben J A; Pal, Nirvik; Burnside, Beth A; Zhang, Lini; Sadiq, Furqaan; Finkel, Kevin J; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31820c2b57; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21293252/,93

MATERIALS AND METHODS DCD lung transplant program requires a systematic approach for an efficient utilization of hospital resources. The surgical techniques have been developed to minimize the ischemic time during lung procurement. We have presented our management protocol and the surgical techniques as used at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS We have transplanted 92 recipients with lungs procured from 91 donors over an 8 year period from May 2006 to July 2014. This accounted for an extra 19% lung transplant operations performed during this time period. Operative mortality was 1% and 8 year survival was 71% in DCD lung recipients. CONCLUSIONS DCD lung transplantation provides an additional significant pool of lung donors with satisfactory short and long term outcomes.","Saxena, Pankaj; Zimmet, Adam D; Snell, Greg; Levvey, Bronwyn; Marasco, Silvana F; McGiffin, David C",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.07.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217512/,93
85629,Criticality in epidemic spread: An application in the case of COVID19 infected population.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND The benefit of a stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) is not certain for older patients, particularly in the surgical context. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with an unfavourable outcome in this population. DESIGN Prospective, descriptive, monocentric study conducted in the surgical ICU of a French university hospital. METHODS Patients aged ≥75 years admitted in the surgical ICU for a predicted length of stay ≥48 hours were included. Patients received an initial and a 6-months nutritional and functional assessment performed by physicians and nurses. The outcome was considered as favourable if the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) variation (ADL delta = 6-months ADL - ICU admission ADL) was between 0 and -0.5 point 6 months after ICU discharge and unfavourable if the ADL delta decreased by more than 0.5 points or if the patient had died 6 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS Fifty-six patients-32 (57%) male-aged 79 [77; 83] y were included. ICU mortality was 19%; 6-month mortality was 22%. Median ADL delta was -0.5 [-0.5-0] points. A low ADL score (P = .0438) and a low albumin level (P = .0213) at admission were the two independent factors associated with an unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION Mortality and loss of independence were high in this elderly population during and after their surgical ICU stay. The benefit of a systematic collaboration between intensive care specialists, ICU nurses, and geriatricians, to assess and manage nutritional and functional problems and to prevent a pejorative outcome in patients over 75 years old admitted in surgical ICU needs to be studied. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE There should be systematic screening for objective markers of undernutrition and frailty on ICU admission of older patients as they are associated with a poor prognosis.","Occhiali, Emilie; Prolange, Pierre; Cassiau, Florence; Roca, Frédéric; Veber, Benoit; Clavier, Thomas",Nursing in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323344/,93
85821,Validation of a novel contact-free heart and respiratory rate monitor.,2021-04-13,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the most economically important virus found on citrus and influences production worldwide. The 3' half of the RNA genome is generally conserved amongst sources, whereas the 5' portion is more divergent, allowing for the classification of the virus into a number of genotypes based on sequence diversity. The acknowledged genotypes of CTV are continually being expanded, and thus far include T36, T30, T3, VT, B165, HA16-5, T68 and RB. The genotype composition of the CTV populations of a potential cross protection source in Mexican lime was studied whilst comparing different techniques of viral population characterization. Cloning and sequencing of an ORF 1a fragment, genotype specific RT-PCRs and Illumina sequencing of the p33 gene as well as RNA template enrichment through immuno-capture was done. Primers used in the cloning and sequencing proved to be biased towards detection of the VT genotype. RT-PCR and Illumina sequencing using the two different templates provided relatively comparable results, even though the immuno-captured enriched template provided less than expected CTV specific data, while the RT-PCRs and p33 sequencing cannot be used to make inferences about the rest of the genome; which may vary due to recombination. The source was found to contain multiple genotypes, including RB and VT. When choosing a characterization method, the features of the virus under study should be considered. It was found that Illumina sequencing offers an opportunity to gain a large amount of information regarding the entire viral genome, but challenges encountered are discussed.","Kleynhans, Jackie; Pietersen, Gerhard",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27599410/,93

Anxiety has been shown to impact test scores, yet no anxiety measure currently exists specific to older adult neuropsychological assessment. This study piloted and validated the Feelings About Neuropsychological Testing measure (FANT), a measure of neuropsychological assessment anxiety developed to measure the cognitive, affective, and physiological aspects of test and state anxiety. The measure was validated on 105 community based older adults aged 55 and older. All participants were administered the FANT, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- seven item (GAD-7), Test Anxiety Inventory- Short Form (TAI-SF), Patient Health Questionnaire- nine item (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Dementia Worry Scale (DWS), and PROMIS Cognitive Function Short Form- 6a (CFSF). The measure proved feasible to administer, both the State and Test-specific dimensions demonstrated good internal consistency (state: α =.832; test: α =.894), discriminant validity, and external validity (compared to GAD-7, TAI-SF, PHQ-9, DWS, and CFSF). FANT scores may reveal patients for whom anxiety disrupts attention and attentional control, and therefore has promise as a measure that may inform assessment findings and guide possible intervention to maximize performance during testing sessions and to inform data interpretation.","Dorenkamp, Megan A; Vik, P","Neuropsychology, development, and cognition.

87632,Three pitfalls of accountable healthcare rationing.,2021-01-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been evaluated using an algorithm based on the Bateman function in a modified SIR/SIZ-Model. Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A - No restrictions on the population; Scenario B - Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C - Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant (α) for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant (β) for the fall in number of infectious persons. .","Merle, Uta; Laßmann, Axel; Dressel, Alexander R; Braun, Peter",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515729/,93
87759,Board Walk - April 2021.,2021-04-01,"Big data in both the public domain and the health care industry are growing rapidly, for example, with broad availability of next-generation sequencing and large-scale phenomics datasets on patient-reported outcomes. In parallel, we are witnessing new research approaches that demand sharing of data for the benefit of planetary society. Health data cooperatives (HDCs) is one such approach, where health data are owned and governed collectively by citizens who take part in the HDCs. Data stored in HDCs should remain readily available for translation to public health practice but at the same time, governed in a critically informed manner to ensure data integrity, veracity, and privacy, to name a few pressing concerns. As a solution, we suggest that data generated from high-throughput omics research and phenomics can be stored in an open cloud platform so that researchers around the globe can share health data and work collaboratively. We describe here the Global Open Health Data Cooperatives Cloud (GOHDCC) as a proposed cloud platform-based model for the sharing of health data between different HDCCs around the globe. GOHDCC's main objective is to share health data on a global scale for robust and responsible global science, research, and development. GOHDCC is a citizen-oriented model cooperatively governed by citizens. The model essentially represents a global sharing platform that could benefit all stakeholders along the health care value chain.","Tanwar, Ankit Singh; Evangelatos, Nikolaos; Venne, Julien; Ogilvie, Lesley Ann; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu; Brand, Angela",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719569/,93

88786,Facility design and healthcare-acquired infections: state of the science.,2014,"BACKGROUND Flexible endoscopy is an integral part of surgical care. Exposure to endoscopic procedures varies greatly in surgical training. The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons has developed the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES), which serves to teach and assess the fundamental knowledge and skills required to practice flexible endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. This report describes the validity evidence in the development of the FES cognitive examination. METHODS Core areas in the practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy were identified through facilitated expert focus groups to establish validity evidence for the test content. Test items then were developed based on the content areas. Prospective enrollment of participants at various levels of training and experience was used for beta testing. Two FES cognitive test versions then were developed based on beta testing data. The Angoff and contrasting group methods were used to determine the passing score. Validity evidence was established through correlation of experience level with examination score. RESULTS A total of 220 test items were developed in accordance with the defined test blueprint and formulated into two versions of 120 questions each. The versions were administered randomly to 363 participants. The correlation between test scores and training level was high (r = 0.69), with similar results noted for contrasting groups based on endoscopic rotation and endoscopic procedural experience. Items then were selected for two test forms of 75 items each, and a passing score was established. CONCLUSIONS The FES cognitive examination is the first test with validity evidence to assess the basic knowledge needed to perform flexible endoscopy. Combined with the hands-on skills examination, this assessment tool is a key component for FES certification.","Poulose, Benjamin K; Vassiliou, Melina C; Dunkin, Brian J; Mellinger, John D; Fanelli, Robert D; Martinez, Jose M; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Sillin, Lelan F; Delaney, Conor P; Velanovich, Vic; Fried, Gerald M; Korndorffer, James R; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3220-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24100859/,93

Baseline vaccination rates (March 2019) for pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza at our tertiary cancer centre were 8% and 40%, respectively. The aim of this study was to increase the number of gynecologic chemotherapy patients receiving pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations to 80% by March 2020. METHODS We performed an interrupted time series study using structured quality improvement methodology. Three interventions were introduced to address vaccination barriers: an in-house vaccination program, a staff education campaign, and a patient care bundle (pre-printed prescription, information brochure, vaccine record booklet). Process and outcome data were collected by patient survey and pharmacy audit and analyzed on statistical process control charts. RESULTS We identified 195 eligible patients. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates rose significantly from 5% to a monthly mean of 61% and from 36% to a monthly mean of 67%, respectively. The 80% target was reached for both vaccines during one or more months of study. The in-house vaccination and staff education programs were major contributors to the improvement, whereas the information brochure and record booklet were minor contributors. CONCLUSIONS Three interventions to promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination among chemotherapy patients resulted in significantly improved vaccination rates. Lessons learned about promoting vaccine uptake may be generalizable to different populations and vaccine types. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives to expand the program to all chemotherapy patients at our centre are underway.","McGinnis, Justin M; Jones, Rebecca; Hillis, Christopher; Kokus, Heather; Thomas, Heidi; Thomas, Jason; Alyafi, Mohammad; Bernard, Laurence; Eiriksson, Lua R; Elit, Lorraine M; Hirte, Hal; Jimenez, Waldo; Reade, Clare J; Kumar Tyagi, Nidhi; Helpman, Limor",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526258/,93

Changes in nerve function and central pain processing can be quantified by assessing pain thresholds and pain modulation mechanisms. AIM To summarise the literature which compares pain thresholds and pain modulation mechanisms in people with diabetes without neuropathies, with non-painful diabetic neuropathies and with painful diabetic neuropathies, and in people without diabetes. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted. Terms related to diabetes, pain thresholds and pain modulation mechanisms will be combined in a structured search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and PEDro. Publications on adults (18 years and older) with diabetes and at least one pain threshold measure following thermal, mechanical or electrical stimuli and/or at least one pain modulation mechanisms (temporal summation or conditioned pain modulation) with a comparison group will be considered. There will be no restriction regarding language or year of publication. One investigator will screen records based on title and abstract (ESS). Two independent investigators (ESS and MC) will select full-text papers and assess risk of bias using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Potential disagreements will be resolved with a third investigator (LB). One investigator (ESS) will extract all data and a second investigator (MS) will extract data for 20% of the papers to verify accuracy of the process.

While intuitively appealing, there is sparse evidence for its use beyond feasibility. AIM To examine the usefulness of single access laparoscopy (SAL) in a general series experience of patients sick with ulcerative colitis. METHODS All patients presenting electively, urgently or emergently over a three-year period under a colorectal specialist team were studied. SAL was performed via the stoma site on a near-consecutive basis by one surgical team using a ""surgical glove port"" allowing group-comparative and case-control analysis with a contemporary cohort undergoing conventional multiport surgery. Standard, straight rigid laparoscopic instrumentation were used without additional resource. RESULTS Of 46 consecutive patients requiring surgery, 39 (85%) had their procedure begun laparoscopically. 27 (69%) of these were commenced by single port access with an 89% completion rate thereafter (three were concluded by multi-trocar laparoscopy). SAL proved effective in comparison to multiport access regardless of disease severity providing significantly reduced operative access costs (> 100€case) and postoperative hospital stay (median 5 d vs 7.5 d, P = 0.045) without increasing operative time. It proved especially efficient in those with preoperative albumin > 30 g/dL (n = 20). Its comparative advantages were further confirmed in ten pairs case-matched for gender, body mass index and preoperative albumin. SAL outcomes proved durable in the intermediate term (median follow-up = 20 mo). CONCLUSION Single port total colectomy proved useful in planned and acute settings for patients with medically refractory colitis. Assumptions regarding duration and cost should not be barriers to its implementation.","Burke, John; Toomey, Des; Reilly, Frank; Cahill, Ronan",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i39.6015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132651/,93

Past experience provides one source of knowledge about likely task demands in the present, with learning enabling future predictions about anticipated demands. We examine whether spatial contexts serve to cue retrieval of associated task demands (e.g., context A and B probabilistically cue retrieval of task demands X and Y, respectively), and the role of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in mediating such retrieval. Using 3D virtual environments, we induce context-task demand probabilistic associations and find that learned associations affect goal-directed behavior. Concurrent fMRI data reveal that, upon entering a context, differences between hippocampal representations of contexts (i.e., neural pattern separability) predict proactive retrieval of the probabilistically dominant associated task demand, which is reinstated in dlPFC. These findings reveal how hippocampal-prefrontal interactions support memory-guided cognitive control and adaptive behavior.","Jiang, Jiefeng; Wang, Shao-Fang; Guo, Wanjia; Fernandez, Corey; Wagner, Anthony D",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15928-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345979/,93

We report a patient with advanced CADM with ILD and MDA-5 antibodies who failed to improve with immunosuppressants. We performed 2 TPE over 3 days, using 5% albumin as replacement fluid. Although five total TPE were planned, he was transferred for lung transplant evaluation after the second TPE; he died 16 days after transfer without receiving a transplant. A literature review identified four patients with CADM and MDA-5 antibodies treated with TPE; all experienced symptomatic improvement of their ILD.

The COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on people's movement and access to health services, introduced severe challenges to chronic disease management. The era that will evolve after this pandemic is likely to provide uncertainty and service model disruptions. HF treatment is based on guidelines derived from randomised clinical trial evidence. Translational shortfalls from trials into practice have been overcome with post-trial service improvement studies like OPTIMIZE-HF where a team using a process of care can translate evidence to the general population. However, gaps remain for vulnerable populations e.g. those with more severe HF, with multiple comorbid conditions, and certain demographic groups and/or residents in remote locations. Health technology has come with great promise, to fill some of these gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to observe, from Australian healthcare lens, HF management outside the traditional model of care. This narrative review describes relatively recent events with health technology as a solution to improve on service gaps.","Satici, Sakine; Iyngkaran, Pupalan; Andrew, Sharon; Patil, Arun; Bidargaddi, Niranjan; Battersby, Malcolm; De Courten, Maximilian",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2021.01.272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792252/,93

Likewise, other habits, such as physical activity or sleeping hours have also been modified. OBJECTIVES the objective of this work was to evaluate the changes occurred in eating and lifestyle habits among the adult Galician population during the confinement period ordered in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS a survey was conducted using Microsoft Forms, and spread among the population using an instant messaging service for mobiles through the internet. RESULTS a total of 1350 Galician adults completed the questionnaire; mean of age was 63.2 ± 8.1 years, 30 % were men, and 70 % were women. The obtained data show a trend towards consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and a decrease in less healthy ones such as processed foods. In total, 46 % of the population reported they were eating more than before the confinement, with an increase in snacking between meals (54 %) and in anxiety about food due to situations of stress or nervousness bieng reported by 40 % of respondents. This has resulted in an increase in body weight, reported by 44 % of participants, with the average gain being 2.8 ± 1.5 kg. CONCLUSIONS during confinement, the eating and lifestyle habits of the Galician population have been modified. The weight gain observed in a population that already had a high level of overweight and obesity at confinement onset aggravates the present situation and may have a negative impact on the development of chronic, non-communicable.","Sinisterra Loaiza, Laura Isabel; Vázquez Belda, Beatriz; Miranda López, José Manuel; Cepeda, Alberto; Cardelle Cobas, Alejandra",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155474/,93

Various methods for determining infarct volume have been used in clinical studies. We evaluated the effectiveness of several methods for measuring infarct volume, especially regarding futile outcomes despite endovascular treatment.Patients with acute ischemic stroke in unilateral anterior circulation territory who were treated with intra-arterial thrombectomy were included. For assessing infarct volume, the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) scoring system was applied to images obtained by noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT), postcontrast CT (PCCT), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DWI stroke volume was semiquantitatively measured with the manually outlined hyperintense lesion. Infarct core volume was calculated with a threshold apparent diffusion coefficient value of 600 × 10 mm/s. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were estimated to assess inter-reader reliability for ASPECTS scoring and DWI stroke volume. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, and univariable and multivariable comparative analyses, were performed with each evaluation method to predict futile outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 5-6).The mean age of the included 79 patients was 65.1 ± 15.7 years. Among them, 55 (69.6%) patients demonstrated successful reperfusion after intra-arterial thrombectomy, but 34 (43.0%) patients had futile outcomes. Inter-reader agreement was excellent for measurement of the DWI stroke volume (ICC, 0.973), DWI ASPECTS (0.940), and PCCT ASPECTS (0.859), but was moderate for NCCT ASPECTS (0.694). Regarding prediction of futile outcomes, area under ROC curve was 0.551 on NCCT ASPECTS and it was significantly smaller than that in PCCT ASPECTS (area under ROC 0.651, P = 0.030), DWI ASPECTS (0.733, P = 0.003), DWI stroke volume (0.702, P = 0.022), and infarct core volume (0.702, P = 0.021). Besides old age and high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission, MRI parameters such as DWI ASPECTS and infarct core volume indicating large volumes were independently associated with futile outcomes in multivariable analyses.DWI ASPECTS can be a good parameter predicting futility, which is easily measured and has high prediction power.","Han, Miran; Choi, Jin Wook; Rim, Nae-Jung; Kim, Sun Yong; Suh, Hong-Il; Lee, Kyu Sun; Hong, Ji Man; Lee, Jin Soo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000004702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27583902/,93

Porcine xenografts are viable alternatives but undergo α-1,3-galactose (Gal)-mediated hyperacute rejection and are lost by post-operative day (POD) 3 because of naturally occurring antibodies to Gal in primate recipients. Using baboons, we previously demonstrated that xenografts from GalT-KO swine (lacking Gal) provided wound coverage comparable with allografts with systemic immunosuppression. In this study, we investigate topical immunosuppression as an alternative to prolong xenograft survival. Full-thickness wounds in baboons were created and covered with xenogeneic and allogeneic split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Animals were treated with slow-release (TyroSphere-encapsulated) topical formulations (cyclosporine-A [CSA] or Tacrolimus) applied 1) directly to the STSGs only, or 2) additionally to the wound bed before STSG and 1). Topical CSA did not improve either xenograft or allograft survival (median: treated grafts = 12.5 days, control = 14 days; P = 0.27) with similar results when topical Tacrolimus was used. Pretreatment of wound beds resulted in a significant reduction of xenograft survival compared with controls (10 vs 14 days; P = 0.0002), with comparable results observed in allografts. This observation was associated with marked reduction of inflammation on histology with Tacrolimus and not CSA. Prolongation of allograft and xenograft survival after application to full-thickness wound beds was not achieved with the current formulation of topical immunosuppressants. Modulation of inflammation within the wound bed was effective with Tacrolimus pretreatment before STSG application and may serve as a treatment strategy in related fields.","Mastroianni, Melissa; Ng, Zhi Yang; Goyal, Ritu; Mallard, Christopher; Farkash, Evan A; Leonard, David A; Albritton, Alexander; Shanmugarajah, Kumaran; Kurtz, Josef M; Sachs, David H; Macri, Lauren K; Kohn, Joachim; Cetrulo, Curtis L",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0000000000000597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28639977/,93

We have established and interrogated a database of around 70,000 naturally processed MHC-bound peptides and demonstrate that cysteine-containing peptides are presented on the surface of cells in an MHC allomorph-dependent manner and comprise on average 5-10% of the immunopeptidome. A significant proportion of these peptides are oxidatively modified, most commonly through covalent linkage with the antioxidant glutathione. Unlike some of the previously reported cysteine-based modifications, this represents a true physiological alteration of cysteine residues. Furthermore, our results suggest that alterations in the cellular redox state induced by viral infection are communicated to the immune system through the presentation of S-glutathionylated viral peptides, resulting in altered T cell recognition. Our data provide a structural basis for how the glutathione modification alters recognition by virus-specific T cells.

Az elmúlt hónapokban életünket alapvetően megváltoztatta a COVID-19-pandémia, melynek egészségügyi, gazdasági és társadalmi hatásai egyelőre szinte felbecsülhetetlenek. A vírusfertőzés akut következményei mellett egyre több adat bizonyítja a teljes népességre kifejtett hatásait: a pszichológiai distressz, a depressziós és szorongásos tünetek, valamint az addiktív viselkedésformák gyakoriságának növekedését. Az is nagyon fontos kérdés, hogy a globális válsághelyzet hogyan befolyásolja az öngyilkossági arányszámokat. Írásomban az elmúlt időszak legjelentősebb pszichiátriai szakirodalma alapján foglalom össze a vírusfertőzés akut és krónikus hatásait, valamint a járványhelyzet általános és specifikus pszichológiai-pszichopatológiai következményeit, kiemelt figyelmet fordítva a suicidiumrizikóra és a leginkább veszélyeztetett csoportokra. A vizsgálatok arra utalnak, hogy a pandémia következtében kialakuló mentális gondok és a suicid viselkedés egyre fontosabb népegészségügyi problémává válnak. Bár napjainkban még a vírusfertőzöttek gyógyítása és a fertőzés terjedésének lassítása a legfontosabb cél, mindannyiunknak fel kell készülnünk a járvány hosszú távú következményeire. A pandémia várható negatív mentálhigiénés hatásainak megelőzésére és enyhítésére általános és specifikus módszerek kidolgozása és alkalmazása szükséges. Ebben az egészségügyi, mentálhigiénés és közösségi ellátórendszerek mellett szerepet kell vállalniuk a politikai és gazdasági döntéshozóknak, a társadalmi szervezeteknek és a média munkatársainak is.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

It is shown that all of these parameters directly influence the silica-condensation kinetics. Concerning films with the 2D-hexagonal structure belonging to the CTAB-water phase diagram, the mesophase is mainly stabilized by interactions between cylindrical micelles, and the reactivity of the silica sol does not drastically modify the extent of the order in films. In contrast, the formation of a rigid silica network just after the micellar organization appears to be crucial to prepare well-organized films with the 3D-hexagonal or the cubic transient structure. In the latter case, the size and reactivity of silica clusters have to be controlled to obtain rapid gelation in the deposited sol.","Matheron, Muriel; Gacoin, Thierry; Boilot, Jean-Pierre",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b612408a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680269/,93

The objective of this study was to examine mental health symptoms among US adults in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in late March 2020 with a national sample of 963 US adults using an online research platform. Participants self-reported state of residence, psychosocial characteristics, and levels of anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive function, and fatigue in the context of COVID-19 using validated patient-reported outcomes scales in the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System measures. We used analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression to evaluate correlates of mental health symptoms. RESULTS Overall, participants reported high levels of anxiety (mean [SD], 57.2 [9.3]) and depression (mean [SD], 54.2 [9.5]). Levels of anger, anxiety, cognitive function, depression, and fatigue were significantly higher among the Millennial Generation and Generation X (vs Baby Boomers), those with not enough or enough (vs more than enough) financial resources, females vs males), those with self-reported disability (vs no self-reported disability), and those with inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy. In adjusted models, being in Generation X and the Millennial Generation (vs Baby Boomer), having not enough or enough vs more than enough) financial resources, and having inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy were most strongly correlated with worse mental health symptoms.

We developed risk prediction models to identify patients with low risk for COVID-19 from this cohort of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory symptoms. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients admitted to our institution's respiratory surveillance wards from 10 February to 30 April 2020 contributed data for analysis. Prediction models for COVID-19 were derived from a training cohort using variables based on demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure risks and blood investigations fitted into logistic regression models. The derived prediction models were subsequently validated on a test cohort. RESULTS Of the 1,228 patients analysed, 52 (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Two prediction models were derived, the first based on age, presence of sore throat, dormitory residence, blood haemoglobin level (Hb), and total white blood cell counts (TW), and the second based on presence of headache, contact with infective patients, Hb and TW. Both models had good diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 and 0.866, respectively. Risk score cut-offs of 0.6 for Model 1 and 0.2 for Model 2 had 100% sensitivity, allowing identification of patients with low risk for COVID-19. Limiting COVID-19 screening to only elevated-risk patients reduced the number of isolation days for surveillance patients by up to 41.7% and COVID-19 swab testing by up to 41.0%.

Although arrhythmia characterization and possible predictors were previously reported, there are conflicting data regarding the exact prevalence of arrhythmias. Clinically applicable algorithms to classify COVID patients' arrhythmic risk are still lacking, and are the aim of our study. METHODS We describe a single center cohort of hospitalized patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 during the initial Israeli outbreak between 1/2/2020 -30/5/2020. The study's outcome was any documented arrhythmia during hospitalization, based on daily physical examination, routine ECG's, periodic 24-hour Holter, and continuous monitoring. Multivariate analysis was used to find predictors for new arrhythmias and create classification trees for discriminating patients with high and low arrhythmic risk. RESULTS Out of 390 COVID-19 patients included, 28 (7.2%) had documented arrhythmias during hospitalization, including: 23 atrial tachyarrhythmias, combined atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia storm, and 3 bradyarrhythmias. Only 7/28 patients had previous arrhythmias. Our study showed significant correlation between disease severity and arrhythmia prevalence (p<0.001) with a low arrhythmic prevalence among mild disease patients (2%). Multivariate analysis revealed background heart failure (CHF) and disease severity are independently associated with overall arrhythmia while age, CHF, disease severity, and arrhythmic symptoms are associated with tachyarrhythmias. A novel decision tree using age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels was created to stratify patients into high and low risk for developing arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS Dominant arrhythmia among COVID-19 patients is AF. Arrhythmia prevalence is associated with age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels. A novel simple Classification tree, based on these parameters, can discriminate between high and low arrhythmic risk patients.","Rav-Acha, Moshe; Orlev, Amir; Itzhaki, Itay; Zimmerman, Shmuel F; Fteiha, Bashar; Bohm, Davina; Kurd, Ramzi; Samuel, Tal Y; Asher, Elad; Helviz, Igal; Glikson, Michael; Michowitz, Yoav",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128270/,93

102684,Histone mimics: more tales to read.,2021-07-30,"Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, knowledge transfer from pretrained models showed outstanding performance in medical image classification. However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this article, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, which we called self-supervised super sample decomposition for transfer learning (4S-DT) model. The 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabeled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition (CD) layer to simplify the local structure of the data. The 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream CD mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabeled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. The 4S-DT has achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% on the larger of the two datasets used in the experimental study and an accuracy of 97.54% on the smaller dataset, which was enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed M; Gaber, Mohamed Medhat",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3082015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038371/,93

DESIGN Time series analyses using cross-sectional annual data from the Telephone Surveillance System (VIGITEL 2008-2019). Food consumption was evaluated through: (1) consumption of five or more portions of fruits and vegetables in ≥5 d/week; (2) consumption of beans in ≥5 d/week and (3) consumption of soft drinks or artificial juices in ≥5 d/week. Absolute inequality was assessed by the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative inequality by the concentration index (CIX). SII and CIX positive values indicate higher prevalence among more educated citizens and negative among less educated ones. Time trend was assessed by linear regression using weighted least squares. SETTING 26 Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. PARTICIPANTS 621 689 individuals ≥18 years. RESULTS Fruits and vegetable consumption was more prevalent among the more educated citizens, while beans were mostly consumed by the less educated, and soft drinks or artificial juices was more prevalent among individuals with intermediate education. The highest absolute inequality was found for beans (SII2019 -25·9). In 12 years, the absolute inequality increased for fruit and vegetable consumption (from SII2008 12·8 to SII2019 16·2), remained for beans (SII2008 -23·1 to SII2019 -25·9) and reduced for soft drinks or artificial juices (SII2008 8·7 to SII2019 0·4). Relative inequality was low and constant. CONCLUSION Despite the advances reducing inequalities in soft drinks or artificial juice consumption, the increase in the social gap for adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is troublesome.","Crepaldi, Barbara Virginia Caixeta; Okada, Letícia Martins; Rauber, Fernanda; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Azeredo, Catarina Machado",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021002950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407905/,93

Thus, it is of great significance. The use of sutures in some human organs, such as the intestines and bladder, is inadequate because fluid leakage occurs due to the presence of pinholes. Methods Three types of large intestine wounds with an opening of about 1 cm were investigated. They were untreated, treated by needle and threaded, and treated by hand-held electrospinning, respectively. Results The results show that hand-held electrospinning technique effectively prevented the exudation of fluids in the intestinal tract. The average diameter of the nanofibrous membrane was about 0.5 μm with hole of several micrometers. It can be elongated 90% without breakage. The hand-held electrospinning device could be used with nitrile gloves, preventing the risk of infection caused by exposed hands. Discussion This work can provide a reference for future animal experiments and clinical experiments. However, safety should be investigated before application.","Zhou, Tongtong; Wang, Yaozhong; Lei, Fengcai; Yu, Jing",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s241909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764920/,93

Reviewing the United States Environmental Protection Agency Lead and Copper rule data can contribute to guiding future legislation on Pb testing. This work aims to (i) identify variations in Pb levels in North Carolina school and child care drinking water by building age, (ii) evaluate the effect of corrosion control measures on reducing these levels, and (iii) evaluate the adequacy of Pb reporting limits according to modern instrumentation. To achieve these objectives, information on 26,608 water samples collected in 206 North Carolina child centers between 1991 and 2019 has been analyzed. Lead concentrations were above a recently proposed 5 μg/L trigger level in 12.3%, 10.4%, 7.5%, and 0.9% of samples from pre-1987, 1987-1990, 1991-2013, and post-2013 buildings, respectively. Thus, recently proposed legislation requiring testing only for pre-1987 (or pre-1991) buildings will fail to identify all centers at risk. The odds that a greater than 5 μg/L Pb level is detected has been decreasing over the years, with a faster decreasing rate for buildings reporting corrosion control. Over 15% of samples report a method detection limit of 5 μg/L. For accurate results, future legislation should require sub-μg/L detection limits, which are easily achievable with commonly available instrumentation.","Carter, Jake A; Erhardt, Robert J; Jones, Bradley T; Donati, George L",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c04316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138370/,93

This study aims to explore the causes, clinical findings and prognosis of biopsy-proven LC in infants, toddlers and preschoolers. We enrolled young children with biopsy-proven cirrhosis from January 2010. Till January 2020, the study has been going on for 10 years. A total of 139 cirrhotic children were enrolled, including 87 boys and 52 girls. The median age at initially histological diagnosis of cirrhosis was 2 years old (range: 1 month-6 years). Sixty-two patients reported yellowish discoloration of sclera and/or skin as an initial symptom. Ninety-three patients had definite etiologies while 46 had indeterminate causes. Among the confirmed cases, 31 had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, accounting for 33.3%. Subsequently, glycogen storage disease was diagnosed in 16 cases and Wilson disease in 14 cases. In these patients with HBV infection, 9 finally achieved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss (29.0%) after effective antiviral therapy during the follow-up. Logistic regression revealed that baseline alanine aminotransferase (odds ratio 1.008, P=0.028) was the independent predictor of HBsAg loss. Furthermore, 1 patient who underwent second biopsies showed histological reverse. HBV infection is an important cause of paediatric cirrhosis in our study.

We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating utilization of telehealth for prenatal care in a large academic practice in New York City, comparing women with public and private insurance. We found that patients with public insurance were less likely to have at least one telehealth visit than women with private insurance (60.9 vs. 87.3%, p < 0.001). After stratifying by borough, this difference remained significant in Brooklyn, one of the boroughs hardest hit by the pandemic.

A systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Scopus, Embase and OpenGrey from inception to May 2020 to find all eligible studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine this correlation. A random-effects model was applied in this meta-analysis due to significant statistical heterogeneity among included studies. Overall, 10 eligible studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis, and results of the present meta-analysis indicated that maternal cadmium exposure is associated with the risk of PTB (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.08-1.61).

During this challenging period, nearly all major societies have recommended for conservative approach, even for patients with relatively stable acute cardiovascular diseases. Selection of specific antiplatelet therapy in an uncomplicated post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patient can, at times, be crucial issue in such strained circumstances. We report a case of 64-year-old male, who was taken for urgent coronary angiogram (CAG) in view of non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Successful PCI with implantation of drug eluting stent was done for right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending (LAD) artery lesions. On day 5th post-PCI, he developed acute inferior wall STEMI due to subacute stent thrombosis (ST), and despite all efforts, patient could not be saved as he didn't receive timely intervention. Increased travel time to emergency department due to lockdown because of COVID-19 and along with extra time required for donning of personal protection equipment (PPE) and other COVID-19 related safety measures prolonged the ischemic time. Potent P2Y12 inhibitor based dual antiplatelet therapy might have prevented this subacute ST, and thus mortality, as the patient was discharged on clopidogrel after PCI. While selecting specific P2Y12 inhibitor in a post PCI patient, apart from clinical condition of patient and complexity of procedure, we should also consider current COVID-19 pandemic. Current circumstances may favour ticagrelor over other P2Y12 inhibitors in view of its potent, rapid, and reversible antiplatelet action along with its optimistic effect in pneumonia.","Choudhary, Rahul; Kaushik, Atul; Sharma, Jai Bharat",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt-20-485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968646/,93

A precise prognostic tool to identify poor outcomes among such cases is desperately needed. METHODS Total 400 COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions were retrospectively recruited from 4 centers, including 54 dead cases (labeled as poor outcomes) and 346 patients discharged or hospitalized for at least 7 days since initial CT scan. Patients were allocated to a training set (n = 271), a test set (n = 68), and an external test set (n = 61). We proposed an initial CT-derived hybrid model by combining a 3D-ResNet10 based deep learning model and a quantitative 3D radiomics model to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients reaching poor outcome. The model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), survival analysis, and subgroup analysis. RESULTS The hybrid model achieved AUCs of 0.876 (95% confidence interval: 0.752-0.999) and 0.864 (0.766-0.962) in test and external test sets, outperforming other models. The survival analysis verified the hybrid model as a significant risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 2.049 [1.462-2.871], P < 0.001) that could well stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk of reaching poor outcomes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The hybrid model that combined deep learning and radiomics could accurately identify poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions from initial CT scans. The great risk stratification ability could help alert risk of death and allow for timely surveillance plans.","Wang, Siwen; Dong, Di; Li, Liang; Li, Hailin; Bai, Yan; Hu, Yahua; Huang, Yuanyi; Yu, Xiangrong; Liu, Sibin; Qiu, Xiaoming; Lu, Ligong; Wang, Meiyun; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3076086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905341/,93

However, less is known regarding the longitudinal association between anemia and deterioration of kidney function among the general population. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a nationally representative survey for households with members aged ≥ 45 years. Participants without creatinine and demographic data in 2011 and 2015 were excluded. Anemia was defined according to definitions of the World Health Organization. Rapid decline in kidney function was defined as a ≥16.9% (quartile 3) decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the CKD-EPI equation during 2011-2015. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic splines were used to explore their relationship. Altogether, 7210 eligible participants were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 8.8 years. Rapid decline in kidney function occurred among 1802 (25.0%) participants. Those with kidney function decline were more likely to be older, male, and have anemia, lower eGFRs, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (P < 0.05). Anemia, or hemoglobin, was independently associated with rapid decline in kidney function after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.32-2.04; OR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.87-0.94, respectively). Restricted cubic splines showed a nonlinear relationship between hemoglobin and rapid decline in kidney function, especially for men with anemia (P < 0.05). In conclusion, anemia is an independent risk factor for progression of kidney function among the middle-aged and elderly population. Attentive management and intervention strategies targeting anemia could be effective to reduce the risk of kidney failure and improve the prognosis of the general population.","Yang, Chao; Meng, Qinqin; Wang, Huaiyu; Wang, Yafeng; Su, Zaiming; Liu, Lili; Liu, Wenwen; Kong, Guilan; Zhang, Luxia; Zhao, Yaohui; Zhao, Ming-Hui",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2303541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083456/,93

A 'gold-standard' investigation has not yet been identified for detection and monitoring. Initially, computed tomography (CT) was the mainstay investigation as it shows the disease severity and recovery, and its images change at different stages of the disease. However, CT has been found to have limited sensitivity and negative predictive value in the early stages of the disease, and the value of its use has come under debate due to whether its images change the treatment plan, the risk of radiation, as well as its practicality with infection control. Therefore, there has been a shift to the use of other imaging modalities and tests, such as chest X-rays and ultrasound. Furthermore, the use of nucleic acid-based testing such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have proven useful with direct confirmation of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aim to review and analyse current literature to compare RT-PCR, immunological biomarkers, chest radiographs, ultrasound and chest CT scanning as methods of diagnosing COVID-19.","Harahwa, Tinotenda A; Lai Yau, Thomas Ho; Lim-Cooke, Mae-Sing; Al-Haddi, Salah; Zeinah, Mohamed; Harky, Amer",Diagnosis,https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2020-0058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621728/,93

112797,Textually mediated discourses in Canadian news stories: Situating nurses' salaries as the problem.,2018,"Supplementary lighting is frequently applied in the winter season for crop production in greenhouses. The effect of supplementary lighting on plant growth depends on the balance between assimilate production in source leaves and the overall capacity of the plants to use assimilates. This study aims at quantifying the source-sink balance and carbohydrate content of three tomato cultivars differing in fruit size, and to investigate to what extent the source/sink ratio correlates with the potential fruit size. Cultivars Komeet (large size), Capricia (medium size), and Sunstream (small size, cherry tomato) were grown from 16 August to 21 November, at similar crop management as in commercial practice. Supplementary lighting (High Pressure Sodium lamps, photosynthetic active radiation at 1 m below lamps was 162 μmol photons m(-2) s(-1); maximum 10 h per day depending on solar irradiance level) was applied from 19 September onward. Source strength was estimated from total plant growth rate using periodic destructive plant harvests in combination with the crop growth model TOMSIM. Sink strength was estimated from potential fruit growth rate which was determined from non-destructively measuring the fruit growth rate at non-limiting assimilate supply, growing only one fruit on each truss. Carbohydrate content in leaves and stems were periodically determined. During the early growth stage, 'Komeet' and 'Capricia' showed sink limitation and 'Sunstream' was close to sink limitation. During this stage reproductive organs had hardly formed or were still small and natural irradiance was high (early September) compared to winter months. Subsequently, during the fully fruiting stage all three cultivars were strongly source-limited as indicated by the low source/sink ratio (average source/sink ratio from 50 days after planting onward was 0.17, 0.22, and 0.33 for 'Komeet,' 'Capricia,' and 'Sunstream,' respectively). This was further confirmed by the fact that pruning half of the fruits hardly influenced net leaf photosynthesis rates. Carbohydrate content in leaves and stems increased linearly with the source/sink ratio. We conclude that during the early growth stage under high irradiance, tomato plants are sink-limited and that the level of sink limitation differs between cultivars but it is not correlated with their potential fruit size. During the fully fruiting stage tomato plants are source-limited and the extent of source limitation of a cultivar is positively correlated with its potential fruit size.","Li, Tao; Heuvelink, Ep; Marcelis, Leo F M",Frontiers in plant science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26097485/,93

CT angiography in both patients demonstrated thrombus within a middle cerebral artery M2 branch. In both cases the occluded artery was not visualized on DSA and only the proximal tip of the clot could be seen as a filling defect ""hanging"" into the parent artery reminiscent of a ""tip of an iceberg"". Rather than selectively catheterizing the occluded branch we placed the stent retriever in the patent parent artery crossing only the tip of the clot. In both cases one pass of the stent retriever was sufficient to retrieve the whole clot by its tip and reopen the occluded branch. We suggest trying this technique whenever the clot is seated in the proximal part of a secondary branch such as an M2 segment of middle cerebral artery. This ""tip of the iceberg"" technique prevents the need to selectively catheterize the occluded branch which, if difficult, can prolong procedural and ischemic time.","Agid, Ronit; Power, Sarah","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915609123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26472639/,93

We hypothesized that in diabetic patients undergoing pulmonary resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, metformin exposure is associated with improved survival. METHODS An institutional database was used to identify patients with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 2004 and 2013. Patients were divided into 3 cohorts: type II diabetic patients with metformin exposure (cohort A, n = 81), type II diabetic patients without metformin exposure (cohort B, n = 57), and nondiabetic individuals (cohort C, n = 77). Univariate, multivariate, and propensity-matched analyses were performed to assess progression-free and overall survivals between groups. RESULTS A total of 215 patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer treated with surgical resection were identified for analysis with a median follow-up of 19.5 months. Patients in cohort A had lower T- and N-stage tumors than those in cohorts B or C. However, on multivariate analysis adjusting for age, gender, and T and N stage, progression-free survival was greater for cohort A than cohort B (hazard ratio [HR], 0.410; 95% confidence interval, 0.199-0.874; P = .022) or cohort C (HR, 0.415; 95% confidence interval, 0.201-0.887; P = .017). Likewise, when propensity-matched analyses were performed, cohort A demonstrated a trend toward improved progression-free survival compared with cohort B (P = .057; HR, 0.44; c-statistic = 0.832) and improved progression-free survival compared with cohort C (P = .02; HR, 0.41; c-statistic = 0.843). No differences were observed in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Metformin exposure in diabetic patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer may be associated with improved progression-free survival, but no effect was seen on overall survival.

Proximity labeling utilizes enzymes that generate reactive radicals to covalently tag neighboring proteins. The tagged endogenous proteins can then be isolated for further analysis by MS. To analyze protein-protein interactions or identify components that localize to discrete subcellular compartments, spatial expression is achieved by fusing the enzyme to specific proteins or signal peptides that target to particular subcellular regions. Although these technologies have only been introduced recently, they have already provided deep insights into a wide range of biological processes.

In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic. Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.","Bai, S L; Wang, J Y; Zhou, Y Q; Yu, D S; Gao, X M; Li, L L; Yang, F",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2020.0005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32064855/,93

The present study therefore attempts to assess the implications of entire eco-restoration model as practiced by Department of Forest, Government of Uttarakhand in 2019. Its assessment was done by calculating restoration success index by way of considering three categories, viz., direct management measure (M), environmental desirability (E) and socio-economic feasibility (SE) considering 22 individual variables. 'M' comprised both biotic and abiotic pressures. Grazing and tourism were biotic, while abiotic pressure was considered mainly soil erosion in alpine area due to topographic fragility. Above ground vegetation profile and below ground soil nutrient profile (N, P, K, pH and water holding capacity) were analyzed in 'E' component. In the last but not least, 'SE' was analyzed to assess the social acceptability of the local communities and stakeholders who are supposed to be ultimate beneficiary of alike interventions. Direct management measure was found with the variable index score of 0.8 indicating the higher score as compared to environmental desirability (0.56). Under direct management measure, grazing and tourists' carrying capacity of the area was analyzed with high management needs to call the region sustainable in terms of availability of bio-resources. The ecosystem index score was evaluated for the reference (81.94), treated (64.5) and untreated zones (52.03), wherein increasing profile of these values were found. The outcomes like improved vegetation profile in terms of total herb density, soil nutrient profile of the restored area along with soil pH (4.96) and water holding capacity (49.85%) were found to be restored significantly along with controlling 169.64 tonne year-1 soil erosion from draining. The assessment of grazing pattern of 118 migratory Cow Unit (CU) (76 horse/mule and 18 sheep/goat, already controlled), 318 local CU (30 horse/mule and 187 sheep/goat) were calculated and recommended to be controlled. Tourists' carrying capacity of 274 tourists per day and manual removal of Rumex nepalensis at the shepherd camping site were found to be worth to apply in the area. Use of biodegradable but locally sourced material and engaging local villagers in this endeavor were also found to be in harmony with SDG Goal 1 (no poverty). Therefore, the restoration and its evaluation model could have its future prospects to prove as a successful restoration practice. This restoration practice could not only be worth in high altitude degraded alpine pastures of the Indian Himalayan Region but also to other mountain alpine and sub-alpine ecosystems.","Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra; Maiti, Priyanka; Kumar, Sandeep; Kumar, Anand; Bisht, Nisha; Sekar, K Chandra; Arya, Satish Chandra; Rai, Sumit; Nand, Mahesha",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95472-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400660/,93

METHODS A 14-item cross-sectional survey about ethical/professional issues in dermatopathology was distributed over e-mail to members of the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) from June to September 2019. RESULTS Two hundred sixteen surveys were completed, with a response rate of 15.3%. Respondents ranked appropriate and fair utilization of healthcare resources (n=83 or 38.6%) as the most often encountered ethical/professional issue. Conflict of interest was ranked as the most urgent or important ethical/professional issue (n=83 or 39.3%). One hundred thirty-three (61.6%) respondents felt ""somewhat"" or ""not at all"" well equipped to handle ethical dilemmas in practice and 47 (22.8%) respondents identified a major or extreme burden (e.g. have considered resigning/retiring) due to ethical challenges.

To date, only a few long-term functional studies and no quality of life assessment are available. The aim of this study was to assess long-term functional outcomes and quality of life after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2008, patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for full-thickness external rectal prolapse and/or rectocele were prospectively included. Fecal incontinence and constipation were scored (Wexner score and Rome II criteria). Quality of life was assessed using the gastrointestinal quality of life form (GIQLI). RESULTS Thirty-three patients were included and 30 (91 %) completed all the questionnaires. There was no morbidity or mortality. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 ± 1 days (range 3-7 days). After a mean follow-up of 42 ± 7 months (range 32-52 months), recurrence of rectocele was observed in two patients (6 %). At the end of follow-up, constipation was improved in 13/18 patients (72 %) and two patients (7 %) presented de novo constipation. The patients' Wexner score improved between preoperative status and end of follow-up (12 ± 7 vs. 4 ± 3, p = 0.002). Compared to the preoperative score, quality of life significantly improved over time: 77 ± 21 preoperatively versus 107 ± 17 at 1 year versus 109 ± 18 at the end of follow-up (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study showed that laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was associated with excellent postoperative outcomes and a low long-term recurrence rate. Long-term functional results were excellent in terms of continence, with significant improvement of quality of life and without worsening constipation.","Maggiori, L; Bretagnol, F; Ferron, M; Panis, Y",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-013-0973-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23345041/,93
117447,Taking Call.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent-supported aneurysm coiling has been utilized with increasing frequency over the past few years, particularly for addressing treatment of complex and wide-neck aneurysms. A sizable body of literature describing various experiences with stent-supported coiling now exists. The purpose of this research was to carry out a comprehensive literature survey of stent-supported aneurysm coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS A survey of papers reporting results with stent-assisted aneurysm coiling through January 2011 was conducted to identify the prevalence of stent-related and other complications, occlusion rates, and clinical and angiographic follow-up data. RESULTS Thirty-nine articles with 1517 patients met inclusion criteria for initial analysis, follow-up analysis, or both. Overall, 9% of cases were confounded by a technical stent-related issue, including 4% failure of deployment. The overall procedure complication rate was 19%, with periprocedural mortality of 2.1%. Approximately 45% of aneurysms were completely occluded at first treatment session, increasing to 61% on follow-up. Approximately 3.5% in-stent stenosis and 0.6% stent occlusion were observed at angiographic follow-up. Delayed stroke or transient ischemic attack was reported in 3% of subjects. Within a subset of articles, the incidence of stent-related issues in the first 10 patients was significantly higher than in subsequent subjects, supporting the notion of a procedural ""learning curve."" CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, the morbidity of stent-supported coiling is somewhat higher compared with ""traditional"" coiling. As might be expected, execution of the procedure appears improved with experience. Complete occlusion rates remain somewhat low. More and longer term angiographic follow-up information is needed to understand delayed stent-related issues and to better define the durability of treatment.","Shapiro, M; Becske, T; Sahlein, D; Babb, J; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

118276,Kinesiology taping does not change fibularis longus latency time and postural sway.,2016,"Proper simulation of processes of the natural gas industry such as dehydration, liquefaction and regasification require accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties of the working fluids. For such processes, cubic equations of state are the calculation methods most frequently employed. Among them, the Peng-Robinson equation is usually the one recommended for gas, refinery and petrochemical applications in many simulators. Numerous works have been proposed in order to improve the temperature dependence relation of the attraction parameter of the equation - the so called alpha function. In this work, five currently available alpha functions are evaluated for the prediction of molar volumes and enthalpies of natural gas samples. Additionally, parameters of one of the models are readjusted to volumetric data of methane, in order to represent its supercritical behavior more accurately. Experimental data of 44 mixtures are compared with calculated results. Van der Waals mixing rules are used, with binary interaction parameters set as zero. In the case of the original alpha function, it is also tested how the inclusion of non-zero binary parameters affects the predictions. The extended Saffari-Zahedi model presents the smallest average deviation for the molar volumes (1.35%). For the enthalpy calculation, the inclusion of the binary parameters results in deviation values of 2.62% for gas-gas transitions and 4.44% for gas-liquid transitions.","GonÇalves, AndrÉ F; Costa, AndrÉa O S DA; Costa Junior, Esly F DA",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,https://doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202020190603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263661/,93

METHODS We searched Pubmed and Embase between 15 January 2016 and 26 June 2019 for longitudinal studies comparing incident HIV infection among women using a hormonal contraceptive method and either non-users or users of another specific hormonal contraceptive method. We extracted information from newly identified studies, assessed study quality, and updated forest plots and meta-analyses. RESULTS In addition to 31 previously included studies, five more were identified; three provided higher quality evidence. A randomised clinical trial (RCT) found no statistically significant differences in HIV risk among users of intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), levonorgestrel implant (LNG implant) or the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD). An observational study found no statistically significant differences in HIV risk among women using DMPA, norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), implants (type not specified) or Cu-IUD. Updated results from a previously included observational study continued to find a statistically significant increased HIV risk with oral contraceptives and DMPA compared with no contraceptive use, and found no association between LNG implant and HIV risk. CONCLUSIONS High-quality RCT data comparing use of DMPA, LNG implant and Cu-IUD does not support previous concerns from observational studies that DMPA-IM use increases the risk of HIV acquisition. Use of other hormonal contraceptive methods (oral contraceptives, NET-EN and implants) is not associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition.","Curtis, Kathryn M; Hannaford, Philip C; Rodriguez, Maria Isabel; Chipato, Tsungai; Steyn, Petrus S; Kiarie, James N",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2019-200509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919239/,93

Fish were collected from the end of August to the middle of September in 2017 and 2019-2020 in the north part of Lake Teletskoye. For the 'benthivorous' form the prevalence, intensity and abundance of T. crassus ranged from 22.4% to 51.9%, 1.9-2.8 and 0.4-1.3, respectively, whereas the same indices for the 'planktivorous' form ranged from 94.7% to 97.5%, 4.2-4.8 and 4.0-4.7, respectively. The level of prevalence of infection and abundance of T. crassus in muscle was relatively stable among studied years for both forms. The level of prevalence was higher in the years 2019 and 2020 than in 2017 for the 'benthivorous' form, whereas for the 'planktivorous' form this index did not change during the studied years.

METHODS Between 2003 and 2008, 37 consecutive patients underwent 46 TEP repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operating time, conversion rate, intraoperative, postoperative complications and recurrence were measured. Twenty-eight patients had unilateral hernia and nine patients had bilateral hernias. The mean age was 59 years old (range 22-88 years). RESULTS The mean operation duration was 88 min (range 60-120 min). Bilateral repairs took 38% longer than for unilateral repairs (108 vs 78 min). Three patients (8.1%) had conversion to open surgery. Seroma developed in two patients, which was subsequently resolved. Within 1 year of follow up evaluation, there was 1 recurrence (2.7%). The mean inpatient hospital stay was 1.6 days, and 24.3% of the operations were performed as outpatients. CONCLUSION Repair of recurrent hernia using the TEP approach can be achieved with minimum morbidity, good clinical outcomes and acceptable recurrence rates.

Piran et al. reviewed its safety and efficacy for the first time in 2018. However, more studies have been published on the matter since then. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of this use and update this review. METHODS We systematically searched in Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from 1/1/2018 to 6/19/2020. A random effects model meta-analysis of proportions was used to study the efficacy of PCC on major bleeding control, mortality and thrombosis incidence. RESULTS 33 studies (n = 2568 patients), with the majority of studies being uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies, were included; atrial fibrillation was the main factor Xa inhibitors indication and approximately 62% of patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage. We estimated the pooled proportion outcomes for hemostasis (80%, CI 0.75-0.84), mortality (15%, CI 0.11-0.19) and thromboembolic adverse events (3%, CI 0.02-0.05). High versus low dose PCC did not affect hemostasis or thrombosis. Patients with ICH had higher mortality rates (22%, CI 0.13-0.32). Heterogeneity was significant (Ι2 > 50% with p < 0.05) for all pooled proportional outcomes. The quality of evidence was low given that included studies were not randomized or controlled. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the off label use of 4F PCC in major bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitors.

Methods We randomly selected 238 T2DM patients from a list of 2460 patients from the Jabber Abulizz Hospital. We interviewed them face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the determinants of KAP regarding the recommended diets for T2DM patients. Results Majority of the patients demonstrated good knowledge (54.6%), positive attitude (79%); and good practice (58%). The result revealed that patients with formal education had 3.0 (95% CI: 1.6-5.7) times higher odds of having good diabetic dietary knowledge than those with informal education. While patients who had good knowledge and a positive attitude were respectively 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4-8.9) and 3.2 (95% CI: 1.5-6.7) times more likely to follow dietary recommendations than the patients with poor knowledge and negative attitudes.

This study examines the feasibility, safety and incisional hernia rate of the use of a prophylactic intraperitoneal onlay mesh stripe (IPOM) to prevent incisional hernia following midline laparotomy. METHODS This prospective, randomized controlled trial randomly allocated patients undergoing median laparotomy either to mass closure of the abdominal wall with a PDS-loop running suture reinforced by an intraperitoneal composite mesh stripe (Group A) or to the same procedure without the additional mesh stripe (Group B). Primary endpoint was the incidence of incisional hernias at 2 years following midline laparotomy. Secondary endpoints are were the feasibility, the safety of the mesh stripe implantation including postoperative pain, and the incidence of incisional hernias at 5 years. RESULTS A total of 267 patients were included in this study. Follow-up data 2 years after surgery was available from 210 patients (Group A = 107; Group B = 103). An incisional hernia was diagnosed in 18/107 (17%) patients in Group A and in 40/103 (39%) patients in Group B (p < 0.001). A surgical operation due to an incisional hernia was conducted for 12/107 (11%) patients in Group A and for 24/103 (23%) patients in Group B (p = 0.039). In both groups, minor and major complications as well as postoperative pain are reported with no statistically significant difference between the groups, even in contaminated situations.

We previously reported the identification of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene encoding β-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6) as the initial P450 gene in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. In this study, a second relevant P450 (CYP72A154) was identified and shown to be responsible for C-30 oxidation in the glycyrrhizin pathway. CYP72A154 expressed in an engineered yeast strain that endogenously produces 11-oxo-β-amyrin (a possible biosynthetic intermediate between β-amyrin and glycyrrhizin) catalyzed three sequential oxidation steps at C-30 of 11-oxo-β-amyrin supplied in situ to produce glycyrrhetinic acid, a glycyrrhizin aglycone. Furthermore, CYP72A63 of Medicago truncatula, which has high sequence similarity to CYP72A154, was able to catalyze C-30 oxidation of β-amyrin. These results reveal a function of CYP72A subfamily proteins as triterpene-oxidizing enzymes and provide a genetic tool for engineering the production of glycyrrhizin.","Seki, Hikaru; Sawai, Satoru; Ohyama, Kiyoshi; Mizutani, Masaharu; Ohnishi, Toshiyuki; Sudo, Hiroshi; Fukushima, Ery Odette; Akashi, Tomoyoshi; Aoki, Toshio; Saito, Kazuki; Muranaka, Toshiya",The Plant cell,https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.082685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128119/,93
126904,Requiem for impact factors and high publication charges.,2021-03-31,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this article is to report an alternative approach for the management of a distal aneurysm of superior mesenteric artery using direct percutaneous ultrasound-guided Onyx injection. METHODS We report a rare case of symptomatic superior mesenteric artery aneurysm. A 78-year-old man presents with pain and pulsating mass in the right umbilical region of the abdomen. The patient was treated by percutaneous ultrasound-guided Onyx injection after several failing transarterial embolization attempts. RESULTS The procedure was successful without any complication, and the patient wasdischarged to home the day after procedure. Follow-up at 60 months confirmed the complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac. Ultrasound-guided Onyx injection for distal superior mesenteric artery aneurysm could provide an alternative to transcatheter arterial embolization or open surgery. Anatomical assessment of collaterals and knowledge of abdomen anatomy could play important roles in preventing bowel ischemia and minimizing the risk of procedural complication. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided Onyx injection of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm is a feasible, effective, and cost-saving technique that can be used when endovascular approach is not possible or has failed.","Simoncini, Fabio; Mastrorilli, Davide; Mezzetto, Luca; Angrisano, Alessandro; Scorsone, Lorenzo; Bergamaschi, Gastone; Veraldi, Gian Franco",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/1708538120962880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028161/,93
127113,Ebola revisited: lessons in managing global epidemics.,2015,"AIMS To describe the neuropathological findings in two cases of fatal Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with neurological decline. METHODS Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed in both patients by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs antemortem. Coronial autopsies were performed on both patients and histological sampling of the brain was undertaken with a variety of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. RNAscope® in situ hybridisation (ISH) using the V-nCoV2019-S probe and RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was performed in paraffin-embedded brain tissue sampled from areas of pathology. RESULTS Case 1 demonstrated severe multifocal cortical infarction with extensive perivascular calcification and numerous megakaryocytes, consistent with a severe multi-territorial cerebral vascular injury. There was associated cerebral thrombotic microangiopathy. Case 2 demonstrated a brainstem encephalitis centred on the dorsal medulla and a subacute regional infarct involving the cerebellar cortex. In both cases ISH and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were negative in tissue sampled from the area of pathology. CONCLUSIONS Our case series adds calcifying cerebral cortical infarction with associated megakaryocytes and brainstem encephalitis to the spectrum of neuropathological findings that may contribute to the neurological decompensation seen in some COVID-19 patients. Viral RNA was not detected in post-mortem brain tissue, suggesting that these pathologies may not be a direct consequence of viral neuroinvasion and may represent para-infectious phenomena, relating to the systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable syndromes that both patients suffered.","Jensen, Melanie P; Le Quesne, John; Officer-Jones, Leah; Teodòsio, Ana; Thaventhiran, James; Ficken, Catherine; Goddard, Martin; Smith, Chris; Menon, David; Allinson, Kieren S J",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/nan.12662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895961/,93

127149,An estimation of undetected COVID cases in France.,2020-12-21,"COVID-19 case fatalities surged during the month of March 2020 in Italy, reaching over 10,000 by 28 March 2020. This number exceeds the number of fatalities in China (3,301) recorded from January to March, even though the number of diagnosed cases was similar (85,000 Italy vs. 80,000 China). Case Fatality Rates (CFR) could be somewhat unreliable because the estimation of total case numbers is limited by several factors, including insufficient testing and limitations in test kits and materials, such as NP swabs and PPE for testers. Sero prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities.","Rubino, Salvatore; Kelvin, Nikki; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Kelvin, David",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235086/,93
127170,Taste Masking Study Based on an Electronic Tongue: the Formulation Design of 3D Printed Levetiracetam Instant-Dissolving Tablets.,2021-05-11,"Human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are endemic respiratory pathogens and, while related, originated from independent zoonotic introductions. OC43 is in fact a host-range variant of the species Betacoronavirus-1, and more closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-its presumptive ancestor-and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). The β1-coronaviruses (β1CoVs) and HKU1 employ glycan-based receptors carrying 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia). Receptor binding is mediated by spike protein S, the main determinant of coronavirus host specificity. For BCoV, a crystal structure for the receptor-binding domain S1A is available and for HKU1 a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the complete S ectodomain. However, the location of the receptor-binding site (RBS), arguably the single-most important piece of information, is unknown. Here we solved the 3.0-Å crystal structure of PHEV S1A We then took a comparative structural analysis approach to map the β1CoV S RBS, using the general design of 9-O-Ac-Sia-binding sites as blueprint, backed-up by automated ligand docking, structure-guided mutagenesis of OC43, BCoV, and PHEV S1A, and infectivity assays with BCoV-S-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses. The RBS is not exclusive to OC43 and related animal viruses, but is apparently conserved and functional also in HKU1 S1A The binding affinity of the HKU1 S RBS toward short sialoglycans is significantly lower than that of OC43, which we attribute to differences in local architecture and accessibility, and which may be indicative for differences between the two viruses in receptor fine-specificity. Our findings challenge reports that would map the OC43 RBS elsewhere in S1A and that of HKU1 in domain S1B.","Hulswit, Ruben J G; Lang, Yifei; Bakkers, Mark J G; Li, Wentao; Li, Zeshi; Schouten, Arie; Ophorst, Bram; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Boons, Geert-Jan; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Huizinga, Eric G; de Groot, Raoul J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1809667116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679277/,93

Given that US blacks are socially and economically disadvantaged relative to whites, health disparities scholars expected that blacks would have shorter telomere length-a biomarker of cell aging-than whites. Yet the majority of studies have found that blacks have longer telomere length than whites. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 3,761; 28.3% non-Hispanic black, 71.7% non-Hispanic white), we found that leukocyte telomere length was 4.00% (95% CI: 1.12%, 6.87%) longer among blacks compared to whites in the full sample, but differences were greatest among those with lower SES (5.66%; 95% CI: 0.10%, 10.32%), intermediate among those with middle SES (4.14%; 95% CI: 0.05%, 8.24%), and smallest among those with higher SES (2.33%; 95% CI: -3.02%, 7.67%).

The goal of this study was to report on the area density, occurrence, and type of respiratory viruses on desks in primary school classrooms. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques were employed to measure nucleic acid area densities from a broad range of human adenoviruses and rhinoviruses, as well as coronavirus OC43, influenza A, and norovirus GI. Every two weeks, virus monitoring was conducted on the desks of four primary school classrooms in Colorado, USA, during the 2019 respiratory virus season. DNA and RNA from respiratory viruses and norovirus were recovered from more than 20% of the desks sampled; occurrence patterns that indicate a greater than 60% probability of encountering any virus, if more than five desks were occupied in a day. Rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were the most commonly detected viruses as judged by the composite of occurrence and number of gene copies recovered. Desktop adenosine triphosphate monitoring did not predict the recovery of viral genomic materials on desks. School desks can be commonly contaminated with respiratory viruses.

130073,The quality of diagnosis and triage advice provided by free online symptom checkers and apps in Australia.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be familial or secondary, which is often triggered by infection or malignancy. HLH therapy includes dexamethasone and etoposide. However, therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to treat macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), rheumatic sHLH. We report our experience with anakinra to treat patients with nonrheumatic secondary HLH (sHLH). PROCEDURE Six children were diagnosed with HLH from December 2014 to August 2016 and were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (6-10 mg/kg/day divided over four doses) with or without dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 /day). Therapy was either escalated or weaned based on clinical and laboratory response. RESULTS Five of six patients were treated with anakinra and dexamethasone, and one with anakinra alone due to active cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years (range 0.8-14.9 years). No pathogenic mutations associated with HLH were identified, but three of six possessed genetic variants of unknown significance. Infectious triggers were identified for four patients and two patients had malignancies. The average treatment duration was 8 weeks with 3.5-5.5 years of follow up. No patient needed escalation of therapy to include etoposide. All patients achieved remission. Anakinra was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. CONCLUSION Initial treatment with anakinra (with or without dexamethasone) is a feasible treatment alternative for patients with secondary HLH and may allow for avoidance of etoposide. We recommend early initiation of anakinra when HLH is suspected. A broader investigation of the use of anakinra as a first-line agent for HLH is ongoing.","Bami, Sakshi; Vagrecha, Anshul; Soberman, Danielle; Badawi, Mohamad; Cannone, Daniel; Lipton, Jeffrey M; Cron, Randy Q; Levy, Carolyn Fein",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725881/,93

This study investigated whether using anastomotic sealants (TissuCol(®), Histoacryl(®) Flex, and Duraseal(®)) prevents leakage in a rat peritonitis model. STUDY DESIGN Sixty-seven Wistar rats were divided into control and experimental groups (TissuCol, Histoacryl, and Duraseal groups). Peritonitis was induced 1 day before surgery with the cecal ligation puncture model. On day 0, colonic anastomosis was constructed with sutures and then sealed with no adhesive (control group) or one select adhesive (experimental groups). Bursting pressure, abscess formation, and adhesion severity were evaluated on day 3 or day 14. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD8, CD206, and iNOS were performed. RESULTS On day 3, bursting pressures of the TissuCol group (120.1 ± 25.3 mmHg), Histoacryl group (117.3 ± 20.2 mmHg), and Duraseal group (123.6 ± 35.4 mmHg) were significantly higher than the that of the control group (24.4 ± 31.7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Abscesses around the anastomosis were found in the control group (6/7) and Duraseal group (2/9) but not in the TissuCol group or Histoacryl group. A higher number of CD206+ cells (M2 macrophages), a lower number of iNOS+ cells (M1 macrophages), a higher M2/M1 index, and a higher CD4+/CD8+ index were seen at the anastomotic site in all experimental groups compared with the control group on day 3. On day 14, abscesses were only found in the control group. Adhesion severity in the Duraseal group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.001).

Critical to reducing waste is a clear understanding of why organs are not used: accurate metrics are essential to identify the extent and causes of waste but use of these measures as targets or comparators between units/jurisdictions must be done with caution as focus on any one measure may result in unintended adverse consequences. Comparison between centres or countries may be misleading because of variation in definitions, patient or graft characteristics. Two of the most challenging areas to improve appropriate deceased donor organ utilisation are appetite for risk and lack of validated tools to help identify an organ that will function appropriately. Currently the implanting surgeon is widely considered to be accountable for the use of a donated organ so guidelines must be clear to allow and support sensible decisions and recognition that graft failure or inadvertent disease transmission are not necessarily attributable to poor decision-making. Accepting an organ involves balancing risk and benefit for the potential recipient.

Data collection included recurrent and new-onset hernias, surgical site infection, 1-year and 2-year catheter survival. RESULTS In 23 patients, 27 hernia repairs combined with peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation were performed. Median age was 52 years (range, 30-85 years) and 18/23 (78%) patients were male. There were no recurrent hernias and no early surgical site infections. Daily flushing was regularly started on the 1st to 3rd postoperative day. Five patients (22%) developed hernias on other anatomical sites, which required hernia repair and perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 28-87 months), 96% of all implanted catheters were still working. CONCLUSION Hernia repair and simultaneous peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation are associated with no recurrent hernias, an early start of peritoneal dialysis, a very low postoperative morbidity and very high 1-year and 2-year catheter survival.","Horvath, P; Königsrainer, A; Mühlbacher, T; Thiel, K; Thiel, C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02086-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773549/,93

The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to evaluate the impact of receiving a TS for cancer survivors when compared to receiving standard care and to identify knowledge gaps to inform future research. METHODS A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature was undertaken from August 2018 to October 2018. Studies were included if participants (cancer survivors) were over 18 years of age and had received a TS, and if outcomes for TS could be separated from other survivorship interventions. The McMaster Critical Appraisal Tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. A narrative synthesis of the study outcomes was then conducted. RESULTS Seven studies (one prospective cohort and six cross-sectional studies) met the inclusion criteria. The impact of TS was assessed using widely varied outcomes in these studies. Overall, receipt of a TS was related to greater patient understanding and perception of the quality of care provided. However, caution is required when interpreting these results due to methodological limitations. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review found that TS may have a positive impact on patient understandings about and perceptions of cancer care. However, more robust research including perspectives of cancer survivors is required.

We compared rScO2 values during cardiac surgery in patients with or without new cerebral ischaemic lesions on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). We hypothesised patients with new cerebral lesions would have impaired tissue oxygenation reflected in their rScO2 values. METHODS NIRS and DWI data were collected in 152 elective cardiac surgery patients. Absolute rScO2 values, duration of desaturation below thresholds (baseline, 10%, and 20%), and accumulated cerebral desaturation load were compared between patients with or without new cerebral lesions on DWI. Primary outcome was time below 10% from rScO2 baseline. RESULTS The time below 10% from rScO2 baseline was significantly longer for patients with new cerebral lesions than for patients without [median (inter-quartile range): 11.0 (0.4; 37.5) min vs 1.8 inter-quartile range: (0.05; 20.9) min, P=0.02]. Furthermore, they had a higher accumulated desaturation load below baseline (P=0.02) and 10% below baseline (P=0.02). Finally, their absolute minimum rScO2 value was significantly lower (P=0.01). However, the frequency of patients with desaturation below 10% and 20% was comparable between patients with and without new cerebral lesions. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis did not identify a clear-cut critical threshold among the investigated rScO2 variables. CONCLUSIONS Use of NIRS identified significant group differences in rScO2 values between patients with or without new ischaemic lesions. However, a critical threshold could not be identified because of a high variation in NIRS values across both groups.

133124,Koebner Phenomenon Induced by Face Mask Ear Loops.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE Retrospective evaluation of our experience with the use of flow diverters (FD) for the endovascular treatment of direct carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae (diCCF). METHODS Between 2011 and 2015, 14 consecutive patients with 14 diCCF were treated with FD alone or in combination with other implants in a single institution. RESULTS A total of 21 sessions were performed in 14 patients. FD placement was technically successful in all cases without an adverse event. Patients were treated with FD alone (n = 5), FD and covered stents (n = 2), FD and coils (n = 7). A total of 59 FD (24 Pipeline Embolization Device, Medtronic; 35 p64 Flow Modulation Device, phenox), 291 coils, and 3 stent grafts were used. Three of 14 diCCF were completely occluded after the 1st session, a minor residual shunt was found in 7/14, and in the remaining 4/14 patients, the shunt volume was reduced significantly. The mean follow-up period encompassed 20 months. Additional treatment included transvenous coil occlusion (n = 3) and/or further FD deployment (n = 5). An asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion was encountered in 2 patients, related to an interruption of antiaggregation. At the last follow-up, 10/14 patients were free from ocular symptoms (71 %), 2 had residual exophthalmos, and no patient had clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION The usage of FD for the treatment of diCCF is straightforward. Injury of the cranial nerves can be avoided. In most cases, ocular symptoms improve. Several FD layers and/or an adjunctive venous coil occlusion are required. Complete occlusion of a diCCF may take weeks or months and long-term antiaggregation is required. In the future, a flexible stent graft might be a better solution.","Wendl, C M; Henkes, H; Martinez Moreno, R; Ganslandt, O; Bäzner, H; Aguilar Pérez, M",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-016-0511-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27129454/,93
133373,[Pandemics and the economy].,2020-06-01,"Sapovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a translational strategy based on processing of a polyprotein precursor by a chymotrypsin-like protease. So far, the molecular mechanisms regulating cleavage specificity of the viral protease are poorly understood. In this study, the catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the predicted forms of the viral protease, the 3C-like protease (NS6) and the 3CD-like protease-polymerase (NS6-7), were examined in vitro. The purified NS6 and NS6-7 were able to cleave synthetic peptides (15 to 17 residues) displaying the cleavage sites of the sapovirus polyprotein, both NS6 and NS6-7 proteins being active forms of the viral protease. High-performance liquid chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of digested products showed a specific trans cleavage of peptides bearing Gln-Gly, Gln-Ala, Glu-Gly, Glu-Pro, or Glu-Lys at the scissile bond. In contrast, peptides bearing Glu-Ala or Gln-Asp at the scissile bond (NS4-NS5 and NS5-NS6, or NS6-NS7 junctions, respectively) were resistant to trans cleavage by NS6 or NS6-7 proteins, whereas cis cleavage of the Glu-Ala scissile bond of the NS5-NS6 junction was evidenced. Interestingly, the presence of a Phe at position P4 overruled the resistance to trans cleavage of the Glu-Ala junction (NS5-NS6), whereas substitutions at the P1 and P2' positions altered the cleavage efficiency. The differential cleavage observed is supported by a model of the substrate-binding site of the sapovirus protease, indicating that the P4, P1, and P2' positions in the substrate modulate the cleavage specificity and efficiency of the sapovirus chymotrypsin-like protease.","Robel, Ivonne; Gebhardt, Julia; Mesters, Jeroen R; Gorbalenya, Alexander; Coutard, Bruno; Canard, Bruno; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Rohayem, Jacques",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00693-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550673/,93
133740,Teaching cholangiography in a surgical residency program.,2013,"Objectives Given finite ICU bed capacity, knowledge of ICU bed utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is critical to ensure future strategies for resource allocation and utilization. We sought to examine ICU census trends in relation to ICU bed capacity during the rapid increase in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases early during the pandemic. Design Observational cohort study. Setting Thirteen geographically dispersed academic medical centers in the United States. Patients/Subjects We obtained daily ICU censuses from March 26 to June 30, 2020, as well as prepandemic ICU bed capacities. The primary outcome was daily census of ICU patients stratified by coronavirus disease 2019 and mechanical ventilation status in relation to ICU capacity. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Prepandemic overall ICU capacity ranged from 62 to 225 beds (median 109). During the study period, the median daily coronavirus disease 2019 ICU census per hospital ranged from 1 to 84 patients, and the daily ICU census exceeded overall ICU capacity for at least 1 day at five institutions. The number of critically ill patients exceeded ICU capacity for a median (interquartile range) of 17 (12-50) of 97 days at these five sites. All 13 institutions experienced decreases in their noncoronavirus disease ICU population, whereas local coronavirus disease 2019 cases increased. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients reached their greatest proportion of ICU capacity on April 12, 2020, when they accounted for 44% of ICU patients across all participating hospitals. Maximum ICU census ranged from 52% to 289% of overall ICU capacity, with three sites less than 80%, four sites 80-100%, five sites 100-128%, and one site 289%. Conclusions From March to June 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic led to ICU censuses greater than ICU bed capacity at fives of 13 institutions evaluated. These findings demonstrate the short-term adaptability of U.S. healthcare institutions in redirecting limited resources to accommodate a public health emergency.","Douin, David J; Ward, Michael J; Lindsell, Christopher J; Howell, Michelle P; Hough, Catherine L; Exline, Matthew C; Gong, Michelle N; Aboodi, Michael S; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Stubblefield, William B; Steingrub, Jay S; Prekker, Matthew E; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Khan, Akram; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H; Ginde, Adit A",Critical care explorations,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786437/,93

However, many current technologies require the detailed mechanistic knowledge of specific material-virion interactions before they can be employed, for example, to aid in the purification of vaccine components or in the design of a more effective PPE. Here, we show that an adaption of a polymer microarray method for screening bacterial-surface interactions allows for the screening of polymers for desirable material-virion interactions. Nonpathogenic virus-like particles including fluorophores are exposed to the arrays in an aqueous buffer as a simple model of virions carried to the surface in saliva/sputum. Competitive binding of Lassa and Rubella virus-like particles is measured to probe the relative binding properties of a selection of copolymers. This provides the first step in the development of a method for the discovery of novel materials with promise for viral binding, with the next being development of this method to assess absolute viral adsorption and assessment of the attenuation of the activity of live virus, which we propose would be part of a material scale up step carried out in high containment facilities, alongside the use of more complex media to represent biological fluids.","Blok, Andrew J; Gurnani, Pratik; Xenopoulos, Alex; Burroughs, Laurence; Duncan, Joshua; Urbanowicz, Richard A; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Müller-Kräuter, Helena; Strecker, Thomas; Ball, Jonathan K; Alexander, Cameron; Alexander, Morgan R",Biointerphases,https://doi.org/10.1116/6.0000586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203214/,93
135660,Essential elements of anaesthesia practice in ERAS programs.,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to analyze the effect of surgical plume generation from various ultrasonic dissectors on laparoscopic visibility, including the first cordless ultrasonic dissector, using a novel real-time digital quantification technique. METHODS The Covidien Cordless Sonicision, the Harmonic ACE, and the Olympus SonoSurg were applied to bovine liver with industry-specified settings. Consecutive activations were digitally captured from a laparoscope positioned to replicate the clinical setting. Plume was recognized by ImageJ software, and the percentage of pixels containing plume in each video frame was calculated. Analysis of variance statistical multi-analysis and Welch's t test were computed for all p values. RESULTS The average maximum plume produced by the Sonicision, ACE, and SonoSurg with the maximum setting were respectively 8.76% (range, 4.32-17.41%), 18.04% (range, 9.07-55.12%), and 9.46% (range, 5.68-22.12%) (p = 0.026). The deviations between the ACE and the other devices were significant (p < 0.05). The average maximum plumes produced with the coagulation setting were 4.80% (range, 0.24-19.83%) for the Sonicision, 26.63% (range, 8.12-73.50%) for the ACE, and 0.21% (range, 0.06-1.05%) for the SonoSurg (p < 0.001). The differences between all the instruments in the coagulation setting were significant. CONCLUSION To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on a real-time digital analysis of surgical plume generation using ImageJ software. In the coagulation setting, the SonoSurg generated minimal plume. The Sonicision obstructed approximately 4%, whereas the ACE generated plume that obstructed 25% of the laparoscopic field. In the cutting setting, the SonoSurg and Sonicision generated the least obstruction, whereas the ACE caused the most obstruction.","Kim, Fernando J; Sehrt, David; Pompeo, Alexandre; Molina, Wilson R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2351-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22660839/,93

136441,Population flow drives spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 in China.,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND Concerns about reduced milk transfer with nipple shield (NS) use are based on evidence from studies with methodological flaws. Milk removal during breastfeeding can be impacted by infant and maternal factors other than NS use. The aim of this study was to control electric breast pump vacuum strength, pattern and duration across multiple study sessions to determine if NS use reduces milk removal from the breast. METHODS A within-subject study with two groups of breastfeeding mothers (infants < 6 months) were recruited; Control Group (CG): no breastfeeding difficulties; Pain Group (PG) used NS for persistent nipple pain. Mothers completed three randomised 15 min pumping sessions using the Symphony vacuum curve (Medela AG); no NS, fitted NS, and a small NS. Sessions were considered valid where the applied vacuum was within 20 mmHg of the set vacuum. Milk removal was considered as pumped milk volume, and also percentage of available milk removed (PAMR), which is calculated as the pumped volume divided by the estimated milk volume stored in the breast immediately prior to pumping. RESULTS Of 62 sessions (all: n = 31 paired sessions) a total of 11 paired sessions from both PG (n = 03) and CG (n = 08) were valid (subset) with and without a fitted NS. Only 2 small shield sessions were valid and so all small shield measurements were excluded. Both pumped volumes and PAMR were significantly lower with NS use for all data but not for subset data. (All: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 76.5 mL, 69%, Fitted NS: 32.1 mL, 41% respectively (volume p = 0.002, PAMR p = 0.002); Subset: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 83.8 mL, 72%; Fitted NS: 35.2 mL, 40% (volume p = 0.111 and PAMR p = 0.045). The difference in PAMR, but not volume, was statistically significant when analysed by linear mixed modelling. A decrease of 10 mmHg was associated with a 4.4% increase in PAMR (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS This experimental data suggests that nipple shield use may reduce milk removal. Close clinical monitoring of breastfeeding mothers using nipple shields is warranted.","Coentro, Viviane Silva; Perrella, Sharon Lisa; Lai, Ching Tat; Rea, Alethea; Murray, Kevin; Geddes, Donna Tracy",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03191-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894074/,93

137324,How COVID exposed the hypocrisy within me.,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND During surgery, liver tissue is particularly prone to bleeding which can be difficult to control, especially in patients with liver disease-associated coagulopathy. Topical sealants and hemostats can enhance clot formation and wound healing, and can be useful for controlling or preventing troublesome bleeding during surgical interventions where conventional methods of hemostasis are inadequate. METHODS An extensive customized literature search was conducted using medical reference databases to identify publications related to the use of potential agents in laparoscopic liver surgery. Citations from these articles were also used. Details of the authors' own experience in this area is also included. RESULTS Routine use of fibrin-based sealants in open liver surgery now seems to be widespread. Data from several large prospective randomized controlled clinical trials have indicated that application of fibrin-based sealants to the cut liver surface during hepatectomy does provide some benefit in terms of a shorter time to hemostasis and a reduction in postoperative drainage fluid, even when compared with argon beam coagulation. Another trial found no additional benefit of fibrin sealants when applied after coagulation of the cut liver surface. A prospective, uncontrolled study found that application of the flowable gelatin matrix-based hemostat Floseal provided rapid effective control of mild-to-severe bleeding during surgical removal of primary or metastatic liver tumors, even in those with cirrhosis. Some of these topical hemostatic agents are already being used on a routine basis by many surgeons performing laparoscopic liver surgery. Although there are no randomized clinical trials, there are several anecdotal or case reports of their effective use during laparoscopic liver surgery. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of current evidence of using hemostats and sealants in open liver surgery, there is potential of developing these strategies in laparoscopic liver surgery.","Saif, Rehan; Jacob, Mathew; Robinson, Stuart; Amer, Amien; Kei-Hui, Douglas; Sen, Gourab; Manas, Derek; White, Steve","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31821db688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21654294/,93

138688,Simulation-Based Virtual-Reality Patient-Specific Rehearsal Prior to Endovascular Procedures: A Systematic Review.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing respiratory support for adults experiencing acute respiratory failure, or at risk of acute respiratory failure, in the intensive care unit (ICU). This is an update of an earlier version of the review. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), for respiratory support in adults in the ICU. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register (17 April 2020), clinical trial registers (6 April 2020) and conducted forward and backward citation searches. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled studies (RCTs) with a parallel-group or cross-over design comparing HFNC use versus other types of non-invasive respiratory support (standard oxygen therapy via nasal cannulae or mask; or NIV or NIPPV which included continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure) in adults admitted to the ICU. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS We included 31 studies (22 parallel-group and nine cross-over designs) with 5136 participants; this update included 20 new studies. Twenty-one studies compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy, and 13 compared HFNC with NIV or NIPPV; three studies included both comparisons. We found 51 ongoing studies (estimated 12,807 participants), and 19 studies awaiting classification for which we could not ascertain study eligibility information. In 18 studies, treatment was initiated after extubation. In the remaining studies, participants were not previously mechanically ventilated. HFNC versus standard oxygen therapy HFNC may lead to less treatment failure as indicated by escalation to alternative types of oxygen therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.86; 15 studies, 3044 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC probably makes little or no difference in mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 11 studies, 2673 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC probably results in little or no difference to cases of pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09; 4 studies, 1057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we were uncertain of its effect on nasal mucosa or skin trauma (RR 3.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 31.48; 2 studies, 617 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay according to the type of respiratory support used (MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.27; 7 studies, 1014 participants). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 24 hours of treatment (MD 10.34 mmHg, 95% CI -17.31 to 38; 5 studies, 600 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to short-term comfort (MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.22; 4 studies, 662 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or to long-term comfort (MD 0.59, 95% CI -2.29 to 3.47; 2 studies, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). HFNC versus NIV or NIPPV We found no evidence of a difference between groups in treatment failure when HFNC were used post-extubation or without prior use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of using HFNC on incidence of pneumonia (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and HFNC may result in little or no difference to barotrauma (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.14; 1 study, 830 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay (MD -0.72 days, 95% CI -2.85 to 1.42; 2 studies, 246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The ratio of PaO2/FiO2 may be lower up to 24 hours with HFNC use (MD -58.10 mmHg, 95% CI -71.68 to -44.51; 3 studies, 1086 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC improved short-term comfort when measured using comfort scores (MD 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 2 studies, 258 participants) and responses to questionnaires (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 168 participants); evidence for short-term comfort was very low certainty. No studies reported on nasal mucosa or skin trauma. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS HFNC may lead to less treatment failure when compared to standard oxygen therapy, but probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure when compared to NIV or NIPPV. For most other review outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in effect. However, the evidence was often of low or very low certainty. We found a large number of ongoing studies; including these in future updates could increase the certainty or may alter the direction of these effects.","Lewis, Sharon R; Baker, Philip E; Parker, Roses; Smith, Andrew F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd010172.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661521/,93

The esophageal replacement was indicated because of persistent corrosive esophageal stricture. First, thoracoscopic native esophagus dissection was performed. After gastric mobilization with single-incision laparoscopy, esophagectomy and esophagogastric anastomosis were performed through the cervical incision. There was no complication, and the patient had gained weight by the end of the 12-month follow-up.

We show that subcutaneous administration of the pharmaceutical excipient 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) to cats with NPC disease ameliorated hepatic disease, but doses sufficient to reduce neurological disease resulted in pulmonary toxicity. However, direct administration of HPβCD into the cisterna magna of presymptomatic cats with NPC disease prevented the onset of cerebellar dysfunction for greater than a year and resulted in a reduction in Purkinje cell loss and near-normal concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids. Moreover, administration of intracisternal HPβCD to NPC cats with ongoing cerebellar dysfunction slowed disease progression, increased survival time, and decreased the accumulation of brain gangliosides. An increase in hearing threshold was identified as a potential adverse effect. These studies in a feline animal model have provided critical data on efficacy and safety of drug administration directly into the central nervous system that will be important for advancing HPβCD into clinical trials.","Vite, Charles H; Bagel, Jessica H; Swain, Gary P; Prociuk, Maria; Sikora, Tracey U; Stein, Veronika M; O'Donnell, Patricia; Ruane, Therese; Ward, Sarah; Crooks, Alexandra; Li, Su; Mauldin, Elizabeth; Stellar, Susan; De Meulder, Marc; Kao, Mark L; Ory, Daniel S; Davidson, Cristin; Vanier, Marie T; Walkley, Steven U",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3010101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25717099/,93

RESULTS Records from 57 adolescents (74% female; mean age 16 (range: 12-17) years; mean BMI 51.3 kg/m(2) ) were reviewed. Of these, only 47% were approved with the original request. Eighty percent of those denied were approved on appeal, while 11% never obtained authorization for surgery. Age less than 18 years and proposed procedure were the most common reasons for denial. CONCLUSIONS Less than half of adolescents with clinical indications for surgery received approval for the procedure on the first request. The appeal process typically resulted in overturning of denials, so that surgical care could be delivered.","Inge, Thomas H; Boyce, Tawny W; Lee, Margaret; Kollar, Linda; Jenkins, Todd M; Brandt, Mary L; Helmrath, Michael; Xanthakos, Stavra A; Zeller, Meg H; Harmon, Carroll M; Courcoulas, Anita; Michalsky, Marc P",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25234923/,93
143241,Covid-19: New data on Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine backs 12 week dosing interval.,2021-02-03,"High-throughput, genome-scale data present a unique opportunity to link host to pathogen on a molecular level. Forging such connections will help drive the development of mathematical models to better understand and predict both pathogen behavior and the epidemiology of infectious diseases, including malaria. However, the datasets that can aid in identifying these links and models are vast and not amenable to simple, reductionist, and univariate analyses. These datasets require data mining in order to identify the truly important measurements that best describe clinical and molecular observations. Moreover, these datasets typically have relatively few samples due to experimental limitations (particularly for human studies or in vivo animal experiments), making data mining extremely difficult. Here, after first providing a brief overview of common strategies for data reduction and identification of relationships between variables for inclusion in mathematical models, we present a new generalized strategy for performing these data reduction and relationship inference tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of robustness when using data to drive model development, particularly when using genome-scale, small-sample in vivo data. We identify the use of appropriate feature reduction combined with data permutations and subsampling strategies as being critical to enable increasingly robust results from network inference using high-dimensional, low-observation data.","Yin, Weiwei; Kissinger, Jessica C; Moreno, Alberto; Galinski, Mary R; Styczynski, Mark P",Mathematical biosciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2015.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093035/,93

To advance the understanding of FHL, we performed gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 children with untreated FHL. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression levels were determined using microarray analysis. Comparisons between patients with FHL and normal pediatric controls (n = 30) identified 915 down-regulated and 550 up-regulated genes with more than or equal to 2.5-fold difference in expression (P ≤ .05). The expression of genes associated with natural killer cell functions, innate and adaptive immune responses, proapoptotic proteins, and B- and T-cell differentiation were down-regulated in patients with FHL. Genes associated with the canonical pathways of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 IL-1, IL-8, TREM1, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signaling and genes encoding of antiapoptotic proteins were overexpressed in patients with FHL. This first study of genome-wide expression profiling in children with FHL demonstrates the complexity of gene expression patterns, which underlie the immunobiology of FHL.","Sumegi, Janos; Barnes, Michael G; Nestheide, Shawnagay V; Molleran-Lee, Susan; Villanueva, Joyce; Zhang, Kejian; Risma, Kimberly A; Grom, Alexei A; Filipovich, Alexandra H",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2010-08-300046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21325597/,93

Treatment options for AF are limited, with only few reports in the literature. The use of prophylactic narrowband Ultraviolet-B (nb-UVB) phototherapy for AF has not previously been described and we report on this for the first time. AIM We analysed the clinical characteristics, phototesting results and responses to treatment for patients with AF diagnosed in the SPS. METHODS We undertook a retrospective review over a ten-year period of all case notes of patients who were assessed and diagnosed with AF through the SPS, based in the Photobiology Unit, Dundee, Scotland. RESULTS All 10 patients were female. Mean age of onset was 25 years; mean time to referral for investigation was seven years. The commonest site involved was the face, with the main clinical feature being monomorphic pustules appearing following sunlight exposure. The eruption was provoked with iterative doses of broadband UVA irradiation in five patients. All patients were offered photoprotective advice and prophylactic nb-UVB phototherapy. Five patients proceeded with phototherapy; four completed the desensitisation course and all four reported either a delay in symptom onset or total prevention of rash induction, with complete efficacy of desensitisation maintained for three years in one patient. CONCLUSION We demonstrate the successful use of UVA provocation testing as a diagnostic tool in AF. Additionally, we recommend the use of prophylactic nb-UVB phototherapy in AF as an effective and well-tolerated approach.","Butt, S; Dawe, R; Blair, R; Ibbotson, S",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215732/,93

146219,Transitioning From Immunosuppressants to Dupilumab in Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Prostatic capsular incision (CapI) is an iatrogenic breach of the prostatic capsule during radical prostatectomy (RP) that can cause positive surgical margins (PSMs) in organ-confined (pT2) prostate cancer, or the retention of benign prostatic tissue. We systematically interrogated the literature in order to clarify the definition of CapI, and the implications of this event for rates of PSM and biochemical recurrence (BCR). METHODS A literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria using the search terms 'capsular incision' AND 'prostatectomy', and variations of each. In all, 18 studies were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS A total of 51 057 RP specimens were included. The incidence of CapI ranged from 1.3% to 54.3%. CapI definitions varied and included a breach of the prostatic capsule 'exposing both benign or malignant prostate cancer cells', 'malignant tissue only', or 'benign tissue only'. The incidence of PSMs due to CapI ranged from 2.8% to 71.7%. Our meta-analysis results found that when CapI was defined as 'exposing malignant tissue only in organ-confined prostate cancer' there was an increased risk of BCR compared to patients with pT2 disease and no CapI (relative risk 3.53, 95% confidence interval 2.82-4.41; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The absolute impact of CapI on oncological outcomes is currently unclear due to inconsistent definitions. However, the data imply an association between CapI and PSMs and BCR. Reporting of possible areas of CapI on the operation note, or marking areas of concern on the specimen, are critical to assist CapI recognition by the pathologist.","Philippou, Yiannis; Harriss, Eli; Davies, Lucy; Jubber, Ibrahim; Leslie, Tom; Bell, Richard W; Bryant, Richard J; Hamdy, Freddie C; Verrill, Clare; Lamb, Alastair D",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.14522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113754/,93

146409,The temporal integration windows for visual mirror symmetry.,2021-08-02,"PURPOSE The major obstacles of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) heat treatments are nonuniform heating in the thermal lesion and heat sinks caused by large blood vessels during treatments which could lead to high tumor recurrence in patients. The objective of this study is to help comprehend RFA heat treatment through thermal lesion formation using computer simulation, and thus to provide helpful assistance in planning RFA. METHODS RFA heat treatment is a popular ""minimally invasive"" treatment method for both primary and metastatic liver tumors, and the heat treatment is studied by numerical calculation. A finite difference model is used to solve all partial differential equations for a simple three-dimensional cubic geometry model. Maximum tissue temperature is used as a critical index for reaching thermal lesion during RFA. Cylindrical RF cool-tip electrode is internally cooled at constant water temperature. RFA thermal lesion is studied at various impacts by single and countercurrent blood vessel(s) traversing the thermal lesion. Several factors are considered, such as location, diameter, and orientation of the blood vessel(s) to the electrode. RESULTS Results show the thermal lesion size decreases as the lesion blood perfusion rate increases. And, single large blood vessel which is orthogonal to RF electrode will cause less undercooled volume in the thermal lesion than one which is parallel to RF electrode. Furthermore, convective energy may easily damage parallel vessel and its surrounding normal tissues during RFA. Small blood vessels (or larger vessels with slow blood flow rate) during RFA could form ""tail-like"" thermal lesion formation, which could damage vessel downstream spots. CONCLUSIONS Studies suggested that incomplete RF tumor ablation still exists within 1 cm distance between large blood vessel and RF electrode in a liver. This could have significant impact on local tumor recurrence rates. Second, if thermally significant vessel existed inevitably within the lesion, avoiding the RF cool-tip electrode placement next to the parallel large blood vessel would have a better heat treatment during RF heating. Additionally, reduced blood flow rate could help reduce significant cooling by large blood vessel.","Huang, Huang-Wen",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4811135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23822457/,93

Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop; they are as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and they have thus attracted much attention in the past few months. This article reviews seven existing antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with 3D structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Five 3D antibody structures associated with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are also evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis, a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the 14 antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed.

148080,The ethics of biosafety considerations in gain-of-function research resulting in the creation of potential pandemic pathogens.,2015,"The transcriptional program associated with herpesvirus latency and the viral genes regulating entry into and exit from latency are poorly understood and controversial. Here, we developed and validated a targeted enrichment platform and conducted large-scale transcriptome analyses of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We used both an experimental hematopoietic cell model of latency and cells from naturally infected, healthy human subjects (clinical) to define the breadth of viral genes expressed. The viral transcriptome derived from experimental infection was highly correlated with that from clinical infection, validating our experimental latency model. These transcriptomes revealed a broader profile of gene expression during infection in hematopoietic cells than previously appreciated. Further, using recombinant viruses that establish a nonreactivating, latent-like or a replicative infection in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, we defined classes of low to moderately expressed genes that are differentially regulated in latent vs. replicative states of infection. Most of these genes have yet to be studied in depth. By contrast, genes that were highly expressed, were expressed similarly in both latent and replicative infection. From these findings, a model emerges whereby low or moderately expressed genes may have the greatest impact on regulating the switch between viral latency and replication. The core set of viral genes expressed in natural infection and differentially regulated depending on the pattern of infection provides insight into the HCMV transcriptome associated with latency in the host and a resource for investigating virus-host interactions underlying persistence.","Cheng, Shu; Caviness, Katie; Buehler, Jason; Smithey, Megan; Nikolich-Žugich, Janko; Goodrum, Felicia",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710522114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158406/,93

By reviewing our 10-year experience of performing totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP), we sought to establish its clinical significance in the treatment of adult inguinal hernia. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively the clinical records of patients who underwent TEP for adult inguinal hernia between January 2003 and December 2012. RESULTS None of the 303 patients with adult primary or recurrent inguinal hernia in our study needed TEP converted to other procedures or suffered serious complications during the procedure. A significant difference was noted in the operation time between direct (n = 32) vs indirect (n = 128) hernias in the primary unilateral inguinal hernia group (91 ± 27 vs 80 ± 32 min, p = 0.033) and between direct/direct (n = 31) vs indirect/indirect (n = 24) hernias (136 ± 58 vs 89 ± 24 min, p = 0.01) in the primary bilateral inguinal hernia group. The only postoperative complications recorded were four cases of hernia recurrence (1.3 %) and one case of chronic pain (0.3 %). CONCLUSIONS The results obtained for TEP over 10 years support this as a promising procedure for the treatment of adult inguinal hernia.","Toma, Hiroki; Eguchi, Toru; Toyoda, Shuichi; Okabe, Yasuhiro; Kobarai, Tomonari; Naritomi, Gen; Ogawa, Takahiro; Hirota, Ichio",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-014-1101-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563587/,93

METHODS Between 2009 and 2011, 53 patients underwent total laparoscopic radical hysterectomies. They were categorized into groups A, B, and C based on the status of preserved pelvic nerve networks: complete preservation of the pelvic nerve plexus (group A, 27 cases); partial preservation (group B, 13 cases); and complete sacrifice (group C, 13 cases). To evaluate bladder function, urodynamic studies were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS No significant difference in sensory function was found between groups A and B. However, the sensory function of group C was significantly lower than that of the other groups. Group A had significantly better motor function than groups B and C. No significant difference in motor function was found between groups B and C. Results showed that the sensory nerve is distributed predominantly at the dorsal half of the pelvic nerve networks, but the motor nerve is predominantly distributed at the ventral half. CONCLUSION Various types of total laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomies can be tailored to patients with cervical carcinomas.","Kanao, Hiroyuki; Fujiwara, Kazuko; Ebisawa, Keiko; Hada, Tomonori; Ota, Yoshiaki; Andou, Masaaki",Journal of gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2014.25.3.198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25045432/,93

Infected macrophages in the CNS undergo apoptosis. We recently showed that M1-D macrophages infected with the low-neurovirulence TMEV BeAn virus became apoptotic through the mitochondrial pathway that is Bax mediated. Our present analyses of the molecular events and signaling pathway(s) culminating in the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization that initiates the caspase cascade and apoptosis of BeAn virus-infected M1-D macrophages revealed activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by 2 to 3 h postinfection (p.i.), followed by phosphorylation of tumor suppressor protein p53 Ser 15 at 3 to 6 h p.i., stabilizing p53 levels until 6 h p.i. Activated p53 upregulated the transcription of proapoptotic puma and noxa genes at 2 to 4 h p.i. and their BH3-only protein expression, followed by the loss of detectable prosurvival Mcl-1 and A1 proteins at 4 to 10 h p.i. Degradation of the prosurvival proteins is known to release Bax, which forms homo-oligomers and translocates into and permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane. Inhibition of phospho-p38 by two specific inhibitors, SB203580 and BIRB796, led to a significant decrease in apoptosis at 10 h p.i., with no effect on virus titers (only SB203580 tested). Together, these data indicate that p53 activation is required for the induction of apoptosis in infected M1-D cells.","Son, Kyung-No; Pugazhenthi, Subbiah; Lipton, Howard L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01030-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656889/,93

METHODS The data (N=1,372) used in this paper comes from the 2013 Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset. Six intentions of protective behaviors (getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, washing hands, avoiding going to public settings, sanitizing home, and eating nutritional supplements) were investigated. Tobit and ordered logistic regressions were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS Respondents were most inclined to washing hands, followed by wearing a mask, avoiding going to public settings, getting vaccine, sanitizing their homes, and eating nutritional supplements. Perceived severity and individual's efficacy were positively correlated with all six behavioral intentions. Trust in authorities has positive effect on all the protective behaviors except sanitizing home. Moreover, perceived probability has positive relationships with overall intention, intention to wear mask, and intention to wash hands.

Little is known about what leads to the initiation of telemental health. OBJECTIVE To categorize the different patterns of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health services among individuals with SMI. METHODS A cohort of rural beneficiaries with SMI (defined as schizophrenia/related psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder) with an index telemental health visit in 2010-2017 was built using claims for a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The authors used latent class analysis to identify classes of mental health care use in the 6 months before the index telemental health visits. Across the classes, the authors also described characteristics of index and subsequent mental health visits. RESULTS The cohort included 4930 rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Three classes of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health were identified. The largest class (n=3066) had minimal use of primary care provider mental health care and the second largest class (n=1537) had minimal specialty mental health care.

A Simulation Study of Droplet Splash Using an Acrylic Box During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE To assess whether there is a significant difference in the effect of incremental changes of portal venous blood flow rates on the size of radiofrequency (RF) versus microwave (MW) ablation lesions in an ex vivo blood-perfused bovine liver model. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was exempt from approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sixty ablations (30 MW and 30 RF ablations) were performed ex vivo in 15 bovine livers perfused with autologous blood via the portal vein at 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mL/min per 100 g of liver tissue (three livers were used for each flow rate). Long-axis diameter (LAD), short-axis diameter (SAD), and volume were measured for each ablation lesion. A general linear mixed model was used to examine the effect of location, ablation device, and flow rate on LAD, SAD, and volume. Results were considered to indicate a significant difference at P less than .05. RESULTS Location was not a significant predictor of LAD, SAD, or volume (P ≥ .4). The slope of the relationship between flow rate and LAD, SAD, and volume was significantly different according to ablation device (P < .0001). For RF ablation lesions, the mean LAD, SAD, and volume demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with flow rate, while the measurements for MW ablation did not change with variation in flow rates. CONCLUSION The size of RF ablation lesions is highly variable, with a significant inverse relationship to the rate of portal venous blood flow. Conversely, the size of MW ablation lesions is unaffected by changes in portal venous blood flow. The consistency of the size of MW ablation lesions could translate into a higher local tumor eradication rate than that reported with RF ablation.","Dodd, Gerald D; Dodd, Nicholas A; Lanctot, Anthony C; Glueck, Deborah A",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.12120486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23297326/,93

It is known that Pneumonia Associated with Mechanical Ventilation (PAMV) is frequent in patients who use this equipment for a long time. As a consequence of COVID-19, its prolonged use can lead to a worse prognosis for the patients. For this reason, in addition to the insufficiency of devices for mechanical ventilation to meet the current demand, it is necessary to adopt measures aimed at preventing complications that may aggravate the patient's clinical condition and, consequently, increase the average hospital stay and the respective hospital care costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discuss, in a concise and practical way, and based on the available literature, the importance of adopting adequate oral hygiene protocols for patients on mechanical ventilation. Based on the data obtained, it was identified that the adoption of effective oral hygiene measures, especially under the supervision of dental professionals, can contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with MV, resulting in greater availability of mechanical ventilation equipment. Since such equipment is in great demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the knowledge and implementation of effective oral hygiene measures will undoubtedly have an impact on improving the quality of care offered to patients, therefore benefiting all those in critical health conditions and assisted in ICUs.","Silva, Dayane Helen Ferreira; Camargos, Júlia Hinkelmann de; Rodrigues, Jefferson Guimarães; Nogueira, Leilismara Sousa; Azevedo, Dênia Alves de; Carvalho, Maria das Graças; Pinheiro, Melina de Barros",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.96; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965365/,93

Latinx immigrants, in particular, face significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including lack of insurance, language barriers, stigma, work conflicts, and limited transportation. METHODS In response to a disproportionately high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Latinxs at the Johns Hopkins Health System, investigators implemented free community-based testing by partnering with religious leaders and leveraging the skill of trusted community health workers. Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests. RESULTS Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events. Among them, 355 (19.9%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 31.5% for Latinxs, 7.6% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 3.4% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 5.3% for patients of other races/ethnicities. Compared with Latinxs who tested negative, Latinxs who tested positive were more likely to report Spanish as their preferred language (91.6% vs 81.7%, p<0.001), be younger (30.4 vs 33.4 years, p<0.008), and have a larger household size (4.8 vs 4.3 members, p<0.002). CONCLUSIONS Community-based testing identified high levels of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among primarily Latinxs with limited English proficiency. During this period, the overall positivity rate at this community testing site was almost 10 times higher among Latinxs than among non-Hispanic Whites.","Bigelow, Benjamin F; Saxton, Ronald E; Flores-Miller, Alejandra; Mostafa, Heba H; Loss, Manisha J; Phillips, Katherine H; Moore, Adrianna M; Hale, W Daniel; Tolson, Tina M; McCann, Nicki S; Catlett, Christina L; Golden, Sherita H; Clark, Jeanne M; Page, Kathleen Raquel",American journal of preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775510/,93
156195,Built for This.,2021-05-01,"In this paper, an unconstrained cardiorespiratory system for monitoring of ECG and respiration during sleep is presented. A novel active dry ECG electrode, which based on the conductive flexible and stretchable Ag NWs/PDMS composite material is designed to acquire the electrocardiographic potentials through the cloth. Meanwhile, a membrane pressure sensor is applied to obtain the respiratory signal, which can avoid the intervention in the sleep process. Combining the novel active ECG electrode and the membrane pressure sensor, the followed signal acquisition circuit is designed to monitor the ECG and respiratory signals simultaneously without fixing any external sensor to the human body. To verify the performance of the proposed system, a comprehensive test protocol is presented. Firstly, we characterized the electrical properties and the signal sensing capability of the proposed sensor. Furthermore, the performance of the entire system is assessed to verify the effects caused by different clothing materials and sleep postures to the ECG signal and the respiratory signal acquisition. The average Pearson correlation coefficient of the RR interval that extracted from the ECG signal obtained by the proposed system and the commercial PSG device can reach over 0.9 of different clothes and postures. As for the respiration acquisition, the accuracy of the respiration rate in different postures can reach 95% during the 2 hours monitoring process. The experimental results are promising, which demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve favorable signal quality and satisfy the basic requirements of the cardiorespiratory monitoring during sleep. Moreover, the proposed system can be extended to the office environment to monitor the health status of the individual.","Wang, Zeyu; Chen, Chen; Tao, Linkai; Yuan, Wei; Li, Wei; Sun, Chenglu; Chen, Wei",Conference proceedings : ...

Although there is no complete treatment protocol for COVID-19, studies on this topic are ongoing, and it is known that broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins are used for coinfections and symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Studies have shown that Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria can cause symptoms such as diarrhea and coinfections accompanying COVID-19. Therefore, in this study, colon-targeted cefaclor monohydrate (CEF)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-Eudragit S100 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a nanoprecipitation technique. The particle sizes of the CEF-loaded NPs were between 171.4 and 198.8 nm. The encapsulation efficiency was in the range of 58.4%-81.2%. With dissolution studies, it has been concluded that formulations prepared with Eudragit S100 (E-coded) and Eudragit S100+PLGA (EP-coded) are pH-sensitive formulations and they are targetable to the colon, whereas the formulation prepared only with PLGA (P-coded) can release a higher CEF rate in the colon owing to the slow release properties of PLGA. The release kinetics were fitted to the Korsmeyer-Peppas and Weibull models. The antibacterial activity of E-, EP-, and P-coded formulations was 16-fold, 16-fold, and 2-fold higher than CEF, respectively, for S. aureus and E. coli according to the microdilution results. As a result of the time killing experiment, all formulations prepared were found to be more effective than the antibiotic itself for long periods. Consequently, all formulations prepared in this study hope to guide researchers/clinicians in treating both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria-induced infections, as well as COVID-19 associated coinfections and symptoms.","Alper Öztürk, A; Namlı, İrem; Aygül, Abdurrahman",Assay and drug development technologies,https://doi.org/10.1089/adt.2020.1014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728979/,93

Consequently, China may be one of the weak links in global preparedness for avian influenza. China's rural health care system has been weakened by 20 years of privatization and fiscal decentralization. China plays a huge role in the global poultry industry, with a poultry population of 14 billion birds, 70%-80% of which are reared in backyard conditions. Although surveillance has been strengthened, obstacles to the timely reporting of disease outbreaks still exist. The weakened health care system prevents many sick people from seeking care at a health care facility, where reporting would originate. Inadequate compensation to farmers for culled birds leads to nonreporting, and local officials may be complicit if they suspect that reporting might lead to economic losses for their communities. At the local level, China's crisis-management ability and multisectoral coordination are weak. The poor quality of infection control in many rural facilities is a serious and well-documented problem. However, traditions of community political mobilization suggest that the potential for providing rural citizens with public health information is possible when mandated from the central government. Addressing these issues now and working on capacity issues, authority structures, accountability, and local reporting and control structures will benefit the control of a potential avian influenza outbreak, as well as inevitable outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases in China's Pearl River Delta or in other densely populated locations of animal husbandry in China.","Kaufman, Joan A",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1086/524990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18269328/,93

Establishing causality has been challenging in existing human studies, due to confounding by genetic and postnatal environment. Animal experiments can improve our understanding of this association. This systematic review examined the effects of maternal obesity in pregnancy on offspring neurobehavior in animal models. We included 26 studies (1047 offspring animals). Meta-analyses showed that offspring of obese mothers displayed higher levels of locomotor activity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 [0.10; 0.58]) and anxiety behavior (SMD 0.47 [0.16; 0.79]) than offspring of lean mothers, but similar memory abilities (SMD -0.06 [-0.52; 0.39]). Meta-analysis of learning abilities was not sensible due to heterogeneity. Although the evidence was heterogeneous and the quality of the included studies generally unclear, this systematic review of animal studies indicates an effect of maternal obesity on increased offspring locomotor activity and anxiety, but not on offspring memory performance. These findings may be important from a public health perspective since obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, and warrant further research.","Menting, Malou D; van de Beek, Cornelieke; Mintjens, Stijn; Wever, Kimberley E; Korosi, Aniko; Ozanne, Susan E; Limpens, Jacqueline; Roseboom, Tessa J; Hooijmans, Carlijn; Painter, Rebecca C",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.12.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611800/,93

We developed two sets of Species Distribution Models using MaxEnt and distribution data from the native and introduced ranges of the species to project their potential distribution in the archipelago. We found differences in the predicted distributions for the models based on introduced and on native occurrences for both species, with different most important variables being selected. Climatic variables were most important for the introduced range models, while other groups of variables (i.e., human-disturbance) were included in the native-based models. Most of the islands of the Azorean archipelago were predicted to have suitable habitat for both species, even when not yet occupied. Our results showed that predicting the invaded range based on introduced range environmental conditions predicted a narrower range. These results highlight the difficulty to transfer models from native to introduced ranges across taxonomically related species, making it difficult to predict future invasions and range expansion.","Lamelas-López, Lucas; Pardavila, Xosé; Borges, Paulo A V; Santos-Reis, Margarida; Amorim, Isabel R; Santos, Maria J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764786/,93

Computed tomography (CT) in combination with contrast enhanced CT is used more often for diagnosing various head pathology in horses. The objective of this study was to compare intravenous and intra-arterial contrast-enhancement techniques and describe normal and abnormal contrast enhancement in the horse's head. RESULTS All 24 horses included in the study recovered without complication from the procedures. Compared to the pre-contrast studies, post-contrast studies showed significant contrast enhancement in the pituitary gland (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p < 0.0001), IA nose septum (p = 0.002), nose mucosa (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p = 0.02), parotid salivary gland (IA: p < 0.0001; IV p < 0.0001), cerebrum (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p < 0.0001), rectus capitis muscle (IA: p < 0.0001; IV p = 0.001), IA temporal muscle (p < 0.0001), IA masseter muscle (p <0.0001) and IV brainstem (p = 0.01). No significant contrast enhancement was seen in the eye (IA: p = 0.23; IV p = 0.33), tongue (IA p = 0.2; IV p = 0.57), IA brainstem (p = 0.88), IV nose septum (p = 0.26), IV temporal muscle (p = 0.09) and IV masseter muscle (p = 0.46). Three different categories of abnormal enhancement were detected: a strong vascularised mass, an enhanced rim surrounding an unenhanced structure and an inflamed anatomical structure with abnormal contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION Using the intra-arterial technique, similar contrast enhancement is achieved using less contrast medium compared to the intravenous technique. And a potential major advantage of the IA technique is the ability to evaluate lesions that are characterized by increased blood flow. Using the intravenous technique, a symmetrical and homogenous enhancement is achieved, however timing is more crucial and the contrast dosage is more of influence in the IV protocol. And a potential major advantage of the IV technique is the ability to evaluate lesions that are characterized by increased vascular permeability. Knowing the different normal contrast enhancement patterns will facilitate the recognition of abnormal contrast enhancements.","Crijns, Casper P; Baeumlin, Yseult; De Rycke, Lieve; Broeckx, Bart J G; Vlaminck, Lieven; Bergman, Erik H J; van Bree, Henri; Gielen, Ingrid",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0632-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26739315/,93

METHODS We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cinahl databases in August 2016 and repeated in May 2017. Included were studies reporting on patients ≥ 18 years, an ICD implant (transvenous, subcutaneous, or ICD with cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT-D]), reporting on BICs, and published in peer-reviewed English-language journals. We excluded nonsystematic reviews, opinion pieces/letters, case studies, conference abstracts, PhD dissertations, protocol papers, studies of ICD shock treatment of atrial fibrillation, and of abdominally or submammary implanted ICDs. RESULTS A total of 40 articles were included: 16 qualitative and 24 quantitative. None of the included studies had BICs as their primary endpoint. Results showed that BICs are present in various degrees in the ICD population and can be attributed to the visibility of the ICD (the scar and bump). Women and younger patients had greater problems with BICs, although men also had concerns. Two items of the ""Florida Patient Acceptance Survey"" were the most frequently used to assess BICs. CONCLUSION BICs were present among ICD patients, but the degree of impact on their lives varied.

158807,AJN On the Web.,2020-04-01,"With the recent explosion in the size of libraries available for screening, virtual screening is positioned to assume a more prominent role in early drug discovery's search for active chemical matter. In typical virtual screens, however, only about 12% of the top-scoring compounds actually show activity when tested in biochemical assays. We argue that most scoring functions used for this task have been developed with insufficient thoughtfulness into the datasets on which they are trained and tested, leading to overly simplistic models and/or overtraining. These problems are compounded in the literature because studies reporting new scoring methods have not validated their models prospectively within the same study. Here, we report a strategy for building a training dataset (D-COID) that aims to generate highly compelling decoy complexes that are individually matched to available active complexes. Using this dataset, we train a general-purpose classifier for virtual screening (vScreenML) that is built on the XGBoost framework. In retrospective benchmarks, our classifier shows outstanding performance relative to other scoring functions. In a prospective context, nearly all candidate inhibitors from a screen against acetylcholinesterase show detectable activity; beyond this, 10 of 23 compounds have IC50 better than 50 μM. Without any medicinal chemistry optimization, the most potent hit has IC50 280 nM, corresponding to K i of 173 nM. These results support using the D-COID strategy for training classifiers in other computational biology tasks, and for vScreenML in virtual screening campaigns against other protein targets. Both D-COID and vScreenML are freely distributed to facilitate such efforts.","Adeshina, Yusuf O; Deeds, Eric J; Karanicolas, John",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000585117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669436/,93

Due to the precautions taken for isolation, the physical inactivity level of the patients which would affect the disease activity has increased (1). Objectives: The primary purpose of this study was to assess the exercise compliance and clinical status of the patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the physical activity level and quality of life of the patients during the pandemic. Methods: The research is a cross-sectional study. Seventy-nine patients with various rheumatic diseases were included in the study. Standard questions were used to evaluate the exercise habits, the level of pain and morning stiffness and severity of exacerbations. Pain and morning stiffness levels and attack severity were scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) (0-10;with 0 indicating no pain/stiffness and 10 severe pain/stiffness). Attack duration was recorded in number of exacerbated days. Parameters were compared before and after the pandemic with Paired Samples T Test. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) Questionnaire were filled to assess the physical activity level and quality of life. Results: Twenty-eight percent of the patients were diagnosed with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), 37% were Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), 14% were Systemic Sclerosis (ScS) 14% were Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 6% were Rheumatoid Arthritis, 1% were Primary Sjogren Syndrome (PSS). Less than half of the patients (46%) did continue exercising regularly during the pandemic and 30 (81%) of them performed only the exercises given by the therapist while 7 (9%) of them tried different exercise types from another source. The reason for discontinuation to exercising expressed by the incompliant patients were mostly unwillingness (17 of 37 patients). Pain, morning stiffness and number of attacks were better during the pandemic compared to before however, a statistically significant difference was found only for morning stiffness (p = .036). The results of IPAQ showed that the majority of the patients (n: 48) were physically inactive, while only 2 patients were active during the pandemic. The most deteriorated quality of life subcategory was energy level of the patients according to the NHP scores. Conclusion: This study results showed that patients with rheumatic diseases stayed physically inactive during the pandemic and the disease status has also been affected negatively. As the duration of the pandemic prolongs, levels of physical inactivity would increase and the progressive physical inactivity is expected to worsen patients' symptoms more. However, as the pandemic appears to continue, face-to-face exercise therapy should still be avoided. For all those reasons above, alternative ways of therapy like tele-rehabilitation would come onto stage to cope with the increasing physical inactivity of the rheumatic patients.","Pala, G.

163202,Forty years of change in a monomictic tropical lake,2021-04-21,"COVID-19 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic, which has significantly impacted the economy, education, and social interactions. Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to COVID-19 is possible with our peptide-based SARS-COV-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat COVID-19.","Wang, Hongye; Hou, Xin; Wu, Xian; Liang, Te; Zhang, Xiaomei; Wang, Dan; Teng, Fei; Dai, Jiayu; Duan, Hu; Guo, Shubin; Li, Yongzhe; Yu, Xiaobo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.994756,93
163299,Doing What’s Right: The Ethical Dimension of Psychoanalytic Work During A Pandemic,2021,"With the recent boom in human sensing, the push to incorporate human mobility tracking with epidemic modeling highlights the lack of groundwork at the meso-scale (e.g., city-level) for both contact tracing and transmission dynamics. Although GPS data has been used to study city-level outbreaks, current approaches fail to capture the path of infection at the individual level. Consequently, in this paper, we extend the usefulness of epidemics prediction from estimating the size of an outbreak at the population level to estimating the individuals who may likely get infected within a finite period of time. To this end, we propose a network-based method to first build and then prune the dynamic contact networks for recurring interactions; these networks can serve as the backbone topology for mechanistic epidemics modeling. We test our method using Foursquare's Points of Interest (POI) smart- phone geolocation data from over 1.3 million devices and show that we can recreate the COVID-19 infection curves for two major (yet very different) US cities (i.e., Austin and New York City) while maintaining the granularity of individual transmissions and reducing model uncertainty. Our method provides a foundation for building a disease prediction framework at the meso-scale that can help both policy makers and individuals of their estimated state of health and help with pandemic planning.","Hurtado, S.; Marculescu, R.; Drake, J.; Srinivasan, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.29.21264175v1?rss=1,93
163428,The nitrogen decade: mobilizing global action on nitrogen to 2030 and beyond,2021-01-22,"To determine the effectiveness of adapting healthy food retail components for online delivery. Small food retail stores that accept SNAP/EBT are important food sources for low-income Americans, especially in areas where traditional grocery stores are difficult to access. SNAP-Ed recognizes healthy food retail interventions as an approach to encourage healthy eating and support direct nutrition education. Small food retail stores that accept SNAP/EBT in low-income census tracts were targeted. Shop Smart Tennessee is an 8-week small food retail program that uses taste testing, educational handouts, and in-store marketing to encourage healthy customer selections. In response to COVID-19, in-store program components were modified for the pilot to be delivered on social media. Food demonstration videos were developed to replace taste testings, and educational handouts were translated to social media posts. Educators posted videos and educational content to the partnering store's Facebook page or tagged the store in posts. To assess the effectiveness of online delivery methods we used participant surveys linked to food demonstration video posts, social media metrics, and nutrition educator feedback. Five stores participated in this pilot. Thirty-seven videos were posted to Facebook with 4,320 views and 863 engagements. Forty-three people completed online participant surveys, with 89% (n = 38) responding they would likely make the recipe at home. Nutrition educator feedback suggested store managers were supportive of online delivery and that it was an acceptable alternative to in-store programming. This pilot demonstrated that components of food retail programming can be adapted for social media. This method was well received by participants, store managers and nutrition educators. It allowed us to reach store customers from a different angle and can be used to inform future food retail work involving social media. Upcoming projects should focus on assessing impact of social media content delivery coupled with in-store engagement efforts. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education.

163520,Confronting Missing Ecological Data in the Age of Pandemic Lockdown,2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of exchange rate volatility, oil price return and COVID-19 cases on the stock market returns and volatility for selected emerging market economies. Additionally, this study compares the market performance in the emerging economies during the COVID-19 pandemic with the pre-COVID and global financial crisis (GFC) period. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the arbitrage pricing theory to model the risk-return relationship between the risk-based factors (exchange rate volatility and COVID-19 cases) and stock market returns. By applying the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, the study captures the asymmetric volatility spillover from the stock markets to foreign exchange markets and vice versa. Findings: Findings reveal that exchange rate volatility exerts a negative and significant effect on the market returns in Brazil (BOVESPA), Chile (S&P CLX IPSA), India (SENSEX), Mexico (S&P BMV IPC) and Russia (MOEX) during the coronavirus pandemic. Regarding the effect of oil price returns, the authors find a positive relationship between oil price and stock market returns across all the economies in the study. The market returns of Russia, India, Brazil and Peru appeared more volatile during the pandemic than the GFC period. Practical implications: As the exchange rate volatility is causing higher risk and uncertainty in the stock market’s performance, the central bank’s effort to maintain a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate sale can be proven crucial for the economies under consideration. Emphasized should also be given to boost investors’ confidence in the stock market, and for this, the government policy actions in reducing the transmission of the disease are the need of the hour. Originality/value: While a large volume of literature on stock market performance in times of COVID-19 has emerged from developed economies, this study adds to the literature by exploring the emerging economies’ stock market performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike previous literature, this study examines the volatility spillover between stock and exchange rate markets in the worst affected emerging economies during the crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Rakshit, B.; Neog, Y.",Studies in Economics and Finance,https://doi.org/10.1108/sef-09-2020-0389,93
163548,"Exploring Reusability of Disposable Face Masks: Effects of Disinfection Methods on Filtration Efficiency, Breathability, and Fluid Resistance",2021,"In times of world crisis such as climate change and the COVID pandemic much has been said about the need for resilience. However, in scenarios of less concern about crisis the leading paradigm is often that of efficiency. The current study shows how efficiency might have got on the way of achieving the necessary resilience to face the COVID 19. With the example of the German brown shrimp fishery in the North Sea the interaction between those two paradigms – efficiency and resilience – is shown in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. For instance, the quest of efficiency for rationalisation may reduce the resources available to set aside buffers to resist shocks, and the standardisation key to efficiency may also hinder more diversity and hence open innovation for solutions to the crisis, all characteristics of resilient organisations. By making use of a literature review including peer reviewed, grey literature and web media as well as of interviews with experts and quantitative data the value chain of the German brown shrimp fishery is analysed under the conceptual framework of organisational resilience. Results show that, despite being more oriented towards efficiency, the German fleets does not show particularly good results in selected efficiency indicators. Additionally, key stages of the value chain as processing and commercialisation together with the investment strategy fail to present some commonly accepted components of resilient organisations, such as redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, diversity, prudence and embeddedness. Despite developments in the direction of sustainability with the MSC certification, the German fleet should pay attention to its capacity to face disturbances, which should be supported by a more long-term, targeted, resilience-oriented policy support.","Goti-Aralucea, Leyre Berkenhagen Jörg Sulanke Erik Döring Ralf",Marine Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104675,93

To study evidence of the vertical transmission in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. Materials and methods: A prospective study was performed in BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, one of the biggest designated (1200 beds) COVID hospitals in India. It was carried out from June 2020 to mid-October 2020. A total of 50 pregnant patients who were COVID-19 positive and admitted to the labor room were studied. Results: The mean age of the mothers was 27.40 ± 4.76 years (range: 19–36 years) and mean gravidity was 1.67 ± 1.41 (range: 1–4). The mean gestational age was 38.31 ± 1.67 weeks. The main complaint was fever in 22 (44%), followed by dry cough in 9 (18%), sore throat in 4 (8%), headache in 2 (4%), malaise in 7 (14%), and diarrhea in 2 (4%) patients. Twenty-two (44%) patients showed an elevated C-reactive protein level, 17 (34%) had lymphopenia, 19 (38%) had mild elevation of the D-dimer level, and 16% of the patients had increased interleukin 6 levels. Most of the patients had normal renal function test (RFT) and liver function test (LFT) results. A majority of them (86%) had normal chest X-ray, whereas rest of them (14%) had haziness in bilateral lung fields. Twenty-six (52%) patients underwent C-section, and 23 (46%) delivered vaginally. Four (8%) babies required the admission in the newborn intensive care unit for mild birth asphyxia but were discharged well. Five babies developed physiological jaundice and required single surface phototherapy (SSPT). Forty-eight (96%) out of 50 had negative vaginal swab by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 48 (96%) did not show any evidence of the virus in the expressed breast milk by RT-PCR. We collected the cord blood sample of 35 patients after delivery which was found to be negative in all (100%). The nasopharyngeal swab of all the babies was negative on the very first day. Day 7 repeat swab was found positive only in one baby. This transmission was mostly via respiratory droplets during intermittent assisted breastfeeding. Most of the cases were having mild disease without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which responded to the supportive treatment. Four patients (8%) had severe anemia and required blood transfusion. Conclusion: Most of the cases were having mild disease without ARDS, which responded to supportive treatment. Reassuringly, there was no evidence of poor fetal outcome, intrauterine fetal deaths, or premature deliveries. We did not find any evidence of the virus in the vaginal fluid, cord blood, or breast milk supporting vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy, even if patient delivered vaginally. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers. 2021.","Kapadia, S.

164055,Digital Spatial Profiling of Collapsing Glomerulopathy,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND The main goal of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate, in women, the association between the behavioural inhibition system/behavioural activation system (BIS/BAS) and fear of COVID-19-related self-infection and infection of loved ones (family members, friends, relatives). Several studies have indicated that the psychological consequences of COVID-19 are serious especially among women. On the other hand, little is known about the role of the BIS and BAS in shaping responses and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article deals with this issue. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The sample consisted of 415 women between the ages of 18 and 67. A numerical rating scale comprising 11 degrees of fear was used to assess participants' COVID-19-related fear, and the BIS and BAS were evaluated using Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales. RESULTS A small positive correlation was observed between the BIS and participants' COVID-19-related fear of loved ones' infection. The BIS explained two percent of the COVID-19-related fear of loved ones' infection dimension. CONCLUSIONS The BIS weakly, but significantly correlated with women's fear of their loved ones being infected by COVID-19. This study highlights the possible role of the BIS mechanism in women's response to COVID-19-related fear, but only when the threat affects loved ones. Comparative studies between men and women are necessary.","Oniszczenko, W.",Current Issues in Personality Psychology,https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp.2021.106139,93
164494,Are fast test results preferable to high test sensitivity in contact-tracing strategies?,2021-02-19,"Background: There's little data of patients with immune diseases (ID) treated with biologic and JAK-inhibitors and COVID19. Current consensus is to keep treatment, however more studies are needed to ascertain the risk in these patients. Objectives: To describe the associated risk factors and outcomes in hospitalized patients with ID treated with biologics and JAK-inhibitors of a tertiary center. Methods: Observational retrospective study of patients with COVID19 from March 1st 2020 to January 31st 2021. Out of all the patients receiving subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) biologics and oral (PO) JAK-inhibitors, we selected those requiring hospitalization due to pneumonia for analysis. We collected demographic data, comorbidities, seasonal flu vaccination, smoking history and the outcome (discharge/admission in an intensive care unit (ICU)/death). We used a composite index (Charlston's index) for comorbidities. Results: Of 153 patients, 29 (18.9%) were hospitalized. 18 (62%) were women with a median age of 61 (IQ 52-69). 14 (48.2%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 5 (17%) had axial spondylarthritis and 4 (13.7%) had Chron's disease. The main IV was Rituximab in 3 (50%), and abatacept, infliximab and vedolizumab had one each. Of the SC, tocilizumab and adalimumab had 5 (22.7%) each, etanecept and golimumab had 3 (13.6%) each and secukinumab, ustekinumab and abatacept had 2 (9%) each. The PO was tofacitinib. There were no outcome differences for each treatment. 24 (82.7%) patients had at least 1 comorbidity with significative difference between patients (Table 1). There were 6 (20.6%) deaths, 3 (50%) in the ICU, 2 (33%) did not meet the ICU criteria, and 1 (16%) before ICU admission. None them had the same ID. Conclusion: The rate of COVID19 hospitalization in our patients was comparable to the general population's (between 19-24% from 60 years plus) and the risk of in-patient death is also similar, around 24%1. Our study suggests that neither their ID nor their treatment influences their risk of a worse outcome. COPD, DM and previous heart disease were associated with worse outcome;however it seems that the main prognostic factor was the overall impact of comorbidities associated;as measured by the Charlston's index, being significantly higher in the patients with a fatal outcome. A fatal outcome was more likely in IV biologics, however it could be explained by indication bias probably due to higher comorbidity and disability in these patients rather than an independent prognostic variable.","Anzola Alfaro, A.

In this study, a microchip-based grating coupled fluorescent plasmonic (GC-FP) assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding towards antigens from variants CoV2 virus variants, strains B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (S. African). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence, and could also resolve acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP as compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive ELISA assay. Collectively, the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable, rapid, and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination.","Taubner, B.; Peredo-Wende, R.; Ramani, A.; Singh, G.; Strle, K.; Cady, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.13.21260442v1?rss=1,93

165043,Why a Globally Fair COVID-19 Vaccination? An Analysis based on Agent-Based Simulation,2021-10-04,"With the rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19 and COVID-20), wearing face masks in public becomes a necessity to mitigate the transmission of this or other pandemics. However, with the lack of on-ground automated prevention measures, depending on humans to enforce face mask-wearing policies in universities and other organizational buildings, is a very costly and time-consuming measure. Without addressing this challenge, mitigating highly airborne transmittable diseases will be impractical, and the time to react will continue to increase. Considering the high personnel traffic in buildings and the effectiveness of countermeasures, that is, detecting and offering unmasked personnel with surgical masks, our aim in this paper is to develop automated detection of unmasked personnel in public spaces in order to respond by providing a surgical mask to them to promptly remedy the situation. Our approach consists of three key components. The first component utilizes a deep learning architecture that integrates deep residual learning (ResNet-50) with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to detect the existence of human subjects in the videos (or video feed). The second component utilizes Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CNN) to detect and extract human faces from these videos. For the third component, we construct and train a convolutional neural network classifier to detect masked and unmasked human subjects. Our techniques were implemented in a mobile robot, Thor, and evaluated using a dataset of videos collected by the robot from public spaces of an educational institute in the U.S. Our evaluation results show that Thor is very accurate achieving an F-1 score of 87.7% with a recall of 99.2% in a variety of situations, a reasonable accuracy given the challenging dataset and the problem domain.","Snyder, S.

165527,Nested oscillations and brain connectivity during sequential stages of feature-based attention,2020-02-29,"Objectives: In Canada, an estimated 20% of women experience perinatal mental illness. Rates are elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor mental health affects expectant and new parents’ overall emotional and physical well-being, and has consequences for children, families, and society. Services currently available to those experiencing perinatal mental illness in Canada are largely inadequate and issues are magnified during COVID-19. This presentation offers findings from the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative survey, which examines gaps in perinatal mental health service delivery. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of Canadian perinatal health care providers. Providers (N=405) were recruited via social media. Results: The majority of providers (87%) do not have mandated screening for perinatal mental illness at their workplace. When women are screened and have symptoms indicative of needing intervention, 61% of providers reported wait times of 1-12 months for services. Mental health services provided are disparate across health regions. Half (50%) reported that they have not received specialized training in perinatal mental illness. Providers identified significant barriers in service provision, with language and/or lack of culturally-appropriate counselling services being cited by 87%. Providers reported that COVID-19 has complicated access to care, including reduced in-person visits and overall services. Conclusions: The survey findings underscore a critical need for anational perinatal mental health strategy to address gaps in screening and treatment. Obstetricians and other perinatal care providers should integrate screening for mood disorders into routine practice while systemic changes are required to ensure accessible and culturally safe treatment of perinatal mental illness across Canada.","Tarasoff, L.; Ou, C.; Hooykaas, A.; Charlebois, J.; Tomfohr-Madsen, L.; Tomasi, P.",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2021.02.044,93
165601,Faith as Authenticity,2021,"Hateful and offensive speech on online social media platforms has been exacerbated by the turbulent and chaotic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, anti-lockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information. It can thus be used to mitigate the damage caused by widespread dissemination of offensive content. © 2021 IEEE.","Moon, J.; Nguyen, H.; Pines, B.; Gokhale, S.

We aimed to understand the practice, perceptions, and experience of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with HCQ use for COVID-19 and other indications. Methods: A validated e-survey with 30 questions was circulated among rheumatologists and other specialists using SurveyMonkey. Responses from rheumatologists were compared with other doctors (odds ratio [OR], median, interquartile range), and ADRs encountered based on their indications. Results: Among 410 respondents (71.2% rheumatologists, 27% academicians) with a lifetime experience of 17886 (4884-52074) patients over 12 (7-20) years, and 148 (48-349) prescription of HCQ per month, one-third (135) were managing COVID-19 with 10 (0-60) prescriptions per physician. Electrocardiograms were seldom ordered preprescription (5%), but visual scans were requested by one-thirds, especially by rheumatologists (OR-1.9). Agreement on the safety of HCQ for non-COVID indications was nearly unanimous (99%), but only two-third (64%) perceived it to be safe for COVID-19, with most (72%) being uncomfortable using HCQ with macrolides. ADRs were most often encountered after middle-age with skin pigmentation (554 [123-2063]) being the most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal intolerance (222 [42-980] per million prescriptions). Cardiac toxicity was rarely reported. ADRs other than cutaneous and visual were noted more frequently by nonrheumatologists. Rheumatologists were less likely to consider HCQ unsafe (OR-0.04) and reportedly faced a greater challenge in drug procurance (OR-2.6) during the pandemic. Conclusions: Most ADRs are rare with HCQ use in our respondent population with a large user experience. HCQ use was considered unsafe by one-thirds in the setting of COVID-19 but not outside it, lesser so by rheumatologists. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

165935,Russian trolls speaking Russian: Regional Twitter operations and MH17,2020-05-13,"COVID-19 has meant major transformations for commercial fabric. These transformations have been motivated by the collapse of consumer mobility at multiple scales. We analyzed the impact of the collapse of global tourist flows on the commercial fabric of Barcelona city center, a city that has been a global reference in over-tourism and tourism-phobia. Fieldwork in the main commercial areas before and after the pandemic and complementary semi-structured interviews with the main agents involved highlight the relationship between global tourist flows and commercial fabric. The paper shows how the end of global tourism has meant an important commercial desertification. The end of the integration of the city center into global consumer flows has implications for urban theory. It means a downscaling of the city center and the questioning of traditional center-periphery dynamics. It has been shown that the tourist specialization of commerce has important effects on the real estate market and makes it particularly vulnerable. However, the touristic specialization of commercial activities as a strategy of resilience has also been presented. This adaptation faces the generalized commercial desertification that drives the growing concentration of consumption around the online channel.","Frago Clols, Lluís",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158215,93
166308,"Conservation practice insights from a comparative case study of two shoreline stabilization projects in Boston Harbor, MA",2021,"Introduction: Treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) continues to evolve as most patients are lenalidomide (LEN) refractory at the time of first relapse with its widespread use in both induction and maintenance therapy. Pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in RRMM has demonstrated significant activity and improvement in progression-free survival in LEN-refractory patients (Richardson et al Lancet Oncol 2019 Jun;20(6):781-794). Ixazomib is a novel oral proteasome inhibitor (PI) that is currently approved in combination with LEN and dexamethasone in RRMM. Ixazomib is administered on a once weekly schedule and its oral route of administration is particularly attractive, not least in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Twice weekly dosing of ixazomib has been studied in combination with LEN demonstrating promising activity in NDMM (Richardson et al, Br J Haematol. 2018 Jul;182(2):231-244). Moreover, safety and efficacy has been shown in RRMM as twice weekly monotherapy on this schedule (Richardson et al, Blood 2014 Aug 14;124(7):1038-46). We hypothesized that a twice weekly ixazomib schedule in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone will lead to enhanced efficacy and comparable safety in RRMM. Methods: This is a phase I/II multicenter, single-arm, open label study evaluating the combination of twice weekly ixazomib with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in RRMM. Primary objective for phase I portion is to determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Ixazomib is studied at doses of 3mg or 4mg on days 1, 4, 8, 11, pomalidomide at a dose of 2mg, 3mg and 4mg on days 1-14 and dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 12mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 (8mg for patients > 75 years old) on a 21 day cycle (Table 1). Patients were included if they received 2 prior lines of therapy, but 1 prior line was allowed if first line treatment included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and disease relapse occurred within 60 days of last therapy. Patients who received prior ixazomib were excluded. Results: At the time of data cutoff, 12 patients have been enrolled across cohorts 0, 1 and 2 and enrollment in the final cohort 3 is ongoing. Median age at the time of enrollment was 70 years old with slight male predominance (58%). ISS stage at diagnosis was II or greater in 75% of patients and 9 out of 12 (75%) patients had high-risk FISH as follows: del 17p (17%), gain 1q (50%), and t(4;14) (8%). Median prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-3) with 100% of patients having prior treatment with lenalidomide and 92% with prior bortezomib. Forty-two percent of patients had a prior autologous stem cell transplant. Most common treatment-related toxicities were mainly low grade and included neutropenia (58%), hyperglycemia (42%), fatigue (33%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and rash (25%). Grade 3 or greater toxicities included neutropenia (17%), anemia (8%), bacterial lung infection (8%), and atrial fibrillation (8%). There was 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in cohort 2 due to lung infection necessitating a delay in initiation of cycle 2 and no further DLTs have been noted. Dose reductions occurred in 4 patients and predominantly involved dexamethasone due to weight gain, insomnia, atrial fibrillation and fatigue. There have been no discontinuations due to toxicity and no treatment related mortality at the time of data cutoff. In response evaluable patients, 5 out of 12 patients have demonstrated a partial response or better (42%), with 1 very good partial response (VGPR) and all patients at least achieving stable disease. Conclusions: Twice weekly ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is a generally well-tolerated regimen with promising early activity in a high-risk RRMM cohort. Maximal tolerated dose and recommend phase II dose has not yet been reached and this study continues to accrue robustly, reflecting in part the convenience and safety of an all oral approach in the current era of COVID-19 Moreover, the ability to perform remote laboratory testing, telemedicine visits and to send medications directly to patients has been an additional value-add to this trial. Updated data will be presented at the meeting.

166441,Towards a Generic Method for Articulating Design-time Uncertainty,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global disruption to higher education, especially in engineering education, where many teaching and learning activities are difficult or impossible to conduct online. This study examines the changes in the students’ experiences of this disruption using a 26-item process-oriented course experience questionnaire (CEQ) that was already in use in the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH), rather than a newly created pandemic questionnaire. This allowed results from spring 2020 to be compared with corresponding data for 2017–2019. Overall, the students expressed lower satisfaction with their courses, indicated they received less feedback and fewer valuable comments, and found it harder to understand the expectations and standards of work. On the positive side, students reported that assessment was less about facts and more about in-depth understanding. By gender, male students were overall more negative to the experience of online learning, whereas female students appeared better able to benefit from the shift to online learning. Our results show the great advantage of using a robust course evaluation system that focuses on students’ learning experience rather than satisfaction, and suggest a way of being prepared to systematically study the effects of possible future disruptions to higher education.

166493,Literature Listing,2020-09-30,"Purpose Methods Results Conclusions Level of Evidence The COVID‐19 pandemic gave rise to renewed concerns of the transmission risks posed by surgeries on sites of high viral colonization such as the nasopharynx. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) involves the creation of a new tear duct from the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity. The purpose of this project is to determine if endoscopic DCR is an aerosol generating procedure (AGP).An optical particle sizer (OPS) was used to intraoperatively quantify aerosol concentrations during four cases of endoscopic DCR. The OPS sampled the air once every 60 seconds throughout the operations. The time of important operative steps were documented and correlated with OPS readings. Particle concentrations during each major surgical step were compared to baseline readings by the Mann Whitney U Test.There were statistically significant increases in median particle concentrations during laryngeal mask airway intubations for both particles 0.3 to 5.0 μm and >5.0 μm (P < .001 and P = .023, respectively). Median particle concentrations during nasolacrimal duct probing, middle meatal debridement, drilling, balloon insertion, tube insertion, and Posisef insertion were not statistically different from baseline.Endoscopic DCR in itself does not appear to be an AGP. It is, however, associated with other aerosol generating events such as laryngeal mask intubation, and thus requires appropriate personal protective equipment. Cautious interpretation of the results is encouraged given the limitations of OPS.4.

166645,Feature Driven and Point Process Approaches for Popularity Prediction,2016-08-17,"The vaccine roll-out has currently established a new trend in the fight against COVID-19. In many countries, as vaccination cover rises, the economic and social disruptions are being progressively reduced, bringing more confidence and hope to the population. However, a crucial debate is related to fair access to vaccines, which would lead to stepping up the pace of vaccination in developing countries. Another important issue is how immunization has influenced the control of the infection, deaths, and transmissibility of the new coronavirus in these countries. In this work we investigate the effects of the rate of vaccination on the COVID-19 epidemic curves, by employing a new data-driven methodology, formulated on the basis of a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model and Machine Learning designs. This data-driven methodology is applied to assess the influence of the vaccines administered in Brazil, on the fight against the virus. The impacts of vaccine efficacy and immunization speed are also explored in our study. Finally, we have found that the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with a low/moderate efficacy can be offset by immunizing a larger proportion of the population more quickly.

Under the direct impact to the social-cultural, political and economic interests, we are in time for change. In the past decade, the concept of PPP has been widely applied to facilitate supply chain resilience after the 2011 the Great East Japan Earthquakes and Tsunami on business continuity planning (BCP). The highlight in 2019 is to implement PPP on climate extremes capacity building programme “Plant Back Better (PBB)” initiatives for Livelihood Continuity Planning (LCP) through the smart technology and climate-smart agriculture across the border for international collaborations. How to look out each other in distance will be the future challenge amidst COVID-19. Consolidating 10 years of implementation findings, this paper developed a cross-border PPP approach on utilizing smart technology for better governance on emergency preparedness and building a stronger partnership engagement on real-time basis. On the digital transformation era, this paper illustrated how we came across the barrier of language, cultural difference and border-control to deliver the DRR mission through PPP amidst the COVID-19 crisis on a common operational picture for emergency preparedness, response and recovery. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Lee, Y.; Li, W.

One possible division of nucleotide sequence is that the predominant selective force on a particular nucleotide can be attributed to just one gene. While this arrangement has been observed in regions in which one gene is structured and the other is disordered, we sought to explore how overlapping genes balance constraints when both protein products are structured over the same sequence. We use a combination of sequence analysis, functional assays and selection experiments to examine an overlapped region in HIV-1 that encodes helical regions in both Env and Rev. We find that functional segregation occurs even in this overlap, with each protein spacing its functional residues in a manner that allows a mutable non-binding face of one helix to encode important functional residues on a charged face in the other helix. Additionally, our experiments reveal novel and critical functional residues in Env and have implications for the therapeutic targeting of HIV-1.","Safari, Maliheh; Jayaraman, Bhargavi; Yang, Shumin; Smith, Cynthia; Fernandes, Jason D.; Frankel, Alan D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.15.452440,93

A total of 164 samples were collected weekly between February 19th and June 8th, 2021. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 47.2% (52/110) influent samples and 37% (20/54) effluent samples. The increasing percentage of positive influent samples correlated with the city increasing active clinical cases during the second wave of COVID-19 in Jaipur. Furthermore, WBE based evidence clearly showed early detection of about 20 days (9/9 samples reported positive on April 20th, 2021) prior to the maximum cases & maximum deaths reported in the city on May 8th, 2021. The present study further observed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in treated effluents at the time window of maximum active cases in the city even after tertiary disinfection treatments of UV & Chlorine. The average genome concentration in the effluents and removal efficacy of six commonly used treatments; Activated Sludge Treatment + Chlorine disinfection (ASP + Cl2), Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) with Ultraviolet radiations disinfection (MBBR + UV), MBBR + Chlorine (Cl2), Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) and SBR + Cl2 were compared with removal efficacy of SBR + Cl2 (81.2%)> MBBR + UV (68.8%) > SBR (57.1%) > ASP (50%) > MBBR + Cl2(36.4%). The study observed the trends & prevalence of four genes (E, RdRp, N, and ORF1ab gene) based on two different kits and found that prevalence of N> ORF1ab >RdRp> E gene, suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. Hence, it is imperative to say that using a combination of different detection genes (E, N, RdRp & ORF1ab genes) reduce false positives in WBE.","Arora, S.; Nag, A.; Kalra, A.; Sinha, V.; Meena, E.; Saxena, S.; Sutaria, D.; Kaur, M.; Pamnani, T.; Sharma, K.; Shrivastava, S.

However, on November 4th 2020, the government published circular MWFC/1/2020 revoking the circular 5/2001 of August 10th 2001, one of the country's most crucial forest protection directives. The revocation of the 5/2001 circular could severely hamper this target, posing a threat of deforestation to a variety of ecosystems which are not part of any formally designated protected areas (PA) in Sri Lanka, also known as Other State Forests. This includes forested areas adjoining PAs which are crucial for habitat connectivity and standalone state forest lands. Such a retrograde step could have potentially catastrophic ramifications on Sri Lanka's declining forest cover. It would also severely weaken the country's commitments to inter alia, the UNREDD Programme, Kyoto protocol and CBD.

Recent scientific evidence demonstrates its feasibility and patient satisfaction. During the lockdown period, the Department of Pediatric Orthopedics at the Istituto di Cura Citta di Pavia supported subjects affected by AIS in two manners: online with the physical therapist (TR) and by using pre-recorded videos (VE). The aim of the present exploratory trial was to evaluate the practice of telerehabilitation in order to employ it in case of new lockdown measures. METHODS: Adherence, perceived enjoyment during the exercise performance and degree of satisfaction with technology were assessed on 18 subjects with AIS, divided into two groups according to the type of exercise administration (seven patients in TR;11 patients in VE). RESULTS: The VE group shows a more noticeable adherence than the TR group. Nonetheless, the perceived enjoyment is more significant in the TR subjects than in the VE ones. The level of satisfaction with technology is positive in both groups under study, without remarkable differences. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise administered at a distance has been positively perceived by all the subjects, though on different levels according to the type of technology employed. Results speak in favor of the use of technology as a means to therapeutic exercise delivery in individuals with AIS. Nevertheless, it is not clear which of the two types it is better to suggest. Biopsychologically speaking, the individual choice is likely to be the most workable solution.","Marin, L.; Albanese, I.; Gentile, F.

We developed a conceptual model based on the social determinants of health framework to guide the search, extraction, analysis, and interpretation of the bibliographic material. A systematic review of peer reviewed literature published in 2020 in scientific journals in the social, health, and behavioral sciences was conducted. A total of 37 articles met the selection criteria, 12 were original investigations with primary data collection, and 25 were studies reporting results of secondary data analysis using public or private databases. The representation of Latinos in the study samples ranged from 5% to 40%. The results of our review are compelling in terms of the overrepresentation of Latinos in SARSCoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The risk factors identified include working in a job considered essential, living in a geographic area with a high population density of Latinos and blacks, overcrowded living conditions in the household, limited English proficiency, and being unable to systematically carry out preventive behaviors known to be effective for infection avoidance. Existing national surveys and registries suffer from assumptions and omissions regarding variables relevant to Latinos. New studies must be guided by inquiries on the usual social determinants of health, but also those relevant for Latinos, such as national group, generational status, and language, among others.","Salgado de Snyder, Velia Nelly McDaniel Marisol Padilla Amado M.; Parra-Medina, Deborah",Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1177/07399863211041214,93
168964,Learner to learner fuzzy profiles similarity using a hybrid interaction analysis grid,2021-10-01,"Measles virus (MeV) viral entry is mediated by a fusion complex comprised of a receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin, H) and a fusion protein (F). The wild type H/F complex requires interaction with specific proteinaceous receptors (CD150/SLAM and nectin-4) in order to be activated. In contrast the H/F complexes isolated from viruses infecting the central nervous system (CNS) do not require a specific receptor. A single amino acid change in the F protein (L454W) was previously identified in two patients with lethal sequelae of MeV CNS infection, and the F bearing this mutation mediates fusion even without the H protein. We show here that viruses bearing the L454W fusion complex are less efficient than wt virus at targeting receptor expressing cells and that this defect is associated with a decreased interaction between the H and the F proteins. Importance Measles (Mev) infection can cause serious complications including measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). MIBE and SSPE are relatively rare but lethal. We have shown that the fusion complex of CNS adapted clinical samples can spread in the absence of known receptor. We now provide evidence that HRC mutations leading to CNS adaptation come at a cost to the efficiency of viral entry.

Choosing the appropriate hashtags for a post is not always easy for users, and therefore posts are often published without hashtags or with hashtags not well defined. To deal with this issue, we propose a new model, called HASHET (HAshtag recommendation using Sentence-to-Hashtag Embedding Translation), aimed at suggesting a relevant set of hashtags for a given post. HASHET is based on two independent latent spaces for embedding the text of a post and the hashtags it contains. A mapping process based on a multi-layer perceptron is then used for learning a translation from the semantic features of the text to the latent representation of its hashtags. We evaluated the effectiveness of two language representation models for sentence embedding and tested different search strategies for semantic expansion, finding out that the combined use of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer) and a global expansion strategy leads to the best recommendation results. HASHET has been evaluated on two real-world case studies related to the 2016 United States presidential election and COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal the effectiveness of HASHET in predicting one or more correct hashtags, with an average F-score up to 0.82 and a recommendation hit-rate up to 0.92. Our approach has been compared to the most relevant techniques used in the literature (generative models, unsupervised models, and attention-based supervised models) by achieving up to 15% improvement in F-score for the hashtag recommendation task and 9% for the topic discovery task. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cantini, R.; Marozzo, F.; Bruno, G.; Trunfio, P.",ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data,https://doi.org/10.1145/3466876,93

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 646 medical students (1st-6th year) in Pamukkale University with an online questionnaire. Forms were collected between 23rd to 31st of March 2020 via Google form. The questionnaire consisted of 39 questions including 12 items about sociodemographic information, 6 questions regarding COVID-19, 11 items about risk perception and 10 items regarding preventive measures about COVID-19. Results: The mean age of students was 21.77 +/- 2.28 years and 413 (63.8%) of them were female. The mean risk perception score of students was 22.70 +/- 4.68 (out of 44) and the mean preventive behavior score of students was 32.20 +/- 4.70 (out of 40). There was a significantly positive correlation between risk perception and preventive behavior scores. Female students, students with lower income, students whose mothers were highly educated, students who evaluated their health status as poor and who evaluated their knowledge about COVID-19 as insufficient had higher risk perception. Adoption of protective measures were higher in female students, married students, students who have chronic diseases and students who evaluated their health status as poor. Conclusion: Medical students in Turkey had a moderate risk perception and high preventive behaviors about COVID-19. In order to enhance students' risk perception, educators should be more involved in the process of medical education regarding the pandemic.","Uzun, S. U.; Celikyurek, N.

The focus was on the constraints and enablers of the structures in East London?s local economy. The research adopted a sequential exploratory design, utilising a three-phase approach. The first phase of the study was a quantitative process to determine the socio-economic profile of the day labourers. The second and third phases were qualitative. In phase 3, semi-structured interviews were conducted with day labourers at three selected hiring sites. Political interference, lack of access to information, insufficient skills and skills accreditation, a difficult local business environment and limited access to the Extended Public Works Programme as a result of age and gender are the key endogenous and exogenous constraints and structures at play in the day labour market in East London. These structures render day labourers structurally vulnerable despite the agency and resilience displayed through their daily endeavours. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this vulnerability vividly.

Meanwhile, the pandemic 's impact on private life and responsibilities for dependents also affected health care workers in rheumatology. Objectives: To examine the adaptability of clinician-researchers in rheumatology in a time of crisis focusing on academic output in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the professional and private burden experienced by health care workers in rheumatology. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv for reports of rheumatic diseases and COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 submitted (or published) from January 1 to June 30 2020 was carried out. As comparison, publications from April 6 to 13 2019 of the same rheumatic diseases without COVID-19 were analysed in terms of author characteristics and journal metrics. Additionally, a questionnaire was circulated via EULAR countries rheumatology societies and individual working group members. The participants were asked to answer 43 questions regarding their family situation, professional background, research output, changes in work and private responsibilities during the pandemic as well as the burden experienced. Responses were collected using an online survey tool and data analyses performed with SPSS Statistics 25;missing variable analysis was performed, excluding records with >15% missing responses. Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated for the entire dataset and split by gender. Results: Whereas the overall number of publications and authors was equal between 2020 and 2019, the portion of female first authors of review articles and original studies decreased substantially in the first phase of the pandemic (Table 1). The numerical contribution of female authors in highly ranked journals (impact factor>6) was comparable in 2019 and 2020, however, the percentage of female first authors dropped from 50% to 32% (P=0.07). In the survey, a total dataset was available for N=180 responders. On average, female respondents (52.5%) were younger, more likely to live alone (19,1% vs 10,5%) and have no caring responsibilities (51.1% vs. 36.3%) than male respondents. Male doctors were more often tenure-track/tenured or chairmen (31.4% vs 12.8% female) and worked less often part-time (9,3% vs. 19.1%). Unpaid overtime hours of all participants were striking with 46.3/44,2% (female/male) reporting to accumulate >10 hours/ week. Regarding gender differences in scientific output, male respondents more frequently revealed >20 publications as first (57,6% vs. 26,9%) or last authors (34.1% vs. 10,1%). Similarly, 44,7% of male respondents reported a last author publication during COVID-19 vs. 26,4% of female respondents. While female and male respondents reported similar experience of burden during the pandemic, more female respondents reported increased family care as a major source of this (38,2% vs. 22,2%). Both genders would like to see increased support from superiors and official institutions. Conclusion: In a time of acute crisis, the adaptability of scientifically active female health care workers in rheumatology is lower than that of their male counterparts. This is reflected in a lower scientific output, especially as first or last authors. However, the burden experienced in the current pandemic is similar between the genders.

170217,A Fundamental Inconsistency in the SIR Model Structure and Proposed Remedies,2020-05-01,"SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve variants of concern (VOC) which escape antibody neutralization and have enhanced transmission. One variant may escape immunity elicited by another, and the delta VOC has been reported to escape beta elicited immunity. Systematic mapping of the serological distance of current and emerging variants will likely guide the design of vaccines which can target all variants. Here we isolated and serologically characterized SARS-CoV-2 which evolved from an ancestral strain in a person with advanced HIV disease and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. This virus showed evolving escape from self antibody neutralization immunity and decreased Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine neutralization sensitivity. We mapped neutralization of evolved virus and ancestral, beta and delta variant viruses by antibodies elicited by each VOC in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Beta virus showed moderate (7-fold) and delta slight escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by ancestral virus infection. In contrast, delta virus had stronger escape from beta elicited immunity (12-fold), and beta virus even stronger escape from delta immunity (34-fold). Evolved virus had 9-fold escape from ancestral immunity, 27-fold escape from delta immunity, but was effectively neutralized by beta immunity. We conclude that beta and delta are serologically distant, further than each is from ancestral, and that virus evolved in prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease is serologically close to beta and far from delta. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is diverging into distinct serological phenotypes and that vaccines tailored to one variant may become vulnerable to infections with another.","Cele, S.; Karim, F.; Lustig, G.; James, S.

170307,Temporal Dynamics of Neural Processing of Facial Expressions and Emotions,2021-05-14,"Abstract Accurate measurement of static and dynamic forces during machining operations is important in the process monitoring, optimization and prediction of machining quality. Cutting and clamping forces are typically measured separately, for example, through hydraulic clamping force devices and piezoelectric table dynamometers. Since cutting and clamping forces interact throughout machining, both forces need to be measured simultaneously to accurately predict machining quality. This paper proposes a novel force measuring device in the form of a vise with built-in piezoelectric sensors and strain gauges to measure multi-axial clamping and cutting forces simultaneously. A strain concentrating design based on a cross-shaped groove was utilized to attach three strain gauges to measure clamping forces. These locations were chosen for their ability to measure clamping forces in real-time and minimize cross-talks. Piezoelectric sensors were embedded between layers in the vise jaw to measure cutting forces. A prototype of the proposed apparatus was fabricated and used to experimentally investigate sensitivities, bandwidth, clamping forces and cutting forces. The results showed that the proposed device has good performance in measuring clamping and cutting forces in milling operations.","Rezvani, Sina; Nikolov, Nicholas; Kim, Chang-Ju; Park, Simon S.; Lee, Jihyun",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235197892031595X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235197892031595X,93
170377,Spatial Tools for Case Selection: Using LISA Statistics to Design Mixed-Methods Research,2020,"Background: Although the Czech Republic weathered the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic with relatively low incidence, the second wave of the global pandemic saw it rank among countries bearing the greatest COVID-19 burden, both in Europe and on a worldwide scale. The aim of the nationwide prospective seroconversion (PROSECO) study was to investigate the dynamics of seroconversion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the Czech population. Methods: All clients of the second largest health insurance company in the Czech Republic were sent a written invitation to participate in this longitudinal study. The study includes the first 30,054 persons who provided a blood sample between October 2020 and March 2021. Seroprevalence was compared between calendar periods of blood sample collection, RT-PCR test results, sociodemographic factors, and other characteristics. Findings: The data show a dramatic increase in seropositivity over time, from 28% in October/November 2020 to 43% in December 2020/January 2021 to 51% in February/March 2021. These trends were consistent with government data on cumulative viral antigenic prevalence in the population captured by PCR testing although the seroprevalence rates established in this study were considerably higher than those listed in government data. Data pooled across the entire study period exhibited minor differences in seropositivity between sexes, age groups and body mass index categories; results were similar between test providing laboratories. Seropositivity was substantially higher among symptomatic vs. asymptomatic persons (76% vs. 34%). At least one third of all seropositive participants were asymptomatic, and 28% participants who developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 never underwent PCR testing. Interpretation: Antibody response provides a better marker of past SARS-CoV-2 infection than PCR testing data. Our data on seroconversion confirm the rapidly increasing prevalence in the Czech population during the dramatically rising pandemic wave prior to the beginning of massive vaccination. The planned second and third assessment of the study participants (April 2021-September 2021, October 2021-March 2022) will provide valuable evidence on the seroprevalence changes following vaccination and persistence of antibodies resulting from natural infection and vaccination.","Piler, P.; Thon, V.; Andryskova, L.; Dolezel, K.; Kostka, D.; Pavlik, T.; Dusek, L.; Pikhart, H.; Bobak, M.; Klanova, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.15.21262007v1?rss=1,93

Yet, its other effects have been profound and pervasive, exposing gender inequalities, reducing psychological sustainability, and causing economic hardship. Entrepreneurship, with its potential for effecting social good and sustainable economic development, has too been changed with studies finding a drop in entrepreneurship during the crisis. Yet, it is unknown how entrepreneurship may change after COVID-19 and lockdown measures are eased. We study changes in attitudes toward entrepreneurship by testing two samples of Singaporean undergraduates before the implementation (N = 242) and after the easing (N = 280) of lockdown measures. In doing so, we contribute to research about attitudes toward entrepreneurship, often side-lined in Theory of Planned Behaviour entrepreneurship studies which tend to focus instead on entrepreneurship intentions. Our findings indicate that opportunity-motivated, or pull, entrepreneurship may have become more positive after lockdown measures are eased. Next, women hold stronger beliefs in entrepreneurship’s capacity to fulfil agentic-type goals (e.g., power, achievement). For both genders, the extent to which entrepreneurship can achieve prosocial, communal-type goals is a key post-lockdown determinant of positive attitudes to entrepreneurship. Our findings provide clues into what to expect regarding post-lockdown entrepreneurship, and bears practical implications for entrepreneurship educators and policymakers.","Seah, Yuan Zhi",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168689,93

171909,Direct Statistical Modeling of Spread of Epidemic Based On a Stage-Dependent Stochastic Model,2021,"Background Social capital has been associated with health outcomes in communities and can explain variations in different geographic localities. Social capital has also been associated with behaviors that promote better health and reduce the impacts of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, face masking, and vaccination have all been essential in controlling contagion. These behaviors have not been uniformly adopted by communities in the United States. Using different facets of social capital to explain the differences in public behaviors among communities during pandemics is lacking. Objective This study examines the relationship among public health behavior, vaccination, face masking, and physical distancing during COVID-19 pandemic and social capital indices in counties in the United States. Methods We used publicly available vaccination data as of June 2021, face masking data in July 2020, and mobility data from mobile phones movements from the end of March 2020. Then, correlation analysis was conducted with county-level social capital index and its subindices (family unity, community health, institutional health, and collective efficacy) that were obtained from the Social Capital Project by the United States Senate. Results We found the social capital index and its subindices differentially correlate with different public health behaviors. Vaccination is associated with institutional health: positively with fully vaccinated population and negatively with vaccination hesitancy. Also, wearing masks negatively associates with community health, whereases reduced mobility associates with better community health. Further, residential mobility positively associates with family unity. By comparing correlation coefficients, we find that social capital and its subindices have largest effect sizes on vaccination and residential mobility. Conclusion Our results show that different facets of social capital are significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors, e.g., social distancing, face masking, and vaccination. As such, our results suggest that differential facets of social capital imply a Swiss cheese model of pandemic control planning where, e.g., institutional health and community health, provide partially overlapping behavioral benefits.","Ferwana, I.; Varshney, L.

Ideally, the E-field induced during TMS is concentrated on a targeted cortical region of interest (ROI). Objective To improve the accuracy of TMS we have developed a fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) for determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a predetermined direction or, alternatively, the overall E-field magnitude in the targeted ROI. Furthermore, ADM can assess E-field uncertainty resulting from precision limitations of TMS coil placement protocols. Method ADM leverages the electromagnetic reciprocity principle to compute rapidly the TMS induced E-field in the ROI by using the E-field generated by a virtual constant current source residing in the ROI. The framework starts by solving for the conduction currents resulting from this ROI current source. Then, it rapidly determines the average E-field induced in the ROI for each coil position by using the conduction currents and a fast-multipole method. To further speed-up the computations, the coil is approximated using auxiliary dipoles enabling it to represent all coil orientations for a given coil position with less than 600 dipoles. Results Using ADM, the E-fields generated in an MRI-derived head model when the coil is placed at 5,900 different scalp positions and 360 coil orientations per position (over 2.1 million unique configurations) can be determined in under 15 minutes on a standard laptop computer. This enables rapid extraction of the optimum coil position and orientation as well as the E-field variation resulting from coil positioning uncertainty. Conclusion ADM enables the rapid determination of coil placement that maximizes E-field delivery to a specific brain target. This method can find the optimum coil placement in under 15 minutes enabling its routine use for TMS. Furthermore, it enables the fast quantification of uncertainty in the induced E-field due to limited precision of TMS coil placement protocols, enabling minimization and statistical analysis of the E-field dose variability. Highlights Auxiliary dipole method (ADM) optimizes TMS coil placement in under 8 minutes Optimum coil position is up to 14 mm away from conventional targeting Optimum coil orientation is typically near normal to the sulcal wall TMS induced E-field is less sensitive to orientation than position errors","Gomez, Luis J.; Dannhauer, Moritz; Peterchev, Angel V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.120022,93

Using structural equation modeling, data processing and involvement were introduced as regulating variables. Host charm, interaction, and trust in the host exerted a significant positive impact on social presence. In addition, host charm and trust in host significantly affected flow experience, and social presence significantly affected flow experience. Both social presence and flow experience significantly affected consumption intention, while involvement affected all paths to some extent. Overall, this study illustrates the significance of host in live e-commerce, and consumers with low involvement should be the focus of attention in live e-commerce.","Wang, Haijian Ding Jianyi Akram Umair Xialei Yue Chen Yitao",Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12080324,93

To limit its spread, WHO recommended preventive measures such as hand washing frequently, social distancing, and face mask wearing. Public knowledge and practice towards the disease is important. Aim of study: We assess the level of knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 among students in Al-Bayan University. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted to gather information regarding the COVID-19 related knowledge and practices among undergraduates. This survey was conducted between October 10 till October 15,2020. Results:351 students were participated from medical and non-medical colleges by completing the questionnaire online. The overall correct answer rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 85.71% and 86.22% of them practicing preventive measures according to WHO guidelines and instructions of ministry of health(MOH). There were no significant differences in knowledge and practices between medical and non-medical. Conclusion: The students have moderate knowledge and appropriate practices towards COVID-19, this indicates the success and the efficacy of the of campaigns and the advertisements announced by WHO and the local MOH.","Salim, K.

The pattern of infections has been found to be controlled by the distinctive selection pressures exerted by fluctuating environmental nature and hosts. A total of 410 whole-genome sequences submitted by the South Asian countries were retrieved from the GISAID database and analyzed to assess the impact and pattern of mutations in this region. Most common and frequent mutations in the South Asian countries are 241C>T, 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G and about 85% SNPs are localized in ORF1ab, spike protein, and nucleocapsid. Among the identified mutations, the proportion of missense type (54.17%) was highest, followed by the synonymous (41.66%) and the non-coding types (4.17%). While analyzing transmission source in terms of geolocation, the largest clustered group from the South Asian countries was based on the G-clade (D614G) (81.7%;335/410 samples), tracing the inception and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the South Asian countries from European regions. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the South Asian strains are highly related to the South American and European strains. We found that G-clade mutations are more prevalent (96.19%) in the samples of Bangladesh which were also prevalent in the European isolates. Surprisingly, one missense mutation (1163A>T) in ORF1ab gene became dominant only in Bangladesh (78.8%), which led to debates regarding effects on the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the frequently mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants among the COVID-19 patients in the South Asian countries which might ease containment of the disease in this region through investigating the virulence reducing factors as the identified mutations are strongly correlated with low infection and mortality rate.","Mahmood, Tousif Bin Saha Ayan Hossan Mohammad Imran Mizan Shagufta Arman S.

The treatment needs for this large group of patients cannot be fully managed within the health-care system, thus developing innovative and effective follow-up strategies is urgently needed. Objectives: To explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a web-based, peer-supported exercise program for people with hip or knee OA. Methods: This study was a single-group, pre-post feasibility study. Patients aged 40-80 years with hip or knee OA who were not candidates for surgery were eligible. The 12-week intervention was delivered through a patient-organizations (The Norwegian Association for Rheumatic Diseases) web-based platforms, and included weekly exercise programs, weekly motivational messages, an OA and exercise website and assigned peer-supporters. Feasibility was evaluated by calculating the proportion of eligible patients who were enrolled and retained at follow-up, as well as time resources used on delivery of the intervention. Acceptability was evaluated by calculating proportion of patients who had valid baseline accelerometer data and completed the maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test according to protocol. Primary efficacy measures were change in PA assessed by accelerometers and change in exercise capacity (VO2peak) assessed by indirect maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test. Secondary efficacy measures were change in patient reported outcomes assessed by HOOS and KOOS (www. koos.nu) (a 10-point change in normalized scores was considered a minimally important change). Data was analysed using paired sample t-test, given as mean change (95% confidence interval) and p-values. Results: We identified 49 eligible patients of which 35 (71%) consented and were enrolled. Among those who consented, 22 (63%) were retained. Time resources used on delivery of the exercise programs and motivational messages were mean (SD) 7.3±1.1 min per week/patient. Compliance with wearing the accelerometer was mean (SD) 6.1±1.0 valid days (mean (SD) 13.8±1.3 hours/day). Twenty (67%) out of 30 patients who attended baseline testing performed the maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test, of which 18 completed according to protocol. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, follow-up testing of primary efficacy measures included only eight patients. For these patients there was a significant increase from baseline to follow-up on moderate-to-vigorous PA (mean change 16.4 minutes/day;95% CI 6.9, 25.9, p=0.005) and VO2peak (mean change 1.83 ml/ kg/min;95% CI 0.29, 3.36, p=0.026). Across all secondary efficacy measures 30-52% of the patients (n=21) improved from baseline to follow-up (Figure 1). Conclusion: Overall, the examined study processes were considered to be feasible and acceptable. Some minor amendments should be applied to improve the recruitment and retention rate before it can be carried out in a larger trial. The efficacy results should be interpreted with caution due the small sample size. However, if the positive results in this study are confirmed in a power-calculated randomised controlled trial, our novel follow-up strategy may be implemented and recommended for long-term management of hip and knee OA.","Joseph, K.

This paper presents personal narratives, authored collaboratively by lecturers Anna and Hana (pseudonyms), engaging with a socio-ecological systems framework. The systems framework presents a layered, multi-faceted approach to reveal the complexity of the impacts of Covid-19 on HE teaching and learning. In-depth analysis of the microsystems, mesosystems, and macrosystems making up their systems framework, serve to highlight specifically how Anna and Hana interpreted their own and their university students’ responses to the unprecedented measures imposed on their lifestyle (home), livelihood (employment), and HE experience (online learning). By applying an autoethnographic methodology, this paper acknowledges and celebrates the lecturers’ subjectivity, emotionality, and influence on the presented research. As educators, their critical self-reflections are authentic and timely, expressing key concerns and considerations, while searching for optimal solutions to deliver equal and equitable learning opportunities for all students. A unique characteristic of this phenomenon was the inability (due to COVID-19 restrictions) of students who learn through practical contexts, to enact kinesthetically in a meaningful manner, and the subsequent implications on their learning. This paper presents a snippet of the lecturers’ reflective practice, co-constructed from recollections, memories, and anecdotal evidence, against a backdrop of current Covid-19 research on the effects of the pandemic, on teaching and learning globally. Whilst this paper sheds light on the experiences of two HE lecturers during the COVID-19 lockdown, a collection and analysis of “student” voice, is recommended. This paper concludes that a collaborative autoethnographic approach during exceptional circumstances, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and other disruptive situations, provides an opportunity for professional self-observation and self-reflective practice that is mutually beneficial, and empowering. These insights provide shared critical knowledge to sustain achievement while averting negative impacts, for students and lecturers alike. © Copyright © 2021 Godber and Atkins.","Godber, K.

It was first identified associated with the surface of vitreous collagen fibrils and several other SLRPs are also known to bind collagen fibrils and it some cases alter fibril morphology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the binding of opticin to the collagen II-containing fibrils found in vitreous and cartilage. Electron microscopic studies using gold labelling demonstrated that opticin binds vitreous and thin cartilage collagen fibrils specifically at a single site in the gap region of the collagen D-period corresponding to the e2 stain band; this is the first demonstration of the binding site of a class III SLRP on collagen fibrils. Opticin did not bind thick cartilage collagen fibrils from cartilage or tactoids formed in vitro from collagen II, but shows high specificity for thin, heterotypic collagen fibrils containing collagens II, and XI or V/XI. Vitreous collagen fibrils from opticin null and wild-type mice were compared and no difference in fibril morphology or diameter was observed. Similarly, in vitro fibrillogenesis experiments showed that opticin did not affect fibril formation. We propose that when opticin is bound to collagen fibrils, rather than influencing their morphology it instead hinders the binding of other molecules to the fibril surfaces and/or act as an intermediary bridge linking the collagen fibrils to other non-collagenous molecules.","Hansen, Uwe; Holmes, David F.; Bruckner, Peter; Bishop, Paul N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.129403,93

However, vaccine perception and acceptance among pregnant and lactating women is unknown in Singapore. We aimed to determine the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among these two groups of women in Singapore, and factors associated with vaccine acceptance. Methods We conducted an anonymous, online survey on the perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant and lactating women at a tertiary hospital in Singapore from 1st March to 31st May 2021. Information on demographics and knowledge were collected, and these factors were assessed for their relationship with vaccine acceptance. Results A total of 201 pregnant and 207 lactating women participated. Vaccine acceptance rates in pregnant and lactating women were 30.3% and 16.9% respectively. Pregnant women who were unsure or unwilling to take the vaccine cited concerns about safety of the vaccine during pregnancy (92.9%), while lactating women were concerned about potential long-term negative effects on the breastfeeding child (75.6%). Other factors significantly associated with vaccine acceptance included a lower monthly household income or education level, appropriate knowledge regarding vaccine mechanism and higher perceived maternal risk of COVID-19. Most pregnant (70.0%) and lactating women (83.7%) were willing to take the vaccine only when more safety data during pregnancy and breastfeeding were available. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was low among pregnant and lactating women in Singapore.

175925,Editor’s Letter,2021,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized human genetics, allowing researchers to identify thousands of disease-related genes and possible drug targets. However, case-control status does not account for the fact that not all controls may have lived through their period of risk for the disorder of interest. This can be quantified by examining the age-of-onset distribution and the age of the controls or the age-of-onset for cases. The age-of-onset distribution may also depend on information such as sex and birth year. In addition, family history is not routinely included in the assessment of control status. Here we present LT-FH++, an extension of the liability threshold model conditioned on family history (LT-FH), that jointly accounts for age-of-onset and sex, as well as family history. Using simulations, we show that, when family history and the age-of-onset distribution are available, the proposed approach yields large power gains over both LT-FH and genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX). We applied our method to four psychiatric disorders available in the iPSYCH data, and to mortality in the UK Biobank, finding 20 genome-wide significant associations with LT-FH++, compared to 10 for LT-FH and 8 for a standard case-control GWAS. As more genetic data with linked electronic health records become available to researchers, we expect methods that account for additional health information, such as LT-FH++, to become even more beneficial.","Pedersen, Emil M; Agerbo, Esben; Plana-Ripoll, Oleguer; Grove, Jakob; Dreier, Julie W.; Musliner, Katherine L.; Bækvad-Hansen, Marie; Athanasiadis, Georgios; Schork, Andrew; Bybjerg-Grauholm, Jonas; Hougaard, David M.; Werge, Thomas; Nordentoft, Merete; Mors, Ole; Dalsgaard, Søren; Christensen, Jakob; Børglum, Anders D.; Mortensen, Preben B.; McGrath, John J.; Privé, Florian; Vilhjálmsson, Bjarni J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440585,93

We explored qualitatively, the vulnerabilities (characteristics that decreased resilience) and stressors that impacted intimate relationships following the initial COVID- 19 lockdown. 45 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with participants who had completed a national web-panel survey (Natsal- COVID) and agreed to follow-up. Here we draw on the accounts of 19 participants in steady relationships who reported relationship difficulties. Analysis drew on Karney and Bradbury's 'Vulnerability-stress-adaptation' model. The sample comprised 12 women and 7 men, 13 were living with their partner and 6 were not. Participant's preexisting attachment, coping, and communication styles shaped their susceptibility to relationship difficulties. The stress of COVID-19, amplified by financial strain and health issues, affected couple's ability to adapt. In live-in relationships, childcare, divisions of housework, and a lack of space in which to unwind and escape from negative behaviours intensified pressures on relationship quality. One participant described these in the context of a violent relationship that worsened during lockdown, which she had managed to leave. Participants who did not live with their partners described struggling with phone/digital communication, physical distance, and a lack of certainty in the future of their relationship. In adapting to 'pandemic life', tensions arose over how much time to spend together. Those in non-cohabiting relationships were torn between balancing risks of COVID-19 against those of not seeing each other, with many reporting feeling they had placed their relationship on hold. For some, their sex life improved their adaptation, while for others it was a further source of stress. Understanding how existing vulnerabilities interact with a stressful event to shape adaptive processes in couples' relationships might provide insights for counsellors and healthcare providers to better support couples through COVID-19..","Boso Perez, R.; Maxwell, K.; Reid, D.; Tanton, C.; Macdowall, W.; Bonell, C.; Clifton, S.; Sonnenberg, P.; Mercer, C.; Field, N.; Mitchell, K.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.350,93

Drawing from upper echelons theory, we examined whether and when the governors' political partisanship (Democratic versus Republican) mattered to the time they took to issue stay-at-home orders, which were advocated to be a strong defense to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings based on event history methodology reveal that Democratic governors took about 9 fewer days than Republican governors to issue statewide stay-at-home orders. In addition, governing discretion and governing demands exacerbated the relationship of governors' political partisanship with the time to their issuance of stay-at-home orders. For instance, when governing discretion was high, Democratic governors took 18 fewer days than Republican governors to issue stay-at-home orders. Moreover, when governing demands were high, Democratic governors took 25 fewer days than Republican governors to declare stay-at-home orders. Our findings are robust to different sets of analyses and a comprehensive set of controls. Moreover, additional analyses suggest that governors' political partisanship was also related to the issuance of reopening plans and that governing discretion and governing demands moderated the relationship.

177267,Review of Ultraviolet-C Light Against Coronavirus,2021,"Maturation of Dengue viruses (DENV) alters the structure, immunity and infectivity of the virion and highly mature particles represent the dominant form in vivo. The production of highly mature virions principally relies on the structure and function of the viral premature protein (prM) and its cleavage by the host protease furin. We developed a reliable clonal cell line which produces single-round mature DENVs without the need for DENV reverse genetics. More importantly, using protein engineering coupled with natural and directed evolution of the prM cleavage site, we engineered genetically stable mature DENVs without comprising viral yield and independent of cell, host, or passage. Using these complementary strategies to regulate maturation, we demonstrate that the resulting mature DENVs are antigenically distinct from their isogenic immature forms. Given the clinical importance of mature DENVs in immunity, our strategy provides a reliable strategy for the production of stable, high-titer mature candidate DENV live virus vaccines, genetically stabilized viruses for DENV maturation and immunity studies, and models for maturation-regulated experimental evolution in mammalian and invertebrate cells.

Treatment of pregnant women is highly efficacious but can precipitate the Jarisch-Herxheimer (JH) reaction. Symptoms of JH reaction are often transient but may include fever, uterine contractions, fetal heart rate abnormalities, and preterm labor. Because of these observations, many guidelines recommend hospitalization for fetal monitoring be considered. We sought to determine the incidence, and severity of JH reactions and the maternal and fetal outcomes following treatment. Methods Retrospective cohort study of pregnant women at >20 weeks gestation admitted to urban referral centers for treatment of infectious syphilis between 2015 and 2020. Data was extracted from a provincial database and supplemented by a review of medical records. Data collection was completed in March 2021. Results 39 women received benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of infectious syphilis in pregnancy. One mild JH reaction was identified in a patient with early latent syphilis. There were no serious maternal or fetal outcomes attributable to treatment. Average gestational age at treatment and delivery was 26 and 37 weeks respectively. Ten cases were staged as primary, 4 as secondary, and 25 as early latent syphilis. Five cases of confirmed congenital syphilis were identified. Further analysis of results is underway. Conclusions Data from our study challenges the recommendation for routine admission for the treatment of infectious syphilis in late pregnancy as no moderate or severe JH reactions were identified in our cohort. Further research is required to determine if a subgroup of women not identified in our cohort are at risk for moderate or severe JH reaction. These findings are timely given the global resurgence of infectious syphilis as inpatient resources continue to be strained by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic..","Macumber, S.; Singh, A.; Robinson, J.; Smyczek, P.; Sklar, C.; Gratrix, J.; Rathjen, L.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.455,93
177767,2020: The year a viral asteroid collided with planet earth,2020,"The COVID-19 ""infodemic""has resulted in the widespread dissemination of counterfeit medical advice, hoaxes, fake products, and phoney information about the virus and responses. As a result, computational methods for determining any information's authenticity to improve trust in public health awareness and policy decisions are profoundly discussed in the scientific community. Even before the pandemic, mis- and disinformation, including fake news, have been observed in the online world in significant numbers for numerous business, political and personal reasons. Moreover, many of these fake news was published from sources believed to be reliable. In contrast, some other fake news was fabricated in a way that would be easily trusted and shared by the general people in social media. COVID-19 related fake news has enormous effects on both the offline and online community, and thus, it challenges government initiatives for proper health intervention. Therefore, interest in research in this area has risen to understand the problem both socially and technically. In this paper, we attempt to understand how we can help student Internet users of colleges from the lower-middle-income country, Bangladesh, in Southeast Asia, to distinguish COVID-19 misinformation. Our study reveals that providing related news as supplementary information to any online news helps students make better decision about news authenticity. Statistical analyses on the survey data show that male students were found to be more accurate than female students to detect mis- and disinformation;students from the urban areas could detect misleading news better than students from villages;and that students from Science background demonstrated overall best performance, while students from Madrasah background, who are all male, could not produce a significant improvement. We conclude that the female students in general and male students of Madrasah, who spend the least amount of time online among all the student Internet users, are the most vulnerable groups to fake news. © 2021 ACM.","Uddin, B.; Reza, N.; Islam, M.

In bioinformatics, alignment-free (AF) sequence analysis methods offer a natural framework to investigate and understand the patterns and inherent properties of biological sequences. Thus, AF methods are used in this paper for the analysis and comparison of COVID-19 genome sequences. First, frequent patterns of nucleotide base(s) in COVID-19 genome sequences are extracted. Second, the similarity/dissimilarity between COVID-19 genome sequences are measured with different AF methods. This allows to compare sequences and evaluate the performance of various distance measures employed in AF methods. Lastly, the phylogeny for the COVID-19 genome sequences are constructed with various AF methods as well as the consensus tree that shows the level of support (agreement) among phylogenetic trees built by various AF methods. Obtained results show that AF methods can be used efficiently for the analysis of COVID-19 genome sequences. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nawaz, M.

Methods: Using 3 claims and 1 EHR database, we evaluate several variants of the case-control, comparative cohort, historical comparator, and self-controlled designs against historical vaccinations with real negative control outcomes (outcomes with no evidence to suggest that they could be caused by the vaccines) and simulated positive controls. Results: Most methods show large type 1 error, often identifying false positive signals. The cohort method appears either positively or negatively biased, depending on the choice of comparator index date. Empirical calibration using effect-size estimates for negative control outcomes can restore type 1 error to close to nominal, often at the cost of increasing type 2 error. After calibration, the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design shows the shortest time to detection for small true effect sizes, while the historical comparator performs well for strong effects. Conclusions: When applying any method for vaccine safety surveillance we recommend considering the potential for systematic error, especially due to confounding, which for many designs appears to be substantial. Adjusting for age and sex alone is likely not sufficient to address the differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and for the cohort method the choice of index date plays an important role in the comparability of the groups Inclusion of negative control outcomes allows both quantification of the systematic error and, if so desired, subsequent empirical calibration to restore type 1 error to its nominal value. In order to detect weaker signals, one may have to accept a higher type 1 error.","Schuemie, M. J.; Arshad, F.; Pratt, N.; Nyberg, F.; Alshammari, T. M.; Hripcsak, G.; Ryan, P.

179235,Securing Land Rights for All through Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration Approach: The Case of Nepal,2021,"A detailed understanding of how and when SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs is crucial for designing effective prevention measures. Other than contact tracing, genome sequencing provides information to help infer who infected whom. However, the effectiveness of the genomic approach in this context depends on both (high enough) mutation and (low enough) transmission rates. Today, the level of resolution that we can obtain when describing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks using just genomic information alone remains unclear. In order to answer this question, we sequenced 49 SARS-CoV-2 patient samples from ten local clusters for which partial epidemiological information was available, and inferred transmission history using genomic variants. Importantly, we obtained high-quality genomic data, sequencing each sample twice and using unique barcodes to exclude cross-sample contamination. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses showed that consensus genomes were generally sufficient to discriminate among independent transmission clusters. However, levels of intrahost variation were low, which prevented in most cases the unambiguous identification of direct transmission events. After filtering out recurrent variants across clusters, the genomic data were generally compatible with the epidemiological information but did not support specific transmission events over possible alternatives. We estimated the effective transmission bottleneck size to be 1-2 viral particles for sample pairs whose donor-recipient relationship was likely. Our analyses suggest that intrahost genomic variation in SARS-CoV-2 might be generally limited and that homoplasy and recurrent errors complicate identifying shared intrahost variants. Reliable reconstruction of direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission based solely on genomic data seems hindered by a slow mutation rate, potential convergent events, and technical artifacts. Detailed contact tracing seems essential in most cases to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission at high resolution.","Gallego-Garcia, P.; Varela, N.; Estevez-Gomez, N.; De Chiara, L.; Fernandez-Silva, I.; Valverde, D.; Sapoval, N.; Treangen, T.; Regueiro, B.; Cabrera-Alvargonzalez, J.

179519,Complex Sequential Data Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review of Existing Algorithms,2020-07-22,"In 2019, COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, infecting billions of people and disrupting the normal lives of citizens in every country. Governments, organizations, and research institutions all over the world are dedicating vast resources to research effective strategies to fight this rapidly propagating virus. With virus testing, most countries publish the number of confirmed cases, dead cases, recovered cases, and locations routinely through various channels and forms. This important data source has enabled researchers worldwide to perform different COVID-19 scientific studies, such as modeling this virus's spreading patterns, developing prevention strategies, and studying the impact of COVID-19 on other aspects of society. However, one major challenge is that there is no standardized, updated, and high-quality data product that covers COVID-19 cases data internationally. This is because different countries may publish their data in unique channels, formats, and time intervals, which hinders researchers from fetching necessary COVID-19 datasets effectively, especially for fine-scale studies. Although existing solutions such as John's Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard and 1point3acres COVID-19 tracker are widely used, it is difficult for users to access their original dataset and customize those data to meet specific requirements in categories, data structure, and data source selection. To address this challenge, we developed a toolset using cloud-based web scraping to extract, refine, unify, and store COVID-19 cases data at multiple scales for all available countries around the world automatically. The toolset then publishes the data for public access in an effective manner, which could offer users a real time COVID-19 dynamic dataset with a global view. Two case studies are presented about how to utilize the datasets. This toolset can also be easily extended to fulfill other purposes with its open-source nature.","Lan, H.; Sha, D. X.; Malarvizhi, A.

179983,Exhibition Review,2021,"Despite the widespread use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in research and clinical care, the underlying mechanisms-of-actions that mediate modulatory effects remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we studied dose–response functions of TMS for modulation of visual processing. Our approach combined electroencephalography (EEG) with application of single pulse TMS to visual cortex as participants performed a motion perception task. During participants’ first visit, motion coherence thresholds, 64-channel visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and TMS resting motor thresholds (RMT) were measured. In second and third visits, single pulse TMS was delivered 30 ms before the onset of motion or at the onset latency of the N2 VEP component derived from the first session. TMS was delivered at 0%, 80%, 100%, or 120% of RMT over the site of N2 peak activity, or at 120% over vertex. Behavioral results demonstrated a significant main effect of TMS timing on accuracy, with better performance when TMS was applied at N2-Onset timing versus Pre-Onset, as well as a significant interaction, indicating that 80% intensity produced higher accuracy than other conditions. TMS effects on VEPs showed reduced amplitudes in the 80% Pre-Onset condition, an increase for the 120% N2-Onset condition, and monotonic amplitude scaling with stimulation intensity. The N2 component was not affected by TMS. These findings reveal dose–response relationships between intensity and timing of TMS on visual perception and electrophysiological brain activity, generally indicating greater facilitation at stimulation intensities below RMT.","Gamboa Arana, Olga Lucia; Palmer, Hannah; Dannhauer, Moritz; Hile, Connor; Liu, Sicong; Hamdan, Rena; Brito, Alexandra; Cabeza, Roberto; Davis, Simon W.; Peterchev, Angel V.; Sommer, Marc A.; Appelbaum, Lawrence G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.151118,93

The multi-variant problem requires an operator to understand that the machining input parameters and choice of tooling will dictate the efficiency of generating surfaces with the appropriate tolerances. Ge is a brittle material and exhibits surface fracture when diamond turned. However, with the introduction of a negatively raked tool, surface fracture can be suppressed such that plastic flow of the material is possible. This paper focuses on the application and evaluation of machine learning methods to better assist the prediction of surface roughness parameters in Ge and provides a comparison with a well-understood ductile material, copper (Cu). Preliminary results show that both classic machine learning (ML) methods and artificial neural network (ANN) models offer improved predictive capability when compared with analytical prediction of surface roughness for both materials. Significantly, ML and ANN models were able to perform well for both Ge, a brittle material prone to surface fracture, and the more ductile Cu. ANN models offered the best prediction tool overall with minimal error. From a computational perspective, both ML and ANN models were able to achieve good results with smaller datasets than typical for many ML applications—which is beneficial since diamond turning can be costly.","Sizemore, Nicholas E.; Nogueira, Monica L.; Greis, Noel P.; Davies, Matthew A.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315948; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315948,93
180620,An online headphone screening test based on dichotic pitch,2020-10-14,"The adenosine analogue Galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, has entered a Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics study in healthy subjects and is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus infection. Moreover, Galidesivir also inhibits the reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and numerous other medically important flaviviruses. Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded resistant viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an E460D substitution, in the active site of TBEV RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), confers resistance to Galidesivir in cell culture. Stochastic molecular simulations indicate that the steric freedom caused by the E460D substitution increases close electrostatic interactions between the inhibitor and the interrogation residue of the TBEV RdRp motif F, resulting in rejection of the analogue as an incorrect/modified nucleotide. Galidesivir-resistant TBEV exhibited no cross-resistance to structurally different antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine, 2’-C-methyladenosine and 4’-azido-aracytidine. Although, the E460D substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in vivo, with 100% survival rate and no clinical signs observed in infected mice. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity, flavivirus resistance to nucleoside inhibitors and the potential contribution of viral RdRp to flavivirus neurovirulence. Importance Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in large areas of Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. We have previously found that Galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, which is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus infection, has a strong antiviral effect against TBEV. For any antiviral drug, it is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works. Here, we produced TBEV mutants resistant to Galidesivir and found that the resistance is caused by a single amino acid substitution in an active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme which is crucial for replication of viral RNA genome. Although, this substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity.","Eyer, Ludek; Nougairède, Antoine; Uhlířová, Marie; Driouich, Jean-Sélim; Zouharová, Darina; Valdés, James J.; Haviernik, Jan; Gould, Ernest A.; De Clercq, Erik; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Ruzek, Daniel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/563544,93

As a result, pricing, distribution, and customer communication policies have also undergone significant changes. The experience of many foreign countries, as well as events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a sharp and thorough transition to digitalization of the economy and the use of the latest technologies in retail. Russia is directly affected by these changes, because our country needs to maintain a decent level of the market, not worse than foreign ones, and offer Russian citizens high-quality products through various marketing innovations, thereby attracting buyers to the trade process and supporting the economy at the proper level. Moreover, the economic downturn against the background of the coronavirus has pushed many businessmen to make significant changes in the conduct of trade, including the digitalization of many of their services, as the behavior of Russian consumers has significantly transformed. There was a sudden transition to online trading, and firms had to adapt rapidly in the field of Internet marketing. Consumers always try to choose the best quality product for the best price for them, especially strong savings are shown now, in the period after a severe economic recession against the background of a pandemic. This indicates a rationalization of consumer preferences. Also, an important criterion in consumer choice is the impression of a purchase, especially after almost all organizations were closed for quarantine, and people lost their usual trips to shops and shopping centers. Thus, rationalism and consumer emotions force a person to make a choice when buying a particular product, and firms that want to make a good profit and promote their products and services to the masses must adapt as soon as possible to the new requirements of consumers and market conditions. © 2020.

Household questionnaires with standardized cases (intentions) were compared to self-recall of health events (behaviors). The connectedness of households and their providers was determined by network analysis. Results. A total of 568 households (incorporating 2900 members) and 65 providers were enrolled. Households reported 636 health events in the prior month. Households sought care for 35% (n=220) and treated with home remedies for 44% (n=277). The odds of seeking care increased 217% for severe events (aOR=3.17; 95%CI 1.99-5.05; p< 0.001). The odds of seeking care from a conventional provider increased by 37% with increasing distance (aOR=1.37; 95%CI 1.06-1.79; p=0.016). Despite stating an intention to seek care from conventional providers, there was a lack of congruence in practice that favored non-conventional providers (McNemar's Chi-squared Test p<0.001). Care was sought from primary providers for 68% (n=150) of cases within a three-tiered network; 25% (n=38/150) were non-conventional. Conclusion. Addressing geographic barriers, possibly with technology solutions, should be prioritized to meet healthcare seeking intentions while developing approaches to connect non-conventional providers into healthcare networks when geographic barriers cannot be overcome.","Klarman, M.; Schon, J.; Cajusma, Y.; Maples, S.; Beau de Rochars, V.

183249,A Message from the Editor-in-Chief,2020-12-23,"The recent widespread pandemic of COVID-19 has put tremendous pressure on the healthcare system. The deployment of telehealth technology is crucial in solving this problem when patients are mildly ill and need to self-isolate at home or in a specific location. This paper proposes using a single radar sensor to continuously contact-less monitor the patients' vital signals in their daily lives. We use edge computing to handle high-priory tasks and combined cloud infrastructure for further process and storage to provide monitoring and telehealth services. A case study is presented to show how the approach can continuously monitor and recognize high-risk diseases and abnormal activity (e.g., sleep apnea). While an accident occurs, the system could provide fast and accurate emergency services. The work has been compared with a good standard. And the experimental results show that the proposed approach for heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) detection achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ± Standard Deviation of Absolute Error (SDAE) of 0.09±1.43 bpm and 0.23±3.23 bpm, respectively. This indicates the radar sensor can provide a high recognition accuracy to meet the requirements for a range of cardiopulmonary function monitoring. This kind of telemedicine service facilitates monitoring the self-isolated subjects to detect and recognize human physical and physiological activities. © 2021 IEEE.","Li, Q.; Liu, J.; Gravina, R.; Li, Y.; Fortino, G.","17th IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, BSN 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/bsn51625.2021.9507032,93

Although cryo-EM has been drastically improved to generate high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) maps that contain detailed structural information about macromolecules, the computational methods for using the data to automatically build structure models are lagging far behind. The traditional cryo-EM model building approach is template-based homology modeling. Manual de novo modeling is very time-consuming when no template model is found in the database. In recent years, de novo cryo-EM modeling using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has ranked among the top-performing methods in macromolecular structure modeling. Deep-learning-based de novo cryo-EM modeling is an important application of artificial intelligence, with impressive results and great potential for the next generation of molecular biomedicine. Accordingly, we systematically review the representative ML/DL-based de novo cryo-EM modeling methods. And their significances are discussed from both practical and methodological viewpoints. We also briefly describe the background of cryo-EM data processing workflow. Overall, this review provides an introductory guide to modern research on artificial intelligence (AI) for de novo molecular structure modeling and future directions in this emerging field.","Si, Dong; Nakamura, Andrew; Tang, Runbang; Guan, Haowen; Hou, Jie; Firozi, Ammaar; Cao, Renzhi; Hippe, Kyle; Zhao, Minglei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06125v2.pdf,93

Unfortunately, the knowledge on behaviours of households when they face a food shortage in these situations is under-reported in the literature. Our paper contributes to the covering of this gap by presenting the food consumption and livelihood-based coping mechanisms used by households in Western Bahr el Ghazal in South Sudan, distinguishing between rural areas and the Wau Protection of Civilian camp. We used a descriptive research design and unique primary data collected by the submission of a survey to a sample of 838 households from July–August 2020. In the alarming hunger situation in the investigated areas, households deeply use coping mechanisms independently of their food security status. The majority of them are at the breakdown of their coping ability. The behaviours used by households indicate a wider social catastrophe that the long-term consequences of these mechanisms can further accentuate. Food assistance resulted in a relatively better situation in the Wau Protection of Civilian camp. The paper confirms the centrality of a humanitarian-development-peace approach to food security in the investigated area, where the support of livelihood strategies and opportunities for households and the promotion of sound institutions have paramount roles.","Sassi, Maria",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158615,93
185505,A lawyer with the Hygeia touch.,2004,"Background: While international guidelines recommend medication reviews as part of the management of multimorbidity, evidence on how to implement reviews in practice in primary care is lacking. The MyComrade (MultimorbiditY Collaborative Medication Review And Decision Making) intervention is an evidence-based, theoretically-informed novel intervention which aims to support the conduct of medication reviews for patients with multimorbidity in primary care. Our aim in this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a trial of the intervention with unique modifications accounting for contextual variations in two neighbouring health systems (Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI)). Methods: A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted, using a mixed methods process evaluation to investigate the feasibility of a trial of the MyComrade intervention. A total of 16 practices will be recruited (eight in ROI; eight in NI) and four practices in each jurisdiction will be randomly allocated to intervention or control. Twenty people living with multimorbidity and prescribed [≥]10 repeat medications will be recruited from each practice prior to practice randomisation. In intervention practices, the MyComrade intervention will be delivered by pairs of GPs in ROI, and a GP and Practice Based Pharmacist (PBP) in NI. The GPs/GP and PBP will schedule time to review medications together using a checklist. Usual care will proceed in practices in the control arm. Data will be collected via electronic health records and postal questionnaires at recruitment, and 4- and 8-months after randomisation. Qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and explore experiences related to multimorbidity management will be conducted with a purposive sample of GPs, PBPs, practice administration staff and patients in intervention and control practices. The feasibility of conducting a health economic evaluation as part of a future definitive trial will be assessed. Discussion: The findings of this pilot study will assess the feasibility of a trial of the MyComrade intervention in two different health systems. Evaluation of the progression criteria will guide the decision to progress to a definitive trial and inform trial design. The findings will also contribute to the growing evidence-base related to intervention development and feasibility studies.","MyComrade Research Team,; Hynes, L.; Kirwan, c.; Murphy, A.

However, by sanitizing and stabilizing the organic matter of sewage sludge, agriculture can utilize it to maintain soil, water, and air quality. As ingredients in soil amendments, such bioresidues are a source of nutrients for plants. Stabilization and sanitation of sewage sludge safely couple its recycling and disposal. This coupling becomes increasingly important as economic and environmental constraints make strategies for waste disposal more difficult to apply. The occurrence of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and zooparasites in sewage sludge is reviewed in this article, and consequential epidemiologic concerns that arise from sewage sludge recycling is also addressed.","Dumontet, S; Scopa, A; Kerje, S; Krovacek, K",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417676/,93

188932,The Australian response: pandemic influenza preparedness.,2006,"BACKGROUND A portable automated component collection system that produces double (2) units of leukoreduced RBCs (DRBCs) from a single donation was evaluated. This study analyzed quality of the collected and final products, the efficacy of automated leukoreduction, and donor safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The system was used to collect 120 DRBCs. WBCs were removed from 90 products with machine-controlled filtration. DRBCs were collected in ACD-A and stored in AS-1 for 42 days at 1 to 6 degrees C. Pre- and postprocedure donor vital signs and hematologic parameters were measured. Procedure time, product characteristics, and adverse events were also recorded. In vitro studies were performed on all products on Day 0 and at end of storage. In vivo recoveries of 28 leukoreduced and 9 nonleukoreduced products were measured on Day 42. RESULTS Day 0 mean percentage of hemolysis for leukoreduced and nonleukoreduced units was 0.05 percent. DRBCs had residual WBC counts of less than 1 x 106 cells per unit and mean RBC recovery after filtration of 91.9 +/- 2.7 percent. Mean 24-hour recovery after infusion for leukoreduced units at end of storage was 80.9 +/- 6.9 percent and nonleukoreduced units was 77.6 +/- 5.8 percent (p> 0.05). No clinically significant changes in donor vital signs or serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS The quality of leukoreduced RBCs collected with this portable automated component collection system met or exceeded FDA requirements. This automated system is safe and effective for collection and processing of 2 units of RBCs suitable for transfusion.","Snyder, Edward L; Elfath, M Dean; Taylor, Harry; Rugg, Neeta; Greenwalt, Tibor J; Baril, Laurene; Whitley, Pamela; Brantigan, Barbara; Story, Ken",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641866/,93
189104,The Great American Smokeout.,1978,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic surgery may become the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal disease. Little is known regarding North American patterns of practice or the limiting factors and strategies for adoption among surgeons. METHODS We sent a 28-item questionnaire to all general surgeon members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. We derived descriptive and correlative information using chi(2), Wilcoxon rank sum and Student t tests and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The return rate was 55% (694/1266). A total of 67% (462/694; 95% confidence interval 63%-70%) of respondents perform colorectal surgery. Of these, 54% perform laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Multivariate logistic regression identified 5 factors related to performing laparoscopic colorectal surgery: fewer years in practice (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.015), practising in the province of Quebec (p = 0.005), university-hospital affiliation (p = 0.034) and minimally invasive surgery fellowship training (p = 0.023). Lack of adequate operating time and formal training were the main reasons cited by surgeons not offering laparoscopic colon resections. Most surgeons (67%) felt that site visits from a minimally invasive surgeon would represent the most effective training method for acquiring advanced laparoscopic skills. CONCLUSION About half of Canadian general surgeons offer laparoscopic colorectal resections. Recent graduation, male sex, practice location, university-hospital affiliation and minimally invasive surgery training are significant predictors for offering a laparoscopic approach. Lack of operative time and formal training are the main barriers to adoption of the technique. Site visits by trained laparoscopic surgeons is the preferred method of acquiring advanced skills.","Moloo, Husein; Haggar, Fatima; Martel, Guillaume; Grimshaw, Jeremy; Coyle, Doug; Graham, Ian D; Sabri, Elham; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Balaa, Fady K; Boushey, Robin P",Canadian journal of surgery.

189667,International Abstracts.,2021-03-31,"The right to health relevant information derives from the principles of autonomy and self direction and has been recognised in international declarations. Providing accurate health information is part of the basis for obtaining ""informed consent"" and is a recognised component of business ethics, safety communications, and case and product liability law. Remarkably, anti-tobacco and pro-tobacco sources alike have come to emphasise the message that there is ""no safe cigarette"" or ""no safe tobacco product"". We propose that the ""no safe"" message is so limited in its value that it represents a violation of the right to health relevant information. There is a need to go beyond saying, ""there is no safe tobacco product"" to indicate information on degree of risks. The ""no safe tobacco"" message does not contradict, for example, the mistaken belief that so called light or low tar cigarettes are safer choices than higher tar cigarettes. We encourage a kind of ""rule utilitarian"" ethical position in which the principle of truth telling is observed while trying to produce the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Although harm reduction approaches to easing the burden of tobacco related diseases are founded on science based comparative risk information, the right to health information is independently related to the need to promote health literacy. This right should be respected whether or not harm reduction policies are judged advisable.","Kozlowski, L T; Edwards, B Q",Tobacco control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16046699/,93

Chinese measures of job satisfaction for individuals with mental illness are however extremely scarce. The aim of this study was to translate the 32-item Indiana Job Satisfaction Scale to Chinese. By means of the expert panel method, the culturally relevant 28-item Chinese Version of Indiana Job Satisfaction Scale (CV-IJSS) was then finalized. A validation study among a group of 125 individuals with mental illness showed that the scale had acceptable psychometric properties. Coefficient alpha of the total score was 0.81 with subscales ranging from 0.63 to 0.87. Test re-test reliability as measured by ICC was 0.77 for the total score and ranged from 0.54 to 0.72 for the subscales. Factorial analysis yielded a four factor solution (general satisfaction, job ambiguity and stress, advancement and security, and job recognition) accounting for 44% of the total variance. The factor solution had similarities as well as differences when compared with the Indiana Job Satisfaction Scale. The differences are discussed in the light of cultural differences. Relationship between scores of CV-IJSS and work performance, quality of life and self-esteem was positive in general which may act as evidence to its concurrent validity. The Chinese Version of Indiana Job Satisfaction Scale is ready for use by rehabilitation professionals to assess vocational rehabilitation outcome for individuals with mental illness in Hong Kong and other Chinese societies. Directions for further studies are suggested.","Tsang, Hector W H; Wong, Alvin",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16048246/,93

METHODS Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","Wang, Jincheng; Liu, Jinpeng; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Wei; Chen, Xiaoqun; Sun, Chao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Qidong; Wu, Yaping; Liang, Wenjie; Ruan, Lingxiang",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Up to now, there have been no specific drugs to protect against SARS-CoV infection, thus developing effective strategies against this newly emerged viral infection warrants urgent efforts. Adoptive immune therapy with pathogen-specific heterologous immunoglobulin has been successfully used to control the dissemination of many viral infections. To investigate whether a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV raised in an artiodactylous host can have a protective role on primate cells, we prepared serum IgGs and their pepsin-digested F(ab')2 fragments from horses inoculated with purified SARS-CoV (BJ-01 strain). The protective effect of the F(ab')2 fragments against SARS-CoV infection was determined in cultured Vero E6 cells by cytopathic effect (CPE), MTT and plaque-forming assays and in a Balb/c mouse model by CPE and quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed the neutralization titres of F(ab')2 from three horses all reached at least 1:1600, and 50 microg of the F(ab')2 fragments could completely neutralize 1x10(4) TCID50- SARS-CoV in vivo. Additionally, we observed that F(ab')2, against BJ-01 strain could also protect cells from infection by the variant GZ-01 strain in vitro and in vivo.

Significant disease first appeared in cattle. Subsequently, the zoonotic danger of the organism was recognized in HIV-infected persons and young children. Cryptosporidium are now ubiquitous and disease has been described in over 79 host species. Cryptosporidiosis has become a major cause of calfhood diarrhea worldwide. In humans it accounts for up to 20% of all cases of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and is a potentially fatal complication of AIDS. Waterborne contamination is a growing concern as a source of widespread outbreaks of disease. Factors that have contributed to the emergence of cryptosporidiosis in animals include biological features of the organism, the lack of an effective treatment or preventative, increased environmental contamination, and trends in livestock production. In humans the zoonotic nature of infection and an increased at-risk population have contributed to disease. Genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium, improved detection methods, and a better understanding of the factors that predispose to disease are important contributions to understanding the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis.","Mosier, D A; Oberst, R D",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11193609/,93

200482,SlAide2Voice: A new educational tool for students with visual disabilities,2021,"PURPOSE First rib resection is a key component of the treatment of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS). We report our experience with, and technique for, robotic first rib resection. METHODS Patients diagnosed with TOS underwent robotic first rib resection of the offending portion of the first rib with disarticulation of the costo-sternal joint. Definitive diagnosis of TOS was made by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) with maneuvers. RESULTS A total of 67 patients underwent robotic first rib resection. Neurogenic TOS: 39 patients underwent robotic resection for Neurologic Symptoms of the upper extremity (Neurogenic TOS). There were 14 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 34 ± 9.5 years. Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) or Venous TOS: 28 patients underwent transthoracic robotic first rib resection for PSS. There were 16 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 24 ± 8.5 years. Operative time was 87.6 ± 10.8 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 days with a median hospitalization of 3 days. There were no neurovascular complications. There was no mortality. In patients with Neurogenic TOS, QuickDASH Scores (mean ± SEM) decreased from 60.3 ± 2.1 preoperatively to 5 ± 2.3 in the immediate postoperative period and to 3.5 ± 1.1 at 6 months (p<0001). Immediate relief of symptoms was seen in 35/39 patients (91%). Persistent paresthesia was seen in 4/39 (9%) immediately postop, and in 2/39 (2.5%) at 6 months. Thirty-seven of 39 (97.5%) patients reported complete relief of symptoms. Among patients with PSS or Venous TOS, 9/28 (32%) required endovascular venoplasty to completely open the subclavian vein after the relief of extrinsic compression. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients with PSS had an open subclavian vein, for a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS Robotic transthoracic first rib resection allows for minimally invasive resection of the first rib in patients with TOS, with excellent relief of symptoms and no neurovascular complications.","Gharagozloo, Farid; Meyer, Mark; Tempesta, Barbara; Werden, Scott",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31821522/,93

OBJECTIVE To provide a comprehensive epidemiologic account of a SARS outbreak from an affected territory. DESIGN Epidemiologic analysis. SETTING The 2003 Hong Kong SARS outbreak. PARTICIPANTS All 1755 cases and 302 deaths. MEASUREMENTS Sociodemographic characteristics; infection clusters by time, occupation, setting, and workplace; and geospatial relationships were determined. The mean and variance in the time from infection to onset (incubation period) were estimated in a small group of patients with known exposure. The mean and variance in time from onset to admission, from admission to discharge, or from admission to death were calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify important predictors of case fatality. RESULTS 49.3% of patients were infected in clinics, hospitals, or elderly or nursing homes, and the Amoy Gardens cluster accounted for 18.8% of cases. The ratio of women to men among infected individuals was 5:4. Health care workers accounted for 23.1% of all reported cases. The estimated mean incubation period was 4.6 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.8 days). Mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization varied between 2 and 8 days, decreasing over the course of the epidemic. Mean time from onset to death was 23.7 days (CI, 22.0 to 25.3 days), and mean time from onset to discharge was 26.5 days (CI, 25.8 to 27.2 days). Increasing age, male sex, atypical presenting symptoms, presence of comorbid conditions, and high lactate dehydrogenase level on admission were associated with a greater risk for death. LIMITATIONS Estimates of the incubation period relied on statistical assumptions because few patients had known exposure times. Temporal changes in case management as the epidemic progressed, unavailable treatment information, and several potentially important factors that could not be thoroughly analyzed because of the limited sample size complicate interpretation of factors related to case fatality. CONCLUSIONS This analysis of the complete data on the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong has revealed key epidemiologic features of the epidemic as it evolved.","Leung, Gabriel M; Hedley, Anthony J; Ho, Lai-Ming; Chau, Patsy; Wong, Irene O L; Thach, Thuan Q; Ghani, Azra C; Donnelly, Christl A; Fraser, Christophe; Riley, Steven; Ferguson, Neil M; Anderson, Roy M; Tsang, Thomas; Leung, Pak-Yin; Wong, Vivian; Chan, Jane C K; Tsui, Eva; Lo, Su-Vui; Lam, Tai-Hing",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15520422/,93

This qualitative study aimed to assess the main promoting and hindering factors for breastfeeding support in Lebanese daycare centers (DCCs), through the perspective of their directors and employees. The study was based on semi-structured interviews with 13 directors and 9 employees. It explored the influence of various cognitive factors as well as different environment types (physical, economic, political, and sociocultural) on their breastfeeding support. Findings suggested the directors and employees valued improving breastfeeding support in DCCs and the physical set-up of the DCCs allowed for this. However, various other factors restricted their abilities to support breastfeeding in the DCC, including limited knowledge and training on the topic, absence of written internal policies on breastfeeding, lack of enforcement in the application of national policies, and the current mothers' work policies that negatively influenced the decision to breastfeed. Improvements could be achieved through integrated interventions, targeting the interaction of internal DCCs factors and national and DCCs breastfeeding policies, as well as several social factors, to create a multilevel approach targeting breastfeeding continuation support in breastfeeding-friendly DCCs in Lebanon and the region.","Abou Jaoude, Maya; Moukarzel, Sara; Kremers, Stef P J; Gubbels, Jessica S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

In the present review, we intend to focus on how the basal activation state of the RAGE axis in common preexisting conditions in DM patients such as endothelial dysfunction and hyperglycemia-related prothrombotic phenotype, as well as the contribution of RAGE signaling in lung inflammation, may then lead to the increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in these patients. Additionally, the cross-talk between the RAGE axis with either another severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor molecule different of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or the renin-angiotensin system imbalance produced by viral infection, as well as the role of this multi-ligand receptor on the obesity-associated low-grade inflammation in the higher risk for severe illness reported in diabetes patients with COVID-19, are also discussed.","Rojas, A.; Lindner, C.; Gonzalez, I.; Morales, M.

205336,A Report from the Field: Providing Psychoanalytic Care during the Pandemic,2021,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, where they mediate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Excessive AMPAR activation leads to diseases such as epilepsy. AMPAR properties are modulated by auxiliary proteins and foremost by the Transmembrane AMPAR Regulatory Proteins (TARPs). These distribute in unique expression patterns across the brain, rendering AMPAR/TARP complexes promising targets for region-specific therapeutic intervention. TARP ð¾8 is predominantly expressed in the forebrain and is enriched in the hippocampus, a region associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Recent high-throughput medicinal chemistry screens have identified multiple promising compounds that selectively target AMPARs associated with ð¾8 and hold promise for epilepsy treatment. However, how these modulators target the receptor complex is currently unknown. Here, we use a combination of ligand docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrophysiology to address this question. We identify a conserved oxindole isostere, shared between three structurally diverse modulators (LY-3130481, JNJ-55511118 and JNJ-61432059) as the major module engaging ð¾8 by an H-bond to N172 (ð¾8). The remaining variable region of each molecule likely targets the receptor complex in ligand-selective modes. Functional data reveal parallels in the underlying modulatory action of two prominent compounds. This work will aid development of refined AMPAR epilepsy therapeutics, and facilitate to uncover the mechanisms by which TARPs modulate the receptor.","Dohrke, Jan-Niklas; Watson, Jake F; Birchall, Kristian; Greger, Ingo H",J. biol. chem,,93

Headache is common in PRES, though headache associated with PRES was not identified as a separate entity in the 2018 International Classification of Headache Disorders. Here, we review the relevant literature and suggest criteria for consideration of its inclusion. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has been identified as a potential risk factor for PRES, with a prevalence of 1-4% in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing neuroimaging, thus making a discussion of its identification and treatment particularly timely given the ongoing global pandemic at the time of this writing. PRES is a neuro-clinical syndrome with specific imaging findings. The clinical manifestations of PRES include headache, seizures, encephalopathy, visual disturbances, and focal neurologic deficits. Associations with PRES include renal failure, preeclampsia and eclampsia, autoimmune conditions, and immunosuppression. PRES is theorized to be a syndrome of disordered autoregulation and endothelial dysfunction resulting in preferential hyperperfusion of the posterior circulation. Treatment typically focuses on treating the underlying cause and removal of the offending agents.","Gewirtz, Alexandra N; Gao, Virginia; Parauda, Sarah C; Robbins, Matthew S",Curr Pain Headache Rep,,93

210653,Boosting Immunity of the Registered Reports System in Psychology to the Pandemic,2020,"The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which first appeared in China in December 2019, has pervaded throughout the world. Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown's Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17-31 May. ARIMA models can be used in fresh outbreak situations to ensure health and safety. It is vital to make quick and accurate decisions on the precautions for epidemic preparedness and management, so corrective and preventive actions can be updated considering obtained values.","Guleryuz, Didem",,,93

211430,Everyday human cognition and behaviour,2020,"We developed a new mutationally well-balanced 32 Y-STR multiplex (CombYplex) together with a machine learning (ML) program PredYMaLe to assess the impact of STR mutability on haplogourp prediction, while respecting forensic community criteria (high DC/HD). We designed CombYplex around two sub-panels M1 and M2 characterized by average and high-mutation STR panels. Using these two sub-panels, we tested how our program PredYmale reacts to mutability when considering basal branches and, moving down, terminal branches. We tested first the discrimination capacity of CombYplex on 996 human samples using various forensic and statistical parameters and showed that its resolution is sufficient to separate haplogroup classes. In parallel, PredYMaLe was designed and used to test whether a ML approach can predict haplogroup classes from Y-STR profiles. Applied to our kit, SVM and Random Forest classifiers perform very well (average 97 %), better than Neural Network (average 91 %) and Bayesian methods (< 90 %). We observe heterogeneity in haplogroup assignation accuracy among classes, with most haplogroups having high prediction scores (99-100 %) and two (E1b1b and G) having lower scores (67 %). The small sample sizes of these classes explain the high tendency to misclassify the Y-profiles of these haplogroups; results were measurably improved as soon as more training data were added. We provide evidence that our ML approach is a robust method to accurately predict haplogroups when it is combined with a sufficient number of markers, well-balanced mutation rate Y-STR panels, and large ML training sets. Further research on confounding factors (such as CNV-STR or gene conversion) and ideal STR panels in regard to the branches analysed can be developed to help classifiers further optimize prediction scores.","Bouakaze, Caroline; Delehelle, Franklin; Saenz-Oyhéréguy, Nancy; Moreira, Andreia; Schiavinato, Stéphanie; Croze, Myriam; Delon, Solène; Fortes-Lima, Cesar; Gibert, Morgane; Bujan, Louis; Huyghe, Eric; Bellis, Gil; Calderon, Rosario; Hernández, Candela Lucia; Avendaño-Tamayo, Efren; Bedoya, Gabriel; Salas, Antonio; Mazières, Stéphane; Charioni, Jacques; Migot-Nabias, Florence; Ruiz-Linares, Andres; Dugoujon, Jean-Michel; Thèves, Catherine; Mollereau-Manaute, Catherine; Noûs, Camille; Poulet, Nicolas; King, Turi; D039,; Amato, Maria Eugenia; Balaresque, Patricia",Forensic Sci Int Genet,,93

Variant films were prepared employing the casting method and using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol. The formulated films were investigated for insulin content, weight variation, surface pH, thickness, folding endurance and disintegration time. In vitro release study was conducted for the selected formulations (F6, F7, F8). A drug/polymer interaction was investigated in the optimized formulation (F7) employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Clinical study was accomplished for F7 on 20 patients. Sniffin's and olfactory discrimination tests were used for assessing patients. The formulated films displayed appropriate physical characteristics. F7 showed the shortest disintegration time (50 ± 7 s) and fastest release. It displayed compatibility between the drug and the used polymers. The results of the clinical study revealed a significant increase in the olfactory detection scores and olfactory discrimination values in the intervention group (7.9 ± 1.2, 6.7 ± 0.5 respectively) compared to placebo group (3 ± 0.8, 2.8 ± 1).. Intervention group showed significant differences between these scores before and after treatment while the placebo group did not display any significant differences.

216732,Authors' Reply,2020,"A few reports suggest that molecular mimicry can have a role in determining the more severe and deadly forms of COVID-19, inducing endothelial damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure. Heat shock proteins/molecular chaperones can be involved in these molecular mimicry phenomena. However, tumor cells can display on their surface heat shock proteins/molecular chaperones that are mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 molecules (including the Spike protein), similarly to what happens in other bacterial or viral infections. Since molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and tumoral proteins can elicit an immune reaction in which antibodies or cytotoxic cells produced against the virus cross-react with the tumor cells, we want to prompt clinical studies to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on prognosis and follow up of various forms of tumors.

217040,Spread of Coronavirus and Racial Disparities,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. METHODS: A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. RESULTS: Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R2 value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. CONCLUSIONS: Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.","Sinha, Ranjan; Kachru, Dashyanng; Ricchetti, Roshni Ray; Singh-Rambiritch, Simitha; Muthukumar, Karthik Marimuthu; Singaravel, Vidhya; Irudayanathan, Carmel; Reddy-Sinha, Chandana; Junaid, Imran; Sharma, Garima; Francis-Lyon, Patricia Alice",J Med Internet Res,,93

The aim was to determine the efficacy of vaporized hydrogen peroxide fogging on pathogens related to the dental environment and its possible application in dentistry. PICOS statement (Population, Intervention, Comparison/Control, Outcome and Study design statement) was used in the review. Six electronic databases were searched for articles published from 2010 to 2020. Articles written in English reporting vaporized hydrogen peroxide on pathogens deemed to be relevant to the dental environment were assessed. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk-of-bias assessment tool designed for the investigation of vaporized hydrogen peroxide application in dentistry. A total of 17 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most commonly reported single bacterial pathogen was Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in five studies, and the viruses Feline calicivirus, Human norovirus, and Murine norovirus were featured in three studies. The results of the studies reporting the log kill were sufficient for all authors to conclude that vaporized hydrogen peroxide generation was effective for the assessed pathogens. The studies that assessed aerosolized hydrogen peroxide found a greater log kill with the use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators. The overarching conclusion was that hydrogen peroxide delivered as vaporized hydrogen peroxide was an effective method to achieve large levels of log kill on the assessed pathogens. The hydrogen peroxide vapor generators can play a role in dental bio-decontamination. The parameters must be standardized and the efficacy assessed to perform bio-decontamination for the whole clinic. For vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators to be included in the dental bio-decontamination regimen, certain criteria should be met. These include the standardization and efficacy assessment of the vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators in dental clinics.","Ahmed, Rukshana; Mulder, Riaan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

Many reports have enough evidence for the use of FDA-approved drugs which have inhibitory potential against target proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we utilized a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates from the existing pool of FDA-approved drugs and checked their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme, and a potential drug target. Using well-defined computational methods, we identified Glecaprevir and Maraviroc (MVC) as the best inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Both drugs bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and form a significant number of non-covalent interactions. Glecaprevir and MVC bind to the conserved residues of substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. This work provides sufficient evidence for the use of Glecaprevir and MVC for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 after experimental validation and clinical manifestations.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; AlAjmi, Mohamed F; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md Tabish; Islam, Asimul; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Biosci. rep,,93

218897,A year of Covid,2021,"This study analyzes the impact on the sales of firms during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on microdata made available by the World Bank through the Enterprise Surveys platform, when the Covid-19 Enterprise Survey Follow-Up was conducted. The study performed a comparison of two linear regression techniques: (1) ordinary least squares with dummy variables, better understanding the average effect of the regressors on the dependent variable and;(2) quantile regression, making it possible to better identify heterogeneous effects in the sample. Controlling potential effects of heteroscedasticity to the quantile regression model, a recent and more robust control approach was employed, through the contributions of Parente and Santos Silva (2016). The intra-cluster estimator allows to obtain non-biased estimates of standard error of the parameters, presenting a more reliable result in relation to the traditional approach of Koenker and Bassett (1978). The results suggest that factors such as access to credit, government subsidies, remote work and hiring temporary workers have heterogeneous effects between firms. Permanent and full-time employees had a greater impact on firms with lower sales growth, signaling a downward trend over conditional quantiles. Government subsidies had a decreasing effect, indicating greater impact on firms with less growth (significant in the 50% and 75% quantiles). Licensed workers affected negatively in all quantiles, but with a greater impact on growth in lower quantiles, that is, in firms with less growth (significant at 1%). The actions of governments promote a “deliberate disconnection” that inevitably results in a socioeconomic crisis, unprecedented in history. These “indirect” effects of the pandemic have already been duly documented in the financial market (TOPCU and GULAL 2020). Although expectations about the potential consequences of social isolation policies have been negatively reflected, other evidence points to positive results, depending on the behavior of the public authority, acting in a transparent manner. From this analyze, it is observed that the orientation of public policies to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be guided in a uniform manner. This guidance allows better control of the adverse effects of the pandemic, aiming at a better allocation of resources and a greater return in terms of social well-being.

Instead of thinking about the global emergence of the epidemic, it is time to act decisively. At first glance, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and orthopedics may seem to be unrelated disciplines, but the provision of healthcare services to patients who require them proves that these two fields are parts of the same whole.

We operated on 10 biopsy patients, 15 primary bone sarcomas, 9 soft tissue sarcomas, and 82 trauma patients within this time frame. Only three patients were suspected to have COVID-19 before admission.

Although less than 5% of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, one in five cases reported to police are deemed baseless (by police) and therefore coded as ""unfounded."" Police officers are in a unique position to act as gatekeepers for justice in sexual assault cases, given their responsibility to investigate sexual assault reports. However, high rates of unfounded sexual assaults reveal that dismissing sexual violence has become common practice amongst the police. Much of the research on unfounded sexual assault is based on police perceptions of the sexual assault, as indicated in police reports. Women's perspectives about their experiences with police are not represented in research. This qualitative study explored women's experiences when their sexual assault report was disbelieved by the police. Data collection included open-ended and semi-structured interviews with 23 sexual assault survivors. Interviews covered four areas including the sexual assault, the experience with the police, the experience of not being believed, and the impact on their health and well-being. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVIVO for analysis. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's analytic method, resulting in the identification of four themes, including, (a) vulnerability, (b) drug and alcohol use during the assault, (c) police insensitivity, and (d) police process. The women in this study who experienced a sexual assault and reported the assault to police were hopeful that police would help them and justice would be served. Instead, these women were faced with insensitivity, blaming questions, lack of investigation, and lack of follow-up from the police, all of which contributed to not being believed by the institutions designed to protect them. The findings from this research demonstrate that police officers must gain a deeper understanding of trauma and sensitive communication with survivors of sexual assault.","Murphy-Oikonen, Jodie; McQueen, Karen; Miller, Ainsley; Chambers, Lori; Hiebert, Alexa",J Interpers Violence,,93

Short-term applications include rapid case identification and contact tracing to limit viral spread, while population screening to determine the extent of viral infection across communities is a longer-term need. Assays developed to address these needs should match the ASSURED criteria. We have identified agglutination tests based on the commonly employed blood typing methods as a viable option. These blood typing tests are employed in hospitals worldwide, are high-throughput, fast (10-30 min), and automated in most cases. Herein, we describe the application of agglutination assays to SARS-CoV-2 serology testing by combining column agglutination testing with peptide-antibody bioconjugates, which facilitate red cell cross-linking only in the presence of plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This simple, rapid, and easily scalable approach has immediate application in SARS-CoV-2 serological testing and is a useful platform for assay development beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alves, Diana; Curvello, Rodrigo; Henderson, Edward; Kesarwani, Vidhishri; Walker, Julia A; Leguizamon, Samuel C; McLiesh, Heather; Raghuwanshi, Vikram Singh; Samadian, Hajar; Wood, Erica M; McQuilten, Zoe K; Graham, Maryza; Wieringa, Megan; Korman, Tony M; Scott, Timothy F; Banaszak Holl, Mark M; Garnier, Gil; Corrie, Simon R",ACS Sens,,93

Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions. To ease the access to diffusion modelling, several programming libraries and tools have been proposed during the last decade: however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is explicitly designed to allow its users to integrate public interventions in their model. In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that can simulate the effects of several public interventions (and their combinations) on the unfolding of epidemic processes. UTLDR enables the design of compartmental models incrementally and to simulate them over complex interaction network topologies. Moreover, it allows integrating external information on the analyzed population (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns\dots) and to use it to stratify and refine the designed model. After introducing the framework, we provide a few case studies to underline its flexibility and expressive power.","Rossetti, Giulio; Milli, Letizia; Citraro, Salvatore; Morini, Virginia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05606v1.pdf,93

Quarantine measures have influenced pregnant women's daily lives. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of the changes imposed by COVID-19 emergency on the well-being of pregnant women and how the transformation of Schiavonia Hospital into a dedicated COVID hospital affected their pregnancy experience. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Pregnant women who gave birth in Schiavonia Hospital during the period May-September 2020 have been included. The assessment examined clinical characteristics, attitudes in relation to the pandemic and how it affected birth plans, perception of information received, and attitudes regards giving birth in a COVID hospital. RESULTS: One hundred four women responded to the survey, with an enrolment rate of 58%. About the influence of COVID-19 pandemic, 51% of respondents reported changing some aspect of their lifestyle. The identification of Schiavonia Hospital as COVID hospital did not modify the trust in the facility and in the obstetrics ward for the 90% of women, in fact for the 85.6% it was the planned Birth Center since the beginning of pregnancy.

222236,Creative Collabs and Technology in the Time of Coronavirus,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Health care workers face significant risk of infection when treating patients with a viral severe acute respiratory infection. To ensure health care worker safety and limit nosocomial transmission of such infection, it is crucial to synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2020, for studies describing the risk of infection associated with the modalities of oxygen therapy used for patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure was the infection of health care workers with a severe acute respiratory infection. Random-effect models were used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 22,123 citations, 50 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 16 for meta-analysis. Globally, the quality of the included studies provided a very low certainty of evidence. Being exposed or performing an intubation (odds ratio 6.48; 95% confidence interval 2.90 to 14.44), bag-valve-mask ventilation (odds ratio 2.70; 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 5.36), and noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 7.40) were associated with an increased risk of infection. All modalities of oxygen therapy generate air dispersion. CONCLUSION: Most modalities of oxygen therapy are associated with an increased risk of infection and none have been demonstrated as safe. The lowest flow of oxygen should be used to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation for patients with severe acute respiratory infection, and manipulation of oxygen delivery equipment should be minimized.","Cournoyer, Alexis; Grand039,; Maison, Sophie; Lonergan, Ann-Marie; Lessard, Justine; Chauny, Jean-Marc; Castonguay, Véronique; Marquis, Martin; Frégeau, Amélie; Huard, Vérilibe; Garceau-Tremblay, Zoé; Turcotte, Ann-Sophie; Piette, Éric; Paquet, Jean; Cossette, Sylvie; Féral-Pierssens, Anne-Laure; Leblanc, Renaud-Xavier; Martel, Valéry; Daoust, Raoul",Ann Emerg Med,,93

We explored university educators' eLearning perspectives, practices, and future adoption intentions. In-depth interviews with 14 educators from a large university in Singapore were conducted. Educators had limited eLearning experience prior to COVID-19 emergency eLearning and expressed strong preferences for in-person sessions. The short notice to switch to eLearning and lack of eLearning experiences created stress and anxiety. Educators responded by making efforts that allowed for teaching to continue, conceding that some expectations had to be readjusted. Despite many obstacles, educators acknowledged reduced apprehension towards eLearning. Reflecting upon their experiences, educators highlighted opportunities and challenges of eLearning. A key opportunity was increased flexibility, which enabled students to learn independently. Additionally, eLearning triggered reflection upon educators teaching which could lead to improved practice. Reduction of some barriers to student-educator interaction were also mentioned. Key challenges include creating social, emotional, and cognitive engagement, catering to diverse student needs and providing holistic learning experiences. Considering opportunities and challenges, educators envisioned that eLearning would feature in their future teaching if practical and helpful for achieving educational goals. Hybrid or blended learning approaches were preferred, but support enabling the implementation of technology-based and pedagogy-informed teaching is necessary.","Müller, Andre Matthias Goh Charlene Lim Li Zhen Gao Xiaoli",Education Sciences,,93

223488,Vets can help government tackle Covid-19,2020,"The use of intensive sampling methods, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is increasingly prominent in medical research. However, inferences from such data are often limited to the subject-specific mean of the outcome and between-subject variance (i.e., random intercept), despite the capability to examine within-subject variance (i.e., random scale) and associations between covariates and subject-specific mean (i.e., random slope). MixWILD (Mixed model analysis With Intensive Longitudinal Data) is statistical software that tests the effects of subject-level parameters (variance and slope) of time-varying variables, specifically in the context of studies using intensive sampling methods, such as ecological momentary assessment. MixWILD combines estimation of a stage 1 mixed-effects location-scale (MELS) model, including estimation of the subject-specific random effects, with a subsequent stage 2 linear or binary/ordinal logistic regression in which values sampled from each subject's random effect distributions can be used as regressors (and then the results are aggregated across replications). Computations within MixWILD were written in FORTRAN and use maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing both the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and a Newton-Raphson solution. The mean and variance of each individual's random effects used in the sampling are estimated using empirical Bayes equations. This manuscript details the underlying procedures and provides examples illustrating standalone usage and features of MixWILD and its GUI. MixWILD is generalizable to a variety of data collection strategies (i.e., EMA, sensors) as a robust and reproducible method to test predictors of variability in level 1 outcomes and the associations between subject-level parameters (variances and slopes) and level 2 outcomes.","Dzubur, Eldin; Ponnada, Aditya; Nordgren, Rachel; Yang, Chih-Hsiang; Intille, Stephen; Dunton, Genevieve; Hedeker, Donald",Behav Res Methods,,93

How colorectal surgeons should manage this during the epidemic remains a big challenge. The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of routine colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 and to offer some Chinese recommendations to colorectal surgeons throughout the world. METHODS: A total of 166 patients receiving colorectal surgery from 20 December 2019 to 20 March 2020 at Department of General Surgery in Chinese General Hospital of People's Liberation Army were enrolled, and further divided into two groups based on before or after admission date of 20 January 2020. Clinicopathologic data such as hospital stay and economic data such as total costs were collected and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Longer hospital stay, higher proportion of non-local patients and more hospitalization cost were found in the post-20 January group (special-time group) (P < 0.001; P < 0.05; P < 0.05, respectively). Apart from this, no difference existed with regard to baseline demographical data such as age, sex and height, as well as clinicopathological data such as previous history, surgery time, operation extent and TNM staging.

Methods: A systematic review to determine risk factors and interventions associated with mortality/survival in adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181185). Results: The search identified 483 abstracts between 1 January and 7 April 2020, of which nine studies were included in the final review. Only one study was of low bias. Advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 11.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.35–18.62) and a history of hypertension were associated with mortality (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.90–5.99). Sex was not associated with mortality. There was insufficient data to assess the association between other comorbidities, laboratory results or critical care risk indices and mortality. The critical care interventions of mechanical ventilation (OR 6.25, 95% CI 0.75–51.93), prone positioning during ventilation (OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.20–21.72), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (OR 8.00, 95% CI 0.69, 92.33) were not associated with mortality. The sample size was insufficient to conclusively determine the association between these interventions and ICU mortality. The need for inotropes or vasopressors was associated with mortality (OR 6.36, 95% CI 1.89–21.36).

RESULTS: Participants from 60 hospitals in 13 countries contributed data to the study. Central venous line teams were most commonly composed of vascular surgery and general surgery attending physicians and trainees. Twenty sites had 2657 lines placed by their central venous access line team or designated practice group. During that time, there were 11 (0.4%) iatrogenic complications associated with central venous access procedures performed by the line team or group at those 20 sites. Triple lumen catheters, Cordis (Santa Clara, Calif) catheters, and nontunneled hemodialysis catheters were the most common types of central venous lines placed by the teams. Eight (14%) sites reported experience in placing central venous lines in prone, ventilated patients with COVID-19. A dedicated line cart was used by 35 (59%) of the hospitals. Less than 50% (24 [41%]) of the participating sites reported managing thrombosed central lines in COVID-19 patients. Twenty-three of the sites managed 48 iatrogenic complications in patients with COVID-19 (including complications caused by providers outside of the line team or designated practice group). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated central venous access line team during a pandemic or other health care crisis is a way by which physicians trained in central venous access can contribute their expertise to a stressed health care system. A line team composed of physicians with vascular skill sets provides relief to resource-constrained intensive care unit, ward, and emergency medicine teams with a low rate of iatrogenic complications relative to historical reports. We recommend that a plan for central venous access line team implementation be in place for future health care crises.","Chun, Tristen T; Judelson, Dejah R; Rigberg, David; Lawrence, Peter F; Cuff, Robert; Shalhub, Sherene; Wohlauer, Max; Abularrage, Christopher J; Anastasios, Papapetrou; Arya, Shipra; Aulivola, Bernadette; Baldwin, Melissa; Baril, Donald; Bechara, Carlos F; Beckerman, William E; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Benedetto, Filippo; Bennett, Lisa F; Charlton-Ouw, Kristofer M; Chawla, Amit; Chia, Matthew C; Cho, Sungsin; Choong, Andrew M T L; Chou, Elizabeth L; Christiana, Anastasiadou; Coscas, Raphael; De Caridi, Giovanni; Ellozy, Sharif; Etkin, Yana; Faries, Peter; Fung, Adrian T; Gonzalez, Andrew; Griffin, Claire L; Guidry, London; Gunawansa, Nalaka; Gwertzman, Gary; Han, Daniel K; Hicks, Caitlin W; Hinojosa, Carlos A; Hsiang, York; Ilonzo, Nicole; Jayakumar, Lalithapriya; Joh, Jin Hyun; Johnson, Adam P; Kabbani, Loay S; Keller, Melissa R; Khashram, Manar; Koleilat, Issam; Krueger, Bernard; Kumar, Akshay",J. vasc. surg,,93
227971,Thyroid cytology in the times of coronavirus,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, international organizations, institutions, and experts firstly recommended face masks for the population only in symptomatic subjects, but today various countries recommend or require their use even outdoor. In Italy, there was an obligation in closed places accessible to the public, including means of transport, and always if the safety distance was not continuously guaranteed. Various regions have long imposed obligations everywhere but at one's own home, and now the mandate has become national. This contribution critically analyses the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of medical masks in preventing respiratory infections in university/community contexts and outdoor gatherings, with questions and answers based on reasoning where possible based on evidence. It discusses whether the evidence supporting the WHO positions is weak compared to more stringent policies; it considers some underestimated adverse effects of the prolonged use of masks in the community and especially outdoors, not only by persons doing physical activity. This paper discusses some differences between SARS and COVID-19 in the potential impact of the masks and proposes to consider the most valid evidence available, avoiding prolonged/continuous use without valid needs for face masks, especially outdoors, waiting for others pragmatic RCTs that clarify conclusively a net balance between expected benefits and possible damages.

228370,Italian politics in 2019 and their legacy: reactions to the coronavirus,2020,"Objectives/Introduction: Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors to enter the cell. These receptors are widely expressed in the intestine, and COVID-19 may cause gastrointestinal symptoms via these receptors during the course of the disease. Helicobacter pylori is known to increase the expression of ACE-2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of H pylori on the presentation and clinical course of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This study was carried out from June 1 to July 20, 2020. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infections by PCR tests were included in the study. Antigen screening tests were performed on stool samples to determine the presence of H pylori. All patients were evaluated for manifestations of COVID-19 infection, severity of the course, hospitalized days due to the virus and outcome of the disease process. RESULTS: Of 108 COVID-19 positive patients evaluated, 31 with a mean age of 49.54â±â17.94 years were H pylori-positive [(8 females (25.8%)] and 77 with a mean age of 47.85â±â20.51 years; [31 females (%40.3)] were H pylori-negative. Abdominal pain (19.4% vs 2.6%) and diarrhea (32.3% vs 9.1%) were significantly higher in patients with H pylori than those without (pâ=â0.007 and pâ=â0.006, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between H pylori positivity and the number of hospitalized days, the severity of the course of COVID-19 infection, or the outcome of the disease (pâ>â0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the findings of abdominal pain and diarrhea strongly correlated with the presence of H pylori in COVID-19 patients.","Balamtekin, Necati; Artuk, Cumhur; Arslan, Melike; Gülsen, Mustafa",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,,93
228468,Thoracic aortic parallel stent-graft behaviour when subjected to radial loading,2021,"A 37-year-old woman presented to her local district general hospital with a cough, pleuritic chest pain and intermittent cyanosis. Eight months prior, she underwent a successful pericardial window for recurrent, symptomatic pericardial effusions. On presentation she was hypoxic but haemodynamically stable. Her chest radiograph raised the suspicion of a diaphragmatic hernia, confirmed by CT imaging. This identified herniation through the diaphragm of the transverse colon and left lobe of the liver resulting in cardiac compression and right ventricular dysfunction. She continued to deteriorate and required emergency intubation to allow safe transfer to a tertiary upper gastrointestinal unit. She underwent a laparotomy and repair of the diaphragmatic hernia with an uneventful inpatient recovery. In the literature, diaphragmatic liver herniation is a recognised complication secondary to trauma or congenital defects, however, to our knowledge, there are currently no cases described following pericardial windowing.","Harsten, Rebecca; Kelly, Mark; Garner, Madeleine; Roberts, Peter",BMJ case reports,,93

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on First Nations people health assessments using an interrupted time series model utilizing data extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule database. Additive triple exponential smoothing was used to model health assessments undertaken between January 2017 and December 2019. The model was used to predict health assessments between January 2020 and June 2020 with 95% confidence (P < .05). There was no significant difference between observed and predicted First Nations people health assessments in January, February, and June 2020. However, we found a statistically significant decrease in health assessments in March (16.5%), April (23.1%), and May (17.2%) 2020. The proportion of total health assessments delivered via telehealth was 0.5%, 23.6%, 17.6%, and 10.0% for March, April, May, and June 2020, respectively. The decrease in total First Nations people health assessments compounds the risk of poorer health outcomes in this population already vulnerable due to a high burden of chronic disease and considerable social, economic, and health inequalities. Strategies to improve the delivery of telehealth for First Nations people must be considered.","Robertson, Ross; Mian, Mustafa; Sreedharan, Subhashaan; Lau, Phyllis",Asia Pac J Public Health,,93

Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep the economy going, on one hand, while keeping the population safe, on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here, we use a Watts-Strogatz network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is already known about the virus, to explore five different scenarios of partial lockdown release in two geographical locations with different age distributions. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between them protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, the addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by about 62%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. Therefore, we propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections while still offering strong protection for the older population.","Mizrahi, Liron; Shekhidem, Huda Adwan; Stern, Shani",Open Biol,,93
232236,Valid Post-Detection Inference for Change Points Identified Using Trend Filtering,2021-04-24,"We investigate the effect of migration rates on international tourism flows and whether linguistic networks and common languages affect the relationship between migration rates and tourist flows. We utilize the gravity data set consisting of 166 origin and 30 destination countries, over the 1995?2010 period for the empirical analysis. The results show that increased migration rates lead to higher international tourism flows in destination countries. This effect becomes even stronger when the destination country has a larger linguistic network. Migration matters less, however, when a country-pair shares closer linguistic ties. The findings of this study will help to inform public, and tourism industry policies aimed at boosting sustainable tourism flows, especially post COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted immigration policies, such as those that seek to attract foreign workers with specific skill sets, tend to enlarge linguistic networks and contribute to multilingualism, which in turn can boost international tourism flows.","Okafor, Luke Emeka Khalid Usman Burzynska Katarzyna",Journal of Travel Research,,93
232609,Applicability of distributed IoT-powered triage units in the management of infectious diseases in developing countries: The COVID-19 case,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest computed tomography (CT) findings associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the early recovery period. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia at a single center between January 12, 2020, and March 16, 2020. The twelve ICU patients studied had been diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) nucleic acid positive. Patient clinical symptoms were relieved or disappeared, and basic clinical information and laboratory test results were collected. The study focused on the most recent CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: The average age of the 12 patients was 58.8 ± 16.2 years. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (100%), dyspnea (100%), and cough (83.3%). All patients experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of which 9 were moderate to severe. Six patients used noninvasive ventilators, and 4 patients used mechanical ventilation. One patient was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lymphocyte count decreased to 0.67 ± 0.3 (× 10 9/L). The average day from illness onset to the last follow-up CT was 56.1 ± 7.7 d. The CT results showed a decrease in ground glass opacities (GGO), whereas fibrosis gradually increased. The common CT features included GGO (10/12, 83.3%), subpleural line (10/12, 83.3%), fibrous stripes (12/12, 100%), and traction bronchiectasis (10/12, 83.3%). Eight patients (66.7%) showed predominant reticulation and interlobular thickening. Four patients (33.3%) showed predominant GGO. Lung segments involved were 174/216 (80.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrous stripes and GGO are common CT signs in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the early recovery period. Signs of pulmonary fibrosis in survivors should be carefully monitored.","Fang, Yu; Zhou, Jun; Ding, Xun; Ling, Gonghao; Yu, Shanshan",Am. j. emerg. med,,93

We examined reactions to COVID-19 and traditional health harms messages discouraging smoking and vaping. METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 810 US adults recruited online in May 2020. All participated in a smoking message experiment and a vaping message experiment, presented in a random order. In each experiment, participants viewed one message formatted as a Twitter post. The experiments adopted a 3 (traditional health harms of smoking or vaping: three harms, one harm, absent) × 2 (COVID-19 harms: one harm, absent) between-subjects design. Outcomes included perceived message effectiveness (primary) and constructs from the Tobacco Warnings Model (secondary: attention, negative affect, cognitive elaboration, social interactions). RESULTS: Smoking messages with traditional or COVID-19 harms elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging smoking than control messages without these harms (all p <0.001). However, including both traditional and COVID-19 harms in smoking messages had no benefit beyond including either alone. Smoking messages affected Tobacco Warnings Model constructs and did not elicit more reactance than control messages. Smoking messages also elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping. Including traditional harms in messages about vaping elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping (p <0.05), but including COVID-19 harms did not. CONCLUSIONS: Messages linking smoking with COVID-19 may hold promise for discouraging smoking and may have the added benefit of also discouraging vaping.","Grummon, Anna H; Hall, Marissa G; Mitchell, Chloe G; Pulido, Marlyn; Mendel Sheldon, Jennifer; Noar, Seth M; Ribisl, Kurt M; Brewer, Noel T",Tob. control,,93

However, the physiological relevance of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections is unknown. Here, with a combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we demonstrated that protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling mediated the proapoptotic signals in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, which converged in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Inhibiting PERK signaling or intrinsic apoptosis both alleviated MERS pathogenesis in vivo. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV induced apoptosis through distinct mechanisms but inhibition of intrinsic apoptosis similarly limited SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis in vitro and markedly ameliorated the lung damage of SARS-CoV-2-inoculated human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence that virus-induced apoptosis is an important disease determinant of highly pathogenic coronaviruses and demonstrates that this process can be targeted to attenuate disease severity.","Chu, Hin; Shuai, Huiping; Hou, Yuxin; Zhang, Xi; Wen, Lei; Huang, Xiner; Hu, Bingjie; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Yoon, Chaemin; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Li, Cun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wong, Kenneth Kak-Yuen; Yeung, Man-Lung; Zhou, Jie; Au-Yeung, Rex Kwok-Him; Yuan, Shuofeng; Jin, Dong-Yan; Kok, Kin-Hang; Perlman, Stanley; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Sci.

234437,Mathematical study of coronavirus (Mers-cov),2020,"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications including those leading to hospitalization. Resources otherwise used for influenza could support caring for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program serves 30 million people annually by providing comprehensive primary health care, including influenza vaccination, to demographically diverse and historically underserved communities. As racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, the objective of this analysis was to assess disparities in influenza vaccination at HRSA-funded health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HRSA analyzed cross-sectional data on influenza vaccinations from a weekly, voluntary Health Center COVID-19 survey after addition of an influenza-related question covering November 7-27, 2020. RESULTS: During the three-week period, 1,126 (81%) of 1385 health centers responded to the survey. Most of the 811,738 influenza vaccinations took place in urban areas and in the Western US Region. There were disproportionately more health center influenza vaccinations among racial and ethnic minorities in comparison with county demographics, except among Non-Hispanic Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives. CONCLUSIONS: HRSA-funded health centers were able to quickly vaccinate large numbers of mostly racial or ethnic minority populations, disproportionately more than county demographics. However, additional efforts might be needed to reach specific racial populations and persons in rural areas. Success in influenza vaccination efforts can support success in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts.","Marks, Suzanne M; Clara, Alexey; Fiebelkorn, Amy Parker; Le, Xuan; Armstrong, Paige A; Campbell, Stephanie; Van Alstyne, Judith Mendel; Price, Sarah; Bolton, Joshua; Sandhu, Paramjit K; Bombard, Jennifer M; Strona, F V",Clin. infect. dis,,93

Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on women and men have suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between T level and SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and recovered in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of the ""Carlo Poma"" Hospital in Mantua were analyzed. Several biochemical risk factors (ie, blood count and leukocyte formula, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6)) as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined. RESULTS: Lower TT and cFT were found in the transferred to ICU/deceased in RICU group vs groups of patients transferred to IM or maintained in the RICU in stable condition. Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (ie, the neutrophil count, LDH, and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count. Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels. A steep increase in both ICU transfer and mortality risk was observed in men with TT < 5 nmol/L or cFT < 100 pmol/L. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected men admitted to RICU.","Rastrelli, Giulia; Di Stasi, Vincenza; Inglese, Francesco; Beccaria, Massimiliano; Garuti, Martina; Di Costanzo, Domenica; Spreafico, Fabio; Greco, Graziana Francesca; Cervi, Giulia; Pecoriello, Antonietta; Magini, Angela; Todisco, Tommaso; Cipriani, Sarah; Maseroli, Elisa; Corona, Giovanni; Salonia, Andrea; Lenzi, Andrea; Maggi, Mario; De Donno, Giuseppe; Vignozzi, Linda",Androl.

237807,Attentional Biased Stochastic Gradient for Imbalanced Classification,2020-12-13,"Introduction: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) circulate endemically in human populations, often with seasonal variation. We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged &lt;5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one HCoV type. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged &lt;1 year (66%, n=208), though there was no age-dependence in the proportion testing positive. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, with no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into the potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.","Otieno, Grieven P.; Murunga, Nickson; Agoti, Charles N.; Gallagher, Katherine E.; Awori, Juliet O.; Nokes, D.

Genomic surveillance has become the gold standard methodology to monitor and study this emerging virus. The current deluge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data being generated worldwide has put additional pressure on the urgent need for streamlined bioinformatics workflows for data analysis. Here, we describe a workflow developed by our group to process and analyze large-scale SARS-CoV-2 Illumina amplicon sequencing data. This workflow automates all the steps involved in SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis: data processing, genome assembly, PANGO lineage assignment, mutation analysis and the screening of intrahost variants. The workflow presented here (https://github.com/dezordi/ViralFlow) is available through Docker or Singularity images, allowing implementation in laptops for small scale analyses or in high processing capacity servers or clusters. Moreover, the low requirements for memory and CPU cores makes it a versatile tool for SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis.","Dezordi, Filipe Zimmer; Campos, Tulio de Lima; Jeronimo, Pedro Miguel Carneiro; Aksenen, Cleber Furtado; Almeida, Suzana Porto; Wallau, Gabriel Luz",,,93

Both asset sales liquidity and the central bank collateral framework are modeled as power functions within the unit interval. Funding stability is captured as a strategic bank run game in pure strategies between depositors. Fire sale liquidity and the central bank collateral framework determine jointly the ability of the banking system to deliver maturity transformation without endangering financial stability. The model also explains why banks tend to use the least liquid eligible collateral with the central bank and why a sudden non-anticipated reduction of asset liquidity, or a tightening of the collateral framework, can trigger a bank run. The model also shows that the collateral framework can be understood, beyond its aim to protect the central bank, as financial stability and non-conventional monetary policy instrument.","Bindseil, Ulrich; Lanari, Edoardo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11030v1.pdf,93

Many people who feel vulnerable, including individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses, may be more susceptible to stigmatize individuals who have an infection. Researchers in this study aimed to develop a measure of negative attitudes toward COVID-19 among people with disabilities and chronic illnesses to better understand how stigmatization, which can cause negative outcomes, plays a role in individuals with disabilities' response to COVID-19. The study was conducted with 269 participants with any disability or chronic illness in which all completed the online questionnaire. To examine the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Negative Attitudes Scale (COVID-19 NAS), an exploratory factor analyses, confirmatory factor analyses, reliability analysis, and correlation were conducted. In addition, concurrent validity was assessed through correlations with participants' stress related to COVID-19, depression and anxiety, and resilience. Exploratory factor analyses demonstrated that COVID-19 NAS is a unidimensional scale. Confirmatory factor analysis results confirmed the one dimensionality of the scale. Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 NAS could be a valuable tool in assessing negative attitudes toward COVID-19 for people with chronic conditions and disabilities.","Umucu, Emre Reyes Antonio amp; Uuml,; rkmez, Bilal Ergun Gül Yazmin Castruita Rios Kosyluk Kristin",Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling,,93
242902,Short-term scholar visas are essential for science,2021,"With the Covid-19 epidemic that turned into a global epidemic, interest in online journalism has increased as much. The quarantine process spent at home has meant the beginning of the golden age of new internet-based communication technologies. Now, there is the “phygital” process, which is the period in which the physical and the digital are combined. Many scientific data and opinions have brought into question the permanence of this period, which is called the “new normal”. This study focuses on the question of whether it’s possible to reproduce the news in the context of the concepts of “new normal” and “phygital” in the news about pandemic in the online journalism environment. This situation shows that it is important to review many headlines of the news from news value to content. For that reason, it’s seen that in the news in which daily cases are dealt with during the pandemic process, nothing other than the numbers flying in the air over time. This shows that over time information becomes meaningless, intricacy and the purpose of the news is lost. The fact that a news is embedded in patterns where only the daily number of cases are given rather than justified information causes the interest in the news to decrease over time. With this study, how the news about the pandemic is given on the daily most clicked news sites is evaluated through the macro structure in Van Dijk's discourse analysis model.","ÇElamp,; Iacute,; K, Ramazan",AJIT-e,,93

The purpose of this study was to gain insight into older adults' technology use and preferences to inform the development of a technology training intervention to support older adult well-being. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 older adults. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative, constant comparison approach. Findings were consistent with Socioemotional Selectivity Theory; respondents were primarily interested in technology to support emotionally meaningful goals. Participants indicated limited interest in technology training, referencing diminished future time perspectives to explain disinterest. Findings suggest that efforts to encourage older adults' expanded technology adoption should highlight how use supports emotionally meaningful goals and provide low-effort, timely training, tied to specific and clear applications.","Bardach, Shoshana H; Rhodus, Elizabeth K; Parsons, Kelly; Gibson, Allison K",J Appl Gerontol,,93

243680,Remembering the Summer of 2020,2020,"The return of a Democratic administration to the White House, coupled with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-induced contractions of job-based insurance, may reignite debate over public coverage expansion and its costs. Decades of research demonstrate that uninsured people and people with copays and deductibles use less care than people with first-dollar coverage. Hence, most economic analyses of Medicare for All proposals and other coverage expansions project increased utilization and associated costs. We review the utilization surges that such analyses have predicted and contrast them with the more modest utilization increments observed after past coverage expansions in the US and other affluent nations. The discrepancy between predicted and observed utilization changes suggests that analysts underestimate the role of supply-side constraints-for example, the finite number of physicians and hospital beds. Our review of the utilization effects of past coverage expansions suggests that a first-dollar universal coverage expansion would increase ambulatory visits by 7-10 percent and hospital use by 0-3 percent. Modest administrative savings could offset the costs of such increases.","Gaffney, Adam; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie; Kahn, James G",Health Aff (Millwood),,93

In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).","Barbosa, Raquel de M; Fernandes, Marcelo A C",Data Brief,,93

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies in the English language assessing effects of proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists on PICU patients published before October 2018 from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. Random-effect Mantel-Haenszel risk difference (MHRD) model was used to pool all the selected studies for meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included mortality and length of PICU stay. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 13 observational) comprising 340,763 patients were included. Overall incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 15.2%. There was no difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (MHRD 5.0%; 95%CI -1.0% to 11.0%, I2=62%) between SUP status. There was increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia for patients who received SUP (MHRD 5.3%; 95%CI 3.5% to 7.0%; I2=0%) compared with those who did not. An increased risk of mortality was found in patients receiving SUP (MHRD 2.1%; 95%CI 2.0% to 2.2%; I2=0%), although when one large study was removed in a sensitivity analysis this association was no longer found. No statistical difference was found in length of PICU stay between the groups (standardized mean difference 0.42; 95%CI -0.16 to 1.01 days; I2=89.8%). CONCLUSIONS: SUP does not show clear benefit in reducing gastrointestinal bleeding or PICU stay. Observational studies suggest an increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia and mortality with SUP, which needs to be validated in clinical trials.","Jie Yao, Dominic Wen; Ong, Chengsi; Eales, Nichola Mary; Sultana, Rehena; Ju-Ming Wong, Judith; Lee, Jan Hau",J. pediatr.

Methods: We implemented the World Health Organization's First Few X cases and contacts investigation protocol for COVID-19. Trained public health professionals collected information on 381 virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases from 31 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. We actively followed up cases to identify exposure to infection, symptoms and outcomes. We also collected limited data on 752 symptomatic people testing negative for COVID-19, as a control group for analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms. Findings: Approximately half of the COVID-19 cases were imported (196 cases; 51.4%), of whom the majority had recent travel to Italy (140 cases; 71.4%). Of the 94 (24.7%) secondary cases, almost all reported close contact with a confirmed case (93 cases; 98.9%), many through household contact (37 cases; 39.8%). By age, a lower proportion of children had COVID-19. Most cases presented with cough, fever and fatigue. The sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age, with nonlinear relationships with age. Although the proportion of COVID-19 cases with fever increased with age, for those with other respiratory infections the occurrence of fever decreased with age.

246395,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art",2020-05-08,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic recovery will require a broad and coordinated effort for infection testing, immunity determination, and vaccination. With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS: The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS: In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in delivery of vaccinations to the US population, including the elderly, between 2012-2017. These findings indicate primary care practices may be a crucial element of vaccine counseling and delivery in the upcoming COVID-19 recovery and immunization efforts in the United States.","Wilkinson, Elizabeth; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Westfall, John M",Ann Fam Med,,93

246871,Feedback Particle Filter for Collective Inference,2020-10-13,"The Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph (LLAMAS) is an NSF-funded facility-class Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph under construction for the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes. It covers a 37""×37"" solid angle with 2,400 optical fibers efficiently coupled by a double-sided microlens-array, producing R = 2, 000 spectra with 0.75"" spatial resolution. Its broad passband from λ = 350 - 970nm offers access to line and continuum measurements over a wide range in redshift. Light is multiplexed by the IFU into 8 compact, carbon-fiber bench mounted spectrographs utilizing VPH grisms. We employed several trades on cost-performance ratio while optimizing LLAMAS' system design including: (a) Splitting the passband between 3 fast all-refractive camera systems with modest entrance pupils, (b) limiting the fibers per unit (i.e. slit length) and building more spectrographs to leverage on production volume, and (c) using a commercial CCD camera built around a common detector (e2v 42-40) and thermoelectric + liquid cooling. To boost blue throughput and achieve high-quality sky subtraction the spectrograph cluster is mounted next to the focal plane on a folded Cassegrain port with gravity-invariant support. This also allows the instrument to deploy quickly, and be fully accessible within 10 minutes on any night, serving as a facility unit for observing astrophysical transients. A sub-sized IFU (169 fibers), mounted in a full-sized front end package with a single spectrograph (2 cameras) was delivered to Magellan in March 2020. We present as-measured laboratory performance from this prototype, though on-sky commissioning was unfortunately cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 can interact with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is able to suppress the LPS-induced production of several inflammatory cytokines that are highly relevant to the prevention of immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ge, Yiyue; Tian, Tingzhong; Huang, Suling; Wan, Fangping; Li, Jingxin; Li, Shuya; Wang, Xiaoting; Yang, Hui; Hong, Lixiang; Wu, Nian; Yuan, Enming; Luo, Yunan; Cheng, Lili; Hu, Chengliang; Lei, Yipin; Shu, Hantao; Feng, Xiaolong; Jiang, Ziyuan; Wu, Yunfu; Chi, Ying; Guo, Xiling; Cui, Lunbiao; Xiao, Liang; Li, Zeng; Yang, Chunhao; Miao, Zehong; Chen, Ligong; Li, Haitao; Zeng, Hainian; Zhao, Dan; Zhu, Fengcai; Shen, Xiaokun; Zeng, Jianyang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,93

248417,Recommended Best Practices for Massage Therapy [open pdf - 0B],2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279â000 (IQR 245â000-320â000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5-8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727â000 cases (670â000-776â000) when R0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8-20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1â207â000 cases (1â164â000-1â249â000) when R0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9-33·1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6-99·9) when R0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5-99·7) when R0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 -94·4) when R0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1·5. INTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

A systematic search was performed on July 2, 2020, and updated on December 1, 2020, to identify studies on KLD/MIS-C associated with COVID-19. The databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scholar were searched. The hospitalized children with a presentation of Kawasaki disease (KD), KLD, MIS-C, or inflammatory shock syndromes were included. A total number of 133 children in 45 studies were reviewed. A total of 74 (55.6%) cases had been admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Also, 49 (36.8%) patients had required respiratory support, of whom 31 (23.3%) cases had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, 18 (13.5%) cases had required other oxygen therapies. In total, 79 (59.4%) cases had been discharged from hospitals, 3 (2.2%) had been readmitted, 9 (6.7%) had been hospitalized at the time of the study, and 9 (6.7%) patients had expired due to the severe heart failure, shock, brain infarction. Similar outcomes had not been reported in other patients. Approximately two-thirds of the children with KLD associated with COVID-19 had been admitted to PICUs, around one-fourth of them had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, and even some of them had been required readmissions. Therefore, physicians are strongly recommended to monitor children that present with the characteristics of KD during the pandemic as they can be the dominant manifestations in children with COVID-19.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Azhdari, Sara; Kavandi, Hadiseh; Nikeghbal, Parisa; Bazyar, Amir; Rafiee, Faranak; Nejati, Seyed Faraz; Sadabad, Faranak Ebrahimian; Rezaei, Nima",J. med. virol,,93

Possible pancreatic involvement has recently been observed in these patients; however, its significance is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of significantly elevated lipase with disease outcomes. METHODS: Data about demographics, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected for 1,003 consecutive patients testing positive for COVID-19. Elevated lipase was defined as greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (>3 × ULN). Baseline characteristics among patients with or without elevated lipase were compared using Fisher exact test or Student t-test for categorical or numerical variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of lipase levels with primary clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission and intubation) adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, history of diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: Of 1,003 patients with COVID-19, 83 had available lipase levels and were all admitted to the hospital. Of 83, 14 (16.8%) had elevated lipase (>3 × ULN), which was associated with higher rates of leukocytosis (P < 0.001) and abnormal liver enzymes (P < 0.01). Compared with lower lipase levels (<3 × ULN), patients with elevated lipase had higher rates of ICU admission (92.9% vs 32.8%; P < 0.001) and intubation (78.6% vs 23.5%; P 0.002). In a multivariable-adjusted model, higher lipase levels were significantly associated with admission to the ICU and rate of intubation. DISCUSSION: Lipase elevation is seen in COVID-19 and is associated with worse disease outcomes.","Barlass, Usman; Wiliams, Brett; Dhana, Klodian; Adnan, Darbaz; Khan, Shahab R; Mahdavinia, Mahboobeh; Bishehsari, Faraz",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,93

254761,Sarcopenia: a geriatric giant facing a huge transition,2021,"Many environmental justice communities face elevated exposures to multiple stressors, given biases in urban and environmental policy and planning. This paper aims to evaluate sound level exposure in a densely populated environmental justice city in close proximity to major roadways, a nearby airport and high levels of industrial activity. In this study we collected various sound level metrics to evaluate the loudness and frequency composition of the acoustical environment in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA. A total of 29 week-long sites were collected from October 2019 to June 2020, a time period that also included the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered activity patterns and corresponding sound level exposures. We found that Chelsea is exposed to high levels of sound, both day and night (65 dB (A), and 80 dB and 90 dB for low frequency, and infrasound sound levels). A spectral analysis shows that 63 Hz was the dominant frequency. Distance to major roads and flight activity (both arrivals and departures) were most strongly correlated with all metrics, most notably with metrics describing contributing from lower frequencies. Overall, we found similar patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic but at levels up to 10 dB lower. Our results demonstrate the importance of noise exposure assessments in environmental justice communities and the importance of using additional metrics to describe communities inundated with significant air, road, and industrial sound levels. It also provides a snapshot of how much quieter communities can be with careful and intentional urban and environmental policy and planning.","Walker, Erica D; Lee, Nina F; Scammell, Madeleine K; Feuer, Arielle P; Power, Maria B; Lane, Kevin J; Adamkiewicz, Gary; Levy, Jonathan I",Environ Res,,93

The participants are 192 mothers, who are mostly employed by private individuals and housewives. About 61.5% of them think that the information about CF was available during the outbreak. Most of them also continue to breastfeed their children. CF is a set of general principles that describe the activities and practices that a mother should follow when breastfeeding her child. It is generally fulfilled through the following five phases: starting the CF at 6 months, meeting the minimum dietary frequency, increasing the texture, and practicing good hygiene. This study confirms the findings of a previous systematic review that maternal knowledge about CF is a contributing factor to the family's CF practice. It also explains how CF knowledge can affect the selection and supply of food for the family. The point of household food security is the most crucial factor that influences the practice of infant and young child feeding (IYCF). This study revealed that children who live in food-secure households are more likely to have the appropriate practices. Although the factors not related to CF practices were not significant, household food security was the main determinant of the socioeconomic status. Information availability and maternal education are both important components of a mother's knowledge. However, their relationship is not significant. This study shows that improving maternal education and the availability of information is not associated with the improvement of mother knowledge.","Widyaningrum, R.; Safitri, R.

256939,Image reconstruction reveals the impact of aging on face perception,2021,"In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China strives to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This ambitious and bold commitment was well received by the global community. However, the technology and pathway are not so clear. Here, we conducted an extensive review covering more than 200 published papers and summarized the key technologies to achieve carbon neutrality. We projected sectoral CO2 emissions for 2020-2050 based on our previous studies and published scenarios. We applied a medium sink scenario for terrestrial sinks due to the potential resource competition and included an ocean sink, which has generally not been included in previous estimates. We analyzed and revisited China's historical terrestrial carbon sink capacity from 1980-2020 based on multiple models and a literature review. To achieve neutrality, it is necessary to increase sink capacity and decrease emissions from many sources. On the one hand, critical measures to reduce emissions include decreasing the use of fossil fuels; substantially increasing the proportion of the renewable energy and nuclear energy. On the other hand, the capacity of future carbon sinks is projected to decrease due to the natural evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, and anthropogenic management practices are needed to increase sink capacity, including increasing the forest sinks through national ecological restoration projects and large-scale land greening campaigns; increasing wood harvesting and storage; and developing CCUS. This paper provides basic source and sink data,and established and promising new technologies for decreasing emissions and increasing sinks for use by the scientific community and policy makers.","Han, Pengfei; Zeng, Ning; Zhang, Wen; Cai, Qixiang; Yang, Ruqi; Yao, Bo; Lin, Xiaohui; Wang, Guocheng; Liu, Di; Yu, Yongqiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10871v1.pdf,93

261559,"Small steps, big changes",2021,"The primary immunological target of COVID-19 vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface and mediates viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation, and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics. The protective glycan shield and the high flexibility of its hinges give the stalk overall low epitope scores. Our computational epitope-mapping procedure is general and should thus prove useful for other viral envelope proteins whose structures have been characterized.","Sikora, Mateusz; von Bülow, Sören; Blanc, Florian E C; Gecht, Michael; Covino, Roberto; Hummer, Gerhard",PLoS Comput Biol,,93

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Guilan Province, Iran. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 1,000 patients with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to six hospitals in Guilan Province, Iran, from April 13 to June 14, 2020. This study evaluated the patients' clinical information, demographic characteristics, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans. Results: The mean age of the patients was obtained at 55±1.3 years, and the majority (n=800;80%) of the cases were male. Furthermore, most patients had underlying diseases, including respiratory system disease (n=173;17.3%), cardiovascular disease (n=711;71.1%), and malignancy (n=146;14.6%). Some of the most common causes of infection with coronavirus were being in crowded places (n=733;73.3%), close contact with an infected person (n=370;82.2%), possession of pets (n=107;23.2%), and family gatherings (n=822;82.2%). In addition, the most common clinical symptoms in patients included fever (n=911;91.1%), cough (n=900;90%), and dyspnea or shortness of breath (n=889;88.9%).

By examining the death rates of Canada in general and Quebec, Ontario and Alberta in particular, one can easily figured out that there are substantial overdispersion relative to the Poisson so that the negative binomial distribution is an appropriate choice for the analysis. Generalized additive models (GAMs) are one of the main modeling tools for data analysis. GAMs can efficiently combine different types of fixed, random and smooth terms in the linear predictor of a regression model to account for different types of effects. GAMs are a semi-parametric extension of the generalized linear models (GLMs), used often for the case when there is no a priori reason for choosing a particular response function such as linear, quadratic, etc. and need the data to 'speak for themselves'. GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by 'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the separate functions are equal at the knots.","Izadi, Farzali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01030v1.pdf,93

However, the COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled if the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness is low. Therefore, the study aim was to explore the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness among the outpatient population and healthcare workers in Taiwan during the worldwide pandemic period without community outbreaks. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs; n = 500; mean age = 32.96 years) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) and outpatients (n = 238; mean age = 34.43 years) arriving at NCKUH. We used an online survey conducted between September 24 and 21 November 2020, for healthcare workers, and between 27 October and 31 December 2020, for the outpatient sample. Information regarding willingness to receive vaccination, willingness to rapid test, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors was collected in both samples; information regarding willingness to care for patients was collected in healthcare workers. Willingness to receive vaccination was the main variable in the present study; willingness to rapid test, willingness to care for patients, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors were the secondary variables in the study. The factors associated with vaccination willingness were identified through logistic regression analysis. The participants' willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%). Similarly, their willingness to take rapid tests was low (23.6% for healthcare workers and 28.6% for outpatient sample). Risk perception (crude odds ratio (COR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03, 1.63), willingness to take rapid test (COR = 9.24; 95% CI = 5.76, 14.83), and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.52, 3.56) were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers' willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to take a rapid test (COR = 8.91; 95% CI = 4.71, 16.87) and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.60) were significant factors explaining the outpatient sample's willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among HCWs and outpatients is low due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan.

Before 2015, the national health information system was fragmented, underfunded, of limited utility and accessed infrequently by health authorities. We built an electronic system that integrated mobile technologies and geographic information system data sets of every house, village and health facility in the country. We piloted the system in 184 health facilities across five provinces between 2015 and 2016. By the end of 2020, the system's mobile tablets were rolled out to 473 facilities in 13 provinces, while the online platform was available in health authorities of all 22 provinces, including church health services. Fractured data siloes of legacy health programmes have been integrated and a platform for civil registration systems established. We discuss how mobile technologies and geographic information systems have transformed health information systems in Papua New Guinea over the past 6 years by increasing the timeliness, completeness, quality, accessibility, flexibility, acceptability and utility of national health data. To achieve this transformation, we highlight the importance of considering the benefits of mobile tools and using rich geographic information systems data sets for health workers in primary care in addition to the needs of public health authorities.","Rosewell, Alexander; Shearman, Phil; Ramamurthy, Sundar; Akers, Rob",Bull World Health Organ,,93

We evaluate the potential of targeting CD38 to ameliorate NAD-related metabolic imbalance and tissue dysfunction in the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we will discuss emerging basic, preclinical, and human data that point to the novel role of CD38 in dysregulated NAD-homeostasis in SSc, SLE, and RA. In particular, recent studies implicate increased activity of CD38, one of the main enzymes in NAD catabolism, in the pathogenesis of persistent systemic fibrosis in SSc, and increased susceptibility of SLE patients to infections. We will also discuss recent studies that demonstrate that a cytotoxic CD38 antibody can promote clearance of plasma cells involved in the generation of RA antibodies. SUMMARY: Recent studies identify potential therapeutic approaches for boosting NAD to treat rheumatologic diseases including SSc, RA, and SLE, with particular attention to inhibition of CD38 enzymatic activity as a target. Key future directions in the field include the determination of the cell-type specificity and role of CD38 enzymatic activity versus CD38 structural roles in human diseases, as well as the indicators and potential side effects of CD38-targeted treatments.","Peclat, Thais Ribeiro; Shi, Bo; Varga, John; Chini, Eduardo Nunes",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,93

269996,Evaluating poetry on COVID-19: attitudes of poetry readers toward corona poems,2021,"Background Patients with COVID-19 usually manifest fever and respiratory symptoms. However, some patients also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in feces of infected patients. Currently there is huge evolving research interest in this potentially lethal disease. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence suggesting involvement of the digestive system in COVID-19. Methods PubMed, Medline and Embase databases were searched up to 10 April 2020, using suitable keywords. Individual and pooled prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the fixed-or random-effects model as appropriate. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated employing the Cochran Q test and I2values, whereas the possibility of publication bias was examined by constructing funnel plots. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence rates (95%CI) for all GI symptoms, and separately for diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal discomfort/pain were 9.8% (6.4-14.7), 10.4% (95%CI 7.7-13.9), 7.7% (95%CI 4.8-12.1), and 6.9% (95%CI 3.9-11.9) respectively. The prevalence rates for children were 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for all symptoms, 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for diarrhea, and 6.8% (95% CI 4.2-11) for nausea/vomiting. In 30.3% (95%CI 10.5-61.6) of the patients SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in feces. Conclusions A percentage of patients with COVID-19 will manifest symptoms from the digestive system. The GI tract may be a target organ and potential transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for disease management and transmission.","Rokkas, Theodore",Ann. Gastroenterol.,,93

To model the variable local pattern, we propose conditional local filters for convolution on the directed graph, parameterized by the functions on local representation of coordinate based on tangent space. The filter is embedded in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for modeling the temporal dynamics with an explainer established for interpretability of different time intervals' pattern. The methods are evaluated on real-world datasets including road network traffic flow, earth surface temperature \&wind flows and disease spread datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance with improvements.","Lin, Haitao; Gao, Zhangyang; Wu, Lirong; Li, Stan.

272932,Interactions between heavy metals and bacteria in mangroves,2021,"The host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the susceptibility of animal species to the virus are topics of great interest to the international scientific community. The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the major receptor for the virus, and sequence and structural analysis of the protein has been performed to determine its cross-species conservation. Based on these analyses, cattle have been implicated as a potential susceptible species to SARS-CoV-2 and have been reported to have increased ACE2 receptor distribution in the liver and kidney, and lower levels in the lungs. The goal of the current study was to determine the susceptibility of cattle to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing inoculation routes that facilitated exposure to tissues with increased ACE2 receptor distribution. For this, colostrum-deprived calves approximately 6 weeks of age were inoculated via the intratracheal or intravenous routes. Nasal and rectal swab samples, as well as blood and urine samples, were collected over the course of the study to evaluate viral shedding, viremia, and seroconversion. Pyrexia was used as the primary criteria for euthanasia and tissue samples were collected during necropsy. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in only two nasal swab samples collected on days 3 and 10 post-inoculation (pi) in two calves; one calf in the intratracheal group and the other calf in the intravenous group, respectively. Additionally, the calf in the intratracheal group that was positive on the nasal swab on day 3 pi also had a positive tracheobronchial lymph node on day 9 pi. Viral nucleic acid load on these samples, based on PCR cycle threshold values, were low and infectious virus was not recovered from the samples. These results suggest that there was no productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in calves following intratracheal and intravenous inoculation.","Falkenberg, Shollie; Buckley, Alexandra; Laverack, Melissa; Martins, Mathias; Palmer, Mitchell V; Lager, Kelly; Diel, Diego G",Viruses,,93
273563,Literature Listing,2020,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of antecedent variables on older adults' intention to get a CORONAVIRUS DISEASE-2019 vaccine. Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from the disease and face an increasingly ageist general population who misrepresent the pandemic as an older adult problem. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior framework to examine vaccine behavior intention. METHOD: A convenience sample (n = 583) of adults aged 60 and older in the United States participated in an online survey using vignettes. Hierarchical regression and analysis of covariance were used to test our model. RESULTS: Results suggest that perceived risk of the pandemic, general vaccine beliefs, and political affiliation influence respondents' attitude toward the vaccine. Respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine and their physician's recommendation help shape vaccine intention. CONCLUSION: The results provide partial support to the proposed model in shaping vaccine intention among older adults.","Callow, Michael A; Callow, Daniel D",J Appl Gerontol,,93

In this review, we discuss proposed hypotheses for the age-related difference in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Factors proposed to explain the difference in severity of COVID-19 in children and adults include those that put adults at higher risk and those that protect children. The former include: (1) age-related increase in endothelial damage and changes in clotting function; (2) higher density, increased affinity and different distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors and transmembrane serine protease 2; (3) pre-existing coronavirus antibodies (including antibody-dependent enhancement) and T cells; (4) immunosenescence and inflammaging, including the effects of chronic cytomegalovirus infection; (5) a higher prevalence of comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and (6) lower levels of vitamin D. Factors that might protect children include: (1) differences in innate and adaptive immunity; (2) more frequent recurrent and concurrent infections; (3) pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses; (4) differences in microbiota; (5) higher levels of melatonin; (6) protective off-target effects of live vaccines and (7) lower intensity of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Arch. dis. child,,93

Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s).

Endoscopy units, endoscopists, and other HCP may be at a significant risk for transmission of the virus. Given the immense burden on the healthcare system and surge in the number of patients with COVID-19, well-designed protocols and recommendations are needed. We aimed to systematically characterize our approach to endoscopic procedures in a quaternary university hospital setting and provide summary protocol recommendations. METHOD: This descriptive study details a COVID-19-specific protocol designed to minimize infection risks to patients and healthcare workers in the endoscopy unit. RESULTS: Our institution, located in São Paulo, Brazil, includes a 900-bed hospital, with a 200-bed-specific intensive care unit exclusively designed for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We highlighted recommendations for infection prevention and control during endoscopic procedures, including appropriate triage and screening, outpatient management and procedural recommendations, role and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and role and procedural logistics involving COVID-19-positive patients. We also detailed hospital protocols for reprocessing endoscopes and cleaning rooms and also provided recommendations to minimize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19-specific administrative and clinical protocol can be replicated or adapted in multiple institutions and endoscopy units worldwide. Furthermore, the recommendations and summary protocol may improve patient and HCP safety in these trying times.","Franzini, Tomazo Antonio Prince; Kotinda, Ana Paula Samy Tanaka; Moura, Diogo Turiani Hourneaux de; Badana, Márcia Lopes Vicente; Medeiros, Marion Sielfeld de; Lima, Patrícia Goulart Rodrigues; Mello, Brigitte Feiner de; Kayano, Rafael Priante; Carmona, Maria José Carvalho; Rocha, Marcelo Cristiano; Campos, Aléia Faustina; McCarty, Thomas R; Guimarães, Thaís; Moura, Maria Luisa do Nascimento; Thompson, Christopher C; Moura, Eduardo Guimarães Hourneaux de",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,93

The necessity to find and pursue relevant information and quantify its quality is broadly acknowledged. Modern information retrieval techniques combined with artificial intelligence (AI) appear as one of the key strategies for COVID-19 living evidence management. Nevertheless, most AI projects that retrieve COVID-19 literature still require manual tasks. METHODS: In this context, we pre-sent a novel, automated search platform, called Risklick AI, which aims to automatically gather COVID-19 scientific evidence and enables scientists, policy makers, and healthcare professionals to find the most relevant information tailored to their question of interest in real time. RESULTS: Here, we compare the capacity of Risklick AI to find COVID-19-related clinical trials and scientific publications in comparison with clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed in the field of pharmacology and clinical intervention. DISCUSSION: The results demonstrate that Risklick AI is able to find COVID-19 references more effectively, both in terms of precision and recall, compared to the baseline platforms. Hence, Risklick AI could become a useful alternative assistant to scientists fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haas, Quentin; Alvarez, David Vicente; Borissov, Nikolay; Ferdowsi, Sohrab; von Meyenn, Leonhard; Trelle, Sven; Teodoro, Douglas; Amini, Poorya",Pharmacology,,93

Respiratory virus-laden particles are commonly detected in the exhaled breath of symptomatic patients or in air sampled from healthcare settings. However, the temporal relationship of detecting virus-laden particles at nonhealthcare locations vs surveillance data obtained by conventional means has not been fully assessed. Methods. From October 2016 to June 2018, air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong. Viral genomes were detected and quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of ecological and environmental factors associated with the detection of virus-laden airborne particles. Results. Influenza A (16.9% [117/694]) and influenza B (4.5% [31/694]) viruses were detected at higher frequencies in air than rhinovirus (2.2% [6/270]), respiratory syncytial virus (0.4% [1/270]), or human coronaviruses (0% [0/270]). Multivariate analyses showed that increased crowdedness (aOR, 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5-3.8]; P &lt; .001) and higher indoor temperature (aOR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3]; P &lt; .001) were associated with detection of influenza airborne particles, but absolute humidity was not (aOR, 0.9 [95% CI, .7-1.1]; P = .213). Higher copies of influenza viral genome were detected from airborne particles &gt;4 μm in spring and &lt;1 μm in autumn. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses that caused epidemics during the study period were detected in air prior to observing increased influenza activities in the community. Conclusions. Air sampling as a surveillance tool for monitoring influenza activity at public locations may provide early detection signals on influenza viruses that circulate in the community.","Xie, Chenyi; Lau, Eric H.Y.; Yoshida, Tomoyo; Yu, Han; Wang, Xin; Wu, Huitao; Wei, Jianjian; Cowling, Ben; Peiris, Malik; Li, Yuguo; Yen, Hui-Ling",Clin.

Characterizing molecular (dis)similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral agents allows one to exploit existing information about the alteration of key biological processes due to known viruses for predicting the potential effects of this new virus. Here, we compare the novel coronavirus network against 92 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics and computational biology. We show that regulatory spreading patterns, physical features and enriched biological pathways in targeted proteins lead, overall, to meaningful clusters of viruses which, across scales, provide complementary perspectives to better characterize SARS-CoV-2 and its effects on humans. Our results indicate that the virus responsible for COVID–19 exhibits expected similarities, such as to Influenza A and Human Respiratory Syncytial viruses, and unexpected ones with different infection types and from distant viral families, like HIV1 and Human Herpes virus. Taken together, our findings indicate that COVID–19 is a systemic disease with potential effects on the function of multiple organs and human body sub-systems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Ghavasieh, A.; Bontorin, S.; Artime, O.; Verstraete, N.; De Domenico, M.",Communications Physics,,93

One of the most impacted areas were the medical and dental education fields, due to the forced break from clinical practice during the lockdown, which affected both the educational part, as well as the patients. Thus, the main goal of our research was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dental students' education as related to their perceptions and evaluations, in Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 878 dental students who reported their perception of the psychological and educational impact of this period by completing a Google Forms questionnaire. Collected data were statistically analyzed using Stata/IC 16. There was a severe psychological impact among the respondents, the levels of stress being perceived as high and very high (33.83%, n = 297; 28.59%, n = 251), similar to high and very high anxiety feelings (26.54%, n = 233; 24.26%, n = 213). Very high educational impact from the point of view of the acquisition of practical skills (48.52%, n = 426) and future professional perspectives (38.95%, n = 342) were recorded. While online theoretical learning ability was principally low (37.93%, n = 333) despite consistently modified time allocated to the individual study (44.35%, n = 389), most of the students evaluated the efficiency of lecturers in online courses as neutral (41.12%, n = 361). New dentistry teaching programs will have to be adopted taking into account the dynamics of the pandemic and its strong impact on our students, in order to improve both their wellbeing and the sustainability of dental education.","Iosif, Laura; Tâncu, Ana Maria Cristina; Didilescu, Andreea Cristiana; Imre, Marina; GalbinaÈu, Bogdan Mihai; Ilinca, Radu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

Allotransplantation is the most promising approach for treatment particularly for its cost-effective and exact curative potential. Herein our aim was to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A allele matching effect on clinical improvement and graft survival after parathyroid transplantation. We performed parathyroid transplantation between ABO/Rh compatible recipient and an unrelated donor who has chronic kidney disease. Preoperative immunological tests include panel reactive antibody, T-flow cytometry crossmatch, B-flow cytometry crossmatch, autoflow cytometry crossmatch, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch tests were performed. After histopathological evaluation, half of the resected parathyroid gland cells were isolated and transplanted to the omentum surface by laparoscopy. The transplantation outcome was followed up throughout 382 days. The recipient discharged 2 days after transplantation without any complication. During follow-up, calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced to a one-third dose; even the intact PTH levels remained low. However, clinical improvement was observed by serum calcium levels. The recipient still continues with low-dose supplementation after 382 days of post-transplantation. Parathyroid cell transplantation to the omental tissue is the most promising option even with only one allele matching for patients with using lifelong high-dose supplementation. Clinical improvements and long-term effect of HLA-A allele matching should be evaluated with more studies and in larger cohorts as well.","Goncu, Beyza; Salepcioglu Kaya, Harika; Yucesan, Emrah; Ersoy, Yeliz Emine; Akcakaya, Adem",J Investig Med,,93

While chest CT scans are routinely performed in the initial assessment of patients with severe pulmonary forms, thymus involvement and reactivation have not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we systematically scored the enlargement of the thymus and the lung involvement, using CT scans, in all adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID or any other cause (control group) at one centre between March and April 2020. Initial biological investigations included nasal detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a subgroup of 24 patients with different degrees of pulmonary involvement and thymus hypertrophy, plasma cytokine concentrations were measured and the export of mature T cells from the thymus was estimated simultaneously by PCR quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were studied: 50 COVID patients and 37 controls. Non-atrophic or enlarged thymus was more commonly observed in COVID patients than in controls (66% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). Thymus enlargement in COVID patients was associated with more extensive lung injury score on CT scans (4 [3-5] vs. 2 [1.5-4], p = 0.01), but a lower mortality rate (8.6% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with mortality were age, lymphopaenia, high CRP and co-morbidities. COVID patients had higher concentrations of IL-7 (6.00 [3.72-9.25] vs. 2.17 [1.76-4.4] pg/mL; p = 0.04) and higher thymic production of new lymphocytes (sj/ßTREC ratio = 2.88 [1.98-4.51] vs. 0.23 [0.15-0.60]; p = 0.004). Thymic production was also correlated with the CT scan thymic score (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) and inversely correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In COVID patients, thymus enlargement was frequent and associated with increased T lymphocyte production, which appears to be a beneficial adaptation to virus-induced lymphopaenia. The lack of thymic activity/reactivation in older SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could contribute to a worse prognosis.","Cuvelier, Pelagia; Roux, Hélène; Couëdel-Courteille, Anne; Dutrieux, Jacques; Naudin, Cécile; Charmeteau de Muylder, Bénédicte; Cheynier, Rémi; Squara, Pierre; Marullo, Stefano",Crit Care,,93

Methods: 230 National Health System hospitals were studied over the two-year period 2010-2012 according to their ownership structure-public hospitals, private hospitals and public-private partnership (PPP)-data envelopment analysis orientated to inputs was used to measure the overall technical efficiency, pure efficiency and efficiency of scale. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logit link function was used to analyse the hospital and regional variables associated with positioning on the frontier. Results: There are substantial differences between the average pure technical efficiency of public, private and PPP hospitals, as well as a greater number of PPP models being positioned on the efficiency frontier (91.67% in 2012). The odds of being positioned on the frontier are 41.7 times higher in PPP models than in public hospitals. The average annual household income per region is related to the greater odds of hospitals being positioned on the frontier of efficiency. Conclusions: During the most acute period of recession in the Spanish economy, PPP formulas favoured hospital efficiency, by increasing the odds of being positioned on the frontier of efficiency when compared to private and public hospitals. The position on the frontier of efficiency of a hospital is related to the wealth of its region.","Ortega-Díaz, Mª Isabel; Ocaña-Riola, Ricardo; Pérez-Romero, Carmen; Martín-Martín, José Jesús",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

As visitation to public parks and `recreation areas increased during the pandemic, the challenge of maintaining visitor safety and protecting environmental resources was exacerbated. A key visitor safety practice during the COVID-19 onset was maintaining a physical distance of six feet (1.8m) between groups. A novel data set documented and compared physical distancing compliance and off-trail behavior on multiple-use trails across multiple states and within select U.S. communities, attending to the impact of select environmental factors. Nearly 6000 observations revealed physical distancing compliance varied and the environmental factors of trail width, density, and signage influenced its variability. Similarly, off-trail movement was related to trail width and density. Clearly the environment matters as people negotiate the ‘new normal’ of physical distancing during physical activity and outdoor recreation participation. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and likelihood of future health crises, this project provides important information and insight for trail and other public green space management, monitoring, and modelling moving forward.","Schneider, Ingrid E.; Budruk, Megha Shinew Kim Wynveen Christopher J.; Stein, Taylor VanderWoude Deonne Hendricks William W.; Gibson, Heather",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,,93

288451,Dark Sirens to Resolve the Hubble-Lema\^itre Tension,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Early studies suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may cause injury to cardiac myocytes and increase arrhythmia risk. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias including incident atrial fibrillation (AF), bradyarrhythmias, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in a large urban population hospitalized for COVID-19. We also evaluated correlations between the presence of these arrhythmias and mortality. METHODS: We reviewed the characteristics of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to our center over a 9-week period. Throughout hospitalization, we evaluated the incidence of cardiac arrests, arrhythmias, and inpatient mortality. We also used logistic regression to evaluate age, sex, race, body mass index, prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and intensive care unit (ICU) status as potential risk factors for each arrhythmia. RESULTS: Among 700 patients (mean age 50 ± 18 years; 45% men; 71% African American; 11% received ICU care), there were 9 cardiac arrests, 25 incident AF events, 9 clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and 10 NSVTs. All cardiac arrests occurred in patients admitted to the ICU. In addition, admission to the ICU was associated with incident AF (odds ratio [OR] 4.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-13.18) and NSVT (OR 8.92; 95% CI 1.73-46.06) after multivariable adjustment. Also, age and incident AF (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.09) and prevalent heart failure and bradyarrhythmias (OR 9.75; 95% CI 1.95-48.65) were independently associated. Only cardiac arrests were associated with acute in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Cardiac arrests and arrhythmias are likely the consequence of systemic illness and not solely the direct effects of COVID-19 infection.","Bhatla, Anjali; Mayer, Michael M; Adusumalli, Srinath; Hyman, Matthew C; Oh, Eric; Tierney, Ann; Moss, Juwann; Chahal, Anwar A; Anesi, George; Denduluri, Srinivas; Domenico, Christopher M; Arkles, Jeffrey; Abella, Benjamin S; Bullinga, John R; Callans, David J; Dixit, Sanjay; Epstein, Andrew E; Frankel, David S; Garcia, Fermin C; Kumareswaram, Ramanan; Nazarian, Saman; Riley, Michael P; Santangeli, Pasquale; Schaller, Robert D; Supple, Gregory E; Lin, David; Marchlinski, Francis; Deo, Rajat",Heart Rhythm,,93

289631,Structural propagation of pandemic shocks: an input–output analysis of the economic costs of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate and report details of a remotely taught surgical laboratory. STUDY DESIGN: Observational. SAMPLE POPULATION: Second-year veterinary students (n = 143) enrolled in a surgical laboratory; 9 weeks were taught traditionally, and 6 weeks were taught remotely. METHODS: Because of the global pandemic, remote laboratories were developed and delivered. Students performed surgical procedures in model organs remotely while being observed by and receiving feedback from instructors on an internet-based video platform. Methods for remote surgical teaching were explored, and successes and challenges were detailed. Surveys were administered to the students and faculty to gather perspectives on their experience and subsequent confidence. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 81 of 143 (57%) students and seven of seven (100%) instructors. The mean overall student satisfaction score (1 not at all satisfied, 10 very satisfied) for in-person instruction was 8.2, and the mean score for remote instruction was 6.2 (P < .001). Overall, the instructors had a mean satisfaction score of 8 for in-person laboratories and a mean satisfaction score of 6 for remotely taught laboratories. Most students had a perception of greater one-on-one instructor attention in remote laboratories. Students reported similar confidence levels for three surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: The described remote teaching method resulted in the perception of greater instructor attention given to students. Student and instructor satisfaction was lower with remote teaching than with in-person teaching. IMPACT: The described method of remote teaching may be applied to teaching surgical students in settings when face-to-face instruction cannot be achieved and may be developed further to create an experience equivalent to face-to-face instruction.","Thieman Mankin, Kelley M; Cornell, Karen; Peycke, Laura; Dickerson, Vanna; Scallan, Elizabeth",Vet Surg,,93

However, another evolving focus is assessing and mitigating the risk of vertical transmission amongst COVID-19-positive mothers. The objective of this review was to summarize the current evidence on the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester and its effects on the neonate.Methods: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL) were searched from January 2020 to May 2020, with continuous surveillance.Results: 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 157 mothers and 160 neonates. The mean age of the pregnant patients was 30.8 years and the mean gestational period was 37 weeks and 1 d. Currently, there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. Amongst 81 (69%) neonates who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5 (6%) had a positive result. However, amongst these 5 neonates, the earliest test was performed at 16 h after birth, and only 1 neonate was positive when they were later re-tested. However, this neonate initially tested negative at birth, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely hospital-acquired rather than vertically transmitted. 13 (8%) neonates had complications or symptoms.Conclusions: The findings of this rapid descriptive review based on early clinical evidence suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to neonate/newborn did not occur. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal management of neonates born to COVID-19-positive mothers.","Thomas, Priya; Alexander, Paul Elias; Ahmed, Usman; Elderhorst, Erica; El-Khechen, Hussein; Mammen, Manoj J; Debono, Victoria Borg; Aponte Torres, Zuleika; Aryal, Komal; Brocard, Eva; Sagastuy, Begoña; Alhazzani, Waleed",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,93

291056,Purpose by design or disaster: Preserving a sense of purpose amid environmental uncertainty,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It produces severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, characterised by the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to the World Health Organization, those who smoke are likely to be more vulnerable to infection. Here, in order to clarify the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and COVID-19, we present a systematic literature review until 28th April 2020 and a meta-analysis. We included 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies based on smoking patient status from 720 initial studies in China, the USA, and Italy. The percentage of hospitalised current smokers was 7.7% (95% CI: 6.9-8.4) in China, 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-2.9) in the USA and 7.6% (95% CI: 4.2-11.0) in Italy. These percentages were compared to the smoking prevalence of each country and statistically significant differences were found in them all (p < 0.0001). By means of the meta-analysis, we offer epidemiological evidence showing that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalised (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14-0.23, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the analysis of data from 18 studies shows a much lower percentage of hospitalised current smokers than expected. As more studies become available, this trend should be checked to obtain conclusive results and to explore, where appropriate, the underlying mechanism of the severe progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","González-Rubio, Jesus; Navarro-López, Carmen; López-Nájera, Elena; López-Nájera, Ana; Jiménez-Díaz, Lydia; Navarro-López, Juan D; Nájera, Alberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

291922,Exergy analysis of marine waste heat recovery CO2 closed-cycle gas turbine system,2020-12-08,"Viral pathogens often exploit host cell regulatory and signaling pathways to ensure an optimal environment for growth and survival. Several studies have suggested that 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an intracellular serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in the modulation of infection. Traditionally, AMPK is a key energy regulator of cell growth and proliferation, host autophagy, stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial homeostasis, fatty acid ß-oxidation and host immune function. In this review, we highlight the modulation of host AMPK by various viruses under physiological conditions. These intracellular pathogens trigger metabolic changes altering AMPK signaling activity that then facilitates or inhibits viral replication. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the regulation of AMPK signaling following infection can shed light on the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against viral infectious diseases.","Bhutta, Maimoona Shahid; Gallo, Elisa S; Borenstein, Ronen",,,93

In the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that: (i) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19; (ii) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the social distancing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Start parameters for the model were obtained from observational data after data-smoothing to reduce between-day variation. Three scenarios, 1) no vaccination, 2) vaccination of 60% of the population over 12 months, 3) vaccination of 60% of the population over 7 months were examined. The effects of changes in t&#945; (doubling-time for the spread of infection, known to be slower in the summer months) and tß (half-life of recovery from infection) on the daily number of infectious persons, the cumulative number of infected persons, and the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care units were also determined. RESULTS: Vaccination produced a marked and rapid reduction in the number of infectious persons (up to -60%) and the total number of infected persons (up to -70%). A 7-month vaccination strategy was significantly more effective than a 12-month strategy. The summer effect came too late to have an additional effect on the spread of infection. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities by ~ 70%. DISCUSSION: The predictions are based on the assumptions that lockdown conditions are maintained and vaccine availability is not limiting. CONCLUSION: Predictions made using the model show that vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can markedly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the period of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities in Germany.","Braun, Peter; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,,93

To determine the perception of symptom relief and demographic variables that promote self-medication in Peru. We performed a cross-sectional, analytical, multicenter study in 3792 study respondents on the use, the reason for use, and perception of relief after the use of six drugs during the quarantine period. An online questionnaire was developed, pretested and submitted to the general public. Multivariable logistic regression was used to ascertain factors that influence an individual's desire to self-medicate, associations were considered significant at pâ¯<â¯0.05 and using region (coast, mountain and jungle) as cluster group. The majority of respondents self-medicated with acetaminophen for respiratory symptoms and mainly because they had a cold or flu. It was observed that all the surveyed drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, azithromycin, penicillin, antiretrovirals and hydroxychloroquine) were consumed for various symptoms including: fever, fatigue, cough, sneezing, muscle pain, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache and breathing difficulty. Over 90% of respondents perceived relief of at least one symptom. Multivariable logistic regression showed that older people have a higher frequency of antiretroviral self-medication, respondents who currently have a job had a higher frequency of penicillin self-medication, and that respondents from the Andes consumed less acetaminophen, while the ones from the rainforest consumed it more. There were significant percentages of self-medication, including drugs without sufficient scientific evidence. Age, region where one lived and job status were variables associated with self-medication frequency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). D-dimer levels were pooled and compared between severe/non-severe and surviving/non-surviving patient groups. Weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies reported on D-dimer levels in 5750 non-severe and 2063 severe patients and 16 studies reported on D-dimer levels in 2783 surviving and 697 non-surviving cases. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical status (WMD: 0.45 mg/L, 95% CI: 0.34-0.56; p < 0.0001). Non-surviving patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels compared to surviving patients (WMD: 5.32 mg/L, 95% CI: 3.90-6.73; p < 0.0001). D-dimer levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with higher risk of severity (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25-2.00; p < 0.0001) and mortality (RR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.40-2.37; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased levels of D-dimer levels measured on admission are significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and may predict mortality in hospitalized patients.","Gungor, Baris; Atici, Adem; Baycan, Omer Faruk; Alici, Gokhan; Ozturk, Fatih; Tugrul, Sevil; Asoglu, Ramazan; Cevik, Erdem; Sahin, Irfan; Barman, Hasan Ali",Am. j. emerg. med,,93
294040,From global risk to global threat: State capabilities and modernity in times of coronavirus,2020,"The negative impact of COVID-19 on adults with underlying chronic kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients, has been well documented. Children have a less severe presentation and better prognosis compared to adults. However, little is known regarding the spectrum of COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents with underlying autoimmune disorders necessitating solid organ transplant and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Case Report. An adolescent male developed end-stage kidney disease secondary to microscopic polyangiitis requiring a living-donor kidney transplant. Six years later, he developed antibody-mediated rejection of his kidney transplant. During his rejection treatment course, he contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed new-onset nephrotic syndrome with severe acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant biopsy revealed de novo collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on a background of chronic active antibody mediated rejection. Immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 on the biopsy specimen demonstrated positive staining of the proximal tubular epithelium consistent with intra-renal viral infection. Pulse corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and temporary reduction of anti-metabolite therapy resulted in successful recovery with return of graft function back to pre-infection baseline. This case highlights the clinical conundrum of treating kidney transplant recipients with active rejection in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric kidney transplant recipients can develop severe COVID-19-related kidney complications. Judicious immunosuppression modulation is necessary to balance infection and rejection risk.","Levenson, Emma; Shepherd, Tara N; Aviles, Diego; Craver, Randall; Ehlayel, Abdulla; Love, Gordon L; Simms, K039; Joy,; Straatmann, Caroline; Ashoor, Isa F",Pediatr Transplant,,93

296938,Group design in group testing for COVID-19 : A French case-study,2020-11-13,"Mass vaccination is a crucial public health intervention during outbreaks or pandemics for which vaccines are available. The US government has sponsored the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, for public health emergencies; however, federally supported programs, including the Public Health and Emergency Preparedness program and Cities Readiness Initiative, have historically emphasized antibiotic pill dispensing over mass vaccination. While mass vaccination and pill dispensing programs share similarities, they also have fundamental differences that require dedicated preparedness efforts to address. To date, only a limited number of public assessments of local mass vaccination operational capabilities have been conducted. To fill this gap, we interviewed 37 public health and preparedness officials representing 33 jurisdictions across the United States. We aimed to characterize their existing mass vaccination operational capacities and identify challenges and lessons learned in order to support the efforts of other jurisdictions to improve mass vaccination preparedness. We found that most jurisdictions were not capable of or had not planned for rapidly vaccinating their populations within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 weeks). Many also noted that their focus on pill dispensing was driven largely by federal funding requirements and that preparedness efforts for mass vaccination were often self-motivated. Barriers to implementing rapid mass vaccination operations included insufficient personnel qualified to administer vaccinations, increased patient load compared to pill-dispensing modalities, logistical challenges to maintaining cold chain, and operational challenges addressing high-risk populations, including children, pregnant women, and non-English-speaking populations. Considering the expected availability of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine for distribution and dispensing to the public, our findings highlight critical considerations for planning possible future mass vaccination events, including during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Hosangadi, Divya; Shearer, Matthew P; Warmbrod, Kelsey Lane; Kan, Lilly; Cantu, Michelle; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",Health Secur,,93
297134,"Great Expectations, Structural Limitations: Ursula von der Leyen and the Commission's New Equality Agenda",2020,"We report here an emerging dispute in Italy concerning triage criteria for critically ill covid-19 patients, and how best to support doctors having to make difficult decisions in a context of insufficient life saving resources. The dispute we present is particularly significant as it juxtaposes two opposite views of who should make triage decisions, and how doctors should best be supported. There are both empirical and normative questions at stake here. The empirical questions pertain to the available level of evidence that healthcare professionals would rather not be left alone with their 'clinical judgments' to make triage decisions, and to the accounts of distributive justice that doctors and healthcare professionals rely on, when making triage decisions. The normative questions pertain to how this empirical evidence should inform guidelines on how prioritisation decisions are made in a context of emergency, and who gets to have the authority to do so. This debate goes beyond the discussion of the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and has broader implications beyond the national context for the discussion of how to relieve moral distress in contexts of imbalances between healthcare resources and clinical needs of a population.","Camporesi, Silvia; Mori, Maurizio",J. med. ethics,,93

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, single-center, prospective, 2-arm clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment was set up. Patients were enrolled from the Maxillofacial Department of the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium) between January 2015 and March 2018. Both the intervention group (n = 13) and the control group (n = 13) received the same postoperative care; in addition, the intervention group underwent 6 sessions of MLD after orthognathic surgery. Three-dimensional facial scans were performed and questionnaires administered on postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180. A linear mixed model was performed, and statistical significance was assumed at the 5% level. RESULTS: In total, 26 patients (mean age 29 years; range 16-57 years) were included for statistical analysis. A faster decrease in swelling in the intervention group was observed on 3-dimensional scans. Furthermore, patients receiving MLD reported reduction in swelling and pain within the first month after surgery. However, no statistically significant difference could be detected in these observations (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, no statistically significant difference could be found between patients treated with or without MLD after orthognathic surgery with regard to swelling and pain.","Van de Velde, Fréderic E G; Ortega-Castrillon, Alejandra; Thierens, Laurent A M; Claes, Peter; De Pauw, Guy A M","Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",,93

However, characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with stroke are not well known. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of risk factors, stroke characteristics, and short-term outcomes in a large health system in New York City. We included consecutively admitted patients with acute cerebrovascular events from March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Data were stratified by COVID-19 status, and demographic variables, medical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, imaging results, and in-hospital outcomes were examined. Among COVID-19-positive patients, we also summarized laboratory test results. RESULTS: Of 277 patients with stroke, 105 (38.0%) were COVID-19-positive. Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a cryptogenic (51.8% versus 22.3%, P<0.0001) stroke cause and were more likely to suffer ischemic stroke in the temporal (P=0.02), parietal (P=0.002), occipital (P=0.002), and cerebellar (P=0.028) regions. In COVID-19-positive patients, mean coagulation markers were slightly elevated (prothrombin time 15.4±3.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.6±24.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.4±1.3). Outcomes were worse among COVID-19-positive patients, including longer length of stay (P<0.0001), greater percentage requiring intensive care unit care (P=0.017), and greater rate of neurological worsening during admission (P<0.0001); additionally, more COVID-19-positive patients suffered in-hospital death (33% versus 12.9%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics in patients with stroke were similar comparing those with and without COVID-19. However, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to experience stroke in a lobar location, more commonly had a cryptogenic cause, and had worse outcomes.","Dhamoon, Mandip S; Thaler, Alison; Gururangan, Kapil; Kohli, Amit; Sisniega, Daniella; Wheelwright, Danielle; Mensching, Connor; Fifi, Johanna T; Fara, Michael G; Jette, Nathalie; Cohen, Ella; Dave, Priya; DiRisio, Aislyn C; Goldstein, Jonathan; Loebel, Emma M; Mayman, Naomi A; Sharma, Akarsh; Thomas, Daniel S; Vega Perez, Ruben D; Weingarten, Mark R; Wen, Huei Hsun; Tuhrim, Stanley; Stein, Laura K",Stroke,,93
300172,Stamps deliver covid tributes,2021,"Influenza is a contagious respiratory virus that causes a significant annual health burden in the United States (US). In spite of effective yearly vaccinations to protect individuals against influenza-related health complications, especially with certain chronic co-morbid illnesses, persistent racial/ethnic disparities exist in influenza immunization. African Americans continue to experience low vaccination uptake, stemming, at least in part, from years of bias in and mistrust of orthodox medicine, safety concerns, and environmental barriers to vaccine access. The novel respiratory coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, causes COVID-19, leading to a pandemic that in the U.S. has exerted severe physical, psychological, and economic tolls on the African Americans and other disadvantaged communities. These two respiratory-borne virus' cause disparate effects in the black community, unmasking persistent disparities in healthcare. Unfortunately, suboptimal influenza immunization acceptance exacerbates flu-related adverse health outcomes, similar to difficulties from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In consideration of the impending influenza-COVID-19 ""twindemic"", robust educational campaigns, policy initiatives, and novel approaches to influenza immunization must be considered for the African American community to build trust in the health benefits of the influenza vaccination and, ultimately, to trust in the health benefits of potential SARS-CoV2 vaccines, when available for the general public.","Ferdinand, Keith C; Nedunchezhian, Saihariharan; Reddy, Tina K",J. natl. med. assoc,,93

CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 67-year-old patient who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) followed by behavioral changes, psychosis, sleep disorders, decreased consciousness, and faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Ancillary findings included serum hyponatremia and imaging evidence of high-intensity lesions within bilateral medial temporal lobes on T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery. Both LGI1 and NMDAR antibodies were positive in serum and cerebral spinal fluid using transfected cell based assays. Despite prominent clinical features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis (LGI1-LE), the patient also exhibited overlapping symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, like early-onset GTCS, which might be related to the concomitant positive NMDAR antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of LGI1-LE with overlapping symptoms and simultaneous positive NMDAR antibodies. It is necessary to evaluate the presence of NMDAR antibodies in certain LGI1-LE patients with unusual symptoms. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the observation, given the fact of a single-case study.","Ji, Tuo; Huang, Zhi; Lian, Yajun; Wang, Chengze; Zhang, Qiaoman; Li, Jinghong",BMC Neurol,,93

303509,"Medical Debt in the US, 2009-2020",2021,"INTRODUCTION: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) encompasses a wide spectrum of symptoms, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematological, and dermatological manifestations. The virus interaction with cells located in the respiratory tract causes the release of inflammatory mediators, whose involvement could be exacerbated by co-existing obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVES: the objective of this research was to analyze the clinically metabolic status in patients who have suffered COVID-19 disease in order to predict the outcome. METHODS: this research is a retrospective study based on a cohort of 165 consecutively admitted patients with criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia according to WHO guidelines at the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro between March and April 2020. Recorded variables included demographic and epidemiological data plus diagnoses as well as morbid complications during hospitalization. The Biochemistry Unit Laboratory carried out laboratory analyses according to validated operational procedures. The statistical tests included univariate and multivariate models adjusted for baseline characteristics and clinically relevant features. RESULTS: the most frequent comorbidity in our cohort was arterial hypertension (44.0 %), followed by dyslipidemia (32.1 %), obesity (30.9 %), and diabetes mellitus (20.0 %). The association between admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with body mass index (BMI) in a multivariate model was statistically significant, evidencing that obese subjects (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) have a 19 % higher risk of requiring ICU care. The univariate model revealed a statistically significant association between obesity and ICU admission and length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The relationship between baseline blood glucose and in-hospital mortality was also statistically significant (p = 0.03), as well as with total cholesterol and ICU admission (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: obesity is related to a longer time of hospitalization and a higher rate of admissions to the ICU. Low total cholesterol levels and abnormal baseline blood glucose were risk factors for ICU requirement and in-hospital mortality. Patient categorization based on obesity could be valuable in the development of a precision medicine model within the COVID-19 pandemic.","Martínez Urbistondo, María; Mora Vargas, Alberto; Expósito Palomo, Esther; Aparicio De Miguel, María; Castejón Díaz, Raquel; Daimiel, Lidia; Ramos López, Omar; San Cristóbal, Rodrigo; Martínez, J Alfredo; Vargas Núñez, Juan Antonio",Nutr. hosp,,93

The UK witnessed a notable increase in sole-worker families with the better-educated partner working, irrespective of gender. The impact of the pandemic was similar but weaker in the US. In both countries, couples at the bottom 25% of the prepandemic family income distribution experienced the greatest increase in neither partner working but the least growth in sole-worker arrangements.

Method: An online-based, nationwide, and cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 1,167 respondents were recruited from June 19 to July 2, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire written in Chinese. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants upon their agreement to commence the questionnaire. Perceived efficacy, safety, and their attitudes toward the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing kits were measured. Result: The majority of the study respondents were female [749 (64.2%)], aged 31-40 years old [372 (31.9%)], and located in mainland China [1,137 (97.4%)]. The majority of the respondents held a positive view toward the introduction of the fast-track approval policy for novel coronavirus testing products (6.16 ± 1.30) as well as toward putting more investment in scientific research and biomedicine to improve the detection accuracy of detection kits (5.94 ± 1.55) in China. The respondents valued the detection accuracy more as opposed to the detection time of the testing kits (4.66 ± 2.00), whereas few participants agreed that in the research and development process, detection accuracy could be sacrificed to speed up production and coverage capacity (3.02 ± 2.04). Conclusion: The majority of the participants have a basic knowledge of the detection methods of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the types of test kits, as well as great confidence in China's domestic production of test kits and decisions. However, how basic knowledge, high compliance, and positive attitudes play a role in easing the tension of the pandemic still remains unknown.","Lan, Ruirui; Sujanto, Robin; Lu, Kengbo; He, Zonglin; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit",Front Public Health,,93

DESIGN: An explorative qualitative study comprising two virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 trial team members and 32 in-depth participant interviews (N=44). Data were collected via telephone calls for in-depth interviews or Zoom for FGDs and manually analysed by inductive content analysis. SETTING: Fourteen private security companies in two Uganda districts. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the clinical trial study team, and men working in private security companies who undertook workplace-based HIV testing. RESULTS: The key themes for participants experiences were: 'challenges in accessing HIV treatment and care, and prevention services', 'misinformation' and 'difficulty participating in research activities'. The effects on HIV treatment and prevention resulted from; repercussions of the COVID-19 restrictions, participants fear of coinfection and negative experiences at health facilities. The difficulty in participating in research activities arose from: fear of infection with COVID-19 for the participants who tested HIV negative, transport difficulties, limited post-test psychosocial support and lack of support to initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis. The key study team reflections focused on the management of the clinical trial, effects of the local regulations and government policies and the need to adhere to ethical principles of research.

304117,On Ambiguity Reduction and the Role of Decision Analysis during the Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) may be at a higher risk of a fatal outcome in case of COVID-19. Current risk stratification among these patients relies on personal experience and extrapolation from patients with acquired heart disease. We aimed to provide an expert view on risk stratification while awaiting results from observational studies. METHODS: This study was an initiative of the EPOCH (European Collaboration for Prospective Outcome Research in Congenital Heart disease). Among nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland), 24 experts from 23 tertiary ACHD centres participated in the survey. ACHD experts were asked to identify ACHD-specific COVID-19 risk factors from a list of potential outcome predictors and to estimate the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in seven commonly seen patient scenarios. RESULTS: 82% of participants did not consider all ACHD patients at risk of COVID-19 related complications. There was a consensus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan physiology and cyanotic heart disease as risk factors for adverse outcomes. Among different ACHD scenarios, a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome was considered to be at the highest risk. There was a marked variability in risk estimation among the other potential outcome predictors and ACHD scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Fontan palliation and cyanotic heart disease were widely considered as risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. However, there was a marked disparity in risk estimation for other clinical scenarios. We are in urgent need of outcome studies in ACHD suffering from COVID-19.","Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco Javier; Tobler, Daniel; Greutmann, Matthias; Bouchardy, Judith; Ladouceur, Magalie; Dos-Subira, Laura; Gallego, Pastora; Gabriel, Harald; Bouma, Berto; Schwerzmann, Markus",,,93

COVID-19 patients with an OUD had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=3.44, 95% CI=2.81-4.21), maximum length of stay ( e ß ^ =1.16, 95% CI=1.09-1.22), and odds of IVD (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06-1.49) than patients without an OUD, but did not differ with respect to COVID-19 mortality. However, OUD patients under age 45 exhibited greater COVID-19 mortality (aOR=3.23, 95% CI=1.59-6.56) compared to patients under age 45 without an OUD. OUD patients using opioid agonist treatment (OAT) exhibited higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=5.14, 95% CI=2.75-10.60) and higher maximum length of stay ( e ß ^ =1.22, 95% CI=1.01-1.48) than patients without OUDs; however, risk for IVD and COVID-19 mortality did not differ. OUD patients using naltrexone had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=32.19, 95% CI=4.29-4,119.83), higher maximum length of stay ( e ß ^ =1.59, 95% CI=1.06-2.38), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=3.15, 95% CI=1.04-9.51) than patients without OUDs, but mortality did not differ. OUD patients who did not use treatment medication had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=4.05, 95% CI=3.32-4.98), higher maximum length of stay ( e ß ^ =1.14, 95% CI=1.08-1.21), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=1.25, 95% CI=1.04-1.50) and COVID-19 mortality (aOR=1.31, 95% CI=1.07-1.61) than patients without OUDs. Interpretation: This study suggests people with OUD and COVID-19 often require higher levels of care, and OUD patients who are younger or not using medication treatment for OUDs are particularly vulnerable to death due to COVID-19.","Qeadan, Fares; Tingey, Benjamin; Bern, Rona; Porucznik, Christina A; English, Kevin; Saeed, Ali I; Madden, Erin Fanning",EClinicalMedicine,,93

307116,Changes to calf bTB testing during Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain affects about 20 % of the Canadian population and can lead to physical, psychological and social vulnerabilities. However, this condition remains poorly recognized and undertreated. During 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily living and health care systems, the situation of people with chronic pain has drawn little public attention. METHODS: This qualitative study was part of a pan-Canadian mixed-methods project and aimed to understand the experiences and challenges of people living with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Between May and August 2020, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 individuals living with chronic pain across the country. We used reflexive thematic analysis to interpret data. RESULTS: Our findings underscored four dimensions of the chronic pain experience during the pandemic: (1) Reinforced vulnerability due to uncertainties regarding pain and its management; (2) Social network as a determinant of pain and psychological condition; (3) Increasing systemic inequities intermingling with the chronic pain experience; (4) More viable living conditions due to confinement measures. Though several participants reported improvements in their quality of life and reduced social pressure in the context of stay-at-home orders, participants from socio-economically deprived groups and minorities reported more challenges in accessing pain relief, health care services, and psychosocial support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and intensified pre-existing disparities and challenges among people living with chronic pain in terms of material resources, psychosocial condition, social support, and access to care. In post-pandemic times, it will be essential to address flaws in health and welfare policies to foster equity and social inclusiveness of people with chronic pain.","Dassieu, Lise; Pagé, M Gabrielle; Lacasse, Anaïs; Laflamme, Maude; Perron, Vickie; Janelle-Montcalm, Audrée; Hudspith, Maria; Moor, Gregg; Sutton, Kathryn; Thompson, James M; Choinière, Manon",Int J Equity Health,,93
307154,Virtually EWMA – Telemedicine and the future,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern. It is important to identify high-risk residence communities and the risk factors for decision making on targeted prevention and control measures. In this paper, the number of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in the residence communities in Wuhan, China was collected together with the characteristic variables of the residence communities and the distances between the residence communities and nearby crowded places. The correlation analysis was conducted between the number of confirmed cases and the characteristic/distance variables. Concerning the characteristic variables, there are significant positive correlations between the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the construction area, covered area, total number of houses, total number of buildings, volume ratio, property charge, and number of second-hand houses in the residence communities in Wuhan, while minor or no correlation is observed for the average price of houses, construction year, greening ratio, or number of sold houses. Concerning the distance variables, there are significant negative correlations between the number of confirmed cases and the distances from the residence communities to the nearest universities, business clusters, and railway stations, while minor or no correlation is observed for the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, shopping malls, cinemas, subway stations, bus stops, inter-city bus stations, airport, general hospitals, or appointed hospitals for COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the residence communities which are newly-built, where the volume ratio or property charge is high or the construction area, covered area, or total number of houses, buildings, second-hand houses, or sold houses is large, or which are close to universities, business clusters, subway stations, or railway stations are the high-risk ones where strict measures should be taken. This study provides the authorities with a valuable reference for precise disease prevention and control on the residence community level in similar cities in the world.","Guo, Xiaojing Zhou Xinyue Tian Fengshi Zhang Hui",Journal of Safety Science and Resilience,,93

The demand to explore the use of EHIS for diagnosis and management of communicable and non-communicable diseases has increased dramatically due to the volume of patient data and the need to retain patients in care. In addition, the advent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in high disease burdened low and middle income countries (LMICs) has increased the need for robust EHIS to enable efficient surveillance of the pandemic. EHIS has potential to enable efficient delivery of disease diagnostics services at point-of-care (POC) and reduce medical errors. This review provides an overview of literature on EHIS's with a focus on describing the key components of EHIS and presenting evidence on enablers and barriers to implementation of EHISs in LMICs. With guidance from the presented evidence, we proposed EHIS key stakeholders' roles and responsibilities to ensure efficient utility of EHIS for disease diagnosis and management at POC in LMICs.","Khubone, Thokozani; Tlou, Boikhutso; Mashamba-Thompson, Tivani Phosa",,,93

In the past two decades, there has been an increased occurrence of highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 in the world. The simultaneous increase in ride-sharing penetration in the cities and the occurrence of infectious diseases around the world raise a question about the safety of ride-sharing vehicles amid an infectious disease outbreak. In this paper, the authors investigate the role of ride-sharing vehicles in the spread of COVID-19 in metropolitan areas. To this end, the authors considered a compartmental model to capture the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections in an urban population and an agent-based simulation to capture the ride-sharing exposure to the disease. It is shown through the simulation that in the absence of any within-vehicle disease-control measures, ride-sharing can aggravate the spread of disease. Furthermore, it is shown that effective implementation of disease outbreak control measures at the ride-sharing level can almost nullify this aggravation.","Paudel, Diwas Melendez Kevin A.; Chacreton, Daniel Das Tapas K.; Ortiz, Miguel Reina Kwon Changhyun University of South Florida Tampa Center for Transportation Environment Community Health",,,93

By drug repurposing, affordable therapeutics could be supplied worldwide in the present pandemic context. Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could be a strategy to impede viral replication and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was previously demonstrated to be active against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering assays demonstrated naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 as predicted by molecular modeling. Naproxen impeded recombinant N oligomerization and inhibited viral replication in infected cells. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen specifically inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2-induced damage. No inhibition of viral replication was observed with paracetamol or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Thus, among the NSAID tested, only naproxen combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Naproxen addition to the standard of care could be beneficial in a clinical setting, as tested in an ongoing clinical study.","Terrier, Olivier; Dilly, Sébastien; Pizzorno, Andrés; Chalupska, Dominika; Humpolickova, Jana; Boura, Evzen; Berenbaum, Francis; Quideau, Stéphane; Lina, Bruno; Fève, Bruno; Adnet, Frédéric; Sabbah, Michèle; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Maréchal, Vincent; Henri, Julien; Slama-Schwok, Anny",Molecules (Basel),,93

Besides, the review focus on the present challenges and future directions, structure, and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 for better understanding. Based on data, we revealed that most of the vaccines are focus on targeting the spike protein (S) of COVID-19 to neutralized viral infection and develop long-lasting immunity. Up to phase-1 clinical trials, some vaccines showed the specific antigen-receptor T cell response, elicit the humoral and immune response, displayed tight binding with human-leukocytes-antigen (HLA), and recognized specific antibodies to provoke long-lasting immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Chaudhry, Sundas Nasir; Hazafa, Abu; Mumtaz, Muhummad; Kalsoom, Ume; Abbas, Saima; Kainaat, Amna; Bilal, Shahid; Zafar, Nauman; Siddique, Aleena; Zafar, Ayesha",Life Sci,,93

Adult stem cells reside within a specified dynamic niche in vivo, which is essential for continuous tissue homeostatic maintenance through balancing self-renewal with lineage selection. Meanwhile, adult stem cells may be multipotent or unipotent, and are present in both quiescent and actively dividing states in vivo of the mammalians, which may switch to each other state in response to biophysical cues through mitochondria-mediated mechanisms, such as alterations in mitochondrial respiration and metabolism. In general, stem cells facilitate tissue repair after tissue-specific homing through various mechanisms, including immunomodulation of local microenvironment, differentiation into functional cells, cell ""empowerment"" via paracrine secretion, immunoregulation, and intercellular mitochondrial transfer. Interestingly, cell-source-specific features have been reported between different tissue-derived adult stem cells with distinct functional properties due to the different microenvironments in vivo, as well as differential functional properties in different tissue-derived stem cell-derived extracellular vehicles, mitochondrial metabolism, and mitochondrial transfer capacity. Here, we summarized the current understanding on roles of mitochondrial dynamics during stem cell homeostasis and aging, and lineage-specific differentiation. Also, we proposed potential unique mitochondrial molecular signature features between different source-derived stem cells and potential associations between stem cell aging and mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communication, as well as potential novel strategies for anti-aging intervention and healthy aging.","Lin, Weiping; Chen, Shuxun; Wang, Yan; Wang, Ming; Lee, Wayne Yuk-Wai; Jiang, Xiaohua; Li, Gang",Cell Death Dis,,93

310090,Heterogeneous Treatment and Spillover Effects under Clustered Network Interference,2020-08-03,"Countless evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in human malignant cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), although their exact function remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of the lncRNA LOC440173 in ESCC progression. Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to measure the expression levels of LOC440173 and miR-30d-5p. The biological function of this lncRNA was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, clone formation, and transwell assays, as well as flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The function of LOC440173 was validated in vivo using tumor xenografts. The regulatory network of LOC440173/miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 was established using bioinformatic analysis and verified with dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and rescue experiments. The expression level of LOC440173 was significantly increased in ESCC tissues and esophageal carcinoma cells. High LOC440173 expression was correlated with histological grade, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Overexpression of LOC440173 promoted esophageal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vitro, and facilitated tumor growth in vivo. MicroRNA-30d-5p (miR-30d-5p) was downregulated in ESCC tissues and acted as a direct binding target of LOC440173 during the regulation of HDAC9 expression in esophageal carcinoma cells. In conclusion, LOC440173 exerts a promotive role in ESCC tumorigenesis by targeting the miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 axis and regulating the EMT process. LOC440173 might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ESCC.","Wang, Gaoyan; Feng, Bo; Niu, Yunfeng; Wu, Jianhua; Yang, Yang; Shen, Supeng; Guo, Yanli; Liang, Jia; Guo, Wei; Dong, Zhiming",Mol.

As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.","Franklin, Alan B; Bevins, Sarah N",Sci Total Environ,,93
315435,Uncertain Historical Knowledge for Uncertain Times,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus pandemic is a current global health crisis. Many chiropractic institutions, associations, and researchers have stepped up at a time of need. However, a subset of the chiropractic profession has claimed that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is clinically effective in improving one's immunity, despite the lack of supporting scientific evidence. These unsubstantiated claims contradict official public health policy reflecting poorly on the profession. The aim of this commentary is to provide our perspective on the claims regarding SMT and clinically relevant immunity enhancement, drawing attention to the damaging ramifications these claims might have on our profession's reputation. MAIN TEXT: The World Federation of Chiropractic released a rapid review demonstrating the lack of clinically relevant evidence regarding SMT and immunity enhancement. The current claims contradicting this review carry significant potential risk to patients. Furthermore, as a result of these misleading claims, significant media attention and public critiques of the profession are being made. We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession's reputation. The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students. CONCLUSION: It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy. We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised. We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.","Plener, Joshua; Csiernik, Ben; Bejarano, Geronimo; Hjertstrand, Jesper; Goodall, Benjamin",Chiropr Man Therap,,93

317646,Making the best of a difficult time,2021,"This article presents the reaction of the East-central European (ECE) countries, members of the EU and NATO, to the Coronavirus pandemic. Understandably, there are major similarities as the pandemic—a global challenge—hit every state of the region, by and large, in the same way. The geographical location, size (absence of great powers), and historical traditions led to the exposure of these countries to the pandemic being closely aligned. The points of international reference of these small and medium-sized countries can be seen to align in different directions as to which other states they watch and often follow when deciding about their steps in such a global crisis. This article cannot be fully comprehensive and will, therefore, focus on the reactions of health and emergency services. It raises the question as to whether any similarities are deterministic or whether there are noticeable differences due to the variety of their political systems and current history. © 2020, Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defense Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

For the modeling process, the data published by the daily technical report COVID-19 in Mexico from March 19th to September 30th were used. The data published in the month of October were included to carry out the prediction. The results show a satisfactory comparison between the real data and those obtained by both models with a R2 > 0.999. The Levenberg-Marquardt and BFGS quasi-Newton optimization algorithm were favorable for fitting the coefficients during learning in the ANN model due to their fast and precision, respectively. On the other hand, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm fitted the parameters of the Gompertz model faster by minimizing the sum of squares. Therefore, the ANN model better fits the real data using ten coefficients. However, the Gompertz model using three parameters converges in less computational time. In the prediction, the inverse ANN model was solved by a genetic algorithm obtaining the best precision with a maximum error of 2.22% per day, as opposed to the 5.48% of the Gompertz model with respect to the real data reported from November 1st to 15th. Finally, according to the coefficients and parameters obtained from both models with recent data, a total of 109,724 cumulative deaths for the inverse ANN model and 100,482 cumulative deaths for the Gompertz model were predicted for the end of 2020.","Conde-Gutiérrez, R A; Colorado, D; Hernández-Bautista, S L",Nonlinear Dyn,,93

322130,"Global biodiversity and biogeography of mangrove crabs: Temperature, the key driver of latitudinal gradients of species richness",2020,"Background: A rigorous approach is needed to inform rapid adaptation and optimisation of behavioral interventions in evolving public health contexts, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This helps ensure that interventions are relevant, persuasive, and feasible while remaining evidence-based. This paper provides a set of iterative methods to rapidly adapt and optimize an intervention during implementation. These methods are demonstrated through the example of optimizing an effective online handwashing intervention called Germ Defense. Methods: Three revised versions of the intervention were rapidly optimized and launched within short timeframes of 1-2 months. Optimisations were informed by: regular stakeholder engagement; emerging scientific evidence, and changing government guidance; rapid qualitative research (telephone think-aloud interviews and open-text surveys), and analyses of usage data. All feedback was rapidly collated, using the Table of Changes method from the Person-Based Approach to prioritize potential optimisations in terms of their likely impact on behavior change. Written feedback from stakeholders on each new iteration of the intervention also informed specific optimisations of the content. Results: Working closely with clinical stakeholders ensured that the intervention was clinically accurate, for example, confirming that information about transmission and exposure was consistent with evidence. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) contributors identified important clarifications to intervention content, such as whether Covid-19 can be transmitted via air as well as surfaces, and ensured that information about difficult behaviors (such as self-isolation) was supportive and feasible. Iterative updates were made in line with emerging evidence, including changes to the information about face-coverings and opening windows. Qualitative research provided insights into barriers to engaging with the intervention and target behaviors, with open-text surveys providing a useful supplement to detailed think-aloud interviews. Usage data helped identify common points of disengagement, which guided decisions about optimisations. The Table of Changes was modified to facilitate rapid collation and prioritization of multiple sources of feedback to inform optimisations. Engagement with PPI informed the optimisation process. Conclusions: Rapid optimisation methods of this kind may in future be used to help improve the speed and efficiency of adaptation, optimization, and implementation of interventions, in line with calls for more rapid, pragmatic health research methods.","Morton, Katherine; Ainsworth, Ben; Miller, Sascha; Rice, Cathy; Bostock, Jennifer; Denison-Day, James; Towler, Lauren; Groot, Julia; Moore, Michael; Willcox, Merlin; Chadborn, Tim; Amlot, Richard; Gold, Natalie; Little, Paul; Yardley, Lucy",Front Public Health,,93

The aim of this study was to compare age and comorbidities between women and men who died from COVID-19. We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1 and May 9, 2020. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independently significant variables associated with gender in patients who died from COVID-19. The model was adjusted for age and comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 mortality. We identified 6760 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these patients, 3018/6760 (44.6%) were women. The mortality rate was higher for men (women 18.2% vs. men 20.6%, p = 0.039). Of the patients who died, women were on average 5 years older than men (woman 77.4 ± 12.7 vs. men 72.4 ± 13.0, p < 0.001). In the multivariable model, cardiovascular comorbidities were not significantly different between women and men. Chronic kidney disease (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and smoking (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) were more common in men. Age decile (aOR for women 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and obesity (aOR for women 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-3.0) were higher in women. This study demonstrates that women who died of COVID-19 showed a similar cardiovascular disease profile as men. Yet, they are 5 years older than men. Investigating the gender impacts of COVID-19 is an important part of understanding the disease behavior.","Klang, Eyal; Soffer, Shelly; Nadkarni, Girish; Glicksberg, Ben; Freeman, Robert; Horowitz, Carol; Reich, David L; Levin, Matthew A",SN Compr Clin Med,,93

325257,From the Guest Editors,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reached Kenya in March 2020 with the initial cases reported in the capital city Nairobi and in the coastal area Mombasa. As reported by the World Health Organization, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the world, killed many, collapsed economies and changed the way people live since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in the end of 2019. As at the end of December 2020, it had led to over 2.8 million confirmed cases in Africa with over 67 thousand deaths. The trend poses a huge threat to global public health. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We employed a SEIHCRD mathematical transmission model with reported Kenyan data on cases of COVID-19 to estimate how transmission varies over time. The model is concise in structure, and successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the model to assess the factors driving the infection. The model illustrates the effect of mass testing on COVID-19 as well as individual self initiated behavioral change. The results have significant impact on the management of COVID-19 and implementation of prevention policies. The results from the model analysis shows that aggressive and effective mass testing as well as individual self initiated behaviour change play a big role in getting rid of the COVID-19 epidemic otherwise the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery.","Mbogo, Rachel Waema; Orwa, Titus Okello",,,93
326846,Plenty more work on new covid-19 treatments,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The most recent survey conducted by the World Health Organization described Tuberculosis (TB) as one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. The increasing number of TB-resistant cases has contributed to this scenario. In light of this, new strategies to control and treat the disease are necessary. Our research group has previously described furoxan derivatives as promising scaffolds to be explored as new antitubercular drugs. RESULTS: Two of these furoxan derivatives, (14b) and (14c), demonstrated a high selectivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The compounds (14b) and (14c) were also active against a latent M. tuberculosis strain, with MIC90 values of 6.67 µM and 9.84 µM, respectively; they were also active against monoresistant strains (MIC90 values ranging from 0.61 to 20.42 µM) and clinical MDR strains (MIC90 values ranging from 3.09 to 42.95 µM). Time-kill experiments with compound (14c) showed early bactericidal effects that were superior to those of the first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs currently used in therapy. The safety of compounds (14b) and (14c) was demonstrated by the Ames test because these molecules were not mutagenic under the tested conditions. Finally, we confirmed the safety, and high efficacy of compounds (14b) and (14c), which reduced M. tuberculosis to undetectable levels in a mouse aerosol model of infection. CONCLUSION: Altogether, we have identified two advanced lead compounds, (14b) and (14c), as novel promising candidates for the treatment of TB infection.","de Souza, P C; Fernandes, G F S; Marino, L B; Ribeiro, C M; Silva, P B da; Chorilli, M; Silva, C S P; Resende, F A; Solcia, M C; de Grandis, R A; Costa, C A S; Cho, S H; Wang, Y; Franzblau, S G; Dos Santos, J L; Pavan, F R",Biomed Pharmacother,,93

329227,The people behind the papers - Wael Noor El-Nachef and Marianne Bronner,2020,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to address the relevant issues surrounding older adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) today. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 1 million people >65âyears have CAP in the US per year, which is more than previously reported (or realized). Older adults are vulnerable to the increasing prevalence of viral CAP, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes, but pneumococcus is still the most common pathogen to cause CAP. Racial disparities continue to need to be addressed in order to improve early and late outcomes of older adults with CAP. SUMMARY: The epidemiology of CAP, specifically for older adults is changing. More recent pathogen incidence studies have included culture, as well as newer microbiological methods to determine etiology. Current disparities among disadvantaged populations, including African-Americans, result in more comorbidities which predisposes to more severe CAP. However, outcomes in the hospital between races tend to be similar, and outcomes between age groups tends to be worse for older compared to younger adults. Finally, the cost of CAP is significant compared to diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction and stroke.","Furman, Christian Davis; Leinenbach, Angela; Usher, Ronnita; Elikkottil, Jaseena; Arnold, Forest W",Curr. opin. infect. dis,,93

330273,No Time for Silence,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical features of children with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The children who were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 in the Wuchang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan from February 5 to March 10, 2020 were enrolled as subjects. The clinical, laboratory, and lung imaging data were collected during hospitalization and isolation. This was a retrospective single-center case series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1 124 patients with mild COVID-19 were admitted from February 5 to March 10, 2020, including 13 children (1.16%). All the 13 children (7 boys and 6 girls) were residents of Wuhan in China, with a median age of 16 years (range: 10-18 years). Of all the 13 children, 9(69%) were from family clusters of COVID-19 and 4(31%) had unknown sources of infection. The mean time from exposure to onset was 6.8 days (range: 2-13 days) in 9 children with a definite history of exposure. There were 6 symptomatic children with the main manifestations of fever, cough, weakness, and myalgia, and the mean time from onset to hospitalization was 9.2 days. Of all the 13 children, 7(54%) were asymptomatic with positive nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There were 4 children (31%) with abnormal lung CT findings, mainly patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lung field, and 6 children (46%) had no symptoms with normal lung CT findings. All children had normal routine blood test results and C-reactive protein levels. Eight children underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests at least once, among whom 6 had negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive IgG, and 2 underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests twice and had negative results. Of all the 13 children, 11(85%) had negative results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests during hospitalization and were discharged, and 2(15%) had positive results of four SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and were transferred to another hospital and lost to follow-up. Among the 11 children who were followed up, 1 had positive results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests at the isolation point, and 10 had negative results. The mean hospital stay was 10.9 days for the 13 children. Eleven children recovered during follow-up, with good living and learning conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild COVID-19 often have an uncertain history of exposure and may not have any clinical symptoms. Etiological diagnosis is more important than clinical diagnosis. The disappearance of clinical manifestations may not parallel with the result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. SARS-CoV-2 has a long detoxification time, and there may be recurrent cases of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further studies are needed to investigate the production patterns of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and their effect on the body.","Tian, J. D.; Xie, M.; Wen, Z. C.; Xu, J.

We prove that when the basic reproduction number is less than unity the model can exhibit a number of nonlinear phenomena including saddle-node, backward, and Hopf bifurcations. The model is fitted to COVID-19 data pertinent to Saudi Arabia.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. All women aged up to 24 years, who delivered between April 25, 2020, and June 24, 2020, at Women's Hospital, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil were considered. The ENG-implant or other contraceptive methods were offered prior to hospital discharge. The participants were split into two groups: (1) those who chose the ENG-implant and (2) those that refused the implant. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: 151 women were included, with 76.2% selecting the ENG-implant. The average age was 19.5 years;73.2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32.5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75.5% were not in full time education. Further, 70.5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89.1% unsatisfied with their previous method that opted for the ENG-implant (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Offering the ENG-implant to youths during the immediate postnatal period is evidence-based care, and contraceptive provision is an essential health promotion tool, even during a pandemic. Thinking quickly about public policies in times of crisis is important to guarantee sexual and reproductive rights.","Barbieri, M. M.; Herculano, T. B.; Dantas Silva, A.; Bahamondes, L.; Juliato, C.

Given the uncertainties of WVC educational quality and the challenge of shifting to an online environment, this study aimed to evaluate student satisfaction with the teaching quality of case-based discussion (CBD) sessions conducted through WVC. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two undergraduate medical students in pediatrics completed the reduced Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) survey with a five-point Likert scale over 5 weeks. The WVC CBD sessions were facilitated by 50 faculty members. RESULTS: 82% of respondents were highly satisfied with the WVC CBD session's teaching quality. The majority agreed that the sessions were intellectually challenging, that the instructors were dynamic, and encouraged students to participate. No statistically significant correlation was found between student satisfaction and technical issues (r = 0.037, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: WVC teaching had an overall positive outcome on student satisfaction, and teaching quality relied on teaching, cognitive, and social presence rather than technology. However, technology remains an important platform that supports teachers' educational activities. Thus, implementing a blended pediatric course to augment future course delivery is optimal.","Fatani, Tarah H",BMC Med Educ,,93

340825,On the benefits of flattening the curve: A perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality among adults. The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children under 18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated prior to the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 9,812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%; P = 0.003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI 1.59-130.39; P = 0.02) for SARS-CoV-2 positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection. This risk persisted after adjustment for preoperative upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting an increased risk in symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Saynhalath, Rita; Alex, Gijo; Efune, Proshad N; Szmuk, Peter; Zhu, Hong; Sanford, Ethan L",,,93

The impact of the pandemic on dual-physician households remains unknown. In this survey study, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dual-physician families and described gendered differences related to the impact of the pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey distributed via e-mail and social media, with results collected from April 30, 2020 until May 26, 2020. Respondents were members of a dual-physician couple. Respondents provided information on demographic characteristics and the impact of the pandemic on their professional lives, personal lives, and well-being. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Ordinal variables were compared between genders using Cochran-Armitage trend test. Feeling emotionally and physically drained compared to pre-pandemic was analyzed as a binary outcome in a multivariable logistic model. Results: Of the 1799 physicians who completed the survey, 52% were between 30 and 39 years old, 81% self-identified as women, and 62% were white. Women were more likely to report increased worry about their job security, finances, personal health, partner's health, and children's health (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported feeling more drained during the pandemic. Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.3, p < 0.001), and having children younger than 5 years of age (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.95, p = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of feeling more drained. Conclusions: Women were more likely to report increased worry about job security, finances, and health and had an increased risk of feeling more drained during the pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant stress for all physicians, women in dual-physician families were disproportionately affected, demonstrating the need for increased support from hospital administrations.","Soares, Andrea; Thakker, Prashanth; Deych, Elena; Jain, Shikha; Bhayani, Rakhee K",J Womens Health (Larchmt),,93
341081,Posterior predictive model checking using formal methods in a spatio-temporal model,2021-10-04,"SUMMARY: iBioProVis is an interactive tool for visual analysis of the compound bioactivity space in the context of target proteins, drugs and drug candidate compounds. iBioProVis tool takes target protein identifiers and, optionally, compound SMILES as input, and uses the state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction method t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to plot the distribution of compounds embedded in a 2D map, based on the similarity of structural properties of compounds and in the context of compounds' cognate targets. Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2D map, may bind the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe the structural distribution of one or two target proteins' known ligands on the 2D compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein which is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds and seven antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iBioProVis and its carefully filtered dataset are available at https://ibpv.kansil.org/ for public use. CONTACT: vatalay@metu.edu.tr.

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (±standard deviation) was 49 years ± 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Li, Lin; Qin, Lixin; Xu, Zeguo; Yin, Youbing; Wang, Xin; Kong, Bin; Bai, Junjie; Lu, Yi; Fang, Zhenghan; Song, Qi; Cao, Kunlin; Liu, Daliang; Wang, Guisheng; Xu, Qizhong; Fang, Xisheng; Zhang, Shiqin; Xia, Juan; Xia, Jun",Radiology,,93

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the development direction of home-based exercise and put in the corresponding efforts. However, there is currently a lack of research on all aspects of home-based exercise. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effective sustainable development strategy of home-based exercise in China through a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) hybrid model. Thirteen factors corresponding to the SWOT analysis were identified through a literature review and expert opinions. The results show that in China the advantages and potential outweigh the weaknesses and threats of home-based exercise. Home-based exercise should grasp the external development opportunities and choose the SO development strategic type that combines internal strengths and external opportunities. As the core for the development of home-based exercise, this strategy should be given priority. To sum up, home-based exercise is believed to have a bright future.","Li, Hanming; Chen, Xingquan; Fang, Yiwei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

346989,Ising model with variable spin/agent strengths,2020-04-10,"Tick-borne encephalitis is a natural-focal infection damaging central nervous system, caused by the similarly-named virus transmitted by several species of ixodic ticks. Natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are widely spread in the forest and forest-steppe landscape zones of the temperate climate belt in the vast territory of Eurasia from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. New TBE-endemic territories have been recently identified in Japan, the Netherlands, and in the UK - in 2019. The increasing risk of infection due to the development of tourism and visits to natural foci of TBE became a public health issue of international concern. The aim of the study is to identify modern features of TBE incidence dynamics in the Russian Federation, the state of laboratory diagnostics and prevention and to predict the incidence for 2021. The paper shows that there is a persistent downward trend in TBE-cases in Russia, which is observed through the past few years. The characteristic feature of the epidemic season-2020 was a significant reduction in the incidence of TBE: 989 cases were registered in 33 constituent entities of the Russian Federation (morbidity rate - 0.67 per 100 000 of the population). The sharp decrease of TBE cases in 2020 as compared to 2019 against the background of a decrease in vaccination can be explained, along with natural factors, by the introduction of restrictive measures during the COVID-19 epidemic. The paper also reflects the dynamics of morbidity, seeking the medical services because of tick bites, the infection rate of the carrier, the scope of vaccination, seroprophylaxis, acaricide treatments. The coverage of express-diagnostic tests of ticks for markers of associated pathogens and its availability for the population are presented. It is recognized that the epidemiological situation on TBE in the Russian Federation remains unfavorable. It demands constant attention on the part of healthcare organizations and Federal Service for Surveillance in the Sphere of Consumers Rights Protection and Human Welfare, as well as management decision making aimed at further decrement in TBE incidence through the improvement of prevention measures, specifically in the entities that are characterized by high TBE incidence. The situation requires monitoring of natural foci of infection, enhancement of prophylaxis and treatment of TBE. The paper provides the forecast of TBE incidence for 2021 and values of the 95 % confidence range of the indicator fluctuation, taking into account the presence or absence of trends in its changes in the territory of federal districts and constituent entities of the Russian Federation in 2011-2020. © 2021 Russian Research Anti-Plague Institute.

347836,Planning for Dissent,2021,"The previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have led researchers to study the role of diagnostics in impediment of further spread and transmission. With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control. Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 102 RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR. Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30â min combined with the colorimetric visualization. This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV). Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.","Baek, Yun Hee; Um, Jihye; Antigua, Khristine Joy C; Park, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Yeonjae; Oh, Sol; Kim, Young-Il; Choi, Won-Suk; Kim, Seong Gyu; Jeong, Ju Hwan; Chin, Bum Sik; Nicolas, Halcyon Dawn G; Ahn, Ji-Young; Shin, Kyeong Seob; Choi, Young Ki; Park, Jun-Sun; Song, Min-Suk",Emerg Microbes Infect,,93

348898,"Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act--Tax Relief for Individuals and Businesses",2020,"Abstract Aim Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is spreading typically to the human population all over the world and the report suggests that scientists have been trying to map the pattern of the early transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since it has been reported as an epidemic. Our main aim is to show if the rise-in-cases proceeds in a gradual and staggered manner instead of soaring quickly then we can suppress the burden of the health system. In this new case study, we are attempting to show how to control the outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19 via mathematical modeling. We have examined that the method of flattening the curve of the coronavirus, which increases the recovery rate of the infected individuals and also helps to decrease the number of deaths. In this pandemic situation, the countries like Russia, India, the United States of America (USA), South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) are leading in front where the virus is spreading in an unprecedented way. From our point of view, we establish that if these countries are following the method of flattening the curve like China and South Korea then these countries can also overcome this pandemic situation. Method We propose a Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) mathematical model of infectious disease with onset data of COVID-19 in Wuhan and international cases, which has been propagated in Wuhan City to calculate the transmission rate of the infectious virus COVID-19 until now. To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, infected and recovered rate diagram, prediction of the transmission of the disease from the available dataset in Wuhan, and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. Results We have observed that the basic reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.2 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.15-4.77) to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) and the mean incubation period was 5.2?days (95% [CI], 4.1-7.0). Interestingly the mean value lies between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19. The doubling time of COVID-19 was registered 7.4?days (95% CI, 5.3-19) in the early stages and now the value decreases to ?4.9?days. Similarly, we have observed the doubling time of the epidemic in South Korea decreased to ?9.6?days. Currently, the doubling time of the epidemic in Russia, India, and the USA are 19.4?days, 16.4?days, and 41?days, respectively. We have investigated the growth rate of COVID-19 and plotted the curve flattening diagram against time. Conclusion Via flattening the curve method, China and South Korea control the transmission of the fatal disease COVID-19 in the human population. Our results show that these two countries initially sustained pandemics in a large portion of the human population in the form of virus outbreaks that basically prevented the virus from spreading further and created ways to prevent community transmission. The majority portion of the people are perfectly fine, who are quarantined strictly and never get sick, but the portion of people who have developed symptoms is quickly isolated further.","Batabyal, Saikat Batabyal Arthita",Health Science Reports,,93
349127,Holography from Decoherence and Entanglement,2020-06-23,"Context: An outbreak of a novel, zoonotic coronavirus occurred in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and has now affected almost the entire world, with the maximum confirmed cases being 1 521 252 as of April 10, 2020. The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it. Objective: The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV"" or ""MERS-CoV"" or ""Bat SARS-CoV"" or ""ACE2 receptor"". Setting: This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results: The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions: First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time. The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.","Khan, Tahseen; Agnihotri, Kartikeya; Tripathi, Aditi; Mukherjee, Suneet; Agnihotri, Namita; Gupta, Gaurav",Altern. ther. health med,,93

This strongly implies global transmission occurred before the lockdown of China. However, the initial source's transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain obscure and controversial. Research data suggest bat (RaTG13) and pangolin carried CoV were the proximal source of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used systematic phylogenetic analysis of Coronavirinae subfamily along with wild type human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains. The key residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and O-linked glycan were compared. SARS-CoV-2 strains were clustered with RaTG13 (97.41% identity), Pangolin-CoV (92.22% identity) and Bat-SL-CoV (80.36% identity), forms a new clade-2 in lineage B of beta-CoV. The alignments of RBD contact residues to ACE2 justified? Those SARS-CoV-2 strains sequences were 100% identical by each other, significantly varied in RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic cleavage site with an inserted sequence of PRRA compared to RaTG13 and only PRR to pangolin. Only serine (Ser) in pangolin and both threonine (Thr) and serine (Ser) O-linked glycans were seen in RaTG13, suggesting that a detailed study needed in pangolin (Manis javanica) and bat (Rhinolophus affinis) related CoV.","Malaiyan, Jeevan; Arumugam, Suresh; Mohan, Kamalraj; Gomathi Radhakrishnan, Gokul",J. med. virol,,93

In this study, we aimed at investigating the clinical and laboratory assessments in COVID-19 patients with and without liver injury. Methods: Symptomatic 541 COVID-19 positive patients, who were admitted to Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were recruited in this study. Their data was collected retrospectively, including demographic data, blood tests, symptoms, radiographical assessments, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Results: Around 19% of the recruited COVID-19 patients displayed signs of acute liver injury. Also, there was an increase in the percentage of critical, ICU-admitted and mortality rates in COVID-19 cases with liver injury, as well as a higher percentage of septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 patients with liver injury had more pronounced bilateral consolidation, lymphopenia and neutrophilia. Additionally, these patients had higher levels of CRP, LDH, procalcitonin, ferritin and D dimer levels. Finally, there was a higher percentage of patients taking various COVID-19 therapies in the COVID-19 patients with liver injury group.

In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach and a germ-free (GF) fish model to determine the response of newly hatched zebrafish larvae after 24 h exposure to Pseudozyma sp. when compared to conventionally-raised (CR) larvae. We observed 59 differentially expressed genes in Pseudozyma-exposed GF zebrafish larvae compared to their naïve control siblings. Surprisingly, in CR larvae, there was not a clear transcriptome difference between Pseudozyma-exposed and control larvae. Differentially expressed genes in GF larvae were involved in host metabolic pathways, mainly peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, steroid hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. We also observed a significant change in the transcript levels of immune-related genes, namely complement component 3a, galectin 2b, ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, and aquaporins. Nevertheless, we did not observe any significant response at the cellular level, since there were no differences between neutrophil migration or proliferation between control and yeast-exposed GF larvae. Our findings reveal that exposure to Pseudozyma sp. may affect metabolic pathways and immune-related processes in germ-free zebrafish, suggesting that commensal yeast likely play a significant part in the early development of fish larvae.","Siriyappagouder, Prabhugouda; Galindo-Villegas, Jorge; Dhanasiri, Anusha K S; Zhang, Qirui; Mulero, Victoriano; Kiron, Viswanath; Fernandes, Jorge M O",Front Immunol,,93

METHODS: This study involved a retrospective case notes review of patients referred to a single specialist paediatric centre with suspected PIMS-TS, with a focus on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome in the context of an MDT framework. RESULTS: Nineteen children of median age 9.1 years fulfilled the definition of PIMS-TS and were managed within an MDT framework: 5/19 were female; 14/19 were of Black, Asian or minority ethnicity; 9/19 also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). Severe systemic inflammation, shock, and abdominal pain were ubiquitous. Treatment was stratified within an MDT framework and included CSs in all; i.v. immunoglobulin in all; anakinra in 4/19; infliximab in 1/19; and antiviral (aciclovir) in 4/19. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant diagnostic equipoise using a current definition of PIMS-TS, overlapping with KD. Outside of clinical trials, an MDT approach is vital. The role of the paediatric rheumatologist is to consider differential diagnoses of hyperinflammation in the young, to advise on empiric immunomodulatory therapy, to set realistic therapeutic targets, to gauge therapeutic success, to oversee timely step-down of immunomodulation, and to contribute to the longer-term MDT follow-up of any late inflammatory sequelae.","Papadopoulou, Charalampia; Al Obaidi, Muthana; Moraitis, Elena; Compeyrot-Lacassagne, Sandrine; Eleftheriou, Despina; Brogan, Paul",Rheumatology (Oxford),,93

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were supposed to receive chloroquine (CQ) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Due to a change in institutional protocol, initial patients received chloroquine and subsequent patients who did not receive chloroquine served as negative controls. Clinical effectiveness was determined in terms of timing of symptom resolution and conversion rate of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on day 14 and day 15 of admission. RESULTS: Twelve COVID-19 patients formed the treatment arm and 17 patients were included in the control arm. The duration of symptoms among the CQ treated group (6.3 ± 2.7 days) was significantly (p-value = 0.009) lower than that of the control group (8.9 ± 2.2 days). There was no significant difference in the rate of RT-PCR negativity in both groups. 2 patients out of 12 developed diarrhea in the CQ therapy arm. CONCLUSION: The duration of symptoms among the treated group (with chloroquine) was significantly lower than that of the control group. RT-PCR conversion was not significantly different between the 2 groups.","Niwas, Ram; S, Aneesa Shahul; Garg, M K; Nag, Vijaya Lakshmi; Bhatia, Pradeep Kumar; Dutt, Naveen; Chauhan, Nishant; Charan, Jaykaran; Asfahan, Shahir; Sharma, Praveen; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Banerjee, Mithu; Garg, Pawan; Sureka, Binit; Bohra, Gopal Krishna; Gopalakrishnan, Maya; Misra, Sanjeev",Adv Respir Med,,93

As a result, frailty rates are expected to increase, and frailty is expected to worsen as a secondary problem associated with COVID-19 countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to determine the extent of frailty in the elderly associated with lifestyle changes implemented as COVID-19 countermeasures, to ascertain actual lifestyle changes and clarify the existence of Corona-Frailty. We will also conduct Corona-Frailty screening to verify the effect of support provided as feedback to supporters of the elderly. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The survey target area is Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Phase I aims to verify the short-term effects of COVID-19. A questionnaire will be distributed to 465 community-dwelling elderly people, and responses will be obtained by post. Frailty will be evaluated using the Frailty Screening Index. Respondents who are frail and have had many changes in their lifestyle will be screened as high-risk people, and feedback will be provided to local supporters. The aim of Phase II will be to verify the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the effect of screening. A similar survey will be distributed twice after the first survey, once after 6 months and again after 1 year and the frailty rate will be tested. Furthermore, out of the subjects identified with frailty in Phase I, the progress of those who were screened and those who were not screened will be compared between groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Takasaki University of Health and Welfare (approval number: 2009). The results of this study will be reported to the policymaker, presented at academic conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

The direct pathway refers to the person-to-person transmission between susceptibles and infectious individuals. Infected individuals shed virus on the objects, and new infections arise through touching a contaminated surface; this refers to the indirect transmission pathway. We model the direct and indirect transmission pathways with a S A D O I R ode model. Our proposal explicitly includes compartments for the contaminated objects, susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infectious, detected infectious, and recovered individuals. We compute the basic reproduction number and epidemic growth rate of the model and determine how these fundamental quantities relate to the transmission rate of the pathways. We further study the relationship between the rate of loss of immunity and the occurrence of backward bifurcation. An efficient statistical framework is introduced to estimate the parameters of the model. We show the performance of the model in the simulation scenarios and the real data from the COVID-19 daily cases in South Korea.","Memarbashi, Reza; Mahmoudi, Seyed Mahdi",,,93
364990,AgreeSum: Agreement-Oriented Multi-Document Summarization,2021-06-04,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is impacting the global population. This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to receptor binding domain (RBD), nucleocapsid, and spike S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 develop over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2+ patient specimens, 86%), suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were different based on patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age. Analyses of these findings may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the levels of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients throughout infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2+ patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-18, and gamma interferon [IFN-Î³]) and chemotactic markers (IP-10 and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), GRO-&#945;, and MIP-1&#945; relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients who succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Furthermore, patients who succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and had a higher ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population, and knowledge of the immune response to COVID-19 is still developing. This study assesses the interplay of different parts of the immune system during COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate that COVID-19 patients produce antibodies to three proteins of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and identify many other immunological proteins that are involved during infection. The data suggest that one of these proteins (CXCL13) may be a novel biomarker for severe COVID-19 that can be readily measured in blood. This information combined with our broad-scale analysis of immune activity during COVID-19 provides new information on the immunological response throughout the course of disease and identifies a novel potential marker for assessing disease severity.","Horspool, Alexander M; Kieffer, Theodore; Russ, Brynnan P; DeJong, Megan A; Wolf, M Allison; Karakiozis, Jacqueline M; Hickey, Brice J; Fagone, Paolo; Tacker, Danyel H; Bevere, Justin R; Martinez, Ivan; Barbier, Mariette; Perrotta, Peter L; Damron, F Heath",MSphere,,93

A Comparative Study of Democracy under the Virus Threat,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Both inpatient and outpatient providers may be at increased risk of stress, anxiety and depression from their roles as health providers during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study explores how the US COVID-19 epidemic has increased feelings of stress, anxiety and depression among outpatient reproductive health providers. METHODS: We conducted a survey with open-ended responses among outpatient reproductive health providers across the U.S. engaged in contraceptive care to collect data on their experiences with stress, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. The study population included physicians, nurses, social workers, and other health professions [n = 288]. Data were collected from April 21st-June 24th 2020. We used content analysis of free text responses among providers reporting increased stress, anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Two-thirds (184) of providers reported increased stress and one-third (96) reported increased anxiety or depression related to care provision during the COVID-19 epidemic. The major sources of stress, anxiety and depression were due to patient care, worry about becoming infected or infecting family members, work- and home-related concerns, experiencing provider burnout, and fear of the unknown. Concerns about quality of patient care, providers' changing responsibilities, lack of personal protective equipment, and difficulty coping with co-worker illness and absence all contributed to provider stress and anxiety. Worries about unemployment and childcare responsibilities were also highlighted. Providers attributed their stress, anxiety or depression to feeling overwhelmed, being unable to focus, lacking sleep, and worrying about the unknown. CONCLUSIONS: US outpatient providers are experiencing significant stress, anxiety, and depression during the US COVID-19 epidemic. Policy and programmatic responses are urgently needed to address the widespread adverse mental health consequences of this epidemic on outpatient providers, including reproductive health providers, across the US.

367632,Making Resolutions Last,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is rapidly spreading across the globe. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the pandemic.

In this review, we consider a year later where we are now, what the future holds, and what the long-term effects of the pandemic will be on stroke. Stroke occurs in about 1.4% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, who show an excess of large vessel occlusion and increased mortality. Despite this association, stroke presentations fell dramatically during the pandemic, although emerging data suggest that total stroke mortality may have risen with increased stroke deaths at home and in care homes. Strategies and guidelines have been developed to adapt stroke services worldwide, and protect healthcare workers. Adaptations include increasing use of telemedicine for all aspects of stroke care. The pandemic is exacerbating already marked global inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality. Lastly, the pandemic has had a major impact on stroke research and funding, although it has also emphasized the importance of large scale collaborative research initiatives.","Markus, Hugh S; Martins, Sheila",Int J Stroke,,93

Here we discuss how the threshold is related to the basic infectivity of neighbors $R_0$, for trees (Bethe lattice), trees with triangular cliques, and in non-planar lattice percolation with extended-range connectivity. It is shown how having a smaller range of contacts increases the critical value of $R_0$ above the value $R_{0,c}=1$ appropriate for a tree, an infinite-range system or a large completely connected graph.","Ziff, Robert M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00550v1.pdf,93

In this study, a comprehensive crystallography-guided fragment-based drug discovery approach was employed to design new inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. All small molecules co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank were used as inputs. Fragments sitting in the binding pocket (87) were grouped into eight geographical types. They were interactively coupled using various synthetically reasonable linkers to generate larger molecules with divalent binding modes taking advantage of two different fragments' interactions. In total, 1,251 compounds were proposed, and 7,158 stereoisomers were screened using Glide (standard precision and extra precision), AutoDock Vina, and Prime MMGBSA. The top 22 hits having conformations approaching the linear combination of their constituent fragments were selected for MD simulation on Desmond. MD simulation suggested 15 of these did adopt conformations very close to their constituent pieces with far higher binding affinity than either constituent domain alone. These structures could provide a starting point for the further design of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors with improved binding, and structures are provided.","Ahmad, Sarfraz; Usman Mirza, Muhammad; Yean Kee, Lee; Nazir, Mamoona; Abdul Rahman, Noorsaadah; Trant, John F; Abdullah, Iskandar",Chem. biol. drug des,,93
373495,Roundtable Discussion: The Challenge of Developing Effective Sterilization and Reprocessing Instructions for Use,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has shown a global spreading trend. Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are urgently needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020, to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curves. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level. RESULTS: A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 µg/mL with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer &#8805;2.0 µg/mL, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 µg/mL on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization. Patients with D-dimer levels &#8805;2.0 µg/mL had a higher incidence of mortality when comparing with those who with D-dimer levels <2.0 µg/mL (12/67 vs 1/267, P < .001; hazard ratio, 51.5; 95% confidence interval, 12.9-206.7). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0 µg/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.

374187,"Vaccinating the UK: how the covid vaccine was approved, and other questions answered",2020,"There are as yet no licensed therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that the monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, and report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilizing CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis confirms that incubation of spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope could be useful therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody that blocks receptor attachment.","Huo, Jiandong; Zhao, Yuguang; Ren, Jingshan; Zhou, Daming; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Ginn, Helen M; Carrique, Loic; Malinauskas, Tomas; Ruza, Reinis R; Shah, Pranav N M; Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Coombes, Naomi; Bewley, Kevin R; Tree, Julia A; Radecke, Julika; Paterson, Neil G; Supasa, Piyasa; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Screaton, Gavin R; Carroll, Miles; Townsend, Alain; Fry, Elizabeth E; Owens, Raymond J; Stuart, David I",Cell host microbe,,93

375386,From sharecropping to equal shares: transforming the sharing economy in northeastern Brazil,2020,"The global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused worrying concern amongst the public and health authorities. The first and foremost problem that many countries face during the outbreak is a shortage of medical resources. In order to investigate the impact of a shortage of hospital beds on the COVID-19 outbreak, we formulated a piecewise smooth model for describing the limitation of hospital beds. We parameterized the model while using data on the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths in Wuhan city from 10 January to 12 April 2020. The results showed that, even with strong prevention and control measures in Wuhan, slowing down the supply rate, reducing the maximum capacity, and delaying the supply time of hospital beds all aggravated the outbreak severity by magnifying the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, lengthening the end time of the pandemic, enlarging the value of the effective reproduction number during the outbreak, and postponing the time when the threshold value was reduced to 1. Our results demonstrated that establishment of the Huoshenshan, Leishenshan, and Fangcang shelter hospitals avoided 22,786 people from being infected and saved 6524 lives. Furthermore, the intervention of supplying hospital beds avoided infections in 362,360 people and saved the lives of 274,591 persons. This confirmed that the quick establishment of the Huoshenshan, Leishenshan Hospitals, and Fangcang shelter hospitals, and the designation of other hospitals for COVID-19 patients played important roles in containing the outbreak in Wuhan.","Zhou, Weike; Wang, Aili; Wang, Xia; Cheke, Robert A; Xiao, Yanni; Tang, Sanyi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93

375642,Photoactive Antiviral Face Mask with Self-Sterilization and Reusability,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special education schools for children in most areas of China were closed between the end of January and the beginning of June in 2020. The sudden interruption in schooling and the pandemic itself caused parents to be anxious and even to panic. Mobile-based parenting skills education has been demonstrated to be an effective method for improving the psychological well-being of mothers with children with autism. However, whether it can improve the psychological states of mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is a subject that should be urgently investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training on anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and hope in mothers with children with autism, as well as the feasibility of the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental trial. A total of 125 mothers with preschool children with autism were recruited in January 2020. The participants were assigned to the control group (n=60), in which they received routine care, or the intervention group (n=65), in which they received the 12-week WeChat-based parenting training plus routine care, according to their preferences. Anxiety, depression, parenting stress, hope, satisfaction, and adherence to the intervention were measured at three timepoints: baseline (T0), postintervention (T1), and a 20-week follow-up (T2). RESULTS: In total, 109 mothers completed the T1 assessment and 104 mothers completed the T2 assessment. The results of the linear mixed model analysis showed statistically significant group × time interaction effects for the intervention on anxiety (F=14.219, P<.001), depression (F=26.563, P<.001), parenting stress (F=68.572, P<.001), and hope (F=197.608, P<.001). Of all mothers in the intervention group, 90.4% (48.8/54) reported that they were extremely satisfied with the WeChat-based parenting training. In total, 40.0% (26/65) logged their progress in home training each week and 61.5% (40/65) logged their progress more than 80% of the time for all 20 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The WeChat-based parenting training is acceptable and appears to be an effective approach for reducing anxiety, depression, and parenting stress, as well as increasing hope in mothers with children with autism during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies with rigorous designs and longer follow-up periods are needed to further detect the effectiveness of the WeChat-based parenting training.

A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.","Violi, Francesco; Pastori, Daniele; Cangemi, Roberto; Pignatelli, Pasquale; Loffredo, Lorenzo",Thromb Haemost,,93

Aim: To determine association of the demographic data of COVID-19 patients with clinical profile and disease outcomes. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional single-center study considered adults patients of both the gender from March to June 2020 with an estimated sample size of 2000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Necessary demographic and clinical data were collected and selected subjects were followed-up until discharge or death. Subjects were classified as those who survived (1839 patients) and succumbed (138 patients) to death. T-Test was used for comparing continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical data between the groups. Results: The study included 1977 patients with a male-To-female ratio of 1:0.62. Fever, dyspnea and cough were noted as the major symptoms prevalent among patients who succumbed to death when compared to those who survived (p-value &lt;0.001). Statistically significant variables noted between the groups were age (survived mean age-42.74±15.15 years vs mean age 59.12±12.95 in those who succumbed to death, p-value &lt;0.001), age groups (p-value &lt;0.001), gender (p-value 0.042), haemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Count (TLC), neutrophil, lymphocytes, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, all the comorbidity variables and the asymptomatic status. Variables identified as significant predictors of disease outcomes were Haemoglobin (Hb), TLC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, NLR, LDH and ferritin (p-value &lt;0.001). Most of the subjects belonging to the mortality group required oxygen and other Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facilities when compared to the survival group (p-value &lt;0.001). The mean days of viral clearance noted in COVID subjects was around 8.98±3.54 days. Conclusion: Hb, TLC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, NLR, LDH and ferritin are noted as significant predictors of COVID-19 outcome. Biochemical monitoring of COVID-19 patients helps in identifying critically ill patients early and can reduce mortality and improve the recovery.","Krishnegwda, R.; Rajanna, A.

To compare the experience of psychiatric trainees in Ireland of online Balint Groups (BG) in contrast to face to face groups.2. To assess the general attitudes of trainees to BG using the Psychological Medical Inventory (PMI) (Ireton and Sherman, 1988) scale.MethodAn online survey comprising two sections: 1. A questionnaire exploring participants experience, effectiveness and obstacles to attending the two formats of BG with a free text box response. 2. General attitude of trainees towards BG using PMI scale.An online cross-sectional survey using Survey Monkey. An invitation to participate in the survey was emailed to all trainees by the College of Psychiatrists in Ireland. All data were anonymised, and all data processing was conducted in line with GDPR. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Microsoft Excel. Thematic analysis was applied to the free-text box responses.Result16.49% (64/388) responded to the survey. Responses were uniform across all stages of training. 97% of respondents attended BG;72% attended both formats, 25% attended only face-to-face and 3% online only. 65% of respondents preferred face to face compared to 18% online, whilst 11% stated no preference.On thematic analysis, trainees asserted a preference for face-to-face, describing better group cohesion, feeling safer to share, increased ease of interpreting non-verbal communication, and that conversation was more fluid. They described greater ease of engagement with the group/facilitator and preferred direct social interaction with peers.Conversely, most trainees acknowledged that online groups were convenient to attend, less time consuming & mitigated COVID risk associated with face-to-face meetings. Common themes against the use of online groups were: less psychotherapeutic in nature, technical issues, silences, unable to see participants faces and as though speaking “into the void”.Regarding trainees' attitudes to attending BG, most of the trainees found BG had been beneficial in developing more interest and confidence in dealing with the psychological aspects of patient care. Trainees agreed that skills improved in developing an excellent doctor-patient relationship, recognising patients under stress/ in distress, systemically obtaining psychological information and making treatment decisions based upon psychological needs and psychotherapeutic engagement. They agreed that they could better understand the influence of doctors' emotions on the doctor-patient relationship.ConclusionThis survey showed that most trainees find BG beneficial in developing better doctor-patient relationships, preferring face-to-face rather than online BG. However, they found online more convenient. A blended learning approach could provide trainees with the benefits of both formats of BG.","Jain, Sudha Adams Emma Lee Alyson",BJPsych Open,,93

The healthcare employees taking part in the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. The aim of the study is to determine the levels of the anxiety, depression, and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. As the data collection tool, an e-survey was used. In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used. In the second section of the survey, the problems experienced by the healthcare employees during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the socio-demographic features of the employees were investigated. 2076 healthcare employees participated in the study. The results showed that the major cause of the anxiety or stress among healthcare employees comes from the fear to contaminate the COVID-19 virus to their families (86.9%). It was observed that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of female employees are higher than that of male employees (p < 0.003). The highest depression, anxiety and stress levels of healthcare employees come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (p < 0.001). Health managers and policymakers need to make a move immediately to find solutions for the physical and psychological needs of the health employees. On the other hand, in order to minimize the risk, preparation of the work power plans beforehand and inclusion of obligatory referral chain into health services can be suggested.","Tengilimoglu, Dilaver; Zekioglu, Aysu; Tosun, Nurperihan; Isik, Oguz; Tengilimoglu, Onur",Leg Med (Tokyo),,93

382112,"Diversity, abundance, and life histories of littoral chydorids (Cladocera: Chydoridae) in a subarctic European lake",2020,"The data for the Ebola outbreak that occurred in 2014-2016 in three countries of West Africa are analysed within a common framework. The analysis is made using the results of an agent based Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model on a Euclidean network, where nodes at a distance $l$ are connected with probability $P(l) \propto l^{-\delta }$, $\delta$ determining the range of the interaction, in addition to nearest neighbors. The cumulative (total) density of infected population here has the form $R(t) = \frac{a\exp(t/T)}{1+c\exp(t/T)}$, where the parameters depend on $\delta$ and the infection probability $q$. This form is seen to fit well with the data. Using the best fitting parameters, the time at which the peak is reached is estimated and is shown to be consistent with the data. We also show that in the Euclidean model, one can choose $\delta$ and $q$ values which reproduce the data for the three countries qualitatively. These choices are correlated with population density, control schemes and other factors. Comparing the real data and the results from the model one can also estimate the size of the actual population susceptible to the disease. Rescaling the real data a reasonably good quantitative agreement with the simulation results is obtained.","Khaleque, Abdul; Sen, Parongama",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08655v2.pdf,93

383223,Un printemps passé avec l'enseignement à distance,2020,"Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are functional protein microdomains that typically mediate interactions between a short linear region in one protein and a globular domain in another. Surface Plasmon Resonance assays have been performed to determine the binding affinity between PDZ domain of wild type human PALS1 protein and tetradecapeptides representing the SLiMs sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins (E-SLiMs). SARS-CoV-2 E-SLiM binds to the human target protein with a higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV-1, showing a difference significantly greater than previously reported using the F318W mutant of PALS1 protein and shorter target peptides. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have provided clear evidence of the structural determinants driving this binding process. Specifically, the Arginine 69 residue in the SARS-CoV-2 E-SLiM is the key residue able to both enhance the specific polar interaction with negatively charged pockets of the PALS1 PDZ domain and reduce significantly the mobility of the viral peptide. These experimental and computational data are reinforced by the comparison of the interaction between the PALS1 PDZ domain with the natural ligand CRB1, as well as the corresponding E-SLiMs of other coronavirus members such as MERS and OCF43. Our results provide a model at the molecular level of the strategies used to mimic the endogenous SLiM peptide in the binding of the tight junctions of the host cell, explaining one of the possible reasons of the severity of the infection and pulmonary inflammation by SARS-CoV-2.","Lo Cascio, Ettore; Toto, Angelo; Babini, Gabriele; De Maio, Flavio; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Mordente, Alvaro; Della Longa, Stefano; Arcovito, Alessandro",,,93

The impact on the UK water sector extends beyond engineering and treatment processes, with social, economic and environmental consequences. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with executives from ten UK water companies to investigate the organisational response to the pandemic, and how their response impacted operational delivery. The Safe changes to operational practices;and industry collaboration, were mapped onto the framework and a ripple effect map developed. Lessons learnt highlight: a failure to adequately prepare for the scale of the threat;the success of sector level collaboration;and a need to embrace new ways of working.","Lawson, Elizabeth Bunney Sarah Cotterill Sarah Farmani Raziyeh Melville-Shreeve Peter Butler David",Water and Environment Journal,,93
384255,Covid 19-new lockdown updates,2021,"Background: Biobankers have been unexpectedly involved in the pandemic of COVID-19 since early 2020. Although specific guidance was not available, the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) Best Practices and the ISO 20387 document have been utilized to deal with the pandemic disaster. The ISO experts and best practice experts in ISBER teamed up to share the available information and learn the experiences of biobanks concerning COVID-19 through organizing webinars, surveys, and town hall meetings. Four ISBER regional ambassadors (RAs) from the Indo-Pacific Rim (IPR) region were also actively involved at one of the town hall meetings. These RAs, who are from Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan, and the Director-at-Large of the region, have summarized their experiences in this article. Materials and Methods: The ISBER Standards Committee COVID-19 Task Force has kindly provided the survey results. The extracted glossary from the results was categorized into 10 factors: (1) crisis management; (2) sample-related issues; (3) logistics-related issues; (4) equipment-related issues; (5) ethical, legal, and social implication-related issues; (6) operation-related issues; (7) personnel-related issues; (8) management-related issues; (9) infection-related issues; and (10) research-related issues. Each IPR RA has provided a case considering these 10 factors. Results and Discussion: Two key points have emerged from the scenarios, which are as follows: (1) impacts of the biobanks in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are similar to those in high-income countries (HICs) and (2) tolerance of the biobanks in LMICs is not so robust as those in HICs. Furthermore, communication strategies with internal and external stakeholders are critical for a biobank to manage this crisis. This article summarizes the impacts, indicates the opportunities that COVID-19 has brought to the biobank community, and highlights the usefulness of the network beyond biobank services. Lastly, the biobanks need to turn the challenges into opportunities to overcome the crisis.","Yadav, Birendra Kumar; Ng, Wayne; Fachiroh, Jajah; Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki; Furuta, Koh",Biopreserv Biobank,,93

Yeast come with various advantages, but in the context of coronavirus research and the system outlined here, they are simple and easy to work with and can be used at biosafety level 2. The system involves inducible expression of individual viral proteins and identification of detrimental phenotypes in the yeast. Yeast knockout and overexpression libraries can then be used for genome-wide screening of host proteins that provide a suppressor phenotype. From the yeast hits, a narrowed list of candidate genes can be produced to investigate for roles in viral replication. Since the system only requires expression of viral proteins, it can be used for any current or emerging virus, regardless of biocontainment requirements and ability to culture the virus.

384513,Less is More: Intelligent Intensive Care for SARS-CoV-2 Based on the Imaging Data,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected radiology practices in many ways. The aim of this survey was to estimate declines in imaging volumes and financial impact across different practice settings during April 2020. METHODS: The survey, comprising 48 questions, was conducted among members of the ACR and the Radiology Business Management Association during May 2020. Survey questions focused on practice demographics, volumes, financials, personnel and staff adjustments, and anticipation of recovery. RESULTS: During April 2020, nearly all radiology practices reported substantial (56.4%-63.7%) declines in imaging volumes, with outpatient imaging volumes most severely affected. Mean gross charges declined by 50.1% to 54.8% and collections declined by 46.4% to 53.9%. Percentage reductions did not correlate with practice size. The majority of respondents believed that volumes would recover but not entirely (62%-88%) and anticipated a short-term recovery, with a surge likely in the short term due to postponement of elective imaging (52%-64%). About 16% of respondents reported that radiologists in their practices tested positive for COVID-19. More than half (52.3%) reported that availability of personal protective equipment had become an issue or was inadequate. A majority (62.3%) reported that their practices had existing remote reading or teleradiology capabilities in place before the pandemic, and 22.3% developed such capabilities in response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Radiology practices across different settings experienced substantial declines in imaging volumes and collections during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. Most are actively engaged in both short- and long-term operational adjustments.","Malhotra, Ajay; Wu, Xiao; Fleishon, Howard B; Duszak, Richard; Silva, Ezequiel; McGinty, Geraldine B; Bender, Claire; Williams, Beth; Pashley, Neale; Stengel, Casey J B; Naidich, Jason J; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,,93
384534,Teaching Like Gumby,2021,"Background: an increase in the time from the symptoms onset to first medical contact and to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) has been observed in countries with high-incidence of COVID-19 cases. We aimed to verify if there was any change in the patient delay and in the EMS response times up to the pPCI for STEMI patients in Swiss Ticino Canton. Methods: We assessed STEMI management including time from symptoms onset to EMS call, time of EMS response, time to pPCI in Swiss Canton Ticino. Data were retrieved from the Acute-Coronary-Syndrome-Ticino-Registry. We considered the patients included in the registry from March to May 2020 (pandemic period) and then from June to August 2020 (post-pandemic period) in whom a pPCI was performed. We compared these patients to those undergoing a pPCI in the same months in the year 2016-2019. Results: During the pandemic period, the time from symptoms onset to pPCI significantly increased compared to non-pandemic periods. This was due to a significant prolongation of the time from symptoms onset to EMS call, that nearly tripled. In contrast, after the pandemic period, there was a significantly shorter time from symptom onset to EMS call compared to non-pandemic years, whereas all other times remained unchanged. Conclusion: Patients delay the call to EMS despite symptoms of myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic also in a region with a relatively low incidence of COVID-19.","Baldi, Enrico; Auricchio, Angelo; Cresta, Ruggero; Vanetta, Chiara; Anselmi, Luciano; Pedrazzini, Giovanni; Benvenuti, Claudio",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,,93

Prompt diagnosis is the key to mitigate this situation. As several diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are already available and still others are under development, mandating a comprehensive review of the efficacy of existing tools and evaluate the potential of others. AREAS COVERED: Currently explored platforms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and surveillance centered on qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR, microarray, LAMP, lateral flow immunoassays, proteomics-based approaches, and radiological scans are overviewed and summarized in this review along with their advantages and downsides. A narrative literature review was carried out by accessing the freely available online databases to encapsulate the developments in medical diagnostics. EXPERT OPINION: An ideal detection method should be sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, and should allow early diagnosis of the infection as near as possible to the point of care that could alter the current situation for the better. Medical diagnostics is a highly dynamic field as no diagnostic method available for SARS-CoV-2 detection offers a perfect solution and requires more attention and continuous R&D to challenge the present-day pandemic situation.","Sharma, Bhawna; Shahanshah, Mohd FardeenHusain; Gupta, Sanjay; Gupta, Vandana",Expert rev. mol. diagn,,93

384918,Audiology in the Time of the Coronavirus,2020,"The highly transmissible novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over 8.8 million people globally and has upended the delivery of health care in the United States, creating unprecedented challenges to providing care to patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The initial surge of patients with COVID-19 that have flooded hospitals has put a strain on physical space, workforce, and supplies. In addition, social distancing and the risk of COVID-19 transmission has created significant barriers for thoracic surgeons to diagnose and treat patients. Many hospitals across the country have temporarily suspended elective operations to preserve hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Currently, the pandemic has greatly disrupted the current standard of resection after adequate staging with imaging and/or surgical staging for early stage NSCLC well beyond the initial acute phase; therefore, a new paradigm for effective management will need to be devised until the COVID-19 pandemic is eradicated with systematic vaccination and herd immunity. Thoracic surgeons will need to recalibrate their approach to ensure that patients receive timely and effective treatment for early stage NSCLC. The management of early stage NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic should be balanced with available hospital resources, risk of progression of disease, risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patient and surgeon, and the availability of alternative therapies. This article will address the current challenges with treating early stage NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a clinical framework for providing effective surgical therapy while mitigating the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to patients and surgeons.","Merritt, Robert E; Kneuertz, Peter J",,,93

We reviewed the current evidence on post-COVID syndrome, focusing on its clinical manifestations and addressing the challenges for its management in primary healthcare. The incidence of post-COVID syndrome is estimated at 10-35%, while for hospitalized patients it may reach 85%. Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in 17.5-72% of post-COVID cases, followed by residual dyspnea with an incidence ranging from 10-40%. Mental problems, chest pain, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may affect up to 26%, 22% and 11% of patients, respectively. More than one third of patients with post-COVID syndrome have pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension and diabetes mellitus being the most common. Beyond the prolonged duration of symptoms, the scarce published data indicate that most patients with post-COVID syndrome have a good prognosis with no further complications or fatal outcomes reported. Given the clinical spectrum of patients with post-COVID syndrome, most of them will be managed by primary healthcare professionals, in conjunction with pre-existing or new co-morbidities, which, in turn, may increase the burden of COVID-19 on primary healthcare. In conclusion approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 may have symptoms persisting beyond three weeks, fulfilling the criteria of post-COVID syndrome.

386255,Notes from the Editors,2021,"AIMS: The purpose of our study was to determine which groups of orthopaedic providers favour virtual care, and analyze overall orthopaedic provider perceptions of virtual care. We hypothesize that providers with less clinical experience will favour virtual care, and that orthopaedic providers overall will show increased preference for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased preference during non-pandemic circumstances. METHODS: An orthopaedic research consortium at an academic medical system developed a survey examining provider perspectives regarding orthopaedic virtual care. Survey items were scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 = ""strongly disagree"", 5 = ""strongly agree"") and compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Providers with less experience were more likely to recommend virtual care for follow-up visits (3.61 on the Likert scale (SD 0.95) vs 2.90 (SD 1.23);p = 0.006) and feel that virtual care was essential to patient wellbeing (3.98 (SD 0.95) vs 3.00 (SD 1.16);p &lt; 0.001) during the pandemic. Less experienced providers also viewed virtual visits as providing a similar level of care as in-person visits (2.41 (SD 1.02) vs 1.76 (SD 0.87);p = 0.006) and more time-efficient than in-person visits (3.07 (SD 1.19) vs 2.34 (SD 1.14);p = 0.012) in non-pandemic circumstances. During the pandemic, most providers viewed virtual care as effective in providing essential care (83.6%, n = 51) and wanted to schedule patients for virtual care follow-up (82.2%, n = 50);only 10.9% (n = 8) of providers preferred virtual visits in non-pandemic circumstances. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic providers with less clinical experience seem to favourably view virtual care both during the pandemic and under non-pandemic circumstances. Providers in general appear to view virtual care positively during the pandemic but are less accommodating towards it in non-pandemic circumstances.

386643,Channels' Confirmation and Predictions' Confirmation: From the Medical Test to the Raven Paradox,2020,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been showing patterns of extensive rise in prevalence in the contemporary era, affecting the quality of life of millions of people and leading the causes of death worldwide. It has been a provocative challenge for modern medicine to diagnose CVD in its crib, owing to its etiological factors being attributed to a large array of systemic diseases, as well as its non-binary hideous nature that gradually leads to functional disability. Novel echocardiography techniques have enabled the cardiac ultrasound to provide a comprehensive analysis of the heart in an objective, feasible, time- and cost-effective manner. Speckle tracking echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, and 3D echocardiography have shown the highest potential for widespread use. The uses of novel modalities have been elaborately demonstrated in this study as a proof of concept that echocardiography has a place in routine general practice with supportive evidence being as recent as its role in the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Despite such evidence, many uses remain off-label and unexploited in practice. Generalization of echocardiography at the point of care can become a much-needed turning point in the clinical approach to case management. To actualize such aspirations, we recommend further prospective and interventional studies to examine the effect of implementing advanced techniques at the point of care on the decision-making process and evaluate their effectiveness in prevention of cardiovascular morbidities and mortalities.","Iskander, John; Kelada, Peter; Rashad, Lara; Massoud, Doaa; Afdal, Peter; Abdelmassih, Antoine Fakhry",Curr Probl Cardiol,,93

The authors analyzed changes in clinical drug testing patterns and results at a national clinical laboratory, comparing data obtained before and during the pandemic. Testing for prescription and illicit drugs declined rapidly during the pandemic, with weekly test volumes falling by approximately 70% from the baseline period to the trough (the week beginning March 29) before rising in subsequent weeks. Among individuals tested, positivity increased by 35% for non-prescribed fentanyl and 44% for heroin during the pandemic. Positivity for non-prescribed fentanyl increased significantly among patients positive for other drugs: by 89% for specimens positive for amphetamines; 48% for benzodiazepines; 34% for cocaine; and 39% for opiates (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). These findings suggest significant increases in dangerous drug combinations. Positivity for non-prescribed use of many other drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. Models adjusting for potential confounding variables, including medication-assisted treatment and treatment at a substance use disorder facility indicated that the risk for non-prescribed fentanyl positivity rose by more than 50% during the pandemic. In summary, these findings demonstrate decreased drug testing overall, with increased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations. The convergence of the drug abuse epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased need for health care and public health resources dedicated to supporting vulnerable patients and addressing the underlying causes of these disturbing trends.","Niles, Justin K; Gudin, Jeffrey; Radcliff, Jeff; Kaufman, Harvey W",Popul. health manag.

387165,Stochasticity of infectious outbreaks and consequences for optimal interventions,2021-08-02,"In the current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses during the upcoming fall and winter seasons may present an unprecedented burden of respiratory disease in the population. Important respiratory viruses that will need to be closely monitored during this time include SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. The epidemiology of these viruses is very similar in terms of susceptible populations, mode of transmission, and the clinical syndromes, thus the etiological agent will be difficult to differentiate without target specific assays. The availability of a sensitive and specific multiplex assay that can simultaneously detect all these targets will be valuable. Here we report the validation of a real-time reverse transciptase-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. This multiplex assay is comparable to its singleplex counterparts with a limit-of-detection being less than 5 copies/reaction, 100 % specificity, over seven logs of dynamic range, less than 1 % coefficientof variation showing high precision, and equivalent accuracy using patient samples. It also offers the added benefits of savings in reagents and technologist time while improving testing efficiency and turn-around-times in order to respond effectively to the ongoing pandemic.","Pabbaraju, Kanti; Wong, Anita A; Ma, Raymond; Zelyas, Nathan; Tipples, Graham A",J Virol Methods,,93

With much focus on secondary and acute care at this time, there has been less communication and understanding about the impact on primary care. This discussion paper is based on the experience of one of the authors working as a general practitioner/family doctor during the pandemic and rapid changes are described during this time (April 2020). Two important themes emerged from this experience focusing on the importance of supporting one another and new roles and ways of working. It can be argued that the challenges presented by COVID-19 have expedited positive and potentially sustainable change in UK primary care that has been needed for some time. The authors discuss the implications for future working and make a series of recommendations for primary care relating to the importance of supporting the workforce, remote consultations and communication, regular team meetings, and development of integrated care. It is suggested that many of the challenges highlighted can be addressed by placing a greater emphasis on the use of interprofessional education (IPE) to underpin and support effective collaborative working.","Gray, Richard; Sanders, Chris",J Interprof Care,,93
390211,Metagenomics: preventing future pandemics,2021,"Widespread high-throughput testing for identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by reverse transcriptase PCR has been a foundation in the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Quality assurance metrics for these reverse transcriptase PCR tests are still evolving as testing becomes widely implemented. As testing increases, it is important to understand performance characteristics and the errors associated with these tests. Herein, we investigate a high-throughput, laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR assay to determine whether modeling can generate quality control metrics that identify false-positive (FP) results due to contamination. This study reviewed repeated clinical samples focusing on positive samples that test negative on re-extraction and PCR, likely representing false positives. To identify and predict false-positive samples, we constructed machine learning derived models based on the extraction method used. These models identified variables associated with false-positive results across all methods, with sensitivities for predicting FP results ranging between 67% and 100%. Application of the models to all results predicted a total FP rate of 0.08% across all samples, or 2.3% of positive results, similar to reports for other reverse transcriptase PCR tests for RNA viruses. These models can predict quality control parameters, enabling laboratories to generate decision trees that reduce interpretation errors, allow for automated reflex testing of samples with a high FP probability, improve workflow efficiency, and increase diagnostic accuracy for patient care.","Martinez, Ryan J; Pankratz, Nathan; Schomaker, Matthew; Daniel, Jerry; Beckman, Kenneth; Karger, Amy B; Thyagarajan, Bharat; Ferreri, Patricia; Yohe, Sophia L; Nelson, Andrew C",J. mol. diagn,,93

392113,"Preparing for Future Pandemics with a Reserve of Inventory, Capacity, and Capability (preprint)",2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel (IKs ), composed of pore-forming KCNQ1 &#945;-subunits and ancillary KCNE1 ß-subunits, regulates ventricular repolarization in human heart. Propofol at clinically used concentrations modestly inhibits the intact (wild-type) IKs channels and is therefore unlikely to appreciably prolong QT interval in electrocardiogram during anesthesia. However, little information is available concerning the inhibitory effect of propofol on IKs channel associated with its gene variants implicated in QT prolongation. The KCNE1 single nucleotide polymorphism leading to D85N is associated with drug-induced QT prolongation and therefore regarded as a clinically important genetic variant. This study examined whether KCNE1-D85N affects the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Whole-cell patch-clamp and immunostaining experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and/or mouse cardiomyocyte-derived HL-1 cells, transfected with wild-type KCNQ1, wild-type or variant KCNE1 cDNAs. KEY RESULTS: Propofol inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N current more potently than KCNQ1/KCNE1 current in HEK293 cells and HL-1 cells. Immunostaining experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that pretreatment with propofol (10 µM) did not appreciably affect cell membrane expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 proteins in KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N channels. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The KCNE1 polymorphism D85N significantly elevates the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. This study detects a functionally important role of KCNE1-D85N polymorphism in conferring genetic susceptibility to propofol-induced QT prolongation and further suggests the possibility that the inhibitory action of anesthetics on ionic currents becomes exaggerated in patients carrying variants in genes encoding ion channels.","Kojima, Akiko; Mi, Xinya; Fukushima, Yutaka; Ding, Wei-Guang; Omatsu-Kanbe, Mariko; Matsuura, Hiroshi",Br. j. pharmacol,,93
392304,Spatial-Spectral Evidence of Glare Influence on Hyperspectral Acquisitions,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Among patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), coronary artery disease (CAD) has been identified as a high-risk condition. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes and mortality among patients with COVID-19 according to CAD status. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Cremona Hospital (Lombardy region, Italy) between February and March 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. CAD was defined as a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CAD that was being medically treated. RESULTS: Of 1252 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 124 (9.9%) had concomitant CAD. Patients with CAD were older and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities compared with those without CAD. Although patients with CAD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality than patients without CAD (HR 3.01, 95% CI 2.27 to 3.99), this difference was no longer significant in the adjusted model (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63). Results were consistent among patients with prior MI (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.41), prior PCI (aHR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.62), prior CABG (aHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.82), or CAD medically treated (aHR 0.84, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.44). Multivariable analysis showed that age (aHR per 5 year increase 1.62, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.72) and female sex (aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82) were the only two independent correlates of mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 and CAD have an exceedingly higher risk of mortality, which is mainly attributable to the burden of comorbidities rather than to a direct effect of CAD per se.","Loffi, Marco; Piccolo, Raffaele; Regazzoni, Valentina; Di Tano, Giuseppe; Moschini, Luigi; Robba, Debora; Quinzani, Filippo; Esposito, Giovanni; Franzone, Anna; Danzi, Gian Battista",,,93

We propose a two-stage approach for learning and inferring the preferences of human operators based on the sequence of sub-tasks and actions. We conduct an IKEA assembly study and demonstrate how our approach is able to learn the dominant preferences in a complex task. We show that our approach improves the prediction of human actions through cross-validation. Lastly, we show that our two-stage approach improves the efficiency of task execution in an online experiment, and demonstrate its applicability in a real-world robot-assisted IKEA assembly.","Nemlekar, Heramb; Modi, Jignesh; Gupta, Satyandra K.; Nikolaidis, Stefanos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14994v1.pdf,93

Mental illnesses and physical inactivity are prevalent among U.S. college students. This study examined whether there was a change in minutes of PA and depression scores after a stay-at-home order and examined predictors of these changes. An online survey was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students attending a large, diverse university via an electronic newsletter. The survey requested information about demographic and academic data, cardiorespiratory fitness, and depression symptoms. Paired t-tests and logistic regression were employed. Our sample (n = 194) was predominantly female (73%), young (mean age of 25), not a sexual minority (82%), and had a mean 3.4 GPA. Students reported worse depression scores (p < 0.01) and fewer minutes of PA (p = 0.01) after the stay-at-home order. There was a small but significant (p = 0.04) correlation between changes in total minutes of PA and depression scores. Senior (p = 0.05) and Hispanic (p = 0.03) students were less likely to report worsening depression scores than freshmen and white students, respectively. Asian students were significantly more likely than white students to report decreased PA. This study suggests that COVID-19 and its consequences may be contributing to reduced PA and greater depression symptoms in college students and that sub-groups have been affected differently. Targeted interventions to promote PA and support mental health may bolster the ability for resilience of college students.","Coughenour, Courtney; Gakh, Maxim; Pharr, Jennifer R; Bungum, Timothy; Jalene, Sharon",J. community health,,93

396681,Turkey's Military and Defense Policies,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the duration of SARS-CoV-2 remained in the environment of quarantine hotels. METHODS: 39 Patients by RT-PCR were included. We collected the clinical features, laboratory test results, smear sample information, and quarantine room information. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were launched. We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination. RESULT: Among 39 COVID-19 cases, 10 were asymptomatic and 37 were imported from aboard. 271 swab samples of environmental surfaces related to observational patients were collected. 18 swab samples from 7 patients were positive. The highest contaminated rate occurred in Cup (100%), followed by hand sink (12.82%) and toilet seat and flush (7.89%), telephone (5.56%), bedside table (5.56%), floor drain (5.41%), etc. It showed environmental surface contamination was associated with the clinical cyclical threshold values of patients (P = 0.01) and the sampling interval time after the cases left the room(P = 0.03). Duration of contamination on environmental surfaces was associated with the wet status of sampling site (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that environmental contamination might be attributed to the viral load of patients' respiratory tract and the sampling interval time after the cases left the room. Moist surfaces are prone to remain SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. Our study highlighted the importance of strict strategy to chemical disinfection in the quarantine rooms.","Liu, Jie; Liu, Jingwen; He, Zheng; Yang, Zhicong; Yuan, Jun; Wu, Haoying; Zhu, Pingting; Fu, Xuesong; Lin, Yunwan; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Zhengyang; He, Shiyu; Ma, Xiaowei",Int. j. infect. dis,,93

There is a dearth of empirical evidence about the effect of policies regulating access to care for such groups. This study aims to document the impact of an equity-based strategy to facilitate access to COVID-19 testing during the initial phase of the pandemic. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study included all outpatients presenting at the Geneva University Hospital for COVID-19 testing in March and April 2020. We compared the testing program uptake, and the proportions of positive tests and of complicated clinical course between undocumented migrants and homeless persons and the general population. Results Underserved patients represented 215 (6.5%) of the 3299 participants. There was no significant difference in the time-lag between the first COVID-19 evocative symptoms and the testing, the number of symptoms at presentation, and the participation to the program during its first month of implementation. The proportion of positive tests was significantly higher (32.1% vs. 23.6%, p=0.005) among undeserved while the proportion of complicated clinical course was comparable. Conclusions Equity-based policies can mitigate disparities in access to care during the pandemic and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community by early detection of infective cases. The high proportion of positive test in underserved patients highlight the need to include such groups into future COVID-19 immunization program. More globally, this study highlights the opportunity to reinforce healthcare systems to adapt to new threats and to contribute to a better protection of the whole of society.","Baggio, Stephanie Jacquerioz Frederique Salamun Julien Spechbach Hervé Jackson Yves",Journal of Migration and Health,,93

398312,Used disposable face masks are significant sources of microplastics to environment,2021,"Edible bird's nest (BN) is a Chinese traditional medicine with innumerable health benefits, including anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. A small number of studies have reported the anti-viral effects of EBN against influenza infections using in vitro and in vivo models, highlighting the importance of sialic acid and thymol derivatives in their therapeutic effects. At present, studies have reported that EBN suppresses the replicated virus from exiting the host cells, reduces the viral replication, endosomal trafficking of the virus, intracellular viral autophagy process, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reorient the actin cytoskeleton of the infected cells, and increase the lysosomal degradation of viral materials. In other models of disease, EBN attenuates oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptosis, enhances proliferation and activation of B-cells and their antibody secretion. Given the sum of its therapeutic actions, EBN appears to be a candidate that is worth further exploring for its protective effects against diseases transmitted through air droplets. At present, anti-viral drugs are employed as the first-line defense against respiratory viral infections, unless vaccines are available for the specific pathogens. In patients with severe symptoms due to exacerbated cytokine secretion, anti-inflammatory agents are applied. Treatment efficacy varies across the patients, and in times of a pandemic like COVID-19, many of the drugs are still at the experimental stage. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects of EBN, chemical constituents from various EBN preparation techniques, and drugs currently used to treat influenza and novel coronavirus infections. We also aim to review the pathogenesis of influenza A and coronavirus, and the potential of EBN in their clinical application. We also describe the current literature in human consumption of EBN, known allergenic or contaminant presence, and the focus of future direction on how these can be addressed to further improve EBN for potential clinical application.","Chua, K.

398685,"""How is this our life right now?""",2021,"This paper discusses the challenges faced by rural learners in South Africa in the context of the world pandemic commonly known as COVID-19. Rural learners face unprecedented challenges in adjusting to a new mode of life and learning, the latter being characterised by the predominant use of online, learning management systems and low-tech applications. The paper is informed by critical emancipatory research, which argues for social justice, empowerment and social inclusion of all learners in teaching and learning, with the aim of constructing better futures for all learners. To generate data, I used participatory action research. A total of 10 learners and five teachers participated via WhatsApp. The paper answers two questions: what are the learning challenges faced by rural learners in South Africa, and how can online learning be enhanced in the context of COVID-19? The findings suggest that, while the South African government is promoting online learning as the only alternative in the context of COVID-19, this mode excludes many rural learners from teaching and learning, due to a lack of resources to connect to the internet, the learning management system, and low-tech software. Based on the findings of this study, the paper argues that rural learners are critical stakeholders in education and in the fight against COVID-19, and they cannot be left behind in efforts to fight the pandemic. Values such as social justice and the rights of rural learners should not be foregone in the fight against COVID-19.","Dube, Bekithemba",Multidiscip. J. Educ. Res.,,93

401270,Empirical or Invariant Risk Minimization? A Sample Complexity Perspective,2020-10-30,"Polyhydroborate salts represent the important class of energy materials attracting significant recent attention. Some of these salts exhibit promising hydrogen storage properties and/or high ionic conductivities favorable for applications as solid electrolytes in batteries. Two basic types of thermally activated atomic jump motion are known to exist in these materials: the reorientational (rotational) motion of complex anions and the translational diffusion of cations or complex anions. The present paper reviews recent progress in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of both reorientational and diffusive jump motion in polyhydroborate salts. The emphasis is put on sodium and lithium closo-borates exhibiting high ionic conductivity and on borohydride-based systems showing extremely fast reorientational motion down to low temperatures. For these systems, we discuss the effects of order-disorder phase transitions on the parameters of reorientations and diffusive jumps, as well as the mechanism of low-temperature rotational tunneling.","Skripov, Alexander V; Soloninin, Alexei V; Babanova, Olga A; Skoryunov, Roman V",Molecules (Basel),,93

We examine downstream effects on mental health, how effects vary by race and ethnicity, and the role of existing state-level social policies in softening the pandemic's impact. METHODS: We analyze an online, multi-wave Census Bureau survey fielded to nearly a million respondents between late April and July 2020. The survey includes questions measuring psychological distress as well as indirect measures of experience with the pandemic. We combine these data with state-level measures of COVID cases, lock-down orders, unemployment filings, and safety net policy. FINDINGS: We find significant mental stress among all respondents and a sizeable gap between non-white and white respondents. Adjusting for pandemic experiences eliminates this gap. The effect of losing work due to the pandemic is slightly offset by state policies such as unemployment benefit size and Medicaid expansion. The magnitude of these offsetting effects is similar across racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The racialized impacts of the pandemic are exacerbated by inequalities in state policy exemplifying structural racism. If the least generous states matched the policies of the most generous, inequalities caused by the pandemic would be diminished.","Sances, Michael W; Campbell, Andrea Louise",J. health polit. policy law,,93

The indications for renal replacement therapy for these patients are those commonly accepted to treat AKI. We describe a continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) protocol for AKI, which aims to provide the best treatment according to the particular patient’s and medical personnels’ needs in biohazard settings with limited human and technological resources. We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction. In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors. CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources. Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.","Nalesso, Federico; Garzotto, Francesco; Cattarin, Leda; Gobbi, Laura; Qassim, Laila; Sgarabotto, Luca; Tiberio, Ivo; Calò, Lorenzo A.",J.

406787,"Risk, uncertainty, and leverage",2020,"Introduction: Mandated restrictions on outdoor physical activity (PA) during the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the lifeworld of millions of people and led to a contradictory situation. On the one hand, PA was perceived as risky behaviour, as it might facilitate transmission of the virus. On the other hand, while taking precautions, regular PA was an important tool to promote the population's health during the lockdown. Methods: This paper examines the differences in government restrictions on PA in France, Germany, and Italy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on techniques of qualitative content analysis and apply a critical theoretical framework to assess the countries' restrictions on PA. Results: Our analysis shows that the restrictions on PA varied in the three countries, in all three countries. This variance is attributed both to differences in the timing and severity of the pandemic in the countries analysed, as well as to the divergence in the relationships between the countries' sport and health systems. Conclusion: At the national level, the variance in restrictions on PA reflect the differences in the spread of the coronavirus and in the health systems' understanding of and approach to PA.

408272,Demonstration of plasma focus operation without using sliding discharge on a glass or ceramic insulator for plasma initiation,2021-04-02,"BACKGROUND: High sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hs-TnT) has been associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We aimed to determine if hs-TnT levels and their timing are independent predictors of adverse events in these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients hospitalized at our institution between 23 March 2020 and 13 April 2020 who were found to be COVID-19-positive. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables including initial and peak hs-TnT were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were completed for a primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death, intubation, need for critical care, or cardiac arrest. RESULTS: In the 276 patients analysed, initial hs-TnT above the median (&#8805;17 ng/L) was associated with increased length of stay, need for vasoactive medications, and death, along with the composite endpoint (OR 3.92, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that elevated initial hs-TnT was independently associated with the primary endpoint (OR 2.92, p = 0.01). Late-peaking hs-TnT (OR 2.19 for each additional day until peak, p < 0.001) was also independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hs-TnT identifies patients at high risk for adverse in-hospital events, and trends of hs-TnT over time, particularly during the first day, provide additional prognostic information.","Singh, Nikhil; Anchan, Rajeev K; Besser, Stephanie A; Belkin, Mark N; Cruz, Mark D; Lee, Linda; Yu, Dongbo; Mehta, Natasha; Nguyen, Ann B; Alenghat, Francis J",Biomarkers,,93

409530,Joint Fairness Model with Applications to Risk Predictions for Under-represented Populations,2021-05-10,"Some comorbidities are risk factors for severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) but it is unknown whether some increase susceptibility to Covid-19 in children. In this Mexican case-control study, contact with patients with Covid-19, or having obesity, or having diabetes, or hypertension or been immunosuppressed independently increased the risk for Covid-19 in the whole sample analysis. However, only contact history and obesity remained statistically significant in the separated analysis of girls and boys. The results suggest that obesity is not only associated with severe disease but also increases risk for Covid-19. Contrary to findings in adults, no difference between cases and controls was found for gender, presence of pneumonia or surrogates of severe disease including admission to intensive care unit, tracheal intubation or whether patient had died. This indicates that Covid-19 is less severe in children than adults. Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in obesity and Covid-19 in children.","Hernández-Garduño, Eduardo",Pediatr Obes,,93

The development of cost-effective and efficient sorbents for the establishment of sensitive analytical methods is critical for achieving trace-level detection. In this study, a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based sorbent is synthesized by a facile sonication-assisted method exfoliated by zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) in situ. The novel ZIF-67/g-C3N4 composites were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis, exhibiting good dispersity and a large surface area. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that g-C3N4 structures can be effectively exfoliated by the introduced ZIF-67 molecules. The hybrid material was successfully utilized as a dispersive solid-phase extraction sorbent, and the extraction factors were systematically optimized by response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, the synthesized sorbent exhibited desirable linear correlations (R2 > 0.99), a low detection limit (0.3-2 ng L-1), and good repeatability (relative standard deviation <15%, n = 6). The developed method was applied for the analysis of natural and spiked water samples. The study demonstrated that the ZIF-67/g-C3N4 composites are promising materials for pollutant adsorption from drinking water samples.","Xie, Hanyi; Wei, Yanze; Li, Jingkun; Wang, Shanshan; Li, Huijuan; Zhao, Yanfang; Zhao, Mei; Chen, Xiangfeng",J Chromatogr A,,93
409788,Super-correlated radiance in nonlinear photonic waveguides,2019-12-09,"Climatic resources are vitally important for tourism, driving major intra- and inter-regional travel flows for sun-sand-surf (3S) tourism around the world. The development of climate indices to measure the suitability of climate for major tourism market segments has evolved over three decades. This study provides the first application of the holiday climate index (HCI):Beach specification in the Asia-Pacific tourism region. The HCI is designed from international tourist climate preference studies and is compared with the tourism climate index (TCI), which is widely applied, but not based on tourist climate preferences. The index inter-comparison is conducted at 14 of the most popular beach resort destinations in China, which include four geographic regions of China with four different Köppen classifications. The results show key differences between the two indices in rating the climatic suitability of the selected beach destinations in China, with the TCI rating beach destinations in the north and south higher during the spring and fall seasons, which is not consistent with beach tourism visits. During the summer months, southern destinations have much higher HCI:Beach rating, reflecting the 3S tourists' desire for higher temperatures. The findings reinforce those from other tourism regions that indicate the TCI is not appropriate for assessing 3S tourism potential and that additional cross-cultural studies of tourist climate indices are needed to better inform market segment climate service development and to understand the potential impacts of future climate change.","Yu, D D; Rutty, M; Scott, D; Li, S",Int. j. biometeorol,,93

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase, and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions facilitated by international travel, leading to a pandemic. To guide effective control and interventions, primary data is required urgently, globally, including from low- and middle-income countries where documentation of cardiovascular manifestations and risk factors in people hospitalized with COVID-19 is limited. Objectives: This study aims to describe the cardiovascular manifestations and cardiovascular risk factors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We propose to conduct an observational cohort study involving 5000 patients recruited from hospitals in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Eligible adult COVID-19 patients will be recruited from the participating hospitals and followed-up until 30 days post admission. The outcomes will be reported at discharge and includes the need of ICU admission, need of ventilator, death (with cause), major adverse cardiovascular events, neurological outcomes, acute renal failure, and pulmonary outcomes. Conclusion: Given the enormous burden posed by COVID-19 and the associated severe prognostic implication of CVD involvement, this study will provide useful insights on the risk factors for severe disease, clinical presentation, and outcomes of various cardiovascular manifestations in COVID-19 patients particularly from low and middle income countries from where the data remain scant.","Sliwa, Karen; Singh, Kavita; Raspail, Lana; Ojji, Dike; Lam, Carolyn S P; Thienemann, Friedrich; Ge, Junbo; Banerjee, Amitava; Newby, L Kristin; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz P; Gidding, Samuel; Pinto, Fausto; Perel, Pablo; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj",Glob Heart,,93

The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. The best prevention for COVID-19 is avoiding exposure to the virus. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15, and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association declared at P< 0.05. RESULTS: In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI: 1.06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for the COVID-19 were factors showed significant association with the practice. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery.","Mersha, Abera; Shibiru, Shitaye; Girma, Meseret; Ayele, Gistane; Bante, Agegnehu; Kassa, Mekidim; Abebe, Sintayehu; Shewangizaw, Misgun",PLoS One,,93

414203,Analysing the Effect of Recommendation Algorithms on the Amplification of Misinformation,2021-03-26,"Introduction: In my thesis I am exploring the role ofpharmaceutical packaging design in relation to the user.This topic is becoming increasingly relevant as the numberof issued prescriptions in Slovenia is rising every year, treatment with prescription medicine is experienced by almosteveryone. Medicine packaging must therefore provide essential information effectively and efficiently.Aim: The purpose of this thesis is to improve current heterogeneous conditions by developing a standardized designsystem for all prescription drugs by taking into account users'needs at each stage of the process. The final goal is a simplerand more effective use of products for everyone involved.Methods: Research was conducted in three stages. Inthe first stage, the existing condition in packaging designwas analysed: information hierarchy/arrangement on 8 significant manufacturers' products considering 1-the typeof information and 2-different user groups. Second stageconsisted of conducting surveys with 2 focus groups representing two main user groups who use the packaging differently-medicine consumers and healthcare professionals.(1)Consumer focus group consisted of 81 participants, recruitedrandomly from various age groups (age 10 to 89). They wereasked closed-ended questions. Healthcare professionalsfocus group consisted of 5 pharmacists with extensive experience. They were asked open-ended questions. The collected data from both research stages was statistically andqualitatively analysed in order to define the main problemswith medicine packaging design and use. Identified problemswere then addressed through the design process. The thirdstage included development of a standardised design systemin accordance with information design theory and cognitivepsychology findings.(2) These helped establish the systembuilding blocks/rules: information hierarchy and organization, use of colour, shape and typography.Results: Analysis of existing conditions clearly exposedthe heterogeneity and unsuitability of the majority of medicine packaging design. These caused similar problems toboth user groups: trouble finding information (73 %), lack/redundancy of information (47 %/17 %), illegible, unreadable typography (39 %), distracting visual elements (26 %),unclear distinction between medicines (17 %). These leadto various consequences: incorrect route of administration(39 %), consuming/prescribing expired (30 %) or incorrectproduct (8 %), time loss (8 %). Each of these problems wasaddressed through establishment of new, highly precise rulesin packaging design: regulating hierarchy and typography,introducing visual categorization through symbols and illustrations (information category, pharmaceutical form, ATCgroup) and color-coding medicine strength. The rules forma standardised system which provides unity, consistency andquality regulation, improving the everyday experience ofmany people.Conclusion: The research was carried out as a part ofa BA thesis. The execution of the project would require achange in the legislation on state level. It therefore servesas a speculative proposal, aiming to raise questions that arecurrently not being addressed properly within the industry.The possibility of implementation could be recognizedthrough gradual transformation of individual rules/buildingblocks of the system into new state regulations or guidelines.Discussion with the industry and the profession has not yetbeen carried out due to the Covid-19 crisis.","Bevec, E.",International Journal of Pharmacy Practice,,93

In line with the UK Royal Colleges' advice the management of acute appendicitis (AA) changed with greater consideration for non-operative management (NOM) or open appendicectomy when operative management (OM) was sought. We describe our experience of the presentation, management and outcomes for these patients to inform care for future viral pandemics. METHODS: This retrospective, cohort study compared patients diagnosed with AA between March and July 2019 with those during the pandemic period of March to July 2020. Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographics, inflammatory markers, imaging, severity, management, histology, length of stay (LOS) and 90-day outcomes. RESULTS: There were 149 and 125 patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively. 14 patients (9.4%) had NOM in 2019 versus 31 (24.8%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). In the 2019 operative management (OM) group 125 patients (92.6%) had laparoscopic appendicectomy versus 65 (69.1%) in 2020. 59 patients (39.6%) had a CT in 2019 versus 70 (56%) in 2020. The median LOS was 4 days in 2019 and 3 days in 2020 (p = 0.03). Two patients in each year who received NOM had treatment failure (14.3% in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020). Three patients in 2019 who received OM had treatment failure (2.2%). Of 95 patients tested for COVID-19 all but one tested negative. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was no observed increase in severity of AA, patients had a shorter LOS and were more likely to have imaging. NOM proportionally increased with no observed change in outcomes.","Pringle, Heather C M; Donigiewicz, Urszula; Bennett, Melissa-Rose; Walker, Eleanor; Fowler, George E; Narang, Sunil; Ball, Susan; Bethune, Robert M",BMC Surg,,93

To date, physical distancing and good personal hygiene have been the only effective measures to limit spread. The pandemic has altered routine cancer care, including allied health and supportive care interventions. Clinicians must adapt and find ways to continue to deliver optimal patient care at this time. The prescription of exercise to people with cancer has been demonstrated to have meaningful benefits for both physical and mental health and quality of life, and may even enhance survival. Such exercise interventions provide the largest benefit to patients when delivered in a supervised, group, clinic-based setting. In the age of COVID-19, group-based exercise in communal facilities presents risks for both aerosol and surface transmission of the virus among people exercising, necessitating a pivot from the usual methods of exercise delivery to home-based exercise programs. In this article, we discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in moving to a home-based program for patients with cancer while maintaining the benefits of targeted and high-fidelity exercise medicine. We provide practical recommendations for how home-based exercise can be supported and nurtured by qualified exercise professionals who treat people living with cancer, as well as pointing to resources that are available online to assist practitioners. Despite the challenges faced during this pandemic, we believe that it is important for people to continue to benefit from exercise in a safe environment with the support of exercise specialists.","Newton, Robert U; Hart, Nicolas H; Clay, Tim",JCO Oncol Pract,,93
415055,Analytical and Cellular Automaton approach to a generalized SEIR model for infection spread in an open crowded space,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread implementation of public health measures, such as stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and masking mandates. In addition to decreasing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, these measures also impact the transmission of seasonal viral pathogens, which are common triggers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether reduced viral prevalence mediates reduction in COPD exacerbation rates is unknown. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter health care system to assess admission trends associated with community viral prevalence and with initiation of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. We applied difference-in-differences analysis to compare season-matched weekly frequency of hospital admissions for COPD prior to and after implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Community viral prevalence was estimated using regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test positivity data and correlated to COPD admissions. RESULTS: Data involving 4422 COPD admissions demonstrated a season-matched 53% decline in COPD admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which correlated to community viral burden (r = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.78) and represented a 36% greater decline over admission frequencies observed in other medical conditions less affected by respiratory viral infections (incidence rate ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.71, P < .001). The post-COVID-19 decline in COPD admissions was most pronounced in patients with fewer comorbidities and without recurrent admissions. CONCLUSION: The implementation of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased COPD admissions. These changes are plausibly explained by reduced prevalence of seasonal respiratory viruses.","So, Jennifer Y; O039,; Hara, Nathan N; Kenaa, Blaine; Williams, John G; deBorja, Christopher L; Slejko, Julia F; Zafari, Zafar; Sokolow, Michael; Zimand, Paul; Deming, Meagan; Marx, Jason; Pollak, Andrew N; Reed, Robert M",Am. j. med,,93

417413,Welcome 2021,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid adoption of virtual clinic processes and healthcare delivery. Herein, we examine the impact of virtualising genetics services at Canada's largest cancer centre. A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate relevant metrics during the 12 weeks prior to and during virtual care, including referral and clinic volumes, patient wait times and genetic testing uptake. The number of appointments and new patients seen were maintained during virtual care. Likewise, there was a significant increase in the number of patients offered testing during virtual care who did not provide a blood sample (176/180 (97.7%) vs 180/243 (74.1%); p<0.001), and a longer median time from the date of pretest genetic counselling to the date a sample was given (0 vs 11 days; p<0.001). Referral volumes significantly decreased during virtual care (35 vs 22; p<0.001), which was accompanied by a decreased median wait time for first appointment (55 days vs 30 days; p<0.001). The rapid virtualisation of cancer genetic services allowed the genetics clinic to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical volumes or access to genetic testing. There was a decrease in referral volumes and uptake of genetic testing, which may be attributable to pandemic-related clinical restrictions.","Norman, Maia Leigh; Malcolmson, Janet; Randall Armel, Susan; Gillies, Brittany; Ou, Brian; Thain, Emily; McCuaig, Jeanna Marie; Kim, Raymond H",J. medical. genet,,93

We examined the mental health impact of reduced working in a nationally representative sample of employees. METHOD: We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. RESULTS: Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37). We also found evidence of higher levels of psychological distress among those sick or self-isolating, and those with reduced working due to caring responsibilities. LIMITATIONS: While the GHQ is a widely used and validated instrument in identifying potential psychiatric disorders, it is important to note that it does not represent a clinical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal examination of employment transitions and mental ill-health related to pandemic outcomes is imperative and should help inform public health responses and ongoing government policy in supporting those adversely affected.","Ferry, Finola; Bunting, Brendan; Rosato, Michael; Curran, Emma; Leavey, Gerard",J Affect Disord,,93

420300,"""Something Is Wrong Here"": An Interview With Sarah Cox About Damming Canadian Rivers for Hydroelectricity",2020,"L'embolie pulmonaire (EP) doit être prise en charge préférentiellement en ambulatoire lorsque les conditions le permettent : score de SPESI à 0, absence de dilatation des cavités droites au scanner ou d'élévation des biomarqueurs cardiaques [1]. Nous avions fait une étude préalable en 2018, qui avait montré que 9,4 % des patients étaient hospitalisés pour une EP de manière indue. Nous avions diminué ce taux de manière significative à 1,6 % en 2019 après formation et communication d'une document d'aide à la prise en charge des EP auprès de nos collègues urgentistes. Nous souhaitions évaluer les modalités d'orientation et de prise en charge des patients traités pour une EP issus de notre service d'urgence. Nous avons étudié restrospectivement, sur la période juin 2018-juin 2020, les dossiers des patients avec prise en charge en ambulatoire par les urgentistes et vus systématiquement en consultation de thrombose par notre équipe de médecine interne entre J2 et J7. Cette consultation permettait de vérifier la bonne compréhension et la posologie du traitement, de déterminer sa durée, de programmer ou non un bilan de thrombophilie à l'arrêt du traitement ou une recherche de cancer, la programmation d'un doppler veineux des membres inférieurs si non réalisé. L'objectif de notre étude était de vérifier si l'orientation en ambulatoire était adaptée et si la prise en charge thérapeutique était conforme aux recommandations. Notre cohorte comportait 31 patients dont 19 hommes (61 %) et 12 femmes (39 %), d'âge moyen 48 ans. Les patients présentaient une EP lobaire (n = 10, 32 %), segmentaire (n = 17, 55 %), sous-segmentaire (n = 4, 13 %). L'EP était bilatérale chez 9 patients (29 %). Dans 8 cas (26 %), l'EP était spontanée, sans aucun facteur retrouvé à l'issue du bilan. Dans 23 cas (74 %), l'embolie pulmonaire était provoquée (immobilisation, voyage en avion, chirurgie, alitement, COVID). La majorité des patients était traité par AOD (96 %), dont 25 patients sous rivaroxaban (80 %) et 5 patients sous apixaban (16 %). Une patiente était traitée par HBPM puis Coumadine en post-partum. Tous les patients sauf un ont eu un doppler veineux des MI, il n'y avait pas de TVP dans 76 % des cas (n = 23/30), une TVP distale édans 2 cas (6,6 %), et une TVP proximale dans 5 cas (16,6 %). Le bilan étiologique était réalisé en cas d'EP non provoquée, en fonction de l'âge : bilan de thrombophilie chez les patients de moins de 40 ans, recherche de cancer chez les patients de plus de 50 ans. La durée de traitement anticoagulant était de 6 mois chez 15 patients avec EP spontanée ou avec facteur de risque mineur (48 %), elle était de 3 mois chez 11 patients avec EP provoquée par un facteur de risque majeur (35 %) et au long cours chez 4 patients (13 %). La durée moyenne de suivi était de 10 mois, deux patients ont été perdus de vue après la consultation de thrombose. Parmi les patients suivis plus de 6 mois, aucun n'a présenté de récidive d'EP à l'arrêt du traitement. Deux patients sur 31 (6 %) auraient dû être hospitalisés et ont été pris en charge en ambulatoire de manière indue : un patient qui avait un score de sPESI à 1 et un patient qui avait une surinfection d'infarctus pulmonaire. Deux patients sur 31 (6 %), avaient une prescription d'anticoagulants partiellement erronée avec une posologie inadaptée pour l'un et une durée trop courte pour l'autre. La consultation de thrombose a eu lieu dans 100 % des cas entre J2 et J7 suivant l'EP. Celle-ci a permis de corriger les deux erreurs posologiques et d'hsopitaliser le patient avec infarctus pulmonaire. Le dernier patient n'a finalement pas été hospitalisé. Trois patients (9,6 %) ont présenté des complications hémorragiques sous anticoagulants : un patient de 43 ans a présenté une hématurie sous AOD, qui a fait découvrir un cancer du rein ;une patiente a présenté des rectorragies sous rivaroxaban ;une patiente a présenté une hépatite et des métrorragies sous rivaroxaban. Dans notre étude, la collaboration interniste-urgentiste a permis la création d'une filière ambulatoire des EP efficiente puisque 94 % des patients étaient bien orientés et bien traités. La prise en charge ambulatoire s'est bien déroulée chez tous les patients avec 100 % de patients sans récidive thromboembolique. La consultation de thrombose faite entre J2 et J7 s'est avérée indispensable : elle a permis de réorienter et de corriger si besoin les prises en charge inadaptées, d'adapter le bilan étiologique aux recommandations, de faire de l'éducation thérapeutique auprès des patients. La prise en charge ambulatoire des EP est efficiente grâce à la coordination entre les urgentistes et les internistes. Une consultation de thrombose est nécessaire entre J2 et J7 après le diagnostic pour revoir les patients et guider la suite de la prise en charge.

The objective of the present study was to clarify further the clinical characteristics and blood parameters in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three suspected patients and 64 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection were admitted to a designated hospital. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 64 patients studied, 47 (73.4%) had been exposed to a confirmed source of COVID-19 transmission. On admission, the most common symptoms were fever (75%) and cough (76.6%). Twenty-eight (43.8%) COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, 10 (15.6%) showed lymphopenia, 47 (73.4%) and 41 (64.1%) had elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), respectively, and 30 (46.9%) had increased fibrinogen concentration. After the treatment, the counts of white blood cells and platelets, and the level of prealbumin increased significantly, while aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hsCRP decreased. COVID-19 patients with the hospital stay longer than 12 days had higher body mass index (BMI) and increased levels of AST, LDH, fibrinogen, hsCRP, and ESR.

422026,A coronavirus online analysis platform at the National Genomics Data Center,2020,"Optimizing the processing technology is an effective way to improve the yield of active ingredients for the industrial production of medicinal crops Baikal Skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) is a perennial herb in the Lamiaceae family and its dried root is used as a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the active ingredients of S baicalensis have important pharmacological effects including anti-oxidation, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammation Specifically, it is recently found that S baicalensis has significant curative effects on the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) In recent years, the market demand for the medicinal products of S baicalensis is increasing because of its great medicinal values However, the annual yield of active ingredients originated from the root of S baicalensis is limited due to that little progress has been made on the traditional processing technology used in the extraction process A pressing issue faced by both herbalists and scientists is how to improve the processing efficiency, thereby obtaining the maximum yield of products for S baicalensis In this study, a systematic analysis on the effects of growth years and post-harvest processing on the contents of medicinal active ingredients of S baicalensis was conducted The contents of eight active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, scutellarin, scutellarein, apigenin, and chrysin) in roots of S baicalensis of different growth years (ranging from 1 year to 15 years) were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further analyzed to determine the optimal harvest period In particular, the contents of six active ingredients in different parts (cortex and stele) of the root of S baicalensis were estimated and compared Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of the contents of active ingredients in fresh-crush and fresh-cut roots of S baicalensis at room temperature were compared and analyzed to reveal the influence of post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients In addition, the effects of six different post-harvest treatments on the contents of active ingredients were systematically designed and compared to determine the best primary processing technology The results showed that the best harvesting period for S baicalensis should be determined as 2–3 years based on comprehensive evaluation of active ingredient content, annual yield increment, and land use efficiency The contents of active ingredients including baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in cortex were significantly higher than those in stele (P ≤ 0 05) The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and scutellarin in fresh roots of S baicalensis significantly reduced as the storage time increased, but the reduction of fresh-cutting was significantly lower than that of fresh-crushing For the effects of different processing treatments, the contents of four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) under drying (D) and cutting-drying (C–D) treatments were significantly higher than those of the other four treatments (P ≤ 0 05) Collectively, the above results will not only provide novel processing methods that will improve the yield of active ingredients for S baicalensis, but also shed light on the optimization of processing technology for the industrial production of medicinal crops","Bai, Chengke Yang Jingjing Cao Bo Xue Ying Gao Pufan Liang Hui Li Guishuang",Industrial Crops and Products,,93

422355,Social Herd Immunity,2020,"Objective: To assess the depression and anxiety and their relationship with disease activity in patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 54 patients with CS (48 females, 6 males). Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State, STAI-Trait were used to evaluate scores and severity of depression, the current state of anxiety, and general anxiety, respectively. Patients with active CS (n=10) were recorded as group 1, those who were still receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy after surgery (n=14) as group 2, and those in remission (n=30) as group 3. The groups were compared in terms of parameters that could affect anxiety and depression scores. Correlation analyses were also performed. Results: BDI-II scores were higher in group 1 than group 3 (p=0.002), and STAI-State scores were higher in group 1 than group 2 (p=0.03) while STAI-Trait scores and the other parameters were similar between the groups. Moderate and severe depression were detected in 60% of group 1, 25% of group 2, and 16% of group 3 patients. High state anxiety was seen in 70% of patients in group 1, 50% of group 2, and 57% of group 3 patients. Positive correlations between BDI-II scores and disease activity (r=0.438, p=0.001) and STAI-State scores and disease activity (r=0.297, p=0.029) were observed. Conclusion: Increased depression and state anxiety during the pandemic in patients with active CS suggests that psychiatric disorders may increase in those with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.","Pamp,; Iacute,; ŞKamp,; NpaŞA, Hamide Seda Turgut Karaarslan Özlem Bozkur Evin Esen Ayşe Pamuk Naim ÇAkir amp; lkay, Mert Meral DoĞAnŞEn Sema Çamp; FtÇamp,",Turkish Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism,,93

BPA can contaminate food, beverage, air, and soil. It accumulates in several human tissues and organs and is potentially harmful to human health through different molecular mechanisms. Due to its hormone-like properties, BPA may bind to estrogen receptors, thereby affecting both body weight and tumorigenesis. BPA may also affect metabolism and cancer progression, by interacting with GPR30, and may impair male reproductive function, by binding to androgen receptors. Several transcription factors, including PPARÎ³, C/EBP, Nrf2, HOX, and HAND2, are involved in BPA action on fat and liver homeostasis, the cardiovascular system, and cancer. Finally, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histones modification, and changes in microRNAs expression contribute to BPA pathological effects.

This wall pattern in these vessels concerned to presence of connective stromal elements (collagen and elastic fibres and lamellae) and smooth muscle cells coexisting with some equilibrium in the wall structure of the renal and femoral arteries, mainly in the medial layer architecture. An intimal folding pattern was verified around the vascular lumen, possibly related to capacitance of the both arteries regarding to variability of pressure levels in cardiac cycle. Furthermore, myostromal relations of connective elements and smooth muscle cells verified in the medial layer and the network formed by connective elements in the adventitial layer of these arteries contributed to maintenance of wall viscoelasticity properties of the vessels","Aparecida da Silva Viegas, Katia; Marcos Orsi, Antonio; Simões, Karina; Fantin Domeniconi, Raquel; Raquel Marçal Natali, Maria",Acta Sci.

Visando suprir parte desta carência, este trabalho teve como objetivo descrever o comportamento copulatório da onça-pintada; padronizar a técnica de aspiração folicular por laparoscopia em onças-pardas e pintadas; avaliar a qualidade e quantidade de oócitos de onças-pardas e pintadas maturados in vivo e in vitro; avaliar a viabilidade de oócitos desvitrificados; produzir de embriões in vitro de onças-pardas e pintadas a partir de oócitos maturados in vivo e in vitro; e avaliar a ovulação espontânea em onças-pintadas mantidas em cativeiro. Informações básicas sobre o comportamento reprodutivo das onças-pintadas são de extrema importância para o manejo, desenvolvimento de projetos de reprodução assistida e conservação. O comportamento copulatório da onça-pintada foi descrito de forma qualitativa, a partir dos primeiros sinais de proceptividade feminina e até a finalização da cópula. Descobrimos que quase metade dos eventos de copulação de Panthera onca pode ocorrer sem penetração peniana e, nesses casos, acredita-se que a ejaculação não ocorra. Várias cópulas ocorreram durante o estro feminino. Consistente com os pensamentos relatados por outros, acreditamos que esse comportamento pode ser necessário para promover múltiplas ovulações e para garantir um número suficiente de penetrações penianas bem-sucedidas com a ejaculação, garantindo assim que um número adequado de espermatozoides fertilizantes normais seja depositado na vagina. A LOPU é um procedimento seguro para obtenção de oócitos de boa qualidade visando a multiplicação de felinos selvagens como parte de estratégias de conservação, especificamente onças-pardas e onças-pintadas, que são consideradas vulneráveis no Brasil. Protocolos utilizando eCG para superestimulação ovariana são eficientes em onças-pardas e onças-pintadas, assim como a indução da ovulação nestas espécies com a utilização do hCG. A vitrificação e desvitrificação dos oócitos se mostraram eficientes, obtendo 86,4% estruturas desvitrificados com êxito em relação à avaliação morfológica. É possível a fertilização in vitro de oócitos de onças-pintadas maturados in vivo, porém novos trabalhos são necessários para a maturação in vitro dos oócitos desta espécie e de onças-pardas. A onça-pintada apresenta ovulação induzida por estímulo sensorial e não uma ovulação espontânea. Pelas dificuldades de trabalho com estes animais, não temos nenhum trabalho que defina a situação (ovulação induzida por estímulo sensorial vs. ovulação espontânea) em forma contundente. A ovulação induzida por estímulo sensorial resulta em um reflexo neurológico que resulta na liberação de GnRH pelo estímulo do hipotálamo médio-basal e subsequentes liberações de LH pela hipófise anterior, induzindo a ovulação.","NETO, PEDRO NACIB JORGE",,,93

Kim Jong Un Faces His Greatest Test Yet,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate changes in antimicrobial use during COVID-19 and after implementation of a multispecialty COVID-19 clinical guidance team compared to pre-COVID-19 antimicrobial use. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Internal medicine and medical intensive care unit (MICU) provider teams and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Difference-in-differences analyses of antibiotic days of therapy per 1,000 patient days present (DOT) for internal medicine and MICU teams treating COVID-19 patients versus teams that did not were performed for 3 periods: before COVID-19, initial COVID-19 period, and after implementation of a multispecialty COVID-19 clinical guidance team which included daily, patient-specific antimicrobial stewardship recommendations. Patient characteristics associated with antibiotic DOT were evaluated using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: In the initial COVID-19 period, compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, internal medicine and MICU teams increased weekly antimicrobial use by 145.3 DOT (95% CI, 35.1-255.5) and 204.0 DOT (95% CI, -16.9 to 424.8), respectively, compared to non-COVID-19 teams. In the intervention period, internal medicine and MICU COVID-19 teams both had significant weekly decreases of 362.3 DOT (95% CI, -443.3 to -281.2) and 226.3 DOT (95% CI, -381.2 to -71.3). Of 131 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 86 (65.6%) received antibiotics; no specific patient factors were significantly associated with an expected change in antibiotic days. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial use initially increased for COVID-19 patient care teams compared to pre-COVID-19 levels but significantly decreased after implementation of a multispecialty clinical guidance team, which may be an effective strategy to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial use.","Staub, Milner B; Beaulieu, Ronald M; Graves, John; Nelson, George E",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,93
423742,Are we an ageist society?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cerumen of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care pandemic hospital. Sixty COVID-19 patients with cerumen in their external auditory canals were included in the study. Swabs were taken from the external auditory canal of the patients by an experienced otolaryngologist with the test swab. Sampling was done by rotating the sample swab 360° 10 times in each external auditory canal for a total of 20 times. After collection, swabs were placed into 2 mL of the sterile viral transport medium (various manufacturers), then transported and tested as soon as possible after collection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the cerumen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples of any of the 60 patients with positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: Cerumen cleaning is one of the most common procedures performed by otolaryngologists, and care should be taken during the procedure or due to the possibility of infection from the resulting contaminants. The cerumen contains the secretions of the glands in the external auditory canal and may contain certain pathogens that are actively found in the body. The presence of hepatitis B virus in the cerumen was examined and isolated in the cerumen. In our study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cerumen was evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients. SARS-CoV-2 virus was not detected in the cerumen samples of any of the patients.","Islamoglu, Yuce; Bercin, Sami; Aydogan, Sibel; Sener, Alp; Tanriverdi, Fatih; Gunaydin, Gul Pamukcu; Dinc, Bedia",Ear Nose Throat J,,93

424683,A virtual classroom activity for teaching sunlight-initiated DNA damage and its protection,2021,"Background: Diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. This type of sampling is uncomfortable for the patient, dangerous for health workers, and its high demand has led to a global shortage of swabs. One of the alternative specimens is saliva. However, the optimal conditions for the test have not been established. Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the viral genome in saliva samples kept at room temperature, in the fridge or frozen for 2 days. In addition, the influence of brushing teeth and feeding on the detection of the virus in saliva was addressed. Finally, the efficiency of saliva in revealing the presence of the virus during the hospitalization period was determined in children. Results: The viral genome was consistently detected regardless of the storage conditions of saliva samples. Brushing teeth and feeding did not influence the sensitivity of the test. In hospitalized children, positive results were obtained only during the early days. Conclusions: These results support the idea of the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The viral genome is stable and endures perturbations in the oral cavity. However, clearance of the virus from the mouth during the infection may limit the use of the test only to the early stages of the disease.","López-Martínez, Briceida; Guzmán-Ortiz, Ana L; Nevárez-Ramírez, Abraham J; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Olivar-López, Víctor B; Ángeles-Floriano, Tania; Vilchis-Ordoñez, Armando; Quezada, Héctor",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,93
424872,Covid-19: Single dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine produces strong antibody response in over 80s,2021,"Background/Aims: Ectopic pregnancy is a gynaecological emergency with significant burden of maternal mortality and morbidity in the tropics. The incidence reported in the literature range from 1:60 to 1:250 pregnancies. The aim was to determine incidence and risk factors of ectopic pregnancy in the Gambia. Methodology: A longitudinal study of ectopic pregnancy at Gambian tertiary hospital from January 2016 to April 2018. Data was collected from patients' folders, entered into SPSS version 20 and analysed with descriptive statistics. The test of variation and significance was by ANOVA and Chi-square respectively with error margin set at 0.05 and confidence interval of 95%. Results: A total number of 2562 pregnancies were recorded, 43 were ectopic pregnancies. The estimated incidence was 0.2%. Majority of the patients were between 26 - 35 years (56%), primiparous (32%), heterogeneous marriage (82%) and housewives (86%). Occupation was not associated with ruptured or unruptured ectopic pregnancy (p-0.421). Low parity was associated with more ectopic pregnancy than high parity (p-0.001). The commonest clinical feature was abdominal pain (65.1%), whilst the most prominent risk factors were pelvic inflammatory disease (27.9%) and previous abortion (23.3%). Ectopic pregnancy was seasonal. Conclusion: The incidence rate of 0.2% was in the range reported in the literature. Low parity, previous abortion and pelvic inflammatory disease were the risk factors.","Anyanwu, Matthew; Titilope, Grace",Afr Health Sci,,93
424950,Confinement strategies in a simple SIR model,2020-04-20,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of notifiable infectious diseases (NIDs) in Taiwan remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of cases of NID (n = 42) between January and September 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the open database from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. RESULTS: The number of NID cases was 21,895 between January and September 2020, which was lower than the number of cases during the same period in 2019 (n = 24,469), with a decline in incidence from 102.9 to 91.7 per 100,000 people in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Fourteen airborne/droplet, 11 fecal-oral, seven vector-borne, and four direct-contact transmitted NID had an overall reduction of 2700 (-28.1%), 156 (-23.0%), 557 (-54.8%), and 73 (-45.9%) cases, respectively, from 2019 to 2020. Similar trends were observed for the changes in incidence, which were 11.5 (-28.4%), 6.7 (-23.4%), 2.4 (-55.0%), and 0.3 (-46.2%) per 100,000 people for airborne/droplet, fecal-oral, vector-borne, and direct-contact transmitted NID, respectively. In addition, all the 38 imported NID showed a reduction of 632 (-73.5%) cases from 2019 to 2020. In contrast, 4 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) showed an increase of 903 (+7.2%) cases from 2019 to 2020, which was attributed to the increase in gonorrhea (from 3220 to 5028). The overall incidence of STDs increased from 52.5 to 56.0 per 100,000 people, with a percentage change of +6.7%. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a collateral benefit of COVID-19 prevention measures for various infectious diseases, except STDs, in Taiwan, during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, Shey-Ying; Yen, Muh-Yong; Lee, Ping-Ing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Travel Med Infect Dis,,93
426418,"Stopping the SuperSpreader Epidemic, Part II: MERS Goes Pandemic",2014-05-17,"Objective. Currently, management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 infection with invasive mechanical ventilation results in poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Interventions to reduce ventilatory requirements or preclude their needs should be evaluated in order to improve survival rates in critically ill patients. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during the innate immune response could be a contributing factor to the pulmonary pathology. This study suggests the use of dornase alfa, a recombinant DNAse I that lyses NETs, to reduce ventilatory requirements and improve oxygenation status, as well as outcomes in critically ill patients with ARDS subsequent to confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection. Design. A single-institution cohort study. Setting. Intensive care unit in a tertiary medical center. Patients. Adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Intervention. Treatment with aerosolized dornase alfa. Measurements and Main Results. Of 39 patients evaluated, most patients had improvement in oxygenation measured by increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, reduction in ventilatory support or other supportive oxygen requirements, and partial resolution of bilateral opacities visible on CXR, as well as improved outcome. Conclusions. Administration of inhalational dornase alfa via a filtered nebulizer medication system or through an adapter in a ventilator circuit should be considered in all COVID-19-positive patients with ARDS as early in the disease course as possible.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of a pharmacokinetic and viral load analysis as a basis for adjusting immunoglobulin dosing to treat COVID-19. We reviewed the pre-clinical and clinical literature that describes the impact of a high antigen load on pharmacokinetic data following antibody treatment. Representative examples are provided to illustrate the effect of high viral and tumor loads on antibody clearance. We then highlight the implications of these factors for facilitating the development and dosing of hyperimmune anti-SARS CoV2 immunoglobulin. Both nonclinical and clinical examples indicate that high antigen loads, whether they be viral, bacterial, or tumoral in origin, result in increased clearance and decreased area under the curve and half-life of antibodies. A dosing strategy that matches the antigen load can be achieved by giving initially high doses and adjusting the frequency of dosing intervals based on pharmacokinetic parameters. We suggest that study design and dose selection for immunoglobulin products for the treatment of COVID-19 require special considerations such as viral load, antibody-virus interaction, and dosing adjustment based on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody.","Tegenge, Million A; Mahmood, Iftekhar; Struble, Evi; Golding, Basil",Drugs R&amp;D (Online),,93

The SPDEs have space interactions, in the sense that the dynamics of the system at time $t$ and position in space x also depend on the space-mean of values at neighbouring points. This is a model with many applications, e.g. to population growth studies and epidemiology. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a class of SPDEs with space interactions, and we show that, under some conditions, the solutions are positive for all times if the initial values are. Sufficient and necessary maximum principles for the optimal control of such systems are derived. Finally, we apply the results to study an optimal vaccine strategy problem for an epidemic by modelling the population density as a space-mean stochastic reaction-diffusion equation.","Agram, Nacira; Hilbert, Astrid; Makhlouf, Khouloud; Oksendal, Bernt",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07303v5.pdf,93

We performed high-throughput sequencing on nine samples that were found to have a high concentration of viral RNA. We also assessed the potential impact that long-distance transport of samples to testing centres may have on sequencing results. Here, two samples that were similar in terms of viral RNA concentration but were transported from sites that are over 400 km apart were analyzed. All sequences were compared to previous sequences from Ghana and representative sequences from regions where our patients had previously travelled. Three complete genome sequences and another nearly complete genome sequence with 95.6% coverage were obtained. Sequences with coverage in excess of 80% were found to belong to three lineages, namely A, B.1 and B.2. Our sequences clustered in two different clades, with the majority falling within a clade composed of sequences from sub-Saharan Africa. Less RNA fragmentation was seen in sample KATH23, which was collected 9 km from the testing site, than in sample TTH6, which was collected and transported over a distance of 400 km to the testing site. The clustering of several sequences from sub-Saharan Africa suggests regional circulation of the viruses in the subregion. Importantly, there may be a need to decentralize testing sites and build more capacity across Africa to boost the sequencing output of the subregion.","Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; El-Duah, Philip; Owusu, Michael; Schneider, Julia; Yeboah, Richmond; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Gorman, Richmond; Adu, Eric; Kwarteng, Alexander; Frimpong, Michael; Binger, Tabea; Aryeetey, Sherihane; Asamoah, Jesse Addo; Amoako, Yaw Ampem; Amuasi, John Humphrey; Beheim-Schwarzbach, Jörn; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Obiri-Danso, Kwasi; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian; Phillips, Richard",Arch Virol,,93

However, fewer than 1% of patients in the PARADIGM-HF study had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV symptoms. Accordingly, data that informed the use of S/V among patients with advanced HF were limited. The LIFE (LCZ696 in Hospitalized Advanced Heart Failure) study was a 24-week prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, double-dummy, active comparator trial that compared the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of S/V with those of valsartan in patients with advanced HFrEF. The trial planned to randomize 400 patients &#8805;18 years of age with advanced HF, defined as an EF &#8804;35%, New York Heart Association functional class IV symptoms, elevated natriuretic peptide concentration (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] &#8805;250 pg/ml or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] &#8805;800 pg/ml), and &#8805;1 objective finding of advanced HF. Following a 3- to 7-day open label run-in period with S/V (24 mg/26 mg twice daily), patients were randomized 1:1 to S/V titrated to 97 mg/103 mg twice daily versus 160 mg of V twice daily. The primary endpoint was the proportional change from baseline in the area under the curve for NT-proBNP levels measured through week 24. Secondary and tertiary endpoints included clinical outcomes and safety and tolerability.

432802,Cryptoassets as an emerging class of digital assets in the financial accounting,2020,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with higher mortality and a worse prognosis. Nevertheless, most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, and about 5% can develop more severe symptoms and involve hypovolemia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In a pathophysiological perspective, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by numerous dependent pathways triggered by hypercytokinemia, especially IL-6 and TNF-alpha, leading to systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ dysfunction. Systemic endotheliitis and direct viral tropism to proximal renal tubular cells and podocytes are important pathophysiological mechanisms leading to kidney injury in patients with more critical infection, with a clinical presentation ranging from proteinuria and/or glomerular hematuria to fulminant AKI requiring renal replacement therapies. Glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis, and nephrotoxic drugs are also associated with kidney damage in patients with COVID-19. Thus, AKI and proteinuria are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature emphasizing the impact of acute kidney involvement in the evolutive prognosis and mortality of patients with COVID-19.","Pecly, I. M.

This experimental and observational study was done at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh, Bangladesh from May 2020 to October 2020. Where 105 suspected COVID 19 patients of MMCH and RT-PCR correlation were included in the study. During the study, 43.05% of the patients exposed indirectly to the virus, followed by 44.1% didn't exposed any virus, 21% exposed directly. Diabetes mellitus was 35.7%, HTN - 46.2%, 82.95% had fever, 72.45% had cough, 78.75% had respiratory distress and 49.35% had no diseases. After CT scan diagnosis, positive to infection were found in 98 patients, among them 34 patients had mild type, 22 had severe type of infection where as in RT-PCR diagnosis 69 were positive and 36 were negative to infection. From our study we can conclude that, the most common pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia on HRCT images are pure GGO and GGO and Crazy Paving. Also GGO with consolidation with prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral part of the lung. Further study is very much needed for better outcome.","Jahan, A. B.; Sarwar, J.

As a result, both educational challenges and opportunities emerged. The objective of this study was to assess the changes used by plastic surgery programs as a result of the pandemic. METHODS: A 34-question American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons-approved survey was distributed on April 29, 2020, to attendings in academic plastic surgery programs in the United States. Variables were controlled whenever multiple attending responses were submitted from the same program. RESULTS: A total of 113 attendings, including 30 (27.8%) program directors, responded to the survey. Most respondents were located in the northeast (41.4%). The average percentage of elective case volume was 23% of pre-COVID states. Those who reported a decrease in emergent surgical case volume (55.2%) estimated it to be at an average of 45% of the normal. Almost all the respondents (95.6%) agreed that they were working fewer hours than usual, and 40.9% of those reported a decrease of more than 20 hours per week of work. Most attendings (82.1%) also reported a decrease in their monthly salary. The percentage projected current salary compared with normal was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey data suggest that academic plastic surgery programs have had impactful changes to their operative and educational schedules, teaching, revenue, and patient care.

443405,Interventions on European nationalist populism and bordering in time of emergencies,2020,"Education systems and institutions, often historically considered to be resolute, slow-moving entities transformed virtually overnight during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating nimbleness in adversity. This paper describes the first-hand experiences of teaching staff and students from a UK university which pivoted to emergency remote teaching for a core second-year module in engineering, focused on entrepreneurship. A range of methods are used including self-reflection, summative, formative, and focus-group student feedback. The paper provides an insight for readers who may be interested in the practical challenges associated with moving from an academic module typically delivered in a face-to-face learning environment accommodating a large student cohort (n = 177), to one that exists entirely in the digital domain. Our results show learning outcomes were fully met despite stark differences in quality of learning environments amongst students. Students reported benefits to remote learning because it offers a blended approach of both asynchronous content and synchronous sessions, with the latter enhancing engagement and providing structure to working weeks. Issues of presence emerged amongst group work: whilst it might be easier to confront some individuals for lack of contribution, it is also easier for those individuals to disengage. There was widespread support for the Microsoft Teams platform amongst students and staff but the former group reported this lacked a social environment in which relationships amongst team members could be nurtured informally, such as was experienced via social media.","Lambert, Chris G.; Rennie, Allan E.

A cohort study and longitudinal exploratory analysis were performed. Forty undergraduate first-year dental students, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal, were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two different teaching methods were applied during an identical time-period: face-to-face lectures complemented by physical models (T1 cohort) and webinar lectures complemented by CBCT images (T2 cohort). Learning outcomes were then studied according to theoretical and spatial orientation contexts. A self-reported survey that focused on students' satisfaction, stress, and support was studied. Both teaching methods were analyzed with paired sample student's t-test and Pearson Correlation Confidence intervals 95% with P < 0.05. Furthermore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for self-reported satisfaction survey validity and reliability analysis. The learning outcomes between T1 and T2 cohorts were statistically significant, (P < 0.001) corresponding to differences with a large effect degree (r > 0.60). Students' satisfaction, as measured on a six-point Likert scale, was positively influenced by the webinar lectures supplemented with CBCT images (T2 cohort) in a learning context (4.95 ± 0.5) and future applications (5.92 ± 0.27).

444081,What is my covid risk?,2021,"Saving lives or economy is a dilemma for epidemic control in most cities while smart-tracing technology raises people's privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require private data. We bypass the private-data requirement by suppressing epidemic transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility. The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/anyleopeace/DURLECA/.","Song, Sirui; Zong, Zefang; Li, Yong; Liu, Xue; Yu, Yang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01257v1.pdf,93
444082,What is my covid risk?,2021,"Infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to multi-organ failure associated with a cytokine storm and septic shock. The virus evades the mitochondrial production of interferons through its N protein and, from that moment on, it hijacks the functions of these organelles. The aim of this study was to show how the virus kidnaps the mitochondrial machinery for its benefit and survival, leading to alterations of serum parameters and to nitrosative stress (NSS). In a prospective cohort of 15 postmortem patients who died from COVID-19, six markers of mitochondrial function (COX II, COX IV, MnSOD, nitrotyrosine, Bcl-2 and caspase-9) were analyzed by the immune colloidal gold technique in samples from the lung, heart, and liver. Biometric laboratory results from these patients showed alterations in hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, urea nitrogen, glucose, C-reactive protein, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, Ca²âº, Kâº, lactate and troponin. These changes were associated with alterations in the mitochondrial structure and function. The multi-organ dysfunction present in COVID-19 patients may be caused, in part, by damage to the mitochondria that results in an inflammatory state that contributes to NSS, which activates the sepsis cascade and results in increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Soto, María Elena; Guarner-Lans, Verónica; Rojas, Gustavo; Perezpeña-Diazconti, Mario; Críales-Vera, Sergio A; Manzano Pech, Linaloe; Pérez-Torres, Israel",Histol Histopathol,,93

444084,"Network synchronization, stability and rhythmic processes in a diffusive mean-field coupled SEIR model",2021,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country to largely experience the COVID-19 epidemic among other Western countries during the so-called first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological-organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","Gios, Lorenzo; Crema Falceri, Giulia; Micocci, Stefano; Patil, Luigi; Testa, Sara; Sforzin, Simona; Turra, Ettore; Conforti, Diego; Malfatti, Giulia; Moz, Monica; Nicolini, Andrea; Guarda, Paolo; Bacchiega, Alessandro; Mion, Carlo; Marchesoni, Michele; Maimone, Rosa; Molini, Pietro Benedetto; Zanella, Alberto; Osmani, Venet; Mayora-Ibarra, Oscar; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Form Res,,93

Citizen Solidarity Practices in Vallcarca, Barcelona (Spain)",2020,"Despite protective measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and a COVID airway management program (CAMP), some emergency physicians will inevitably test positive for COVID. We aim to develop a model predicting weekly numbers of emergency physician COVID converters to aid operations planning. The data were obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) used throughout the national healthcare system. Hamad Medical Corporation's internal emergency medicine workforce data were used as a source of information on emergency physician COVID conversion and numbers of emergency physicians completing CAMP training. The study period included the spring and summer months of 2020 and started on March 7 and ran for 21 whole weeks through July 31. Data were extracted from the system's EMR database into a spreadsheet (Excel, Microsoft, Redmond, USA). The statistical software used for all analyses and plots was Stata (version 16.1 MP, StataCorp, College Station, USA). All data definitions were made a priori. A total of 35 of 250 emergency physicians (14.0%, 95% CI 9.9%–19.9%) converted to a positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the study's 21-week period. Of these. only two were hospitalized for having respiratory-only disease, and none required respiratory support. Both were discharged within a week of admission. The weekly number of newly COVID-positive emergency physicians was zero and was seen in eight of 21 (38.1%) weeks. The peak weekly counts of six emergency physicians with new COVID-positive were seen in week 14. The mean weekly number of newly COVID-positive emergency physicians was 1.7 ± 1.9, and the median was 1 (IQR, 0 to 3). This study demonstrates that in the State of Qatar's Emergency Department (ED) system, knowing only four parameters allows the reliable prediction of the number of emergency physicians likely to convert COVID PCR tests within the next week. The results also suggest that attention to the details of minimizing endotracheal intubation (ETI) risk can eliminate the expected finding of the association between ETI numbers and emergency physician COVID numbers.

The ultimate scale of the recession is yet to be determined, but it is likely to be the most dramatic slump since World War II. The impact of the crisis on the financial sector, especially consumer finance, could almost instantly be observed. The article shows how determination and consistency in regulatory actions counteracts the effects of the pandemic crisis for the banking sector and consumer finance. The conducted research has shown the existence of a number of social phenomena typical of this type of global crisis, such as shopping panic, reduced creditworthiness of households related to loss of income, unemployment and increased crime. At the same time, the actions of financial market regulators turned out to be very effective (no negative structural phenomena occurred in the financial market). The accuracy of the selection of instruments and the speed of action limited the social and financial effects of the pandemic, including a loan repayment memorandum, limiting the cost of consumer loans and supporting the banking sector, which will limit the scale of excessive household debt and consumer bankruptcies, and companies were also supported.

447110,Nursing in the time of COVID,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of same-day discharge after uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR. BACKGROUND: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a same-day discharge (SDD) pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral (minimalist) TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources. Studies support that next-day discharge (NDD) for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR. METHODS: In-hospital and 30 day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting pre-specified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed. Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria. Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30 days. RESULTS: Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR. 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD. The STS scores were similar between the two groups (SDD 2.6% ±1.5 vs. NDD 2.3% ± 1.2). There were no deaths at 30 days in either group. There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement (SDD 0% vs. NDD 0.8%, p > .99) or cardiovascular readmission (SDD 0% vs. NDD 5.5%, p = .35) at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Same day discharge following uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR in selected patients appears to be safe, achieving similar 30 day outcomes as a cohort of next day discharge patients.","Perdoncin, Emily; Greenbaum, Adam B; Grubb, Kendra J; Babaliaros, Vasilis C; Keegan, Patricia; Ceretto-Clark, Brendan; Wei, Jane; Guyton, Robert A; Paone, Gaetano; Byku, Isida; Gleason, Patrick T; Biven, Kelby; Mathew, Preethy; Mortorano, Cecilia; Inci, Errol K; Faaborg-Andersen, Christian; Mitchell, Rae; Devireddy, Chandan M",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,93

Work and family are usually seen as two separate domains that are interdependent, with boundaries that have some level of permeability. Crisis situations can alter permeability of these boundaries, enhancing integration of the two domains due to exchange of ideas and spillover of concerns between these domains. This study looks at how these boundaries are impacted for nurses working directly with COVID-19 patients. The study conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with nurses. Through a thematic analysis the study found that the work-family boundaries have blurred due to concerns around the contagiousness and anxiety associated with the virus. In order to cope with these spillover and possible crossover effects, nurses use prosocial distortion and avoidance and create sub-boundaries at home.","Sahay, Surabhi; Wei, Wan",Health Commun,,93

The widespread use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed telemedicine beyond diabetes care and into clinical areas with a paucity of published data. The evaluation and treatment of thyrotoxicosis heavily relies on laboratory assessment and imaging with physical exam playing a role to help differentiate the etiology and assess the severity of thyrotoxicosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a patient presenting for evaluation of new thyrotoxicosis via telemedicine, and describe modifications to consider for thorough, safe evaluation via telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine may be an ideal way to assess and treat patients with thyrotoxicosis who are not able to physically attend a visit with an endocrinologist but still have access to a laboratory for blood draws. Potential challenges include access to imaging and high-volume surgeons if needed. Clinical and economic outcomes of telemedicine care of thyrotoxicosis should be studied so that standards of care for endocrine telemedicine can be established.","Griffith, Michelle L; Bischoff, Lindsay A; Baum, Howard B A",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,93

This paper presents Facebook's risk-driven backbone management strategy to ensure high service performance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe Risk Simulation System (RSS), a production system that identifies possible failures and quantifies their potential severity with a set of metrics for network risk. With a year-long risk measurement from RSS we show that our backbone resiliently withstood the COVID-19 stress test, achieving high service availability and low route dilation while efficiently handling traffic surges. We also share our operational practices to mitigate risk throughout the pandemic. Our findings give insights to further improve risk-driven network management. We argue for incorporating short-term failure statistics in modeling failures. Common failure prediction models based on long-term modeling achieve stable output at the cost of assigning low significance to unique short-term events of extreme importance such as COVID-19. Furthermore, we advocate augmenting network management techniques with non-networking signals. We support this by identifying and analyzing the correlation between network traffic and human mobility. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.","Xia, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, Z.; Yan, G.; Lim, C.

449805,Innovative strategies to support physical distancing among individuals with active addiction,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and is responsible for several hundred thousand fatalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City; to develop machine learning models for making predictions about the hospital course of the patients over clinically meaningful time horizons based on patient characteristics at admission; and to assess the performance of these models at multiple hospitals and time points. METHODS: We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days from admission. Our study population included harmonized EHR data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19-positive patients admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. The models were first trained on patients from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383). Finally, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions. RESULTS: Upon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days. XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. In external validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction. Similarly, the unimputed XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. Trends in performance on prospective validation sets were similar. At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the strongest drivers of mortality prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We externally and prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons. These models identified at-risk patients and uncovered underlying relationships that predicted outcomes.","Vaid, Akhil; Somani, Sulaiman; Russak, Adam J; De Freitas, Jessica K; Chaudhry, Fayzan F; Paranjpe, Ishan; Johnson, Kipp W; Lee, Samuel J; Miotto, Riccardo; Richter, Felix; Zhao, Shan; Beckmann, Noam D; Naik, Nidhi; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Lala, Anuradha; Paranjpe, Manish; Golden, Eddye; Danieletto, Matteo; Singh, Manbir; Meyer, Dara; O039,; Reilly, Paul F; Huckins, Laura; Kovatch, Patricia; Finkelstein, Joseph; Freeman, Robert M; Argulian, Edgar; Kasarskis, Andrew; Percha, Bethany; Aberg, Judith A; Bagiella, Emilia; Horowitz, Carol R; Murphy, Barbara; Nestler, Eric J; Schadt, Eric E; Cho, Judy H; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Fuster, Valentin; Charney, Dennis S; Reich, David L; Bottinger, Erwin P; Levin, Matthew A; Narula, Jagat; Fayad, Zahi A; Just, Allan C; Charney, Alexander W; Nadkarni, Girish N; Glicksberg, Benjamin S",J Med Internet Res,,93
449932,July/August 2020 Forum,2020,"We use microsimulation combined with a model of the COVID-19 impacts on individuals and households to obtain projections of households in destitution in the United Kingdom. The projections are estimated at two levels: aggregate quarterly for the UK, for all quarters of 2020; and annual for 2020 differentiated by region, sector and household demographics. At the aggregate level, destitution is projected to be about three times higher than the non-COVID counterfactual level in 2020Q2, as well as substantially higher than the non-COVID case for the remainder of the year. This increased destitution is initially largely due to the effect on the self-employed, and as the Furlough scheme is drawn down, also on the unemployed. Impacts upon different regions and sectors vary widely, and so do variations across different household types. The sectors particularly affected are construction and manufacturing, while London and its closely connected regions (South East and the Midlands) are most severely affected. Single adult households suffer the most, and the adverse effects increase with number of children in the household. That the effects upon youth remain high is a particularly worrying sign, and very high increases in destitution are also projected for 25-54 year olds and the elderly (75 years and older). Further, severe adverse effects are projected for sections of society and the economy where multiple impacts are coincident. Robust and sustained mitigation measures are therefore required.","Bhattacharjee, Arnab; Lisauskaite, Elena",Natl. Inst. Econ. Rev.,,93

The health situation after the emergence of COVID-19 has precipitated the use of new technologies and the adaptation of rehabilitation services of all kinds. Objective: To describe the implementation of a telerehabilitation system in patients with different diagnoses of disability living in the high southern latitude during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A system of personalized therapies guided by videoconference was implemented for patients with varying diagnoses of disability. The patients were grouped into three age groups (Minors;Adults;Older Adults) and six types of clinical diagnosis (conditions originating in the perinatal period, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the nervous system, diseases of the musculoskeletal system, and connective tissue, mental and behavioural treatments and other diagnoses). The patient's diagnosis, the type of care required, the number of sessions, and the level of satisfaction of each user were evaluated based on the telerehabilitation they received. Results: 101 patients with an average age of 31 ± 26 years participated, 52.5% were male. All of them managed to handle the minimum technologies required for telerehabilitation care. There is a degree of association between the patient's diagnosis and the age group (p&lt;.05), as well as between the diagnosis and the type of care required (p&lt;.05). After implementation, users positively evaluated distance therapy. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation can be implemented in patients with disabilities in areas of high southern latitude, respecting the different stages of the process, to ensure it is correctly delivered.","Gallardo, Asterio Andrade Cvitanic Vanja Rogosich Barría Aburto Patricio Diaz Heriberto Henriquez Cardenas Rolando Aguilar Núñez-Espinosa Cristian",Fisioterapia,,93

The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics and ouctome of ICU-acquired infections in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective single-centre, case-control study including 140 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. We evaluated the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features, and outcome of ICU-acquired infections. Fifty-seven patients (40.7%) developed a bacterial or fungal nosocomial infection during ICU stay. Infection occurred after a median of 9 days (IQR 5-11) of admission and was significantly associated with the APACHE II score (p = 0.02). There were 91 episodes of infection: primary (31%) and catheter-related (25%) bloodstream infections were the most frequent, followed by pneumonia (23%), tracheobronchitis (10%), and urinary tract infection (8%) that were produced by a wide spectrum of Gram-positive (55%) and Gram-negative bacteria (30%) as well as fungi (15%). In 60% of cases, infection was associated with septic shock and a significant increase in SOFA score. Overall ICU mortality was 36% (51/140). Infection was significantly associated with death (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.9, p = 0.015) and a longer ICU stay (p < 0.001). Bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection is a common complication of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. It usually presents as a severe form of infection, and it is associated with a high mortality and longer course of ICU stay.","Bardi, Tommaso; Pintado, Vicente; Gomez-Rojo, Maria; Escudero-Sanchez, Rosa; Azzam Lopez, Amal; Diez-Remesal, Yolanda; Martinez Castro, Nilda; Ruiz-Garbajosa, Patricia; Pestaña, David",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,93

There is paramount importance of cooperation and population engagement in reducing disease infection rates and relieving an outbreak's burden on society. The civil society's engagement may be achieved through disaster education interventions. In this cross-sectional study, a pre-post questionnaire was used to investigate the impact of a brief educational intervention on knowledge, perceived knowledge, perceived safety, and the individual resilience of the population relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. The results of the study display the benefits of the educational intervention to include a significant overall increase in all examined variables. The study also reviewed the overall trust of the public concerning the main responding authorities, as well as practices concerning protective measures for COVID-19. This study demonstrates that educational interventions, such as the brief video, provide an easily implementable design and effective means for educating and empowering the public and should, thus, be considered as a component of future outbreak responses.","Kaim, Arielle; Jaffe, Eli; Siman-Tov, Maya; Khairish, Ella; Adini, Bruria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,93
455158,"Alone in labour: fear, anxiety and the new norm",2021,"In 2019, COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, infecting billions of people and disrupting the normal lives of citizens in every country. Governments, organizations, and research institutions all over the world are dedicating vast resources to research effective strategies to fight this rapidly propagating virus. With virus testing, most countries publish the number of confirmed cases, dead cases, recovered cases, and locations routinely through various channels and forms. This important data source has enabled researchers worldwide to perform different COVID-19 scientific studies, such as modeling this virus&#x2019;s spreading patterns, developing prevention strategies, and studying the impact of COVID-19 on other aspects of society. However, one major challenge is that there is no standardized, updated, and high-quality data product that covers COVID-19 cases data internationally. This is because different countries may publish their data in unique channels, formats, and time intervals, which hinders researchers from fetching necessary COVID-19 datasets effectively, especially for fine-scale studies. Although existing solutions such as John&#x2019;s Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard and 1point3acres COVID-19 tracker are widely used, it is difficult for users to access their original dataset and customize those data to meet specific requirements in categories, data structure, and data source selection. To address this challenge, we developed a toolset using cloud-based web scraping to extract, refine, unify, and store COVID-19 cases data at multiple scales for all available countries around the world automatically. The toolset then publishes the data for public access in an effective manner, which could offer users a real time COVID-19 dynamic dataset with a global view. Two case studies are presented about how to utilize the datasets. This toolset can also be easily extended to fulfill other purposes with its open-source nature.

458537,Co-Robots as Care Robots,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is posing a serious threat to global public health. Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30 to 60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. METHOD: In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. RESULT: The limit of detection (copies/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI: 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28/34), 67.65% (23/34), and 58.82% (20/34), respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","Zhang, Yang; Dai, Chunyang; Wang, Huiyan; Gao, Yong; Li, Tuantuan; Fang, Yan; Shen, Zuojun; Chen, Lichang; Chen, Zhaowu; Ma, Xuejun; Li, Ming",Virol J,,93

The purpose of the present study was to describe non-respiratory symptoms of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Materials and Methods: All patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital, between 1 August and 30 September 2020, were included in this retrospective study. Data were extracted from medical records. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics at the initial presentation at the hospital were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 44.08 years (age range, 18-87 years) and 59.5% were male. The most common symptoms were fatigue in 60 (75.9%) patients, followed by fever (73.4%), myalgia (51.9%), cough (41.8%), anosmia (38%) and arthralgia (36.7%). The muscles of the upper back and the knee joint were the most painful anatomic region and joint, respectively. The laboratory findings on admission showed that D-dimer, CRP and procalcitonin levels were increased, without significant gender differences (p > 0.05). Chest imaging demonstrated pneumonia in 20 (25.3%) patients. Conclusions: Our results indicate that from the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 patients, musculoskeletal symptoms, such as fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia, were present in three-quarters of all patients. These findings could help elaborate updated triage and admission protocols for suspect COVID-19 patients at the hospital and Emergency Department presentation.","Vasiliadis, Angelo V; Tsatlidou, Maria; Metaxiotis, Dimitrios; Psomiadis, Charalampos; Beletsiotis, Anastasios; Arvaniti, Kostoula",Medicina (Kaunas),,93

Given documented racial disparities in other parts of the country, longitudinal convergence of COVID-19 rates around race groups warrants assessment. METHODS: County-level cases for COVID-19 were collected from the Johns Hopkins University, and racial distributions were collected from the American Community Survey. Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed for each day since COVID-19 was first reported in California, and the longitudinal distribution of each race-specific set of correlation coefficients was assessed for stationarity, linear trend and exponential trend. RESULTS: Earlier in the outbreak, the distribution of COVID-19 was most highly correlated with Asian American communities; after approximately 100 days, the distribution of COVID-19 most closely resembled that of African American communities. For every day in this dataset, the county-level distribution of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with the distribution of White American communities in California. DISCUSSION: The geospatial distribution of COVID-19 in California has increasingly resembled that of African American communities within the state. Further study should be conducted to characterise potentially disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across race groups.","Cuomo, Raphael E",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,93
460278,Ten Questions With ... Ed Margerrison,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing is encouraged to mitigate viral spreading during outbreaks. However, the association between distancing and patient-centered outcomes in Covid-19 has not been demonstrated. In the United States social distancing orders are implemented at the state level with variable timing of onset. Emergency declarations and school closures were two early statewide interventions. METHODS: To determine whether later distancing interventions were associated with higher mortality, we performed a state-level analysis in 55,146 Covid-19 non-survivors. We tested the association between timing of emergency declarations and school closures with 28-day mortality using multivariable negative binomial regression. Day 1 for each state was set to when they recorded &#8805; 10 deaths. We performed sensitivity analyses to test model assumptions. RESULTS: At time of analysis, 37 of 50 states had &#8805; 10 deaths and 28 follow-up days. Both later emergency declaration (adjusted mortality rate ratio [aMRR] 1.05 per day delay, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p=0.040) and later school closure (aMRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09, p=0.008) were associated with more deaths. When assessing all 50 states and setting day 1 to the day a state recorded its first death, delays in declaring an emergency (aMRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09, p=0.020) or closing schools (aMRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09, p<0.001) were associated with more deaths. Results were unchanged when excluding New York and New Jersey. CONCLUSIONS: Later statewide emergency declarations and school closure were associated with higher Covid-19 mortality.

Accumulating data on patients with COVID-19-associated stroke have shed light on specificities concerning clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and outcome. Such specificities include a propensity towards large vessel occlusion, multi-territory stroke, and involvement of otherwise uncommonly affected vessels. Conversely, small-vessel brain disease, cerebral venous thrombosis, and intracerebral hemorrhage appear to be less frequent. Atypical neurovascular presentations were also described, ranging from bilateral carotid artery dissection to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and vasculitis. Cases presenting with encephalopathy or encephalitis with seizures heralding stroke were particularly challenging. The pathogenesis and optimal management of ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, but emerging evidence suggest that cytokine storm-triggered coagulopathy and endotheliopathy represent possible targetable mechanisms. Some specific management issues in this population include the difficulty in identifying clinical signs of stroke in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, as well as the need for a protected pathway for brain imaging, intravenous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy, keeping in mind that ""time is brain"" also for COVID-19 patients. In this review, we discuss the novel developments and challenges for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke in patients with COVID-19, and delineate the principles for a rational approach toward precision medicine in this emerging field.","Vogrig, Alberto; Gigli, Gian Luigi; Bnà, Claudio; Morassi, Mauro",Neurosci Lett,,93

Interestingly, early imaging studies documented that pulmonary vascular thickening was specifically associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, implying a potential tropism of the virus for the pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with inflammation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, and lung coagulopathy promoting endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis. These features are strikingly similar to what is seen in pulmonary vascular diseases. Although the consequences of COVID-19 on the pulmonary circulation remain to be explored, several viruses have been previously thought to be involved in the development of pulmonary vascular diseases. Patients with preexisting pulmonary vascular diseases also appear at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The present article reviews the molecular factors shared by coronavirus infection and pulmonary vasculature defects, and the clinical relevance of pulmonary vascular alterations in the context of COVID-19.","Potus, François; Mai, Vicky; Lebret, Marius; Malenfant, Simon; Breton-Gagnon, Emilie; Lajoie, Annie C; Boucherat, Olivier; Bonnet, Sébastien; Provencher, Steeve",,,93

Clinical complication and fatality rate is much higher for patients having co-morbid issues. Compromised immune response and hyper inflammation is hall mark of pathogenesis and major cause of mortality. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is a term used to affiliate the situation of hyper inflammation and therefore use of anti-cytokine and anti-inflammatory drugs is used to take care of this situation. Looking into the clinical benefit of these anti-inflammatory drugs, many of them enter into clinical trials. However, understanding the immunopathology of COVID-19 is important otherwise, indiscriminate use of these drugs could be fetal as there exists a very fine line of difference between viral clearing cytokines and inflammatory cytokines. If any drug suppresses the viral clearing cytokines, it will worsen the situation and hence, the use of these drugs must be based on the clinical condition, viral load, co-existing disease condition and severity of the infection.","Iqubal, Ashif; Hoda, Farazul; Najmi, Abul Kalam; Haque, Syed Ehtaishamul","Drug res.

465313,"Complacency, panic, and the value of gentle rule enforcement in addressing pandemics",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic calls for effective and safe treatments. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS-CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV-229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme® (CZ-MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. The CZ-MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ-MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ-MD have been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold. METHOD OF STUDY: The ability of the CZ-MD to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E was tested using an in vitro virucidal suspension test (ASTM E1052). RESULTS: CZ-MD inactivated SARS-CoV-2 by 98.3% and HCoV-229E by 99.9%. CONCLUSION: CZ-MD mouth spray can inactivate the respiratory coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. Although the in vitro results presented cannot be directly translated into clinical efficacy, the study indicates that CZ-MD might offer a protective barrier against SARS-CoV-2 and a decreased risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Gudmundsdottir, Ágústa; Scheving, Reynir; Lindberg, Fredrik; Stefansson, Bjarki",J. med. virol,,93

Microchips preloaded with COVID-19 primers and probes for the N gene accommodate 1.2-µL reaction volumes, lowering the required reagents by 10-fold compared with tube-based real-time PCR. We validated our assay using contrived reference samples and 21 clinical samples from patients in Canada, determining a limit of detection of 1 copy per reaction. The microchip real-time PCR provides a significantly lower resource alternative to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved real-time RT-PCR assays with comparable sensitivity, showing 100% positive and negative predictive agreement of clinical samples.","Cojocaru, Razvan; Yaseen, Iqra; Unrau, Peter J; Lowe, Christopher F; Ritchie, Gordon; Romney, Marc G; Sin, Don D; Gill, Sikander; Slyadnev, Maxim",J Mol Diagn,,93

INTRODUCTION: The increase of chronic diseases and the associated multimorbidity create challenges for health care resources and services. Considering their role and skill set, nurses are in a position to lead the transformation of health care for patients with chronic illness. Several nurse-led care management models in the community have been identified in the literature, but little is known about these models in hospital settings. It is necessary to map the existing nurse-led care management models and describe their characteristics, differences, and similarities, and the implications for patients with multimorbidity in a hospital environment. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider studies focusing on nurse-led care management models for adult patients with multimorbidity in hospital settings, including readmissions, discharges, and visits to emergency services. METHODS: The search will include Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Nursing and Allied Health Collection, and gray literature through OpenGrey. This review will be restricted to studies published in English. A three-step search strategy will be used, and the articles identified in the databases will be organized and the duplicates removed. The titles and abstracts will be analyzed by two independent reviewers. Full texts will be imported into a bibliographic reference management system. The findings will be presented in tables and descriptive summary.","Gonçalves, Isabel; Mendes, Diana Arvelos; Caldeira, Sílvia; Nunes, Elisabete Maria Garcia Teles",JBI Evid Synth,,93
469477,Estimating direct and spill-over impacts of political elections on COVID-19 transmission using synthetic control methods,2021,"Introduction: While most cases of COVID-19 recover completely within 2-6 weeks, some may develop complications including residual lung fibrosis. We describe an interesting case of late-onset post-COVID fibrosis that presented more than 4 months after the initial infection. Case: A 52-year-old male, an operating room technician by profession tested positive for COVID-19 after coming in contact with an infected patient early in May 2020. He was asymptomatic, vitally stable with no comorbidities, and was given a course of oral hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, and multivitamins. He remained asymptomatic for a week in the isolation ward with all investigations within normal range and was discharged home. HRCT thorax on the first follow-up at 2 weeks was normal and the patient resumed work as usual for the next 3 months. In mid-September, the patient presented to the outpatient clinic with a sudden onset of dyspnea on exertion that was progressive for 5 days with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. He was unable to perform a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Spirometry was suggestive of moderate restriction and reduced DLCO. HRCT thorax at this point revealed bilateral extensive reticular opacities with few ground-glass opacities (GGO's) in all lobes bilaterally with a basal predominance. These findings were suggestive of late-onset of residual fibrosis more than 4 months after the initial infection. RT-PCR for COVID-19 was negative and ruled out re-infection. The patient was unwilling for admission and was started on oral pirfenidone, a tapering dose of oral prednisolone, and was advised home oxygen therapy. He did not take home oxygen but was compliant with oral steroids and antifibrotic. In the 7th-month of post-COVID follow-up, HRCT showed significant improvement as compared to the previous scan with reduced reticular opacities and minimal GGO's. The patient was symptomatically better with a saturation of 98% on room air and could perform 6MWT satisfactorily. Spirometry showed mild restriction and improvement in FVC. The antifibrotic dose was stepped up and the patient was referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Discussion Despite an uncertain natural history of post-COVID sequelae, it has been observed that post-COVID fibrosis can develop as early as 3 weeks after the initial infection. This case was unique in its late presentation during the second post-COVID follow up at 4 months with normal imaging and clinical parameters during the first follow up. Hence a meticulous long-term follow-up should be done for all patients.","Modi, P.; Tuppekar, B.; Nair, G.; Uppe, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,93

We determined the contribution of each of these conditions to diffusion alterations. METHODS: We studied six samples (N = 365 participants) covering the spectrum of AD and SVD, including genetically defined samples. We calculated diffusion measures from DTI and free water imaging. Simple linear, multivariable random forest, and voxel-based regressions were used to evaluate associations between AD biomarkers (amyloid beta, tau), SVD imaging markers, and diffusion measures. RESULTS: SVD markers were strongly associated with diffusion measures and showed a higher contribution than AD biomarkers in multivariable analysis across all memory clinic samples. Voxel-wise analyses between tau and diffusion measures were not significant. DISCUSSION: In memory clinic patients, the effect of SVD on diffusion alterations largely exceeds the effect of AD, supporting the value of diffusion measures as markers of SVD.","Finsterwalder, Sofia; Vlegels, Naomi; Gesierich, Benno; Araque Caballero, Miguel Á; Weaver, Nick A; Franzmeier, Nicolai; Georgakis, Marios K; Konieczny, Marek J; Koek, Huiberdina L; Karch, Celeste M; Graff-Radford, Neill R; Salloway, Stephen; Oh, Hwamee; Allegri, Ricardo F; Chhatwal, Jasmeer P; Jessen, Frank; Düzel, Emrah; Dobisch, Laura; Metzger, Coraline; Peters, Oliver; Incesoy, Enise I; Priller, Josef; Spruth, Eike J; Schneider, Anja; Fließbach, Klaus; Buerger, Katharina; Janowitz, Daniel; Teipel, Stefan J; Kilimann, Ingo; Laske, Christoph; Buchmann, Martina; Heneka, Michael T; Brosseron, Frederic; Spottke, Annika; Roy, Nina; Ertl-Wagner, Birgit; Scheffler, Klaus; Seo, Sang Won; Kim, Yeshin; Na, Duk L; Kim, Hee Jin; Jang, Hyemin; Ewers, Michael; Levin, Johannes; Schmidt, Reinhold; Pasternak, Ofer; Dichgans, Martin; Biessels, Geert Jan; Duering, Marco",Alzheimers dememt,,93
475998,Testing vaccines in the time of Covid: The changing landscape,2021,"The lack of tools to reliably detect RanBP9 in vivo has significantly hampered progress in understanding the biological functions of this scaffold protein. We report here the generation of a novel mouse strain, RanBP9-TT, in which the endogenous protein is fused with a double (V5-HA) epitope tag at the C-terminus. We show that the double tag does not interfere with the essential functions of RanBP9. In contrast to RanBP9 constitutive knock-out animals, RanBP9-TT mice are viable, fertile and do not show any obvious phenotype. The V5-HA tag allows unequivocal detection of RanBP9 both by IHC and WB. Importantly, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses reveal that the tagged protein pulls down known interactors of wild type RanBP9. Thanks to the increased detection power, we are also unveiling a previously unknown interaction with Nucleolin, a protein proposed as an ideal target for cancer treatment. In summary, we report the generation of a new mouse line in which RanBP9 expression and interactions can be reliably studied by the use of commercially available &#945;tag antibodies. The use of this line will help to overcome some of the existing limitations in the study of RanBP9 and potentially unveil unknown functions of this protein in vivo such as those linked to Nucleolin.","Soliman, Shimaa H A; Stark, Aaron E; Gardner, Miranda L; Harshman, Sean W; Breece, Chelssie C; Amari, Foued; Orlacchio, Arturo; Chen, Min; Tessari, Anna; Martin, Jennifer A; Visone, Rosa; Freitas, Michael A; La Perle, Krista M D; Palmieri, Dario; Coppola, Vincenzo",Sci Rep,,93

The virus seems to has propensity to infect older male individuals with underlying disease. The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Not only, the disease seems to be rare and have a milder course in pediatric age but also respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and death are extremely rare. Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course. However, there is a lack of data regarding the effects of ""Coronavirus disease-2019"" on pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, there are three controversial circumstances that patients with rheumatic diseases are believed to be more likely to have viral infections like ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"", on the other hand, antirheumatic drugs may have a protective and therapeutic role in Coronavirus disease-2019 and children are more unlikely to have serious disease course. Therefore, we aimed to have a contributor role for explaining this conundrum and present a bird's eye view regarding this equivocal issue in this review.","Haslak, Fatih; Yildiz, Mehmet; Adrovic, Amra; Barut, Kenan; Kasapçopur, Özgür",Balkan Med J,,93
478779,Could vets manage Covid-19 better?,2020,"Eccentric strength training represents a robust rehabilitation and therapy capability, which is inherently oxygen efficient. The oxygen efficient properties of eccentric training are uniquely suited for elderly people with impaired cardiopulmonary capacity. Furthermore, this technique of eccentric training may be extended to people with reduced cardiopulmonary capacity due to post-symptoms from COVID-19. Synthesis of conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems with eccentric strength training enables the evolution of Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training. The conformal properties of the wearable and wireless inertial sensor, such as the BioStamp nPoint, feature the ability to flexibly mount by adhesive to effectively any segment of the human anatomy, such as about the forearm near the wrist for quantifying a biceps curl. Using Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training with a conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor, such as the BioStamp nPoint, the eccentric phase can be emphasized by visualized feedback of the associated gyroscope signal with a predefined threshold. Machine learning classification, such as a support vector machine, achieves considerable classification accuracy to distinguish between standard strength training and eccentric strength training for a biceps curl through a preliminary application of Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training with a conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor.","LeMoyne, R.; Mastroianni, T.; Ieee,",2020 International Conference on E-Health and Bioengineering,,93

In the context of higher education, a growing number of schools and universities collect data on their students with the purpose of assessing or predicting behaviors and academic performance, and the COVID-19-induced move to online education dramatically increases what can be accumulated in this way, raising concerns about students' privacy. We focus on academic performance and ask whether predictive performance for a given dataset can be achieved with less privacy-invasive, but more task-specific, data. We draw on a unique dataset on a large student population containing both highly detailed measures of behavior and personality and high-quality third-party reported individual-level administrative data. We find that models estimated using the big behavioral data are indeed able to accurately predict academic performance out of sample. However, models using only low-dimensional and arguably less privacy-invasive administrative data perform considerably better and, importantly, do not improve when we add the high-resolution, privacy-invasive behavioral data. We argue that combining big behavioral data with ""ground truth"" administrative registry data can ideally allow the identification of privacy-preserving task-specific features that can be employed instead of current indiscriminate troves of behavioral data, with better privacy and better prediction resulting.","Bjerre-Nielsen, Andreas; Kassarnig, Valentin; Lassen, David Dreyer; Lehmann, Sune",Proc.

In Japan, remdesivir was approved in May 2020 for COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In February 2021, a vaccine against COVID-19 was approved. These two approvals were made using the Special Approval for Emergency system in Japan. This Japanese system was started in 2010, and has been used to approve four drugs to date, including remdesivir and the COVID-19 vaccine. This paper discusses future challenges for Japan's Special Approval for Emergency system and organizes what can be learned from experiences to date. As a result, I would like to point out the following issues. (1) Special Approval for Emergency is a system for approving drugs approved overseas, not a system for approving drugs originally developed in Japan. A system to approve drugs that have not been approved in foreign countries needs to be considered. (2) In the Special Approval for Emergency system, it is necessary to ensure that post-marketing activities are conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan and the conditions of approval, to disclose the results in a timely and speedy manner, and to judge the appropriateness of continued approval based on the results of post-marketing activities.","Maeda, Hideki",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,93
480812,These Stories Must Be Told: Preliminary Observations by a Black Scholar Practitioner on Silences in the Archive,2020,"Naturalistic driving studies often make use of cameras to monitor driver behavior. To analyze the resulting video images, human annotation is often adopted. These annotations then serve as the 'gold standard' to train and evaluate automated computer vision algorithms, even though it is uncertain how accurate human annotation is. In this study, we provide a first evaluation of glance direction annotation by comparing instructed, actual glance direction of truck drivers with annotated direction. Findings indicate that while for some locations high annotation accuracy is achieved, for most locations accuracy is well below 50%. Higher accuracy can be obtained by clustering these locations, but this also leads to reduced detail of the annotation, suggesting that decisions to use clustering should take into account the purpose of the annotation. The data also show that high agreement between annotators does not guarantee high accuracy. We argue that the accuracy of annotation needs to be verified experimentally more often.","Jansen, Reinier J; van der Kint, Sander T; Hermens, Frouke",,,93

481877,Capital and Climate in Times of Coronavirus: Reply to Critics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare, life-threatening complication of Kawasaki disease (KD). Early recognition and treatment of MAS are very important, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish MAS from a severe form of KD. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms ""macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)"" and ""Kawasaki disease"". RESULTS: KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS: The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed. Therapeutically, however, there is a possibility of over-treatment of MAS in patients with KD.","Han, Seung Beom; Lee, Soo-Young",World j. pediatr,,93

482698,Looking back and looking ahead: Applying organisational behaviour to explain the changing face of work,2020,"With increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 patients to be taken care of by the health system, more and more health workers become affected by the disease. It has been reported that right from the beginning of the outbreak in Lombardy up to 20% of the doctors and nurses became infected. Under these circumstances, the regular operation of health institutions already suffering from a shortage of staff becomes difficult. This has led to complete or partial shutdowns of hospitals, either due to a lack of uninfected personnel or because of uncontrollable chains of infection endangering patients. In one of the largest university perinatal center in Bavaria with more than 3000 births per year, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in March 2020, affecting 36 staff members, including doctors, nurses, and midwives. Here, we describe the outbreak and present the measures contributing to the successful containment of the outbreak within three weeks. At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre-defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them. Overall, only a bundle of measures is needed to contain such an outbreak.","Kabesch, Michael; Roth, Samra; Brandstetter, Susanne; Häusler, Sebastian; Juraschko, Eva; Weigl, Marco; Wellmann, Sven; Lang, Thomas; Schmidt, Barbara; Salzberger, Bernd; Ambrosch, Andreas",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,93

The genetic architecture of Lp(a) remains incompletely understood, as well as its independence of LDL cholesterol in its association to CAD. We investigated the genetic determinants of Lp(a) concentrations in a large prospective multiethnic cohort. We tested the association for potential causality between genetically determined higher Lp(a) concentrations and CAD using a multivariable Mendelian randomization strategy. Approach and Results: We studied 371 212 participants of the UK Biobank with available Lp(a) and genome-wide genetic data. Genome-wide association analyses confirmed 2 known and identified 37 novel loci (P<5×10-8) associated with Lp(a). Testing these loci as instrumental variables in an independent cohort with 60 801 cases and 123 504 controls, each SD genetically elevated Lp(a) conferred a 1.30 ([95% CI, 1.20-1.41] P=5.53×10-11) higher odds of CAD. Importantly, this association was independent of LDL cholesterol. Genetic fine-mapping in the LPA gene region identified 15 potential causal variants. This included a rare missense variant (rs41267813[A]) associated with lower Lp(a) concentration. We observed a strong interaction between rs41267813 and rs10455872 on Lp(a) concentrations, indicating a protective effect of rs41267813(A). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an LDL cholesterol-independent causal link between Lp(a) and CAD. A rare missense variant in the LPA gene locus appears to be protective in people with the Lp(a) increasing variant of rs10455872. In the search for therapeutic targets of Lp(a), future work should focus on understanding the functional consequences of this missense variant.","Said, M Abdullah; Yeung, Ming Wai; van de Vegte, Yordi J; Benjamins, Jan Walter; Dullaart, Robin P F; Ruotsalainen, Sanni; Ripatti, Samuli; Natarajan, Pradeep; Juarez-Orozco, Luis Eduardo; Verweij, Niek; van der Harst, P",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,,93

METHOD: A total of 192 participants aged 8-16 years who met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD were included in the study. Children scoring higher than predetermined cut-off point in self-rating questionnaires for problematic mobile phone use (SQPMPU) or Young's internet addiction test (IAT), were defined as ADHD with problematic digital media use (PDMU), otherwise were defined as ADHD without PDMU. The differences between the two groups in ADHD symptoms, EF, anxiety and depression, stress from life events, learning motivation and family environment were compared respectively. RESULTS: When compared with ADHD group without PDMU, the group with PDMU showed significant worse symptoms of inattention, oppositional defiant, behavior and emotional problems by Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP), more self-reported anxiety by screening child anxiety-related emotional disorders (SCARED) and depression by depression self-rating scale for children (DSRSC), more severe EF deficits by behavior rating scale of executive function (BRIEF), more stress from life events by adolescent self-rating life events checklist (ASLEC), lower learning motivation by students learning motivation scale (SLMS), and more impairment on cohesion by Chinese version of family environment scale (FES-CV). The ADHD with PDMU group spent significantly more time on both video game and social media with significantly less time spend on physical exercise as compared to the ADHD without PDMU group. CONCLUSION: The ADHD children with PDMU suffered from more severe core symptoms, negative emotions, EF deficits, damage on family environment, pressure from life events, and a lower motivation to learn. Supervision of digital media usage, especially video game and social media, along with increased physical exercise, is essential to the management of core symptoms and associated problems encountered with ADHD.","Shuai, Lan; He, Shan; Zheng, Hong; Wang, Zhouye; Qiu, Meihui; Xia, Weiping; Cao, Xuan; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Jinsong",Global Health,,93
484569,Nowcasting in a Pandemic using Non-Parametric Mixed Frequency VARs,2020-08-28,"INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wearing surgical face masks has become mandatory for healthcare staff in many countries when interacting with patients. Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person's ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. METHODS: During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days. After completion of their visit, 226 patients were interviewed anonymously in a cross-sectional study design using a questionnaire in which they rated the following three items: friendliness of staff, medical quality of treatment, and how well they felt taken care of during treatment in our Department. RESULTS: On days, on which staff wore photos, mean scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher than on non-photo days (p = 0.013; mean ± standard deviation = 92.8 ± 11.3 vs. 91.0 ± 12.6; median (range) = 97 (98) vs. 96 (76)). When analyzed separately, the increased scores were only significant for the item friendliness of staff (p = 0.009; mean ± standard deviation = 95.8 ± 6.3 vs. 92.2 ± 11.5; median (range) = 98 (39) vs. 97 (54)). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the use of portrait photos with smiling faces has a positive effect on how patients perceive healthcare staff.","Wiesmann, Martin; Franz, Christiane; Sichtermann, Thorsten; Minkenberg, Jan; Mathern, Nathalie; Stockero, Andrea; Iordanishvili, Elene; Freiherr, Jessica; Hodson, Julian; Habel, Ute; Nikoubashman, Omid",PLoS One,,93

Here we study the ability of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent and vaccine sera to neutralize B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, complement this with structural analyses of Fab/receptor binding domain (RBD) complexes, and map the antigenic space of current variants. Neutralization of both viruses is reduced compared with ancestral Wuhan-related strains, but there is no evidence of widespread antibody escape as seen with B.1.351. However, B.1.351 and P.1 sera showed markedly more reduction in neutralization of B.1.617.2, suggesting that individuals infected previously by these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B.1.617.2.

487514,Principles for the socially responsible use of conservation monitoring technology and data,2021,"Lockdown seems the most effective way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as no vaccine is currently available in the market to cure it. Thus, India has enforced nation-wide lockdown from 25 thMarch to lower the spread of this contagious virus and associated illness. This study aims to quantify the changes in pollution levels as well as meteorology during the 6-weeks COVID-19 lockdown over 17 cities of India for 5 major criteria pollutants using publicly available air quality data. Hourly averaged data is accessed from the air quality monitoring stations during the lockdown and immediate pre-lockdown periods and also corresponding data from the previous year (2019). During the lockdown, PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2,and CO reduced significantly with relatively small changes in meteorological conditions compared to the pre-lockdown period. The highest decline is observed over Ahmedabad (68%), Delhi (71%), Bangalore (87%), and Nagpur (63%) for PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2, and CO, respectively. The Northern region shows the highest decline for all the pollutants with most days below NAAQS during lockdown—86%, 68%, and 100% compared to 18%, 0%, and 38% in 2019 for PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2, respectively. The smaller cities Dewas and Jorapokhar show lesser improvement with only 3% and 16% improvement in days under NAAQS for PM 2.5. SO 2is the least affected pollutant with little improvement. The major decline is observed during 7–10 am and 7–10 pm hours of the day for PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2, and CO with more than 40% reduction. The meteorological changes are very small and heterogeneous over India showing a similar extent of changes compared to the previous year but the pollution levels have reduced significantly. Thus, the sharp decline in pollutant concentration during the ~6 weeks period national lockdown can be attributed to the reduced economic and transport activities.","Navinya, Chimurkar; Patidar, Girish; Phuleria, Harish C.",Aerosol Air Qual.

487817,DGP: Wann und wie beatmen bei COVID-19-Pneumonie?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Before the advent of an effective vaccine, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing, social distancing and lockdown have been the primary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is high population wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. OBJECTIVE: Here we analyze online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantify the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization and leading subtopics, to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies. METHODS: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations. RESULTS: We find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that overall COVID-19 coverage is not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (e.g. social media, government pages and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload.

As expected, studies highlighted the great susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 and more severe complications, leading oncologists to deeply rethink patient cancer care. This review is dedicated to the optimization of care pathways and therapeutics in cancer patients during the pandemic and aims to discuss successive issues. First we focused on the international guidelines proposing adjustments and alternative options to cancer care in order to limit hospital admission and cytopenic treatment in cancer patients, most of whom are immunocompromised. In addition cancer patients are prone to polypharmacy, enhancing the risk of drug-related problems as adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Due to increased risk in case of COVID-19, we reported a comprehensive review of all the drug-related problems between COVID-19 and antineoplastics. Moreover, in the absence of approved drug against COVID-19, infected patients may be included in clinical trials evaluating new drugs with a lack of knowledge, particularly in cancer patients. Focusing on the several experimental drugs currently being evaluated, we set up an original data board helping oncologists and pharmacists to identify promptly drug-related problems between antineoplastics and experimental drugs. Finally additional and concrete recommendations are provided, supporting oncologists and pharmacists in their efforts to manage cancer patients and to optimize their treatments in this new era related to COVID-19.","Slimano, Florian; Baudouin, Amandine; Zerbit, Jérémie; Toulemonde-Deldicque, Anne; Thomas-Schoemann, Audrey; Chevrier, Régine; Daouphars, Mikaël; Madelaine, Isabelle; Pourroy, Bertrand; Tournamille, Jean-François; Astier, Alain; Ranchon, Florence; Cazin, Jean-Louis; Bardin, Christophe; Rioufol, Catherine",Cancer Treat Rev,,93

This article presents a chest X-ray image-based automated COVID-19 detection system which can be employed with the RT-PCR test to improve the diagnosis rate. In the proposed approach, the textural features are extracted from the chest X-ray images and local binary pattern (LBP) based images. Further, the image-based and LBP image-based features are jointly investigated. Thereafter, highly discriminatory features are provided to the classifier for developing an automated model for COVID-19 identification. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated over 2905 chest X-ray images of normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 infected persons on various class combinations to analyze the robustness. The developed method achieves 97.97% accuracy (acc) and 99.88% sensitivity (sen) for classifying COVID-19 X-ray images against pneumonia infected and normal person's X-ray images. It attains 98.91% acc and 99.33% sen for COVID-19 X-ray against the normal X-ray classification.

492834,How should we conduct pandemic vaccination?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Standard care in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia complicated by severe dyspnea and respiratory failure, consists of symptom reduction, ultimately supported by mechanical ventilation. Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2, a prominent feature of COVID-19, show several similar symptoms to Critical Asthma Syndrome (CAS) patients, such as pulmonary edema, mucus plugging of distal airways, decreased tissue oxygenation, (emergent) exhaustion due to severe dyspnea and respiratory failure. Prior application of elective phosphodiesterase (PDE)3-inhibitors milrinone and enoximone in patients with CAS yielded rapid symptomatic relief and reverted the need for mechanical ventilation, due to their bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that enoximone may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and prominent CAS-features. METHODS: In this case report enoximone was administered to four consecutive patients (1 M; 3 F; 46-70 y) with emergent respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinical outcome was compared with three controls who received standard care only. RESULTS: After an intravenous bolus of enoximone 20 mg followed by 10 mg/h via perfusor, a rapid symptomatic relief was observed: two out of four patients recovered within a few hours, the other two (with comorbid COPD GOLD II/III) responded within 24-36 h. Compared to the controls, in the enoximone-treated patients respiratory failure and further COVID-19-related deterioration was reverted and mechanical ventilation was prevented, leading to reduced hospital/ICU time. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary observations suggest that early intervention with the selective PDE3-inhibitor enoximone may help to revert respiratory failure as well as avert mechanical ventilation, and reduces ICU/hospital time in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Our findings warrant further research on the therapeutic potential of PDE3-inhibition, alone or in combination with other anti-COVID-19 strategies.","Beute, Jan; Boermans, Pieter; Benraad, Bart; Telman, Jan; Diamant, Zuzana; KleinJan, Alex",Exp Lung Res,,93

Since these problems are infinite-dimensional and often do not have a known analytical solution, one has to resort to numerical methods to compute an approximate solution. This paper uses a unifying notation to outline some of the techniques used in the transcription step of simultaneous direct methods (which discretize-then-optimize) for solving continuous-time dynamic optimization problems. We focus on collocation, integrated residual and Runge-Kutta schemes. These transcription methods are then applied to a simulation case study to answer a question that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely: If there are not enough ventilators, is it possible to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator? The results suggest that it is possible, in principle, to estimate individual patient parameters sufficiently accurately, using a relatively small number of flow rate measurements, without needing to disconnect a patient from the system or needing more than one flow rate sensor. We also show that it is possible to ensure that two different patients can indeed receive their desired tidal volume, by modifying the resistance experienced by the air flow to each patient and controlling the ventilator pressure.","Kerrigan, Eric C.; Nie, Yuanbo; Faqir, Omar; Kennedy, Caroline H.; Niederer, Steven A.; Solis-Lemus, Jose A.; Vincent, Peter; Williams, Steven E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11570v1.pdf,93

495132,Multi-Stage Change Point Detection with Copula Conditional Distribution with PCA and Functional PCA,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, laboratory confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is nationally notifiable. However, reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number of cases because detection and reporting are incomplete and can vary by disease severity, geography, and over time. METHODS: To estimate the cumulative incidence SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic illnesses, and hospitalizations, we adapted a simple probabilistic multiplier model. Laboratory-confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted for sources of under-detection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient settings and assay sensitivity. RESULTS: We estimated that through the end of September, 1 of every 2.5 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 2.0-3.1) hospitalized infections and 1 of every 7.1 (95% UI: 5.8-9.0) non-hospitalized illnesses may have been nationally reported. Applying these multipliers to reported SARS-CoV-2 cases along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews, we estimate that 2.4 million hospitalizations, 44.8 million symptomatic illnesses, and 52.9 million total infections may have occurred in the U.S. population from February 27-September 30, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary estimates help demonstrate the societal and healthcare burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help inform resource allocation and mitigation planning.","Reese, Heather; Iuliano, A Danielle; Patel, Neha N; Garg, Shikha; Kim, Lindsay; Silk, Benjamin J; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia; Reed, Carrie",Clin Infect Dis,,93

Antibody levels against endemic hCoVs start to rise at a very early age, reaching to overall 100% seroprevalence. No difference in the antibody levels was detected for OC43 but the magnitude of 229E-specific antibodies was significantly higher in the sera of children. OC43 and 229E hCoV antibody levels of children correlated significantly with each other and with the level of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas these correlations completely lacked in adults. Although none of the sera showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the higher overall hCoV cross-reactivity observed in children might, at least partially, contribute in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population.","Tamminen, Kirsi; Salminen, Marjo; Blazevic, Vesna",Clin Immunol,,93

By contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, which cause congenital infections, are highly expressed by placental cell types. These data show that the placenta minimally expresses the canonical cell-entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2.","Pique-Regi, Roger; Romero, Roberto; Tarca, Adi L; Luca, Francesca; Xu, Yi; Alazizi, Adnan; Leng, Yaozhu; Hsu, Chaur-Dong; Gomez-Lopez, Nardhy",eLife (Cambridge),,93
497210,From the Editor's Desk,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly since its outbreak in December 2019.Understanding its epidemiological characteristics, especially cutting off transmission routes, is crucial to controlling the spread of the disease. In the study of transmission pathway, the issue of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through ocular surface tissue has also aroused concerns, but there are still no clinically confirmed cases and laboratory evidence of its infection through ocular surface tissue. New research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same genus as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and that it enters cells in the same way as SARS-CoV. This paper reviews the research on SARS-CoV to investigate the possible mechanism of eye transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Niu, Fu-Lai; Ku, Na-Na; Sun, Yi",Intern. Eye Sci.,,93

SARS-CoV-2 infects much more people, especially the elder population, around the world than other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is challenging current global public health system. Beyond the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, microbial coinfection plays an important role in the occurrence and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection by raising the difficulties of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of COVID-19, and even increasing the disease symptom and mortality. We summarize the coinfection of virus, bacteria and fungi with SARS-CoV-2, their effects on COVID-19, the reasons of coinfection, and the diagnosis to emphasize the importance of microbial coinfection in COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Microbial coinfection is a nonnegligible factor in COVID-19. â¢ Microbial coinfection exacerbates the processes of the occurrence, development and prognosis of COVID-19, and the difficulties of clinical diagnosis and treatment. â¢ Different virus, bacteria, and fungi contributed to the coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Xi; Liao, Binyou; Cheng, Lei; Peng, Xian; Xu, Xin; Li, Yuqing; Hu, Tao; Li, Jiyao; Zhou, Xuedong; Ren, Biao",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,93
500190,3D printing technology and internet of things prototyping in family practice: building pulse oximeters during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Italy was the first European country to experience the impact of COVID-19. In order to deal with the health emergency, in early March 2020, the Italian government enforced strict lockdown measures. The different Italian police forces, the Polizia di Stato, Carabinieri and city police forces (Polizia Municipale), patrolled the streets, ensuring that people stayed at home and non-essential shops remained closed. These police forces received unprecedented support from the public in enforcing lockdown. People were active in their neighbourhoods, taking pictures of alleged violators and reporting them to the police, as well as posting pictures of those violating the rules on social networks. Local administrators encouraged citizens to report lockdown violations and in the case of Rome, introduced an online reporting system. This article focuses on the policing of lockdown in Italy. The article develops the argument that public attitudes, defined as policing from below, combined with policing from above by local administrators, produced a populist policing of the lockdown. Qualitative methodology is used to discuss interviews with police officers and analyse newspaper articles. Populist political forces are hegemonising in Italy, relying on the feelings of insecurity that the virus has embittered. Populist hegemony strongly influenced the policing of problems related to COVID. The lack of community policing or plural policing models within the organisation of Italian police forces, which remain a combination of continental and colonial models, has been decisive in the development of populist policing. The consequence of this is a type of ?policing on demand?, with the public providing the police with intelligence and demanding enforcement.","Scalia, Vincenzo",International Journal of Police Science &amp; Management,,93

Reflections on methods and process from exploratory research in West and East Africa,2020,"Urban air quality is a growing concern due a range of social, economic, and health impacts. Since the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic began in 2020, governments have produced a range of non-medical interventions (NMIs) (e.g. lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, mask mandates) to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A co-benefit of NMI implementation has been the measurable improvement in air quality in cities around the world. Using the lockdown policy of the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, we traced the changing emissions patterns produced under the pandemic in a mid-sized, high-altitude city to isolate the effects of human behavior on air pollution. We tracked air pollution over time periods reflecting the Pre-Lockdown, Lockdown, and Reopening stages, using high quality, research grade sensors in both commercial and residential areas to better understand how each setting may be uniquely impacted by pollution downturn events. Based on this approach, we found the commercial area of the city showed a greater decrease in air pollution than residential areas during the lockdown period, while both areas experienced a similar rebound post lockdown. The easing period following the lockdown did not lead to an immediate rebound in human activity and the air pollution increase associated with reopening, took place nearly two months after the lockdown period ended. We hypothesize that differences in heating needs, travel demands, and commercial activity, are responsible for the corresponding observed changes in the spatial distribution of pollutants over the study period. This research has implications for climate policy, low-carbon energy transitions, and may even impact local policy due to changing patterns in human exposure that could lead to important public health outcomes, if left unaddressed.","Mendoza, Daniel L; Benney, Tabitha M; Bares, Ryan; Crosman, Erik T",Environ Res,,93

501538,Guest Editor's Note,2020,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its metabolites play an important role in homeostasis of body, especially the cardiovascular system. In this study, we discuss the imbalance of multiple systems during the infection and the importance of therapeutic choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of cardiac and anti-coagulant therapies in COVID-19 patients. The crosstalk between angiotensin, kinin-kallikrein system, as well as inflammatory and coagulation systems plays an essential role in COVID-19. Cardiac complications and coagulopathies imply the crosstalks between the mentioned systems. We believe that the blockage of bradykinin can be a good option in the management of COVID-19 and CVD in patients and that supportive treatment of respiratory and cardiologic complications is needed in COVID-19 patients. Ninety-one percent of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant, which increases the risk of thrombosis and prolonged aPTT. Therefore, the question that is posed at this juncture is whether it is safe to use the prophylactic dose of heparin particularly in those with elevated D-dimer levels. It should be noted that timing is of high importance in anti-coagulant therapy; therefore, we should consider the level of D-dimer, fibrinogen, drug-drug interactions, and risk factors during thromboprophylaxis administration. Fibrinogen is an independent predictor of resistance to heparin and should be considered before thromboprophylaxis. Alteplase and Futhan might be a good choice to assess the condition of heparin resistance. Finally, the treatment option, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant therapy are critical decisions in COVID-19 patients.","Haybar, Habib; Maniati, Mahmood; Saki, Najmaldin; Zayeri, Zeinab Deris",Mol Biol Rep,,93
501741,A simulation study to compare 210Pb dating data analyses,2020-12-12,"Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic with a daily increasing number of affected individuals and a relatively high mortality rate. COVID-19 patients that develop cardiac injury are at increased risk of a worse clinical course with higher rates of mortality. Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that a system-wide inflammatory response and a cytokine storm mediated type syndrome plays a crucial role in disease progression. This systematic review investigates the possible role of hyperinflammation in inducing cardiac injury as one of the severe complications of COVID-19. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases to identify relevant clinical studies that investigated cardiovascular injury manifestations and reported inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Only 29 studies met our inclusion criteria and the majority of these studies demonstrated significantly elevated inflammatory and cardiac blood markers. It was evident that underlying cardiovascular diseases may increase the risk of developing cardiac injury. However, many COVID-19 patients included in this review, developed different types of cardiac injury without having any underlying cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, many of these patients were either children or adolescents. Therefore, age and comorbidities may not always be the two main risk factors that dictate the severity and outcome of COVID-19. Further investigations are required to understand the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity as an urgent requirement to develop the appropriate treatment and prevention strategies. These strategies may specifically target hyperinflammation as a suspected driving factor for some of the severe complications of COVID-19.","Saed Aldien, Arwa; Ganesan, Gowrii S; Wahbeh, Farah; Al-Nassr, Noor; Altarawneh, Heba; Al Theyab, Lolwa; Saed Aldien, Summia; Tomerak, Sara; Naveed, Hiba; Elshazly, Mohamed B; Zakaria, Dalia",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,93

504524,Art in the time of corona: A thematic analysis,2021,"AimsThe South London and Maudsley High Support Rehabilitation Team supports a cohort of 120 long-term rehabilitation patients in the densely populated London borough of Southwark.COVID-19 has a high transmission rate and is more lethal amongst the elderly, ethnic minorities and those with comorbidities.For these reasons, COVID-19 poses a particular challenge to our patients. Most have significant comorbidities, live communally, engage infrequently with primary care and take high-risk medications like clozapine. Many are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.During the Spring coronavirus wave, we found that unwell patients or their carers would contact our service for advice ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services.In response we designed a standard operating procedure to guide our response to possible cases. This aimed to ensure our advice and management for patients drew upon the latest emerging evidence.We audited our work and the burden of disease within our service until November 2020.MethodAt a team level, we introduced same-day remote assessments structured around a standard operating procedure incorporating the latest primary care and national guidelines.At a trust level, treatment guidelines were amended permitting consultant discretion when deciding whether an urgent blood count was required for those unwell on clozapine, and routine blood count monitoring was extended to 3 months for eligible patientsResultBy November 2020 we had only one confirmed case of COVID-19 on our caseload. This patient required ITU and recovered. Seven patients were judged ‘suspected’ to have suffered COVID-19 and eight were possible cases. One supported living accommodation had a possible outbreak.ConclusionWe are surprised to have had just one confirmed case of COVID-19, despite the vulnerability of our cohort. The attentiveness of our patients and their carers to government guidelines will have contributed to this figure. They have shown remarkable resilience.This pandemic has prompted trust-wide changes to clozapine monitoring and perhaps a permanently less intensive monitoring regime for some patients.That our patients contacted our team ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services may reflect the close trust they place in us to support them through difficulty. It is fitting for a service aiming to provide holistic care that our scope should have expanded in this way during the pandemic. Community rehabilitation services are well placed to act as first responders.","Cave, Jeremy Crews Matthieu",BJPsych Open,,93
504814,Analysis of Users Reaction around Impeachment in Peru using Twitter,2020-10-10,"Purpose: To assess visual outcomes and patient satisfaction for senior resident-performed immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS) during the COVID-19 pandemic, when minimizing healthcare-related exposures for patients and providers are paramount. Methods: This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results: Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their experience (P = 0.701). Five of six senior residents responded that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS. Conclusion: This early experience suggests that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits. Residency programs should consider offering senior resident-performed ISBCS to select patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Tiffany A; Chen, Stephanie P; Ahmad, Tessnim R; Pasricha, Neel D; Parikh, Neeti; Ramanathan, Saras",Indian J Ophthalmol,,93

Equally important, we wish to correct several important misunderstandings that were made by Kruse and Beitzke (2020) on behalf of the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) that possibly contributed to their concerns about the validity of our data, toxicological assessment and conclusions regarding regulatory status of cannabidiol (CBD) products. First and foremost, our study did only assess the risk of psychotropic &#916; 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without inclusion of non-psychotropic &#916; 9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Secondly, as this article will discuss in more detail, there is ample evidence for side effects of CBD products, not only in paediatric patients, but also in adult users of over-the-counter CBD products (including inadvertent ""high"" effects). Thirdly, the exposure and risk assessment was conducted using up-to-date guidelines according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). And finally, the current legal situation in the European Union, without approval of any hemp extract-containing product according to the Novel Food regulation, actually allows blanket statements that all such products are illegal on the market, and this indeed would imply a general ban on the use and marketing of such products as food or food ingredients until such an approval has been granted. We hope that this reassures the F1000Research readership regarding the validity of our results and conclusions. We are pleased, though, that the EIHA has acknowledged the fact that there are non-compliant CBD products available, but according to our data these are a substantial fraction of the market.","Lachenmeier, Dirk W; Walch, Stephan G",F1000Res,,93
505313,"Coronavirus, plastics and eco-friendly packing and transport",2020,"In the UK, March 2020 was a time of great uncertainty as COVID-19 became increasingly widespread. The government responded by making suggestions about how people could reduce the risk of spread on 16 March, moved swiftly into closing schools on the 18 March before announcing a mandatory lockdown on the 23rd March. This was a challenging time for UK equestrians who had to balance maintaining their equine’s routine and daily care alongside the increasing biosecurity measures. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to UK equestrians via social media over two days (28 and 29 March 2020) to better understand the decisions made by UK horse, pony and donkey owners during this time. Data from 452 respondents were generated across all four countries comprising the UK, although there were no significant differences in owner response to the pandemic between locations. The changes respondents made differed between the 16th and the 18th of March 2020, with an early emphasis on improving yard biosecurity and opting to stop riding, as well as reducing the time spent at the yard. After the 18 March, respondents placed more emphasis on risk reduction by changing the activities they did with their horse, including riding, with common examples including avoiding “high risk” activities such as riding on busy roads, jumping, riding young or nervous horses. Few respondents reported having an emergency plan in place should they become ill or otherwise unable to care for their equine. The findings highlight areas that would significantly benefit from in-depth investigation in future research. Equestrian behaviour and mindset around risk-taking and risk perception have already been researched in relation to equestrian activities and sport but have received little attention in the context of wider health challenges. Understanding the uptake of emergency planning and preparation in the UK equestrian community also warrants consideration. Using this information effectively to promote forward planning is likely to be of great benefit in equestrian responses to future health or climate-related crises.","Hockenhull, Jo Bell Catherine White Jo Rogers Suzanne",Animals,,93

505587,How machine learning could be used in clinical practice during an epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emergency general surgery (EGS) has high rates of morbidity, mortality, and readmission. Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient. METHODS: We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient. RESULTS: The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology. Expert review classified slightly over one-third (36%) of consults as nonurgent. CONCLUSIONS: Most postoperative consults seen at our urban safety net hospital represent true morbidity that required admission, intervention, or surgery. Despite this high acuity, one-third of postoperative consults could have been managed as an outpatient. Efforts to improve discharge instructions and set patient expectations could limit unnecessary postoperative emergency department visits.","Fiorentino, Michele; Mulles, Shanen; Cue, Lauren; Merchant, Aziz M; Tufariello, Ann; Cummings, Dustin; Onwubalili, Kenechi; Glass, Nina E",J Surg Res,,93

506108,Intellectual Structure of Coronavirus Research: A Perspective From an Author Cocitation Analysis,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has spread across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus with no vaccine or antiviral therapy available to control the pandemic; therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the betacoronavirus genus like other closely related viruses including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused serious outbreaks and epidemics in the past eighteen years. Here, we report that one of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in COVID-19-infected patients. CH25H converts cholesterol to 25-hydrocholesterol (25HC) and 25HC shows broad anti-coronavirus activity by blocking membrane fusion. Furthermore, 25HC inhibits USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. Mechanistically, 25HC inhibits viral membrane fusion by activating the ER-localized acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) which leads to the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus-cell fusion. Since 25HC is a natural product with no known toxicity at effective concentrations, it provides a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases in the future.","Wang, Shaobo; Li, Wanyu; Hui, Hui; Tiwari, Shashi Kant; Zhang, Qiong; Croker, Ben A; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Carlin, Aaron F; Rana, Tariq M",EMBO J,,93
506286,A descriptive analysis of the data availability statements accompanying medRxiv preprints and a comparison with their published counterparts,2021,"A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a respiratory infection out broke in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, resulted in pandemic conditions worldwide. COVID-19 spread swiftly around the world over with an alert of an emergency for an adequate drug. Therefore, in this research, we repurposed the FDA-approved medicines to find the prominent drug used to cure the COVID infected patients. We performed homology modeling of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), responsible for the viral entry. The prediction of the transmembrane region and the Conserved Domain in TMPRSS2 protein was made for docking. 4182 FDA-approved compounds from the ZINC database were downloaded and used for the calculation of physicochemical properties. Two thousand eight hundred fifteen screened compounds were used for molecular docking against the modelled protein structure. From which top hit compounds based on binding energy were extracted. At 1st site pose, ZINC3830554 showed the highest binding energy -12.91kcal/mol by forming Salt Bridge at LYS143, Hydrogen bond at ALA8, VAL45, HIS47, SER142, ASN277, ASN359, and TRP363. The hydrophobic Interactions at PHE3, LEU4, ALA7, ALA8, ALA139, PRO197, and PHE266. In the 2nd site pose, ZINC203686879 shows the highest binding energy (-12.56 kcal/mol) and forms a hydrophobic interaction with VAL187, VAL189, HIS205, LYS301, GLN347, TRP370 and hydrogen bond was at GLY300, THR302, GLN347, SER350 residues. These hit compounds were subjected to stability checks between the protein-ligand complex through the dynamics simulation (MD), and binding free energy was calculated through the Molecular Mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) method. We hope that hit compounds would be an efficient inhibitor that can block the TMPRSS2 activity and resist the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into targeted human cells by reducing the virus's infectivity and transmissibility.","Barge, Sagar; Jade, Dhananjay; Gosavi, Gokul; Talukdar, Narayan Chandra; Borah, Jagat",Eur J Pharm Sci,,93

507237,Linguistic Inspired Graph Analysis,2021-05-13,"The world-wide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in year 2020 led to economic slowdown and large reduction of fossil fuel CO2 emissions, but it is unclear how much it would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration, and whether it can be observed. We estimated that a 7.9% reduction in emissions for 4 months would result in a 0.25 ppm decrease in the Northern Hemisphere CO2, an increment that is within the capability of current CO2 analyzers, but is a few times smaller than natural CO2 variabilities caused by weather and the biosphere such as El Nino. We used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport model to simulate CO2, driven by a new daily fossil fuel emissions dataset and hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced with observed climate variability. Our results show a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric column CO2 anomaly averaged over 50S-50N for the period February-April 2020 relative to a 10-year climatology. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon satellite GOSAT3. Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that COVID, the biosphere and weather contributed 54%, 23%, and 23% respectively. This seemingly small change stands out as the largest sub-annual anomaly in the last 10 years. Measurements from global ground stations were analyzed. At city scale, on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows reduction of 20-30 ppm, consistent with drastically reduced traffic during the lockdown. The ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and short-lasting COVID signal on the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated over the last two centuries is encouraging. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unintended experiment whose impact suggests that to keep atmospheric CO2 at a climate-safe level will require sustained effort of similar magnitude and improved accuracy and expanded spatiotemporal coverage of our monitoring systems.","Zeng, Ning; Han, Pengfei; Liu, Di; Liu, Zhiqiang; Oda, Tomohiro; Martin, Cory; Liu, Zhu; Yao, Bo; Sun, Wanqi; Wang, Pucai; Cai, Qixiang; Dickerson, Russell; Maksyutov, Shamil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13025v1.pdf,93
507796,Some pros and cons of psychoanalytic teletherapy,2021,"Background: Brain metastasis is a major cause of cancer death in patients with lung cancer. Sirtuin 1 and hsa-miR-217 have been identified to mediate the development of non-small cell lung cancer. Aims: To investigate the roles of hsa-miR-217, its target sirtuin 1, and the P53/KAI1 axis in the brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer. Study Design: Cell culture study. Methods: Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma brain metastasis cell line PC-14/B were incubated and treated with constructed lentiviral plasmids expressing miR-217 and/or sirtuin 1. BEAS-2B cell line was used as a control. The targeted regulation of miR-217 to sirtuin 1was examined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and related protein expression were detected to examine the effect of the miR-217/sirtuin 1 expression on metastasis. Results: PC-14/B cells expressed higher sirtuin 1 and lower P53 and KAI1 compared with BEAS-2B control cells (p<0.05). Sirtuin 1 was a direct target of miR-217. MiR-217 expression suppressed PC-14/B cell invasion (p=0.004), migration (p=0.001), and proliferation (p<0.05), whereas sirtuin 1 overexpression reversed all processes. sirtuin 1 expression inhibited P53, KAI1/CD82, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and ß-catenin but upregulated E-cadherin protein. MiR-217 overexpression induced reverse changes. Conclusion: Hsa-miR-217 and its target sirtuin 1 acted as metastasis suppressor and promoter gene in non-small cell lung cancer, respectively. The hsa-miR-217/sirtuin 1/P53/KAI1 metastasis regulatory pathway showed novel and crucial roles in brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer. This axis might be a potential target for the treatment of brain metastasis of lung cancer.","Jiang, Wenxia; Hou, Likun; Wei, Juan; Du, Yifeng; Zhao, Yan; Deng, Xue; Lin, Xiangdong",Balkan Med J,,93

Similar to some other viral infections, it can cause severe neurological damages. Here, we describe a 40-year-old man case who initially was admitted to a major hospital with presenting 7 days with weak flu-like symptoms (cough) and fever then presented neurology signs for 3 days. Physical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral vasculopathy. Molecular testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swab by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient received supportive cares and was treated with routine antiplatelet therapy. He was improved and discharged 10 days after admission with no symptoms. Our findings report a 40-year-old man with flu-like symptoms that indicate cerebral vasculopathy that was discharged with no symptoms. Therefore, physicians should be monitor patients with worsening or progressive central nervous system results.

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of pregnant and nonpregnant women of reproductive age hospitalized between March and October 2020 in Tehran, Iran. Medical records were reviewed and women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were included. Extracted data were compared and logistic regression performed. RESULTS: A total of 110 pregnant and 234 nonpregnant COVID-19-positive women were included. Frequency of severe disease was higher in nonpregnant women than pregnant women (29% vs 11.8%; P < 0.001). Symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chill, fatigue, and headache were more frequent in nonpregnant women (P < 0.05). Pregnant women had higher oxygen saturation levels and lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.001). Six (5.5%) pregnant and 12 (5.1%) nonpregnant women died (P = 0.80). No significant differences between the groups were found for ICU admission and end organ failure. Significantly more nonpregnant women had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 9.4% vs 0%; P = 0.001). Univariate regression indicated association between hypertension and death; oxygen saturation and ARDS; and body mass index and ICU admission. No association was found between pregnancy and death, ICU admission, or ARDS.

The study sought to establish the moderating effect of the regulatory framework on the relationship between strategic innovation orientation and performance of MFIs using the case of Kenya. The indicators for the regulatory framework were;prudential guidelines, non-prudential guidelines, and government laws. A descriptive and explanatory research design was adopted as the research design with a target population of 13 MFIs from which a sample of 352 respondents was obtained using a proportionate stratified and simple random sampling technique. Both primary and secondary data was collected and analysed using multiple regression model. The regulatory framework was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between strategic innovation orientation and performance. The findings established that regulatory framework had a moderating effect on the relationship between strategic innovation orientation and performance of MFIs.

511329,How to Regulate Blockchain's Real-life Applications: Lessons from the California Blockchain Working Group,2021,"We evaluate the global welfare consequences of increases in mortality and poverty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Increases in mortality are measured in terms of the number of years of life lost (LY) to the pandemic. Additional years spent in poverty (PY) are conservatively estimated using growth estimates for 2020 and two different scenarios for its distributional characteristics. Using years of life as a welfare metric yields a single parameter that captures the underlying trade-off between lives and livelihoods: how many PYs have the same welfare cost as one LY. Taking an agnostic view of this parameter, we compare estimates of LYs and PYs across countries for different scenarios. Three main findings arise. First, we estimate that, as of early June 2020, the pandemic (and the observed private and policy responses) had generated at least 68 million additional poverty years and 4.3 million years of life lost across 150 countries. The ratio of PYs to LYs is very large in most countries, suggesting that the poverty consequences of the crisis are of paramount importance. Second, this ratio declines systematically with GDP per capita: poverty accounts for a much greater share of the welfare costs in poorer countries. Finally, a comparison of these baseline results with mortality estimates in a counterfactual “herd immunity” scenario suggests that welfare losses would be greater in the latter in most countries.","Decerf, Benoit Ferreira Francisco H.

511378,Remote Intimacy: Popular Music Conversations in the Covid Era,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In present days, the use of information technology (IT) in education is unquestionable. The mounting advancement of IT has changed the scenario of education. With the emergence of the current COVID-19 situation, it has undoubtedly provided a solution to most of our educational needs when all educational institutions remained closed due to the pandemic. This study aims to identify the nursing students' attitude towards the practice of e-learning amidst COVID-19. METHODS: A descriptive web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students with a sample size of 470. A self-administered validated questionnaire along with a standard tool to measure the attitude was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the respondents was 20.91± 1.55 years. The majority (76.4%) of the respondents used mobile for their study and 90.4% used Wi-Fi for the internet source. The main advantage of e-learning was stated as the ability to stay at home (72.1%) followed by the reduced cost of accommodation and transport (51.3%) whereas the internet problem (81.7%) was the major disadvantage followed by technical issues (65.5%). Only about 34% of the students found e-learning as effective as traditional face-to-face learning. The mean scores for the domains: perceived usefulness, intention to adapt, distant use of e-learning, ease of learning, technical support, and learning stressors were 3.1, 3.1, 3.8, 2.9, 2.9, and 2.5 respectively. Overall, 58.9% had a favorable attitude regarding e-learning. There was no significant association of overall attitude regarding e-learning with selected socio-demographic variables whereas it was positively associated with all of its six domains. All the domains were positively correlated with each other except for ease of learning with technical support and distant use, and technical support with learning stressor and distant use. Learning stressor versus distant use was negatively correlated with each other. CONCLUSION: Though e-learning was implemented as a substitute during the pandemic, almost half of the nursing students showed a positive attitude regarding e-learning. The majority of the students had internet problems and technological issues. If e-learning can be made user-friendly with reduced technical barriers supplemented with programs that can enhance practical learning abilities, e-learning can be the vital alternative teaching method and learning in the nursing field.","Thapa, Pratima; Bhandari, Suman Lata; Pathak, Sharada",PLoS One,,93

To support these changes, regulators and payers have temporarily modified long-standing policies, recognizing the need for a trade-off between the costs and benefits of oversight during times of crisis. Specifically, there has been a heightened receptivity to the importance of preserving physicians' and other health care professionals' time, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserve for the direct care of patients, instead of squandering these resources on low-value tasks and frustrating technology. Instead of reflexively reverting to past practices and policies, there is now an opportunity to take advantage of the lessons of COVID-19 for the further transformation of health care to achieve Quadruple Aim outcomes (better care for individuals, better health for the population, better experience for clinicians, and lower costs).

This study seeks to answer two interrelated questions: who and how reinterprets the category of Islamic piety in the context of the pandemic and to what extent the online environment transforms the Islamic tradition as a whole. Based on textual analysis of individual publications on social networks and interviews with editors of public websites, the common narratives of Russian Muslim discourse on the pandemic were identified as follows: a retaliation against China for the oppression of Muslim Uighurs;the search for the signs of the coming doomsday;various approaches to the reinterpretation of religious piety.

514995,Covid-19 and Flattening the Curve: a Feedback Control Perspective,2020,"The recent growth of medicine sales online represents a major disruption to pharmacy markets, with COVID-19 encouraging this trend further. While e-pharmacy businesses were initially the preserve of high-income countries, in the past decade they have been growing rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Public health concerns associated with e-pharmacy include the sale of prescription-only medicines without a prescription and the sale of substandard and falsified medicines. There are also non-health-related risks such as consumer fraud and lack of data privacy. However, e-pharmacy may also have the potential to improve access to medicines. Drawing on existing literature and a set of key informant interviews in Kenya, Nigeria and India, we examine the e-pharmacy regulatory systems in LMICs. None of the study countries had yet enacted a regulatory framework specific to e-pharmacy. Key regulatory challenges included the lack of consensus on regulatory models, lack of regulatory capacity, regulating sales across borders and risks of over-regulation. However, e-pharmacy also presents opportunities to enhance medicine regulation-through consolidation in the sector, and the traceability and transparency that online records offer. The regulatory process needs to be adapted to keep pace with this dynamic landscape and exploit these possibilities. This will require exploration of a range of innovative regulatory options, collaboration with larger, more compliant businesses, and engagement with global regulatory bodies. A key first step must be ensuring that national regulators are equipped with the necessary awareness and technical expertise to actively oversee this e-pharmacy activity.","Miller, Rosalind; Wafula, Francis; Onoka, Chima A; Saligram, Prasanna; Musiega, Anita; Ogira, Dosila; Okpani, Ikedichi; Ejughemre, Ufuoma; Murthy, Shrutika; Garimella, Surekha; Sanderson, Marie; Ettelt, Stefanie; Allen, Pauline; Nambiar, Devaki; Salam, Abdul; Kweyu, Emmanuel; Hanson, Kara; Goodman, Catherine",,,93

In this disease, hypercoagulability and hyperinflammation, two common features, are accompanied by a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. We assessed the association between baseline inflammatory cytokine levels and coagulopathy and disease outcome in COVID-19. One hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were selected for the study. Baseline interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level were measured at time of admission. At the same time, baseline coagulation parameters were also assessed during the patient’s hospitalization. Clinical findings, including development of thrombosis and clinical outcome, were recorded prospectively. Out of 136 patients, 87 (~64%) had increased cytokine levels (one or more cytokines) or abnormal coagulation parameters. Among them, 58 (~67%) had only increased inflammatory cytokines, 12 (~14%) had only coagulation abnormalities, and 17 (19.5%) had concomitant abnormalities in both systems. It seems that a high level of inflammatory cytokines at admission points to an increased risk of developing coagulopathy, thrombotic events, even death, over the course of COVID-19. Early measurement of these cytokines, and timely co-administration of anti-inflammatories with anticoagulants could decrease thrombotic events and related fatal consequences.","Rad, Fariba Dabbagh Ali Dorgalaleh Akbar Biswas Arijit",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,93

This partial closure not only enabled learning in smaller targeted groups but also offered a safe sanctuary for those who needed a regulated and secure environment. In Australia, if full school closures were to be enforced over a long period, a significant proportion of students from more vulnerable backgrounds would likely experience persistent disadvantage through a range of barriers: long-term educational disengagement, digital exclusion, poor technology management, and increased psychosocial challenges.

Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses; however, viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stock SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units. Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titres of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells. A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The mean log reductions in the viral titres were &#8805;3·40 and &#8805;4·53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion transmitted SARS-CoV-2.","Keil, Shawn D; Ragan, Izabela; Yonemura, Susan; Hartson, Lindsay; Dart, Nicole K; Bowen, Richard",Vox Sang,,93
520202,Kamlesh Kumar Masson,2020,"BACKGROUND: Appropriateness is particularly relevant in palliative care, an area in which it is essential to question the real need for treatments. Few studies explored the perception of appropriateness by professionals in pediatric palliative care, revealing the conflict sometimes faced when confronted with the uncertainty of prognosis and end-of-life decisions. AIMS: The objective of this study is firstly to investigate the perception that doctors, nurses and psychologists, operating in Italian pediatric hospices, have of the appropriateness of the care they provide. Secondly, to understand what repercussions the perception of non-appropriateness has at individual and team level. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted between 2019 and 2020 through semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 17 professionals working it Italian pediatric hospices. RESULTS: The interviewees do not refer to a common concept of appropriateness, but compare the latter to: the quality of life, the global care of the assisted person, the proportionality of care, the early recognition of the need for palliative care. The discussion within the team emerges as a privileged place to manage the discomfort of individual professionals in the face of treatment choices in conflict with their own values. CONCLUSION: the non-referring to a univocal conception of appropriateness deprives professionals of an objective criterion to resolve the most difficult decisions. However, it allows them to establish what from time to time seems to be the most appropriate care pathway for a given patient, at a given time and context, preserving the goal of personalized care.","Cappi, Valentina; Riboni, Serena; Grana, Marianna; Pierotti, Emanuela; Ravelli, Andrea; Sutti, Stefania; Testa, Sara; Spacci, Alessio; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo; Pellegatta, Federico",Acta Biomed,,93

However, the current situation of CKD management is unclear during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 on kidney patients' follow-ups. METHODS: In April 2020, we included patients who underwent kidney biopsy from January 2017 to December 2019 in a referral center of China, and then initiated a survey via telephone on different aspects of follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected and analyzed demographic data, diagnoses, follow-up conditions, and telemedicine experience. RESULTS: We reached 1190 CKD patients with confirmed kidney biopsies, and included 1164 patients for analysis after excluding those on dialysis. None of our patients have had COVID-19, although more than 50% of them were complicated with other comorbidities, and over 40% were currently using immunosuppressive treatments. Face-to-face clinic visits were interrupted in 836 (71.82%) participants. Medicine adjustments and routine laboratory examinations were delayed or made irregular in about 60% of patients. To continue their follow-ups, 255 (21.90%) patients utilized telemedicine, and about 80% of them were satisfied with the experience. The proportion of telemedicine users was significantly higher in patients with immunosuppressive treatments than those without (31.88% vs. 17.12%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 was mitigated in patients with CKD and other co-existing risk factors when proper protection was utilized. The routine medical care was disrupted during the pandemic, and telemedicine could be a reasonable alternative method.","Chen, Gang; Zhou, Yangzhong; Xia, Jinghua; Yao, Jia; Zheng, Ke; Qin, Yan; Li, Xuemei",Ren Fail,,93
521693,The Ancient History of Peptidyl Transferase Center Formation as Told by Conservation and Information Analyses,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Hyperventilation (HV) is one of the main and basic activation methods during ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), unless medical reasons contraindicate it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the high risk of human-to-human infection, local guidelines and recommendations have been developed that suggest not to perform the HV maneuver routinely. Our objective was to characterize patients who present positive HV in an epilepsy center. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all the ambulatory EEGs performed during one year in our specialized ambulatory child and adolescent epilepsy center, and describe patients with positive maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 305 EEGs were performed. Patients under 3 years and 11 months were excluded as well as all patients that did not fill up the criteria for epilepsy diagnosis. From the 252 EEGs that were included in the study, 194 EEGs (77%) were classified as abnormal and 58 (23%) as normal. From these same 252 EEGs, 150 EEG finished correctly the HV maneuver. Physiological slowing response was found in 54 EEGs (36%), no changes (negative) in 83 (55%), and abnormal response (positive) in 13 EEGs (9%). The 13 HV-positive EEGs showed 4 patients with an increase of epileptiform activity, 3 patients experienced an increase of basal preregistered abnormal slowing, and 6 EEGs showed trigger of bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences. None of these last 6 patients needed more than 3 minutes to elicit the paroxysmal discharge. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings and according with other studies, the low positivity and high specificity of the HV maneuver support the idea that HV could be excluded during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and also reevaluate whether it could be changed to a complementary maneuver, restricted only for cases where absence epilepsy is suspected. Larger studies will be needed to reaffirm this proposal.","Ríos-Pohl, Loreto; Franco, Macarena; Gonzalez, Magdalena",Epilepsia Open,,93
523148,Welcome,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with obesity suffer from an increased susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infections and respond poorly to vaccinations, making it imperative to identify interventions. Recent evidence suggesting that obesity leads to tissue-specific vitamin A deficiency led to an investigation of whether high-dose oral vitamin A, a treatment used for remediating vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, could correct obesity-associated tissue deficits. METHODS: Adult C57BL/6 diet-induced obese mice were supplemented with vitamin A for 4 weeks. A subset of mice were then vaccinated with inactivated influenza virus and challenged. Following supplementation, tissue vitamin A levels, lung immune cell composition, blood inflammatory cytokines, antibody responses, and viral clearance were evaluated. RESULTS: Supplementation significantly improved vitamin A levels in lung and adipose tissues in diet-induced obese mice. Additionally, supplementation decreased inflammatory cytokines in the blood and altered the lung immune environment. Importantly, vaccinated, vitamin A-treated diet-induced obese mice exhibited improved antibody responses and significantly reduced viral loads post challenge compared with PBS-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate a low-cost intervention that may correct vitamin A tissue deficits and help control respiratory viral infections in individuals with obesity.","Penkert, Rhiannon R; Cortez, Valerie; Karlsson, Erik A; Livingston, Brandi; Surman, Sherri L; Li, Yaqi; Catharine Ross, A; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Hurwitz, Julia L",Obesity (Silver Spring),,93

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. DESIGN: The Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation model, was used to examine alternative mitigation strategies. The CEACOV model tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. DATA SOURCES: Data from published literature were used to obtain parameters related to COVID-19 and contact-hours. TARGET POPULATION: Undergraduate students and faculty at U.S. colleges. TIME HORIZON: One semester (105 days). PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTION: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including social distancing, masks, and routine laboratory screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections among students and faculty per 5000 students and per 1000 faculty, isolation days, tests, costs, cost per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among students, mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases from 3746 with no mitigation to 493 with extensive social distancing and masks, and further to 151 when laboratory testing was added among asymptomatic persons every 3 days. Among faculty, these values were 164, 28, and 25 cases, respectively. Costs ranged from about $0.4 million for minimal social distancing to about $0.9 million to $2.1 million for strategies involving laboratory testing ($10 per test), depending on testing frequency. Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to test costs. LIMITATION: Data are from multiple sources. CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

It has been suggested that this is linked, in part, to the choice of sampling method. Methods A diagnostic test accuracy review for sensitivity, using recently developed Cochrane methods for conducting rapid reviews, and the PRISMA protocol was undertaken, with QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessments and meta-analysis of included studies. Sensitivities were calculated by a consensus standard of positivity by either method as the gold standard. Insufficient and/or inaccurate, cross sectional or anatomical site pooling methodologies were excluded. Results Of 13 included studies, 8 had high risk of bias, and 5 had high applicability concerns. There were no statistical differences in pooled sensitivities between collection methods for 8 different viruses, and neither with use of PCR, Immunofluorescence nor culture. In a single study, Influenza H1N1 favoured nasopharyngeal swabs, with aspirates having 93.3% of the sensitivity of swabs (p>0.001). Similar equivocal sensitivities were noticed in detecting bacteria. Conclusions The chain of sampling, from anatomical site to laboratory results, features different potential foci along which sensitivity may be lost.

593473,"The willingness of cooperative societies to sponsor house ownership in Akure, Nigeria",2021-05-14,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cellular senescence is considered a stress response that protects cells against malignant transformation, facilitates tissue repair and development, and prevents virus replication. However, excessive accumulation of senescent cells is associated with chronic diseases such as age-related disorders, cancer, inflammatory diseases and virus replication. The relationship between virus and cellular senescence is proving to be very complex. Cellular senescence can be induced in response to virus infection restricting virus propagation. Some viruses are able to exploit the senescence program to improve their replication, while others have developed strategies to subvert senescence. Therapeutic approaches to eliminate senescent cells may be used as a mechanism to ameliorate age-related diseases, but they may have an impact on virus replication. Here we review the available evidence revealing an interplay between cellular senescence and virus replication. We also discuss the consequences that treatment with senolytic agents may have on virus replication. ABSTRACT: Cellular senescence is viewed as a mechanism to prevent malignant transformation, but when it is chronic, as occurs in age-related diseases, it may have adverse effects on cancer. Therefore, targeting senescent cells is a novel therapeutic strategy against senescence-associated diseases. In addition to its role in cancer protection, cellular senescence is also considered a mechanism to control virus replication. Both interferon treatment and some viral infections can trigger cellular senescence as a way to restrict virus replication. However, activation of the cellular senescence program is linked to the alteration of different pathways, which can be exploited by some viruses to improve their replication. It is, therefore, important to understand the potential impact of senolytic agents on viral propagation. Here we focus on the relationship between virus and cellular senescence and the reported effects of senolytic compounds on virus replication.","Seoane, Rocío; Vidal, Santiago; Bouzaher, Yanis Hichem; El Motiam, Ahmed; Rivas, Carmen",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317104/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9120455,93
593512,The effect of protected areas on pathogen exposure in endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) populations,2012-04-28,"Abstract Kidney transplant recipients who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are bringing unique challenges to health care professionals. Telemedicine has surged dramatically since the pandemic in efforts to maintain patient care and reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients, healthcare workers, and the public. Herein we present reports of three kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 that were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical records system, from home to inpatient settings. We demonstrate how telemedicine helped assess, diagnose, triage, and treat patients with COVID-19 while avoiding an emergency room or outpatient clinic visit. While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive NAT tests. Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. Yet in order to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care kidney transplant recipients are needed.","Abuzeineh, Mohammad; Muzaale, Abimereki D.; Crews, Deidra C.; Avery, Robin K.; Brotman, Daniel J.; Brennan, Daniel C.; Segev, Dorry L.; Al Ammary, Fawaz",Transplant Proc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134520326294; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798002/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134520326294?v=s5,93

Several studies have reported varying incidences of this disease. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to determine the real incidence of deep or superficial vein thrombosis in COVID‐19. The study also aimed to identify risk and protective factors for VTE. METHODS: Patients were consecutively enrolled and assessed with a bilateral Duplex ultrasonography of lower limbs during hospitalization. The exam was repeated weekly until discharge, and then follow‐up for 1 month. RESULTS: Two‐hundred and thirty‐three patients were enrolled. Mean age was 54.4 years (SD 12.7) and 47.8% were female. About 127 patients (54.5%) had comorbidities. At enrollment, patients were normotensive and had normal saturation (95.6%—SD 1.6, with a respiratory rate of 19.1 rpm—SD 4.0), with 130 needing at least supplementary oxygen therapy (55.8%). About 147 patients (63.1%) had at least 1 Duplex ultrasonography study performed and 1.7% had 5 or more studies. One patient had a distal posterior tibial vein thrombosis, which showed signs of chronicity and was congruent with the patient history. Therefore, the incidence of thrombotic events was nearly zero. DISCUSSION: Our study results suggest that performing a Duplex Ultrasonography screening protocol in stable COVID‐19 patient populations, who may need hospitalization but are without symptoms of vein thrombosis, is not founded. We presumably emphasize the advantage of using intermediate LMWH doses as well as early walking in COVID‐19 patients.","Tung‐Chen, Yale; Calderón, Ruth; Marcelo, Cristina; Deodati, Francesco; Mateos, María; Castellano, Aranzazu; Álvarez, Beatriz; Marco, Javier; Ordieres, Lucía",J Ultrasound Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.15798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342886/,93

DESIGN: Mathematical modelling. SETTINGS: Indian epidemic of COVID-19 and vulnerable population. DATA SOURCES: Country-specific and age-segregated pattern of social contact, case fatality rate and demographic data obtained from peer-reviewed literature and public domain. MODEL: An age-structured dynamical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in India incorporating uncertainty in natural history parameters was constructed. INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of different vaccine strategies by targeting priority groups such as keyworkers including healthcare professionals, individuals with comorbidities (24–60 years old) and all above 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence reduction and averted deaths in different scenarios, assuming that the current restrictions are fully lifted as vaccination is implemented. RESULTS: The priority groups together account for about 18% of India’s population. An infection-preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all these groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence by 20.6% (95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 16.7–25.4) and cumulative mortality by 29.7% (95% CrI 25.8–33.8). A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms (but not infection) will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% (95% CrI 8.4–13.0) and cumulative mortality by 32.9% (95% CrI 28.6–37.3). In the event of insufficient vaccine supply to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after keyworkers, vaccine strategy should prioritise all who are >60 and subsequently individuals with comorbidities. In settings with weakest transmission, such as sparsely populated rural areas, those with comorbidities should be prioritised after keyworkers. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriately targeted vaccination strategy would witness substantial mitigation of impact of COVID-19 in a country like India with wide heterogeneity. ‘Smart vaccination’, based on public health considerations, rather than mass vaccination, appears prudent.","Mandal, Sandip; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Bhargava, Balram; Panda, Samiran",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34215611/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048874,93

However, as unable to escape from adversity, the quality of sessile organisms is dramatically affected by salt stress. To systematically explore the quality formation of LJF in morphology, physiology, and bioactive constituents' response to multiple levels of salt stress, UFLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and multivariate statistical analysis were performed. Lonicera japonica Thunb. was planted in pots and placed in the field, then harvested after 35 days under salt stress. Indexes of growth, photosynthetic pigments, osmolytes, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes were identified to evaluate the salt tolerance in LJF under different salt stresses (0, 100, 200, and 300 mM NaCl). Then, the total accumulation and dynamic variation of 47 bioactive constituents were quantitated. Finally, Partial least squares discrimination analysis and gray relational analysis were performed to systematically cluster, distinguish, and evaluate the samples, respectively. The results showed that 100 mM NaCl induced growth, photosynthetic, antioxidant activities, osmolytes, lipid peroxidation, and multiple bioactive constituents in LJF, which possessed the best quality. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between the accumulation of phenolic acids with antioxidant enzyme activity under salt stress, further confirming that phenolic acids could reduce oxidative damage. This study provides insight into the quality formation and valuable information to improve the LJF medicinal value under salt stress.","Cai, Zhichen; Liu, Xunhong; Chen, Huan; Yang, Rong; Chen, Jiajia; Zou, Lisi; Wang, Chengcheng; Chen, Jiali; Tan, Mengxia; Mei, Yuqi; Wei, Lifang",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83566-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594134/,93
598493,With Gratitude From the Inaugural Editor-in-Chief of Innovation in Aging,2020-11-29,"Background More than 20% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The long-term respiratory sequelae in ICU survivors remain unclear. Research question what are the major long-term pulmonary sequelae in critical COVID-19 survivors? Study Design and Methods Consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission were recruited and evaluated 3 months after hospitalization discharge. The follow-up comprised symptom and quality of life, anxiety and depression questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, exercise test (6-minute walking test (6MWT)) and chest computed tomography (CT). Results 125 ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 were recruited between March and June 2020. At the 3-month follow-up, 62 patients were available for pulmonary evaluation. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (46.7%), and cough (34.4%). Eighty-two percent of patients showed a lung diffusing capacity of less than 80%. The median (IQR) distance in the 6MWT was 400 (362;440) meters. CT scans were abnormal in 70.2% of patients, showing reticular lesions in 49.1% and fibrotic patterns in 21.1%. Patients with more severe alterations on chest CT had worse pulmonary function and presented more degrees of desaturation in the 6MWT. Factors associated with the severity of lung damage on chest CT were age and length of invasive mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay. Interpretation Pulmonary structural abnormalities and functional impairment are highly prevalent in surviving ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 3 months after hospital discharge. Pulmonary evaluation should be considered for all critical COVID-19 survivors 3 months post discharge.","González, Jessica; Benítez, Iván D.; Carmona, Paola; Santisteve, Sally; Monge, Aida; Moncusí-Moix, Anna; Gort-Paniello, Clara; Pinilla, Lucía; Carratalá, Amara; Zuil, María; Ferrer, Ricard; Ceccato, Adrián; Fernández, Laia; Motos, Ana; Riera, Jordi; Menéndez, Rosario; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Peñuelas, Oscar; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F.; Labarca, Gonzalo; Caballero, Jesus; Torres, Gerard; de Gonzalo-Calvo, David; Torres, Antoni; Barbé, Ferran",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221004645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676998/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.02.062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221004645?v=s5,93

599000,Optimal Control Strategies and Sensitivity Analysis of an HIV/AIDS-Resistant Model with Behavior Change,2021-07-30,"Background In the United States, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths are captured through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System and death certificates reported to the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). However, not all COVID-19 deaths are recognized and reported because of limitations in testing, exacerbation of chronic health conditions that are listed as the cause of death, or delays in reporting. Estimating deaths may provide a more comprehensive understanding of total COVID-19–attributable deaths. Methods We estimated COVID-19 unrecognized attributable deaths, from March 2020—April 2021, using all-cause deaths reported to NVSS by week and six age groups (0–17, 18–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years) for 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia using a linear time series regression model. Reported COVID-19 deaths were subtracted from all-cause deaths before applying the model. Weekly expected deaths, assuming no SARS-CoV-2 circulation and predicted all-cause deaths using SARS-CoV-2 weekly percent positive as a covariate were modelled by age group and including state as a random intercept. COVID-19–attributable unrecognized deaths were calculated for each state and age group by subtracting the expected all-cause deaths from the predicted deaths. Findings We estimated that 766,611 deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurred in the United States from March 8, 2020—May 29, 2021. Of these, 184,477 (24%) deaths were not documented on death certificates. Eighty-two percent of unrecognized deaths were among persons aged ≥65 years; the proportion of unrecognized deaths were 0•24–0•31 times lower among those 0–17 years relative to all other age groups. More COVID-19–attributable deaths were not captured during the early months of the pandemic (March–May 2020) and during increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity (July 2020, November 2020—February 2021).

The test was standardized using an antigenic epitopes Pool of the synthetic peptide as antigen derived from antigenic regions of the spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane structural proteins, which were designed, based on the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia. In the ELISA standardization process, 34 positive sera were used, including sera from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (mild and severe) and 68 negative sera, including pre-pandemic historical negatives originating from patients living in arbovirus endemic areas or patients with a history of respiratory diseases and sera from patients with a negative rRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The in-house peptide ELIPSE-COL test showed promising performance, being able to detect reactivity in sera from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. Viruses are among the major pathogenic agents that cause number of serious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Viruses cause many diseases in humans, from self resolving diseases to acute fatal diseases. Developing strategies for the antiviral drugs are focused on two different approaches: Targeting the viruses themselves or the host cell factors. Antiviral drugs that directly target the viruses include the inhibitors of virus attachment, inhibitors of virus entry, uncoating inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, inhibitors of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase and the inhibitors of integrase. The inhibitors of protease (ritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir), viral DNA polymerase (acyclovir, tenofovir, valganciclovir and valacyclovir) and of integrase (raltegravir) are listed among the Top 200 Drugs by sales during 2010s. Still no effective antiviral drugs are available for many viral infections. Though, there are a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, many for influenza and some new antiviral drugs for treating hepatitis C infection and HIV. Action mechanism of antiviral drugs consists of its transformation to triphosphate following the viral DNA synthesis inhibition. An analysis of the action mechanism of known antiviral drugs concluded that they can increase the cell’s resistance to a virus (interferons), suppress the virus adsorption in the cell or its diffusion into the cell and its deproteinisation process in the cell (amantadine) along with antimetabolites that causes the inhibition of nucleic acids synthesis.

Healthcare professionals issue less than 20% of all reports suspecting NAI to the responsible authorities. Insufficient knowledge concerning NAI may partly explain this low percentage. The risk of NAI is heightened during health and socioeconomic crises such as COVID-19 and thus demands increased awareness. This review provides an overview and educational material on NAI and its clinical presentation. Methods — We combined a literature review with expert opinions of the senior authors into an educational paper aiming to help clinicians to recognize NAI and act appropriately by referral to multidisciplinary child protection teams and local authorities. Results — Despite the increased risk of NAI during the current COVID-19 crisis, the number of reports suspecting NAI decreased by 42% during the lockdown of the Danish society. Healthcare professionals filed only 17% of all reports of suspected child abuse in 2016. Interpretation — The key to recognizing and suspecting NAI upon clinical presentation is to be aware of inconsistencies in the medical history and suspicious findings on physical and paraclinical examination. During health and socioeconomic crises the incidence of NAI is likely to peak. Recognition of NAI, adequate handling by referral to child protection teams, and reporting to local authorities are of paramount importance to prevent mortality and physical and mental morbidity.","Martinkevich, Polina; Larsen, Lise Langeland; Græsholt-Knudsen, Troels; Hesthaven, Gitte; Hellfritzsch, Michel Bach; Petersen, Karin Kastberg; Møller-Madsen, Bjarne; Rölfing, Jan Duedal",Acta orthopaedica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573297/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2020.1782012,93

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at =0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively.

While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.","Negera, Edessa; Demissie, Tesfaye Moti; Tafess, Ketema",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590,93

To contribute to overall national- and global-scale SDG achievement, local communities need to focus on a locally-relevant subset of goals and understand potential future pathways for key drivers which influence local sustainability. We developed a participatory method to co-create local socioeconomic pathways by downscaling the SDGs and driving forces of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) via a local case study in southern Australia through contextual analysis and community engagement. We linked the SSPs and SDGs by identifying driving forces and describing how they affect the achievement of local SDGs. We co-created six local socioeconomic pathways with the local community which track towards futures with different levels of fulfilment of the SDGs and each encompasses a narrative storyline incorporating locally-specific ideas from the community. We tested and validated the local pathways with the community. This method extends the SSPs in two dimensions–into the broader field of sustainability via the SDGs, and by recontextualizing them at the local scale. The local socioeconomic pathways can contribute to achieving local sustainability goals from the bottom up in alignment with global initiatives.

Past pandemics offer clues,2021,"The main target for this research is to know how the Coronavirus affected specially on the individual and on the society in general with anxiety and panic that resulted from the social media and communication about the severity of this virus and how quickly it spread and also fake news about the infected people and their numbers. So we try to show how it’s important of the psychological support for the society generally and raise the healthy awareness between people, also as this research showed how it’s necessary for people is to preoccupation in other things rather than social media like mental and physical exercises as well as reading and other useful things. From the basic things that we focused on it is the people immune and how it’s get affect by the psychological anxiety, as most studies and researches have been found a relation between the psychological anxiety and the patient immune which it was an inverse relationship as in case of increase the anxiety it will cause a lower immune response and increase the probability of infection specially COVID-19. The comprehensive ban have prevent the society from the communication together to confined the virus and reduce its separation but there must be some alternatives that support people psychologically and physically. As also its important to mention that the panic cases in increase during the comprehensive ban specially in the social areas and countries, for example in Iraq the comprehensive ban was a reason that prevent the communication between relatives and that lead to the psychological fatigue for many people because the interruption that happened with the relatives and the society.","Jasim, Saade Abdalkareem; Saleh, Raed Obaid; Ali, Yasameen Hasan",Mater Today Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321035586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026570/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785321035586; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.04.626,93

Its causative agent is a severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus which has been officially named SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the discovery of extremely low CG abundance in its open reading frames. We found that CG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 is achieved mainly through mutating C/G into A/T, and CG is the best target for mutation. Meanwhile, 5′-untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2 has high CG content and is capable of forming an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit host ribosome for translating its RNA. These features allow SARS-CoV-2 to reproduce efficiently in host cells, because less energy is consumed in disrupting the stem-loops formed by its genomic RNA. Notably, genomes of cellular organisms also have very low CG abundance, suggesting that mutating C/G into A/T occurs universally in all life forms. Moreover, CG is the dinucleotide related to CpG island, mutational hotspot and single nucleotide polymorphism in cellular organisms. The relationship between these features is worthy of further investigations.","Wang, Yong; Mao, Jun-Ming; Wang, Guang-Dong; Luo, Zhi-Peng; Yang, Liu; Yao, Qin; Chen, Ke-Ping",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704018/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69342-y,93

Here we present a generalized version of the RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) assay, called “capture RASL-seq” (cRASL-seq), which enables highly sensitive (down to ~1–100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to ~10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows. Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.","Credle, Joel J.; Robinson, Matthew L.; Gunn, Jonathan; Monaco, Daniel; Sie, Brandon; Tchir, Alexandra; Hardick, Justin; Zheng, Xuwen; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Rothman, Richard E.; Eshleman, Susan H.; Pekosz, Andrew; Hansen, Kasper; Mostafa, Heba; Steinegger, Martin; Larman, H.

Concerns were raised on scientific quality and generalizability of this emerging evidence. MAIN ARGUMENT: However, this way acting is not entirely new and often public health decisions are based on flawed and ambiguous evidence. Thus, to better guide decisions in these circumstances, in this article we argue that there is a need to follow fundamental principles in order to guide best public health practices. We purpose the usefulness of the framework of principalism in public which has been proved useful in real life conditions as a guide in the absence of reliable evidence. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended the implementation of these principles in an integrated manner adopting an holistic system approach to health policies adapted to specificities of local contexts.","Ferrinho, Paulo; Sidat, Mohsin; Leiras, Gisela; Passos Cupertino de Barros, Fernando; Arruda, Horácio",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648280/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3015,93
607120,Outbreakmanagement in Nederland,2010,"Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and US weather data, we estimated the probability of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) being diagnosed as Legionnaires’ disease (LD). LD risk increases when weather is warm and humid. With warm weather, we found a dose-response relationship between relative humidity and the odds for LD. When the mean temperature was 60°–80°F with high humidity (>80.0%), the odds for CAP being diagnosed with LD were 3.1 times higher than with lower levels of humidity (<50.0%). Thus, in some regions (e.g., the Southwest), LD is rarely the cause of hospitalizations. In other regions and seasons (e.g., the mid-Atlantic in summer), LD is much more common. Thus, suspicion for LD should increase when weather is warm and humid. However, when weather is cold, dry, or extremely hot, empirically treating all CAP patients for LD might contribute to excessive antimicrobial drug use at a population level.","Simmering, Jacob E.; Polgreen, Linnea A.; Hornick, Douglas B.; Sewell, Daniel K.; Polgreen, Philip M.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29048279/; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2311.170137,93

608122,Risk assessment and toxicological research on micro‐ and nanoplastics after oral exposure via food products,2020-11-26,"Throughout the covid-19 emergency, health authorities have presented contagion data divided by administrative regions with no reference to the type of landscape, environment or development model. This study has been conducted to understand whether there is a correlation between the number of infections and the different rural landscapes of the country. Italy’s rural landscape can be classified in four types, according to the intensity of energy inputs used in the agricultural process, socioeconomic and environmental features. Type A includes areas of periurban agriculture surrounding the metropolitan cities, type B areas of intensive agriculture with high concentration of agroindustry, type C hilly areas with highly diversified agriculture and valuable landscape, and type D high hills and mountains with forests and protected areas. Areas A and B are located in the plains, covering 21% of the territory and accounting for 57% of the population. They produce most of the added value, consume high levels of energy and represent the main source of pollution. Areas C and D cover 79% of the territory and 43% of the population. We find that provinces with 10% more type C and D areas exhibit on average 10% fewer cases of contagion. The result is statistically significant, after controlling for demographic, economic and environmental characteristics of the provinces. The pollution produced in more energy-intensive landscape has triggered an intense debate of how to ensure the economic competitiveness of Italian agriculture, without compromising environmental integrity or public health. Our findings speak to this debate, by suggesting that planning for more rural territory with lower energy inputs may come with the added benefit of new development opportunities and decreasing the exposure of the population to covid-19. Cost benefit-analyses should take into account that policies aimed at revitalizing more rural areas may reduce the economic impact of covid-19 and of potential future pandemics.","Agnoletti, Mauro; Manganelli, Simone; Piras, Francesco",Landsc Urban Plan,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016920462030815X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994653/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920462030815X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103955,93

During the pandemic, people have been forced to experience new ways of interacting, working, learning, shopping, traveling, and eating meals. A critical question going forward is how these experiences have actually changed preferences and habits in ways that might persist after the pandemic ends. Many observers have suggested theories about what the future will bring, but concrete evidence has been lacking. We present evidence on how much US adults expect their own postpandemic choices to differ from their prepandemic lifestyles in the areas of telecommuting, restaurant patronage, air travel, online shopping, transit use, car commuting, uptake of walking and biking, and home location. The analysis is based on a nationally representative survey dataset collected between July and October 2020. Key findings include that the “new normal” will feature a doubling of telecommuting, reduced air travel, and improved quality of life for some.","Salon, Deborah; Conway, Matthew Wigginton; Capasso da Silva, Denise; Chauhan, Rishabh Singh; Derrible, Sybil; Mohammadian, Abolfazl (Kouros); Khoeini, Sara; Parker, Nathan; Mirtich, Laura; Shamshiripour, Ali; Rahimi, Ehsan; Pendyala, Ram M.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2106499118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140349/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14708v2.pdf,93

We explored the impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support in Austria. METHODS: Adult Austrian residents (n = 560) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about their experiences during Covid-19 lockdown (15 March-15 April 2020). Instruments measuring capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and mental well-being (WHO-5) were used in association with six pre-defined vulnerabilities using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: 31% of the participants reported low mental well-being and only 30% of those with a history of mental health treatment received treatment during lockdown. Past mental health treatment had a significant negative effect across all outcome measures with an associated capability well-being score reduction of − 6.54 (95%CI, − 9.26, − 3.82). Direct Covid-19 experience and being ‘at risk’ due to age and/or physical health conditions were also associated with significant capability deprivations. When adjusted for vulnerabilities, significant capability reductions were observed in association with increased levels of depression (− 1.77) and anxiety (− 1.50), and significantly higher capability levels (+ 3.75) were associated with higher levels of social support. Compared to the cohort average, individual capability impacts varied between − 9% for those reporting past mental health treatment and + 5% for those reporting one score higher on the social support scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to assess the capability limiting aspects of lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities alongside their impacts on mental health and social support. The negative capability well-being, mental health and social support impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown were strongest for people with a history of mental health treatment. Future public health policies concerning lockdowns should pay special attention to improve social support levels in order to increase public resilience.

We hypothesised that this anxiety will be associated with increased pain in chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM). Methods: To study this, we carried out a 10-day online survey with 58 female participants, diagnosed with FM and no other pain condition. We identified which aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic evoked anxiety. We then asked participants to provide daily ratings of both anxiety and pain on 101-point visual analogue scales (VAS). Key participant characteristics were included as mediators in a mixed-effects analysis, where the primary outcome was pain VAS. Results: We found that participants were most often anxious about ""impact on relationships"", ""a family member contracting COVID-19"", and ""financial hardship"", but on average rated ""financial hardships"", ""access to medication"", and ""home loss/eviction"" as evoking the strongest anxiety. Mixed-effects modelling showed that an increase in pain was significantly associated with an increase in anxiety, when taking into account individual variance and daily caffeine intake. Age and intake of some mild analgesics were also linked to stronger pain. Conclusion: Our results extend the initial findings from the literature about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on chronic pain sufferers. We found that not only is pandemic anxiety in FM patients present, but it is associated with amplified self-assessed chronic pain.","Kharko, A. Y.; Hansford, K. J.; Furlong, P. L.; Hall, S.

El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo comparar los parámetros de la epidemia de COVID-19 en Turquía con los diez principales países que informaron el mayor número de casos confirmados en todo el mundo el 25 de abril de 2020. Además, podría proporcionar una mejor comprensión del papel de las medidas nacionales en el curso de la enfermedad mediante el cálculo de la tasa de letalidad. Métodos: Se realizó una búsqueda detallada de los sitios web oficiales del Centro de Ciencias e Ingeniería de Sistemas de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, y se realizaron anuncios entre el 22 de enero y el 25 de abril de 2020. Se obtuvieron los datos relevantes de la distribución de la infección en cada día informado. Resultados: Aunque la tasa de crecimiento aumentó bruscamente en más del 1,2% a fines de enero de 2020, el número acumulado de casos se mantuvo por debajo de los 1.500 en todo el mundo. La curva de crecimiento epidémico en Turquía fue muy similar a la de Estados Unidos e Italia durante el período. La tasa de letalidad en Turquía fue del 2,51%, que está por debajo de los países con la mayoría de los casos, excepto Rusia, y la tasa de recuperación y mortalidad parecía estar en un nivel moderado entre estos países. Conclusiones: Debido a que no existen tratamientos estándar para la enfermedad, es importante evitar la infección o una mayor propagación.

Introduction: The outbreak rapidly spread to more than 200 countries and led to millions of confirmed cases as well as thousands of deaths worldwide. This makes a serious threat to the world in terms of public health. The present study aimed to compare the COVID-19 epidemic parameters in Turkey with the top ten countries that reported the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide on April 25, 2020. Plus, it might provide better insight into the efficacy of national interventions on the course of the disease by measuring the case-fatality rate. Methods: A detailed search of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering official websites, and announcements were conducted between January 22 and April 25, 2020. COVID-19 related datasets for the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results: Although the growth rate sharply increased by more than 1.2% in the late January 2020, the cumulative number of cases remained below 1,500 around the world. The epidemic growth curve in Turkey was very similar to the US and Italy during the period. The case-fatality rate in Turkey was 2.51%, which below the countries with the most cases, except Russia, and the recovery-death ratio appeared to be at a moderate level among these countries. Conclusions: Since there are no standard treatments for the disease, it is important to avoid infection or further spreading.

We developed a simplified and novel preparation method using a Chelex resin that obviates RNA extraction during viral testing. Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital-droplet PCR was compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat-treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow. Furthermore, the initial sample heating step inactivates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, thus improving workflow safety. This fast RNA preparation and detection method is versatile for a variety of samples, safe for testing personnel, and suitable for standard clinical collection and testing on high throughput platforms.","Guan, Bin; Frank, Karen M.; Maldonado, José O.; Beach, Margaret; Pelayo, Eileen; Warner, Blake M.; Hufnagel, Robert B.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532808/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250790v1?rss=1,93

612056,Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Novel COVID-19 via Fractional order Mathematical Model,2020-12-10,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an outbreak that caused serious threats to people worldwide. Police officers are one of those frontline fighters during pandemic. Our study is the first to examine psychological health response among police officers in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional study design with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among police officers from Dessie town from June 20 to July 10, 2020. A total of 385 questionnaires were completed correctly accounting for 91% of the total. The data were collected by using demographic information and psychological health assessment tools. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Brief Resilient Coping Scale questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, sleep, and coping status of participants. Results: The rate of depression was found to be 28.9%. Of these, 19.7% had mild, 7.3% had moderate, 1.6 had moderate–severe, and 0.3% had severe depression symptoms. The rate of general anxiety symptoms was found to be 30.2%. Of these, 22.1% of the police officers had mild, 2.6% had moderate, and 5.5% had severe anxiety. Moreover, 13.8% of police officers had subthreshold insomnia and 2.1% had clinical (moderate–severe) insomnia. Participants who are men, married, highly resilient, and have high social support were associated with lower depression, anxiety, and insomnia scores than those of women, being single or widowed/divorced, low resilient coping score, and low social support, respectively. Conclusion: A psychological health problem was found to be higher among police officers in Dessie town. Younger age, sex, marital status, having chronic diseases, coping, and social support with depression, general anxiety, and insomnia were found to be significantly associated with psychological health problems. There is a need for mental health services, support, and care of police officers during the pandemic.","Tsehay, Mekonnen; Necho, Moges; Gelaye, Habtam; Beyene, Abeba; Birkie, Mengesha",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.713954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566792/,93

Oseltamivir, the most common drug to block the viral life cycle by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA) enzyme, has been less effective in some resistant cases due to the virus mutation. Presently, the binding of 10 chalcone derivatives towards H5N1 and H1N1 NAs in the non-catalytic and catalytic sites was studied using molecular docking. The in silico study was also conducted for its drug-like likeness such as Lipinski Rule, mutagenicity, toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles. The result demonstrates that two chalcones (1c and 2b) have the potential for future NA inhibitor development. Compound 1c inhibits H5N1 NA and H1N1 NA with IC(50) of 27.63 µM and 28.11 µM, respectively, whereas compound 2b inhibits NAs with IC(50) of 87.54 µM and 73.17 µM for H5N1 and H1N1, respectively. The in silico drug-like likeness prediction reveals that 1c is 62% better than 2b (58%) in meeting the criteria. The results suggested that 1c and 2b have potencies to be developed as non-competitive inhibitors of neuraminidase for the future development of anti-influenza drugs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The women diagnosed with COVID‐19 and hospitalised at a tertiary hospital were included. They completed the Introductory Data Form, the Female Sexual Function Index‐(FSFI) and the Short Form‐36 Quality of Life Scale (SF‐36). RESULTS: Fifteen women between the ages of 19‐49 who completed the treatment protocol, discharged at least 14 days before and who had not been diagnosed as sexual dysfunction; sexually active earlier were included in the study. It was detected that weekly sexual intercourse before and after COVID‐19 significantly differed (P = .047). The frequency of relationships decreased statistically after COVID‐19. The mean value of the FSFI satisfaction score differs from COVID‐19 before and after diagnosis (P = .012). The mean satisfaction score before COVID‐19 was 3.47, and after COVID‐19 was 2.93. The score of the subgroups of FSFI did not differ from COVID‐19 before and after diagnosis (P > .050). The median value of SF‐36 pain differs from COVID‐19 before and after diagnosis (P = .008).

From this point of view, they serve as important drug targets. Recently, the involvement of these enzymes in the development of Alzheimer's disease was discovered. The existence of homologs of these enzymes in invertebrates indicates that these enzyme systems are highly conserved during evolution. Most invertebrates lack a closed circulatory system, which excludes the need for blood pressure regulators. Therefore, these organisms represent excellent targets for gaining new insights and revealing additional physiological roles of these important enzymes.

OUTCOMES: Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. EVIDENCE: Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. VALUES: Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. SPONSORS: The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit (III-C). 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for symptoms of and risk factors for SARS (III-C). 3. Upon arrival in the labour triage unit, pregnant patients with suspected and probable SARS should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour. All labour and delivery units caring for suspected and probable SARS should have available at least one room in which patients can safely labour and deliver while in need of airborne isolation (III-C). 4. If possible, labour and delivery (including operative delivery or Caesarean section) should be managed in a designated negative pressure isolation room, by designated personnel with specialized infection control preparation and protective gear (III-C). 5. Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS (III-C). 6. Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother’s period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period (III-C). 7. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols (III-C). 8. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient (III-C). 9. All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus (III-A). 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centres, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses (III-A).","Maxwell, Cynthia; McGeer, Alison; Tai, Kin Fan Young; Sermer, Mathew",J Obstet Gynaecol Can,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2017.04.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729104/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216317304644; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216317304644,93

An impressive high transmission rate allows COVID-19 conferring enormous challenge for clinicians worldwide, and developing to a pandemic level. Combined with a series of complications, a part of COVID-19 patients progress into severe cases, which critically contributes to the risk of fatality. To date, coagulopathy has been found as a prominent feature of COVID-19 and severe coagulation dysfunction may be associated with poor prognosis. Coagulopathy in COVID-19 may predispose patients to hypercoagulability-related disorders including thrombosis and even fatal vascular events. Inflammatory storm, uncontrolled inflammation-mediated endothelial injury and renin angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation are the potential mechanisms. Ongoing efforts made to develop promising therapies provide several potential strategies for hypercoagulability in COVID-19. In this review, we introduce the clinical features of coagulation and the increased vascular thrombotic risk conferred by coagulopathy according to present reports about COVID-19.

Since then, the literature on the effects of this disease has been increasing. Chagas disease is more than 110 years old since its discovery, and the implications of these patients when co-infected with SARS-Cov-2 have not been reported. In this review, we summarize the studies to date on the cardiac affectations generated by both diseases in humans, describing their possible interrelation, the damage that coinfection could generate, the analysis of the treatment for both diseases and recommendations to avoid SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with Chagas disease. This is the first comprehensive review of cardiac disorders that can manifest in chagasic patients as a result of coinfection. ABSTRACT: Background: Chagas disease is considered a neglected tropical disease. The acute phase of Chagas disease is characterized by several symptoms: fever, fatigue, body aches, headache and cardiopathy’s. Chronic phase could be asymptomatic or symptomatic with cardiac compromise. Since the emergence of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cardiovascular involvement has been identified as a complication commonly reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the lack of knowledge of the cardiac affectations that this virus could cause in patients with Chagas disease, the aim of this review is to describe the possible cardiac affectations, as well as the treatment and recommendations that patients with both infections should carry out. Methods: The authors revised the recent and relevant literature concerning the topic and discussed advances and limitations of studies on COVID-19 and their impact in Chagas disease patients, principally with cardiac affectations. Results: There currently exists little information about the consequences that Chagas disease patients can suffer when they are infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: This review highlights the emerging challenges of access to medical care and future research needs in order to understand the implications that co-infections (SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses) can generate in Chagas disease-infected people.","Diaz-Hernandez, Alejandro; Gonzalez-Vazquez, Maria Cristina; Arce-Fonseca, Minerva; Rodriguez-Morales, Olivia; Cedilllo-Ramirez, Maria Lilia; Carabarin-Lima, Alejandro",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10050411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066383/,93

We sought to describe the six-month outcomes of heart transplant (HT) recipients infected by COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical and echocardiographic data from all HT recipients infected with COVID-19 between March and April 2020. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months or until death. Results Twenty-eight HT patients were studied, median age was 64 (range 59-69) and 22 were male. Co-morbidities included obesity (25%), diabetes (61%), HTN (71%), CKD (68 %) and chronic lung disease (36%). Eight patients died (29%) (non-survivors) and 20 survived (survivors) COVID-19 infection. All patients who survived the initial hospitalization period remained alive at 6 months (figure 1). There was no difference in the prevalence of co-morbidities between survivors and non-survivors. Survivors had lower peak ferritin (2185 ± 793 vs 18023 ± 16724, p= 0.04) and procalcitonin (0.8 ± 0.3 vs 104 ± 31, p<0.005). Baseline allograft function was similar between survivors and non-survivors and it remained unchanged at 6 months for the survivors’ group (LVEF baseline: 58 ± 1% vs LVEF 6 m 61 ± 3%). Renal function returned to baseline in 85% of survivors at 6 months after hospitalization. Mycophenolate mofetil was held during the acute infection and was resumed after discharge. At 6 months follow-up, all patients returned to their baseline immunosuppression regimen, have no further symptoms of COVID-19 and there have been no subsequent rejection events. Conclusion COVID-19 infection is associated with a high fatality rate (29%) among HT recipients, however, HT recipients that survive the acute COVID-19 infection have preserved allograft function and end-organ function has returned to baseline at 6 months follow-up.","Diakos, N.; Latif, F.; Takeda, K.; Clerkin, K.; Habal, M.; Naka, Y.; Restaino, S.; Oh, K.; Sayer, G.; Farr, M.; Uriel, N.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249821003879; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249821003879,93

In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of COS on the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids. The pharmacological effects such as antiviral activity improvement by COS were verified by MDCK cell damage inhibition rate after influenza virus propagation. The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract could be improved by COS. Meanwhile, COS at the same low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P(app)-value for phenolic acids compared to the control group (p < 0.05), and was all safe for the Caco-2 cells. The observations from single-pass intestinal perfusion in situ model showed that the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids can be enhanced by COS. Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of phenolic acids might be saturable in different intestine sites. In pharmacokinetics study, COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg improved the bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg prevented MDCK cell damage upon influenza virus propagation better than that of control. All findings above suggested that COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg might be safe and effective absorption enhancer for improving the bioavailability of phenolic acids and the antiviral activity in vitro in Flos Lonicerae extract.","Zhou, Wei; Shan, Jinjun; Tan, Xiaobin; Zou, Jiashuang; Yin, Ailing; Cai, Baochang; Di, Liuqing",Phytomedicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711313002833; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2013.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24035225/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711313002833,93

However, it is generally difficult to estimate the joint impact of different control strategies. In this paper, we tackle this question with an extended epidemic SEIR model, informed by a socio-political classification of different interventions. First, we inquire the conceptual effect of mitigation parameters on the infection curve. Then, we illustrate the potential of our model to reproduce and explain empirical data from a number of countries, to perform cross-country comparisons. This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs. For instance, our results suggest that, while rapid and strong lockdown is an effective pandemic mitigation measure, a combination of social distancing and early contact tracing can achieve similar mitigation synergistically, while keeping lower isolation rates. This quantitative understanding can support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions, to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks. This paper also provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model.","Proverbio, Daniele; Kemp, Françoise; Magni, Stefano; Husch, Andreas; Aalto, Atte; Mombaerts, Laurent; Skupin, Alexander; Gonçalves, Jorge; Ameijeiras-Alonso, Jose; Ley, Christophe",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019589/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252019,93

However, little is known about their clinical performance. Here, we compared two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. METHODS: 103 specimens from 48 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays by Abbott and EUROIMMUN (EI). Duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance were calculated. RESULTS: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 99.4% (95% CI; 96.41-99.98%), and sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3 days post symptom onset, 30.0% (95% CI; 11.89-54.28) at 3-7d, 47.8% (95% CI; 26.82-69.41) at 8-13d and 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at ≥14d. Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative. The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at ≥14d if borderline results were considered positive. The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay.

619087,The Toxicology Investigators Consortium 2020 Annual Report,2021-09-17,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 poses a higher risk of complications in obese patients due to low respiratory system compliance, increased inflammatory cytokines, and an activated immune system secondary to excess adiposity. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has significant anti-inflammatory effects and reduces inflammatory cytokines. It is noninvasive and approved for pain management and musculoskeletal injuries. Data from human and experimental animal models of respiratory tract disease suggests that LLLT reduces inflammation and promotes lung healing. CASE AND OUTCOMES: A morbidly obese 32-year-old Asian female with severe COVID-19 received four consecutive once-daily LLLT sessions via a laser scanner. Pulsed 808 nm and 905 nm laser beams were delivered over the posterior chest for 28 min. The patient was evaluated before and after LLLT by radiological assessment of lung edema (RALE) on chest X-ray, oxygen requirements and saturation, pneumonia severity indices (SMART-COP and Brescia-COVID), blood inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, ferritin, and C-Reactive protein (CRP)). Prior to treatment, oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) via pulse oximetry was 88%–93% on 5–6 L oxygen. Following LLLT, SpO(2) increased to 97%–99% on 1–3 L oxygen. Reductions in RALE score from 8 to 3, Brescia-COVID from 4 to 0, and SMART-COP from 5 to 0 were observed. Interleukin-6 decreased from 45.89 to 11.7 pg/mL, ferritin from 359 to 175 ng/mL, and CRP from 3.04 to 1.43 mg/dL. Post-treatment, the patient noted appreciable improvement in respiratory symptoms.

619351,Coronavirus pandemic: treatment and future prevention,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND: The reasons why some patients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia and others do not are unclear. To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia. METHODS: Using clinically validated antibody panels we studied leukocytes from 29 patients with PCR-proven COVID-19. Ten were hypoxic requiring ventilatory support, eleven were febrile but otherwise well, and eight were convalescing having previously required ventilatory support. Additionally, we analysed patients who did not have COVID-19 but received ventilatory support for other reasons. We examined routine Full Blood Count (FBC) specimens that were surplus to routine diagnostic requirements; normal ranges were established in a historic group of healthy volunteers. FINDINGS: We observed striking and unexpected differences in cells of the innate immune system. Levels of CD11b and CD18, which together comprise Complement Receptor 3 (CR3), were increased in granulocytes and monocytes from hypoxic COVID-19 patients, but not in those with COVID-19 who remained well, or in those without COVID-19 but ventilated for other reasons. Granulocyte and monocyte numbers were unchanged, however Natural Killer (NK) cell numbers were two-fold higher than normal in COVID-19 patients who remained well. INTERPRETATION: CR3 is central to leukocyte activation and subsequent cytokine release in response to infection. It is also a fibrinogen receptor, and its over-expression in granulocytes and monocytes of patients with respiratory failure tables it as a candidate effector of both the thrombotic and inflammatory features of COVID-19 pneumonia, and both a biomarker of impending respiratory failure and potential therapeutic target. NK cells are innate immune cells that retain immunological memory. Rapid expansion of memory NK cells targeting common antigens shared with other Coronaviruses may explain why most patients with COVID-19 do not develop respiratory complications. Understanding the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-may uncover why most infected individuals experience mild symptoms, and inform a preventive approach to COVID-19 pneumonia in the future.","Gupta, Rajeev; Gant, Vanya Alasdair; Williams, Bryan; Enver, Tariq",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220306329; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220306329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771640/,93
619616,Online network monitoring,2021-09-15,"Abstract: Asthma is a heterogeneous respiratory disease reflecting distinct pathobiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are based, at least partly, on different genetic factors shared by many other conditions, such as allergic diseases and obesity. Investigating the shared genetic effects enables better understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic correlations and is less subject to confounding by environmental factors. The increasing availability of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for asthma has enabled researchers to examine the genetic contributions to the epidemiological associations between asthma subtypes, and those between coexisting diseases/traits and asthma. Studies have found not only shared but also distinct genetic components between asthma subtypes, indicating that the heterogeneity is related to distinct genetics. This review summarizes a recently compiled analytical approach—genome-wide cross-trait analysis—to determine shared and distinct genetic architecture. The genome-wide cross-trait analysis features in several analytical aspects: genetic correlation, cross-trait meta-analysis, Mendelian randomization, polygenic risk score and functional analysis. In this article, we discuss in detail the scientific goals that can be achieved by these analyses, their advantages and limitations. We also make recommendations for future directions: 1) ethnicity-specific asthma GWASs, and 2) application of cross-trait methods to multi-omics data to dissect the heritability found in GWAS. Finally, these analytical approaches are also applicable to complex and heterogeneous traits beyond asthma.","Zhu, Zhaozhong; Hasegawa, Kohei; Camargo, Carlos A.; Liang, Liming",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693092/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920309660; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920309660?v=s5,93
619795,Fear of nuclear power? Evidence from Fukushima nuclear accident and land markets in China,2016-07-03,"BACKGROUND: : A novel coronavirus disease that emerged in China in December 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic all over the world, leading to 823,626 people diagnosed and 40,598 deaths globally as of April 1, 2020. Nurses are providing care to patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization. To ensure adequate response capacity and to maintain the health of nurses, it is important to analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift among frontline nurses. OBJECTIVE: : To analyse the actual work hours and preferred work hours per shift of nurses reports among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the influencing factors on the nurses reported preferred work hours. DESIGN: : Cross-sectional survey SETTING(S): This study was conducted in 10 designated hospitals providing treatments to patients with COVID-19 in China. PARTICIPANTS: Nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals in China. METHODS: : A questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to assess frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 cases in 10 designated hospitals. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the actual work hours, the nurses reported preferred work hours and factors influencing nurses reported preferred work hours among the frontline nurses. RESULTS: : A total of 109 nurses responded to the survey. The shift length exceeded the nurses’ preferred work hours [Median (interquartile range): 5.00 (2.00) h vs 4.00 (2.00) h; Minimum-Maximum: 4 - 12 h vs 4 - 8 h], and 60.55% (66/109) of the nurses regarded 4 h as the preferred number of work hours per shift. Five key themes associated with the influencing factors emerged, including circumstances; personal preventable equipment; the nurses’ physical and emotional needs of nurse; and the nurses’ safety needs and work intensity. CONCLUSIONS: : These findings suggest that there is a gap between the actual work hours and the nurses preferred work hours among frontline nurses in different units and different posts. The main influencing factors were circumstances, personal protective equipment, the nurses’ physical and emotional needs, and the nurses’ safety needs and work intensity.","Zhang, Xia; Jiang, Zhixia; Yuan, Xiaoli; Wang, Ying; Huang, Di; Hu, Rujun; Zhou, Jiamei; Chen, Fang",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnsa.2021.100026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666142X21000084?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666142X21000084,93

Admission activation of immune, thrombotic biomarkers and their ability to predict cardiac injury and mortality patterns in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 170 COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury at admission to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 29-March 8, 2020. Temporal evolution of inflammatory cytokines, coagulation markers, clinical, treatment and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 170 patients, 60 (35.3%) died early (<21d) and 61 (35.9%) died after prolonged stay. Admission lab work that correlated with early death were elevate levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (p<0.0001), Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a) (p=0.0025), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p<0.0001). We observed the trajectory of biomarker changes after admission, and determined that early mortality had a rapidly increasing D-dimer, gradually decreasing platelet and lymphocyte counts. Multivariate and simple linear regression models showed that death risk was determined by immune and thrombotic pathway activation. Increasing cTnI levels were associated with those of increasing IL-6 (p=0.03) and D-dimer (p=0.0021). Exploratory analyses suggested that patients that received heparin has lower early mortality compared to those who did not (p =0.07), despite similar risk profile. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury, admission IL-6 and D-dimer predicted subsequent elevation of cTnI and early death, highlighting the need for early inflammatory cytokine-based risk stratification in patients with cardiac injury.","Si, D.; Du, B.; Yang, B.; Jin, L.; Ni, L.; Zhang, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Azam, M.

Rubella virus (RUBV) assembles factories by recruitment of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), mitochondria and Golgi around modified lysosomes known as cytopathic vacuoles or CPVs. These organelles contain active replication complexes that transfer replicated RNA to assembly sites in Golgi membranes. We have studied the structure of RUBV factory in three dimensions by electron tomography and freeze-fracture. CPVs contain stacked membranes, rigid sheets, small vesicles and large vacuoles. These membranes are interconnected and in communication with the endocytic pathway since they incorporate endocytosed BSA-gold. RER and CPVs are coupled through protein bridges and closely apposed membranes. Golgi vesicles attach to the CPVs but no tight contacts with mitochondria were detected. Immunogold labelling confirmed that the mitochondrial protein p32 is an abundant component around and inside CPVs where it could play important roles in factory activities.","Fontana, Juan; López-Iglesias, Carmen; Tzeng, Wen-Ping; Frey, Teryl K.; Fernández, José J.; Risco, Cristina",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20655079/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210004332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210004332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.06.043,93

METHODS: The authors designed a benchtop experiment to evaluate spatter patterns after performing simulated occlusal surface preparations on three typodont teeth in a dental manikin. Fluorescein dye served as the marker to enable visualization of the spatter distribution. The authors compared the effectiveness of a nonisolated control consisting of high-volume evacuation (HVE) alone with that of two dry-field isolation techniques: a dental dam with HVE and the Isolite system (Isolite Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif). RESULTS: The authors performed a two-way analysis of variance. Both the Isolite device and the dental dam with HVE exhibited a significant decrease in the number of contaminated squares (P < .001) compared with that for the nonisolated control. In addition, overall, the results showed no statistically significant difference between the Isolite system and the dental dam with HVE (P = .126). CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed that use of a dental dam with HVE or the Isolite system significantly reduced spatter overall compared with use of HVE alone. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Isolation with a dental dam and HVE or with the Isolite system appears to aid in the reduction of spatter during operative dental procedures, potentially reducing exposure to oral pathogens.","Dahlke, William O.; Cottam, Michael R.; Herring, Matthew C.; Leavitt, Joshua M.; Ditmyer, Marcia M.; Walker, Richard S.",J Am Dent Assoc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817714611454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23115148/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002817714611454,93

In contrast to acute COVID-19 infection, which is usually mild in children, 68% of patients with MIS-C will need intensive care unit. Myocarditis and coronary artery ectasia/aneurysm are included between the main cardiovascular complications in MIS-C. Therefore, close clinical assessment is need it both at diagnosis and during follow-up. Echocardiography is the cornerstone modality for myocardial function and coronary artery evaluation in the acute phase. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) detects diffuse myocardial inflammation including oedema/fibrosis, myocardial perfusion and coronary arteries anatomy during the convalescence and in adolescents, where echocardiography may provide inadequate images. Brain involvement in MIS-C is less frequent compared to cardiovascular disease. However, it is not unusual and should be monitored by clinical evaluation and brain magnetic resonance (MRI), as we still do not know its effect in brain development. Brain MRI in MIS-C shows T2-hyperintense lesions associated with restricted diffusion and bilateral thalamic lesions. To conclude, MIS-C is a multisystem disease affecting many vital organs, such as heart and brain.

625459,Identification of house price bubbles using robust methodology: evidence from Polish provincial capitals,2021-09-28,"Over the past decades, substantial work has established that hemoglobin oxidation and heme release play a pivotal role in hemolytic/hemorrhagic disorders. Recent reports have shown that oxidized hemoglobins, globin-derived peptides, and heme trigger diverse biological responses, such as toll-like receptor 4 activation with inflammatory response, reprogramming of cellular metabolism, differentiation, stress, and even death. Here, we discuss these cellular responses with particular focus on their mechanisms that are linked to the pathological consequences of hemorrhage and hemolysis. In recent years, endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), have gained a lot of interest in connection with various human pathologies. Thus, many CO and H(2)S-releasing molecules have been developed and applied in various human disorders, including hemolytic and hemorrhagic diseases. Here, we discuss our current understanding of oxidized hemoglobin and heme-induced cell and tissue damage with particular focus on inflammation, cellular metabolism and differentiation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in hemolytic/hemorrhagic human diseases, and the potential beneficial role of CO and H(2)S in these pathologies. More detailed mechanistic insights into the complex pathology of hemolytic/hemorrhagic diseases through heme oxygenase-1/CO as well as H(2)S pathways would reveal new therapeutic approaches that can be exploited for clinical benefit.","Gáll, Tamás; Pethő, Dávid; Nagy, Annamária; Balla, György; Balla, József",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22010047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374506/,93

STUDY DESIGN For 34 European countries, publicly available data were collected on daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths, population size, healthcare capacity, government restrictions and their timing, tourism and change in mobility during the pandemic. METHODS Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models using different selection algorithms (forward, backward, stepwise and genetic algorithm) were analysed with height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak and time to the peak as dependent variables. RESULTS The proportion of the population living in urban areas, mobility at the day of first reported death and number of infections when borders were closed were assessed as significant predictors of the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak. Testing the model with variety of selection algorithms provided consistent results. Total hospital bed capacity, population size, number of foreign travellers and day of border closure, were found as significant predictors of time to COVID-19 daily deaths peak. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis demonstrated that countries with higher proportions of the population living in urban areas, with lower reduction in mobility at the beginning of the pandemic, and countries which closed borders having more infected people experienced higher peak of COVID-19 deaths. Greater bed capacity, bigger population size and later border closure could result in delaying time to reach the deaths peak, whereas a high number of foreign travellers could accelerate it.","Jabłońska, Katarzyna; Aballéa, Samuel; Toumi, Mondher",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892351/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.02.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621001104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621001104?v=s5,93

There are seven enzymes in the NOX family: NOX1-5 and dual oxidase (DUOX) 1–2. NOX enzymes in humans play important roles in diverse biological functions and vary in expression from tissue to tissue. Importantly, NOX2 is involved in regulating many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, including regulation of type I interferons, the inflammasome, phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, and cell signaling. DUOX1 and DUOX2 play important roles in innate immune defenses at epithelial barriers. This review discusses the role of NOX enzymes in normal physiological processes as well as in disease. NOX enzymes are important in autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and have also been implicated in acute lung injury caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Targeting NOX enzymes directly or through scavenging free radicals may be useful therapies for autoimmunity and acute lung injury where oxidative stress contributes to pathology.","Taylor, Jared P.; Tse, Hubert M.",Redox Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231721003190?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231721003190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627721/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.102159,93

This study presents outcome data from a children’s hospital in north‐west England, the region with the highest prevalence of COVID‐19 in England. Children and young people undergoing elective surgery isolated within their household for 14 days, then presented for real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respirator syndrome coronavirus disease‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) within 72 hours of their procedure (or rapid testing within 24 hours in high‐risk cases), and a screening questionnaire on admission. Planned surgery resumed on 26 May 2020; in the four subsequent weeks there were 197 patients for emergency and 501 for elective procedures. A total of 488 out of 501 (97.4%) elective admissions proceeded, representing a 2.6% COVID‐19‐related cancellation rate. There was no difference in the incidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 amongst children and young people who had or hadn’t isolated for 14 days (p > 0.99).

Interactions between B cells and CD8 T cells are not as well studied, although CD8 T cells exhibit an accelerated contraction after certain infections in B-cell-deficient mice. Here, we find that B cells significantly enhance primary CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Moreover, memory CD8 numbers and function are impaired in B-cell-deficient animals, leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial challenge. We also show that interleukin-27 production by B cells contributes to their impact on primary, but not memory, CD8 responses.

Neurosurgeons work with critically ill patients who were at particularly high risk for COVID and the pandemic produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow this continued care. This study explores the psychological impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. Methods Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30) two validated surveys prior to and during the pandemic. PSS scores may range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively amongst residents and statistically analyzed. Results The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 pre-pandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (p>0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 pre-pandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (p> 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively. Conclusion There were no significant changes in perceived stress or depressive symptoms during the pandemic.

This paper describes the methods used to develop and maintain the guidelines. Methods The guidelines use GRADE methods and are designed to meet Australian NHMRC standards. Each week, new evidence is reviewed, current recommendations are revised and new recommendations made. These are published in MAGIC and disseminated through traditional and social media. Relevant new questions to be addressed are continually sought from stakeholders and practitioners. For prioritised questions, the evidence is actively monitored and updated. Evidence surveillance combines horizon scans and targeted searches. An Evidence Team appraises and synthesises evidence and prepares evidence-to-decision frameworks to inform development of recommendations. A Guidelines Leadership Group oversees the development of recommendations by multidisciplinary Guidelines Panels and is advised by a Consumer Panel. Results and Discussion: The Taskforce formed in March 2020, and the first recommendations were published two weeks later. The guidelines have been revised and republished on a weekly basis for 24 weeks, and as of October 2020 contain over 90 treatment recommendations, suggesting that living methods are feasible in this context. Conclusions The Australian Guidelines for Care of People with COVID-19 provide an example of the feasibility of living guidelines, and an opportunity to test and improve living evidence methods.","Tendal, Britta; Vogel, Joshua P.; McDonald, Steve; Norris, Sarah; Cumpston, Miranda; White, Heath; Leder, Karin; Navarro, David Fraile; Cheyne, Saskia; Chakraborty, Samantha; Murano, Melissa; Millard, Tanya; Callesen, Henriette E.; Islam, Rakibul M.; Elliott, Julian; Turner, Tari",J Clin Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435620311744; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620311744?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188858/,93
628545,Green shoots.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a decrease of admissions to accident and emergency (A&E) departments after the local outbreaks of COVID-19. However, differential trends of admission counts, for example according to diagnosis, are less well understood. This information is crucial to inform targeted intervention. Therefore, we aimed to compare admission counts in German A&E departments before and after 12th march in 2020 with 2019 according to demographic factors and diagnosis groups. METHODS: Routine data of all admissions between 02.12.2019–30.06.2020 and 01.12.2018–30.06.2019 was available from six hospitals in five cities from north-western, eastern, south-eastern, and south-western Germany. We defined 10 diagnosis groups using ICD-10 codes: mental disorders due to use of alcohol (MDA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, back pain, fractures of the forearm, and fractures of the femur. We calculated rate ratios comparing different periods in 12.03.2020–30.06.2020 with 12.03.2019–30.06.2019. RESULTS: Forty-one thousand three hundred fifty-three cases were admitted between 12.03.2020–30.06.2020 and 51,030 cases between 12.03.2019–30.06.2019. Admission counts prior to 12.03. were equal in 2020 and 2019. In the period after 12.03., the decrease of admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 was largest between 26.03. and 08.04. (− 30%, 95% CI − 33% to − 27%). When analysing the entire period 12.03.-30.06., the decrease of admissions was heterogeneous among hospitals, and larger among people aged 0–17 years compared to older age groups. In the first 8 weeks after 12.03., admission counts of all diagnoses except femur fractures and pneumonia declined. Admissions with pneumonia increased in this early period. Between 07.05. and 30.6.2020, we noted that admissions with AMI (+ 13%, 95% CI − 3% to + 32%) and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis (+ 20%, 95% CI + 1% to + 44%) were higher than in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest differential trends of admission counts according to age, location, and diagnosis. An initial decrease of admissions with MDA, AMI, stroke or TIA, heart failure, COPD, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, and back pain imply delays of emergency care in Germany. Finally, our study suggests a delayed increase of admissions with AMI and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.","Jaehn, Philipp; Holmberg, Christine; Uhlenbrock, Greta; Pohl, Andreas; Finkenzeller, Thomas; Pawlik, Michael T.; Quack, Ivo; Ernstberger, Antonio; Rockmann, Felix; Schreyer, Andreas G.",BMC Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-021-00436-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823795/,93

Complement C4 is the most polymorphic protein in complement system. A plethora of research data demonstrated that individuals with C4 deficiency are prone to microbial infections and autoimmune disorders. In this review, we will discuss the diversity of complement C4 proteins and its genetic structures. In addition, the current development of the regulation of complement C4 activation and its activation derivatives will be reviewed. Moreover, the review will provide the updates on the molecule interactions of complement C4 under the circumstances of bacterial and viral infections, as well as autoimmune diseases. Lastly, more evidence will be presented to support the paradigm that links microbial infections and autoimmune disorders under the condition of the deficiency of complement C4. We provide such an updated overview that would shed light on current research of complement C4. The newly identified targets of molecular interaction will not only lead to novel hypotheses on the study of complement C4 but also assist to propose new strategies for targeting microbial infections, as well as autoimmune disorders.","Wang, Hongbin; Liu, Mengyao",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.694928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335607/,93

It often presents with fever, headache and myalgia, all of which have been commonly reported with COVID-19. Although the disease is usually mild with a good prognosis, there have been reports of severe illness and death. I present a case of murine typhus in a young male who had 2 weeks of headaches and daily fevers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To capture the lived experience of patients with prostate cancer and family members/caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a mixed-methods study of posts to two online networks. We compared all 6187 posts to the Inspire Us TOO Prostate Cancer online support and discussion community from December 2019 to April 2020, to 6926 posts from the same interval in 2019, applying a linguistic ethnography method. A similar analysis was performed using data from the Reddit discussion website (246 posts from 2019 and 260 posts from 2020). Manual qualitative analysis was performed for all 207 posts that mentioned COVID, COVID-19, or coronavirus. The computational linguistic ethnography analysis revealed a more collective tone in 2020, with increased concern about death. Our qualitative analysis showed that patients with prostate cancer and caregivers have concern about a variety of COVID-19–related impacts on care, including delays in testing and treatment. There was also substantial concern about the impact of having cancer on COVID-19 risk and access to COVID-19 care. Misinformation was present in 7% of COVID-19–related posts. In conclusion, online networks provide a useful source of real-world data from patients and their families, and analysis of these data highlighted a substantial impact of COVID-19 on prostate cancer care. PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed a study of online posts by patients with prostate cancer and their families on their perspectives about COVID-19. Concerns about the impact of COVID-19 included worry about delays in testing and treatment.

631129,Off-Patent Biological and Biosimilar Medicines in Belgium: A Market Landscape Analysis,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: Global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) remains a concern. The aim of this study is to describe how mass testing and phylogenetic analysis successfully prevented local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 VOC in a densely populated city with low herd immunity for COVID-19. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we conducted contact tracing, quarantine, and mass testing of the potentially exposed contacts with the index case. Epidemiological investigation and phylogeographic analysis were performed. FINDINGS: Among 11,818 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed till 13(th) May 2021 in Hong Kong, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were found in 271 (2.3%) cases. Except for 10 locally acquired secondary cases, all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were imported or acquired in quarantine hotels. The index case of this SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.351 epidemic, an inbound traveler with asymptomatic infection, was diagnosed 9 days after completing 21 days of quarantine. Contact tracing of 163 contacts in household, hotel, and residential building only revealed 1 (0.6%) secondary case. A symptomatic foreign domestic helper (FDH) without apparent epidemiological link but infected by virus with identical genome sequence was subsequently confirmed. Mass testing of 0.34 million FDHs identified two more cases which were phylogenetically linked. A total of 10 secondary cases were identified that were related to two household gatherings. The clinical attack rate of household close contact was significantly higher than non-household exposure during quarantine (7/25, 28% vs 0/2051, 0%; p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: The rising epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 VOC transmission could be successfully controlled by contact tracing, quarantine, and rapid genome sequencing complemented by mass testing.

633470,A model for the Twitter sentiment curve,2021-04-15,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in ~12% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a recent New York City cohort. Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased monolayer permeability, is a major component of ARDS. Vascular leak results in parenchymal accumulation of leukocytes, protein, and extravascular water, leading to pulmonary edema, ischemia, and activation of coagulation associated with COVID-19. Endothelial inflammation further contributes to uncontrolled cytokine storm in ARDS. We have recently demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor which promotes endothelial quiescence and monolayer integrity, is significantly reduced in experimental models of ARDS. Lung inflammation and high-tidal volume ventilation result in reduced KLF2, leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Mechanistically, we found that KLF2 is a potent transcriptional activator of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (RAPGEF3) which orchestrates and maintains vascular integrity. Moreover, KLF2 regulates multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS)-implicated ARDS genes. Whether lung KLF2 is regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here we report that endothelial KLF2 is significantly reduced in human lung autopsies from COVID-19 patients, which supports that ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 is a vascular phenotype possibly attributed to KLF2 down-regulation. We provide additional data demonstrating that KLF2 is down-regulated in SARS-CoV infection in mice.","Lee, Tzu-Han; Wu, David; Guzy, Robert; Schoettler, Nathan; Adegunsoye, Ayodeji; Mueller, Jeffrey; Hussein, Aliya; Sperling, Anne; Mutlu, Gökhan M.; Fang, Yun",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469586/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.15.426691,93

Research Question What patient characteristics in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with HAIs and how do HAIs associate with outcomes in these patients? Study Design and Methods Multicenter retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data including adult patients with severe COVID-19, admitted to 8 Italian hub hospitals from February 20, 2020, to May 20, 2020. Descriptive statistics, univariable and multivariable Weibull regression models were used to assess incidence, microbial etiology, resistance patterns, risk factors (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, exposure to medication), and impact on outcomes (i.e., ICU survival, length of ICU and hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation) of microbiologically-confirmed HAIs. Results Of the 774 included patients, 359 (46%) patients developed 759 HAIs (44.7 infections/1000 ICU patient-days, 35% multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (389, 50%), bloodstream infections (183, 34%), and catheter related blood stream infections (74, 10%) were the most frequent HAIs, with 26.0 (23.6-28.8) VAPs/1000 patient intubation-days, 11.7(10.1-13.5) BSIs/1000 ICU patient-days, and 4.7 (3.8-5.9) CRBSIs/1000 patient-days. Gram-negative bacteria (especially Enterobacterales) and Staphylococcus aureus caused 64% and 28% of VAPs. Variables independently associated with infection were age, PEEP and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic at admission. 234 patients (30%) died in ICU (15.3 deaths/1000 ICU patient-days). Patients with HAIs complicated by septic shock had almost doubled mortality (52% vs. 29%), while non-complicated infections did not affect mortality. HAIs prolonged mechanical ventilation (24(14-39) vs. 9(5-13) days; p<0.001), ICU and hospital stay (24(16-41) vs. 9(6-14) days, p=0.003; and (42(25-59) vs. 23(13-34) days, p<0.001). Interpretation Critically-ill COVID-19 patients are at high risk for HAIs, especially VAPs and BSIs due to MDR organisms. HAIs prolong mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and HAIs complicated by septic-shock almost doubled mortality.","Grasselli, Giacomo; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Mangioni, Davide; Scudeller, Luigia; Alagna, Laura; Bartoletti, Michele; Bellani, Giacomo; Biagioni, Emanuela; Bonfanti, Paolo; Bottino, Nicola; Coloretti, Irene; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; De Pascale, Gennaro; Ferlicca, Daniela; Fior, Gabriele; Forastieri, Andrea; Franzetti, Marco; Greco, Massimiliano; Guzzardella, Amedeo; Linguadoca, Sara; Meschiari, Marianna; Messina, Antonio; Monti, Gianpaola; Morelli, Paola; Muscatello, Antonio; Redaelli, Simone; Stefanini, Flavia; Tonetti, Tommaso; Antonelli, Massimo; Cecconi, Maurizio; Foti, Giuseppe; Fumagalli, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo; Ranieri, Marco; Viale, Pierluigi; Raviglione, Mario; Pesenti, Antonio; Gori, Andrea; Bandera, Alessandra",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221006796; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221006796?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857475/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.04.002,93

The plant is rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans. We introduce the concept of a cocktail of safe well-characterized natural products from the creosote bush that would represent a bridge between oriental herbal medicines and Western drug-based therapies.","Gnabre, John; Bates, Robert; Huang, Ru Chih",Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcme.2014.11.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2225411014000388; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411014000388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151022/,93

635415,Nonlinear Dynamical Analysis and Optimal Control Strategies for a New Rumor Spreading Model with Comprehensive Interventions,2021-09-15,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with that in a matched cohort with similar cardiovascular risk factors and the effects of DVT and PE on the hospital course. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8 ± 17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, −3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, −3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19–positive patients compared with a non–COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19–positive patients without DVT/PE. Advancements in DVT/PE prevention are needed for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.","Erben, Young; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Gloviczki, Peter; Stone, William; Quinones-Hinojoas, Alfredo; Meltzer, Andrew J.; Lin, Michelle; Greenway, Melanie R.F.; Hamid, Osman; Devcic, Zlatko; Toskich, Beau; Ritchie, Charles; Lamb, Christopher J.; De Martino, Randall R.; Siegel, Jason; Farres, Houssan; Hakaim, Albert G.; Sanghavi, Devang K.; Li, Yupeng; Rivera, Candido; Moreno-Franco, Pablo; O'Keefe, Nancy L.; Gopal, Neethu; Marquez, Christopher P.; Huang, Josephine F.; Kalra, Manju; Shields, Raymond; Prudencio, Mercedes; Gendron, Tania; McBane, Robert; Park, Myung; Hoyne, Jonathan B.; Petrucelli, Leonard; O'Horo, John C.; Meschia, James F.",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213333X2100175X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213333X2100175X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvsv.2021.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836287/,93

Defensive behaviors are triggered by activity in survival circuits that detects imminent threats and fear is the conscious emotion of that follows immediately. But this particular threat (COVID-19) is useable and mysterious, triggering anxieties much more than fear. We conducted a literature search on May 1, 2020 in Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and PubMed with search terms related to COVID-19 fears and found 28 relevant articles. We categorized the papers into six groups based on the content and implications: fear of the unknown, social isolation, hypochondriasis, disgust, information-driven fears, and compliance. Considering the nature of fear and anxiety, combined with the characteristics of the present COVID-19 situation, we contemplate that physicians and other health care workers of several specialties, as well as police officers, fire-fighters, and rescue personnel, and first responders might be more able to deal with COVID-19 if they have (a) some tolerance of the unknown, (b) low illness anxiety disorder, (c) tolerance to social isolation; (d) low levels of disgust sensitivity; (e) be granted financial support, (f) have priority if needed medical assistance (g) use caution relatively to the COVID-19 media coverage and (h) be trained to have high levels of efficacy.

Thus, this risk is a function of both the number of people and the area they occupy. However, the latter continues to evade the COVID-19 testing policy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze per capita COVID-19 testing data reported for Alabama to evaluate whether testing realignment along population density, rather than density agnostic per capita, would be more effective. METHODS: Descriptive statistical analyses were performed for population, density, COVID-19 tests administered, and positive cases for all 67 Alabama counties. RESULTS: Tests reported per capita appeared to suggest widespread statewide testing. However, there was little correlation (r=0.28, P=.02) between tests per capita and the number of cases. In terms of population density, new cases were higher in areas with a higher population density, despite relatively lower test rates as a function of density. CONCLUSIONS: Increased testing in areas with lower population density has the potential to induce a false sense of security even as cases continue to rise sharply overall.","Budhwani, Karim I; Budhwani, Henna; Podbielski, Ben",JMIRx Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725028/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22195,93

While older Americans and minority populations among others are known to be disadvantaged by the digital divide, few studies have examined disparities in telehealth specifically, and none during COVID-19. This study uses data from a large health system in NYC – the initial epicenter of the US crisis – to describe characteristics of patients seeking COVID-related care via telehealth, ER, or office encounters during the peak pandemic period. Demographic factors are significantly predictive of encounter type. Of any age group, patients 65+ had the lowest odds of using telehealth versus other modalities. By race and ethnicity, Black and Hispanic patients have lower odds of using telehealth versus either the ER or an office visit than either Whites or Asians – this remains true even after adjusting for age, comorbidities and preferred language.

640504,Critical warning! Preventing the multidimensional apocalypse on planet Earth,2020-08-05,"PURPOSE: Currently, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are the standard instruments used to compare arthroplasty results. Goodman et al. recently published a well-constructed scale with excellent psychometric properties that can be quickly administered. The main objective of our study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a Spanish version of the Goodman questionnaire in patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: The original Goodman scale was translated into Spanish and cross-culturally adapted. Then, the data from this version were tested for psychometric quality. We designed a cross-sectional study for data collection. This study enrolled 2 institutions. Patients who underwent hip replacement due to primary osteoarthritis secondary to dysplasia between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2019 were included. A total of 153 patients were contacted twice to record the Goodman and Oxford hip scales (OHS) to assess the validity of the questionnaire. Reliability was tested using the Cronbach’s alpha, Concordance using 3 test: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and the Bradley-Blackwood F test. The spearman correlation was used to asses correlation between the OHS and the Spanish-adapted Goodman scale. RESULTS: The overall satisfaction after THA was reported to be “very satisfied” by 137 patients (75%), and only 14 patients reported some degree of dissatisfaction (6%). The improvement in quality of life was reported to be “more than I ever dreamed possible” by 41% patients. Cronbach’s alpha was acceptable, reaching a coefficient of 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.82–1). No statistical difference (t test, p = 0.55) was found in the original version, with great internal validity. Test re-test concordance was optimal among the 3 tests used. A moderate correlation was found between the OHS and the Spanish-adapted Goodman scale. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the Goodman questionnaire in THA is a reliable, consistent, and feasible scale to evaluate patient satisfaction and improvement in the quality of life in Spanish speakers.

HS has a significant negative impact on both the quality of life (QOL) of patients affected by this disease as well as family members and caregivers. However, the pathogenesis of HS is multifactorial and still remains to be fully elucidated, which makes the development of treatments difficult. The last 10 years have seen a surge in HS research, and many new findings have come to light, yet much more remains to be elucidated. Physicians must employ a multidisciplinary approach to maximally address all facets of HS. Clinical characteristics of the disease that differ between females and males as well as across different races and ethnic groups must be considered. Targeted topical, oral, and injectable therapies continue to be developed for HS as a greater understanding of the pathogenesis is reached. However, randomized controlled trials regarding dietary factors that may contribute to HS are needed to meet our patients’ growing concerns and questions about the role of diet in HS pathogenesis. Finally, improved outcome measures are needed to standardize HS severity and grading between physicians and clinical trials, and a more diverse representation of HS populations is needed in clinical trials.","Narla, Shanthi; Lyons, Alexis B.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H.",F1000Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26083.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884675/,93

Both neuropeptides prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of NF-kB and SREBP1 and SREBP2, transcriptions factors involved in proinflammatory reactions and lipid metabolism, respectively, and promoted CREB activation in infected monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and also a negative regulator of NF-kB.

We describe the seasonal variation in NHS Direct respiratory calls (a new source of primary care data) and estimate the contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to this variation. METHODS: Linear regression models were used to estimate the weekly contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to the volume of NHS Direct respiratory calls (England and Wales, 2002–2004, all ages and 0–4 years). RESULTS: Annual peaks in NHS Direct cough and difficulty breathing calls occurred in late December, with peaks in ‘cold/flu’ and fever calls occurring between November and April. The main explanatory variables were influenza (estimated to account for 72.5 calls per 100,000/year; 22% of ‘cold/flu’ calls; 15% of cough; and 13% of fever) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5 per 100,000; 33% of ‘cold/flu’ calls; 20% of cough; and 15% of fever (0–4 years)). CONCLUSIONS: It is estimated that respiratory viruses, notably influenza and RSV, are responsible for at least 50% of the seasonal variation in NHS Direct respiratory calls. These results provide estimates of the burden of specific respiratory diseases reported to NHS Direct, and will help interpret syndromic surveillance data used to provide early warning of rises in community morbidity.","Cooper, D.L.; Smith, G.E.; Edmunds, W.J.; Joseph, C.; Gerard, E.; George, R.C.",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445307006275; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445307006275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17582503/,93

Detecting the presence of an infectious virus in the collected sample is essential to analyze if a person can transmit infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). However, there have been no quantitative investigations conducted for infectious SARS‐CoV‐2 in clinical samples. Therefore, in the present study, a rapid and simple focus‐forming assay using the peroxidase‐antiperoxidase technique was developed to quantify infectious SARS‐CoV‐2 titers in 119 samples (n = 52, nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS]; n = 67, saliva) from patients with COVID‐19. Furthermore, the study findings were compared with the cycle threshold (Ct) values of real‐time RT‐PCR. The infectious virus titers in NPS samples and Ct values were inversely correlated, and no infectious virus could be detected when the Ct value exceeded 30. In contrast, a low correlation was observed between the infectious virus titers in saliva and Ct values (r = ‐0.261, p = 0.027). Furthermore, the infectious virus titers in the saliva were significantly lower than those in the NPS samples. Ten days after the onset of COVID‐19 symptoms, the infectious virus was undetectable, and Ct values were more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples. The results indicate that patients whose symptoms subsided 10 days after onset, with Ct values more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples, were less likely to infect others.","Hiroi, Satoshi; Kubota‐Koketsu, Ritsuko; Sasaki, Tadahiro; Morikawa, Saeko; Motomura, Kazushi; Nakayama, Emi E.; Okuno, Yoshinobu; Shioda, Tatsuo",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139026/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27145,93

However, the duration, degree of damage, and appropriate long-term use of antithrombotic strategies are unclear. Most COVID data are yielded from random clinical observations or autopsy of postmortem samples, while precise blood cellular data in survivors are insufficient. METHODS: We analyzed erythrocytes, circulating endothelial cells, and echinocytes by electron microscopy and flow cytometry in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 31) and matched healthy controls (n = 32) on admission and at hospital discharge. RESULTS: All patients experienced mild disease, none required pulmonary support, and all survived. Admission number of circulating endothelial cells was significantly (40-100 times) higher in COVID-19 patients. Cells were massively damaged by multiple fenestrae in membranes with diameter comparable to the size of supercapsid in SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus. COVID-19 also provoked formation of stacked aggregated erythrocytes capable of clogging microvascular bed and of diminishing oxygen supply. In some patients, such abnormalities persisted at hospital discharge revealing remaining intracellular penetration of SARS-CoV-2 where it may be replicated and returned to circulation. CONCLUSION: These observational and descriptive data suggest that persistent viral cell injury may cause blood vessel damage; their increased permeability resulted in tissue edema, inflammation, platelet activation, and augmented thrombosis. There is a residual blood cell damage following the acute phase in some COVID-19 survivors. Controlled outcome-driven trials are urgently needed for exploring optimal use of long-term antithrombotics and vascular protection strategies even after mild COVID-19.","Melkumyants, Arthur; Buryachkovskaya, Ludmila; Lomakin, Nikita; Antonova, Olga; Serebruany, Victor",Thromb. haemost,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1551-9911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482535/,93

We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms, by which some of these variants may contribute to disease, are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19.

However, the epigenetic and paracrine controls at work in trophectoderm differentiation are still to be fully elucidated and the creation of dedicated in vitro models is desirable to increase our understanding. Here we propose a novel approach based on the epigenetic conversion of adult dermal fibroblasts into trophoblast-like cells. The method combines the use of epigenetic erasing with an ad hoc differentiation protocol. Dermal fibroblasts are erased with 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) that confers cells a transient high plasticity state. They are then readdressed toward the trophoblast (TR) phenotype, using MEF conditioned medium, supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and inhibitors of the Activin/Nodal and FGF2 signaling pathways in low O(2) conditions. The method here described allows the generation of TR-like cells from easily accessible material, such as dermal fibroblasts, that are very simply propagated in vitro. Furthermore, the strategy proposed is free of genetic modifications that make cells prone to instability and transformation.

Influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims, but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in India. Here we report the presence of common respiratory viral pathogens in returning Hajj and Umrah pilgrims suffering from acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 2014-2015. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected from 300 consenting pilgrims with ARI in the past one week and tested for influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses using in-house standardized quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical features among the pathogen positive and negative patients were compared. The patients received symptomatic treatment and antivirals where appropriate and were followed telephonically to collect data on illness outcome. RESULTS: Ninety seven (32.3%) of the 300 participants were tested positive for any virus, most common being influenza viruses (n=33, 11%). Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human coronaviruses [n=26, 8.7%; OC43 (n=19, 6.3%) and C229E (n=7, 2.3%)], rhinovirus (n=20, 6%), adenoviruses (n=8, 2.6%), parainfluenza viruses (n=7, 2.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (n=3, 1%) and bocaviruses (n=2, 0.6%). Clinical features observed in pathogen positive and pathogen negative patients did not differ significantly. Eighteen influenza positive patients were treated with oseltamivir. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pilgrims returning from mass gatherings are often afflicted with respiratory pathogens with a potential to facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens across international borders. The study reinforces the need for better infection prevention and control measures such as vaccination, health education on cough etiquette and hand hygiene.","Koul, Parvaiz A.; Mir, Hyder; Saha, Siddhartha; Chadha, Mandeep S.; Potdar, Varsha; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Lal, Renu B.; Krishnan, Anand",Indian J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425224/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_890_17,93

It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. METHODS: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. RESULT: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test = −2.647, −2.171, P ˂ 0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test = 0.693, −2.177, P ˂ 0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test = −0.068, −1.549, P ˂ 0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient = 0.873, 0.734, P ˂ 0.001). CONCLUSION: In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.","Wang, L.",Med Mal Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243911/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X2030086X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X2030086X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,93
651307,An implementation of virtual white board using open CV for virtual classes,2021-03-10,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is amongst the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The unprecedented emergence of COVID-19 has mandated neurosurgeons to limit viral spread and spare hospital resources whilst trying to adapt management plans for TBI. We aimed to characterize how this affects decision-making on TBI management and drive strategies to cope with future expected waves. METHODS: Retrospective TBI data collection from a single tertiary referral unit was performed between: 01/04/2019 - 30/06/2019 ('Pre-Epidemic') and 01/04/2020 - 30/06/20 ('Epidemic'). Demographics, mechanism of injury, TBI severity, radiological findings, alcohol/anticoagulants/antiplatelets use, and management decisions were extracted. RESULTS: 646 TBI referrals were received in 'Pre-Epidemic' (N = 317) and 'Epidemic' (N = 280) groups. There was reduction in RTA-associated TBI (14.8 vs 9.3%; p = .04) and increase in patients on anticoagulants (14.2 vs 23.6%; p = .003) in the 'Epidemic' group. Despite similarities between other TBI-associated variables, a significantly greater proportion of patients were managed conservatively in local referring units without neurosurgical services (39.1 vs 56.8%; p < .0001), predominantly constituted by mild TBI. CONCLUSION: Despite COVID-19 public health measures, the burden of TBI remains eminent. Increases in local TBI management warrant vigilance from primary healthcare services to meet post-TBI needs in the community.","Manivannan, S; Sharouf, F; Mayo, I; Albaqer, H; Mehrez, M; Jaber, H; Nicholls, Z; Woodward, B O; Watkins, W J; Zaben, M",Brain Inj,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184612/; https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.1934731,93
651590,3D Printing and Continuous Flow Chemistry Technology to Advance Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in Developing Countries,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming an important part of epidemiological investigations of infectious diseases due to greater resolution and cost reductions compared to traditional typing approaches. Many public health and clinical teams will increasingly use WGS to investigate clusters of potential pathogen transmission, making it crucial to understand the benefits and assumptions of the analytical methods for investigating the data. We aimed to understand how different approaches affect inferences of transmission dynamics and outline limitations of the methods. METHODS: We comprehensively searched electronic databases for studies that presented methods used to interpret WGS data for investigating tuberculosis (TB) transmission. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Due to considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies, we present summary data with accompanying narrative synthesis rather than pooled analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. Despite the range of interpretation tools, the usefulness of WGS data in understanding TB transmission often depends on the amount of genetic diversity in the setting. Where diversity is small, distinguishing re-infections from relapses may be impossible; interpretation may be aided by the use of epidemiological data, examining minor variants and deep sequencing. Conversely, when within-host diversity is large, due to genetic hitchhiking or co-infection of two dissimilar strains, it is critical to understand how it arose. Greater understanding of microevolution and mixed infection will enhance interpretation of WGS data. CONCLUSIONS: As sequencing studies have sampled more intensely and integrated multiple sources of information, the understanding of TB transmission and diversity has grown, but there is still much to be learnt about the origins of diversity that will affect inferences from these data. Public health teams and researchers should combine epidemiological, clinical and WGS data to strengthen investigations of transmission.

This systematic literature review summarises extant evidence regarding this association, and explores differences observed between populations over sixty-five years and those younger than sixty-five. Methods: We reviewed articles and grey literature reporting at least one measure of physical activity and at least one mental disorder, in people of all ages. Results: From the 2263 abstracts screened, we extracted twenty-seven articles and synthesized the evidence regarding the association between physical (in)activity and one or more mental health outcome measures. We confirmed that physical activity is beneficial for mental health. However, the evidence was mostly based on self-reported physical activity and mental health measures. Only one study compared younger and elder populations, finding that increasing the level of physical activity improved mental health for middle aged and elder women (no association was observed for younger women). Studies including only the elderly found a restricted mental health improvement due to physical activity. Conclusions: We found inverse associations between levels of physical activity and mental health problems. However, more evidence regarding the effect of ageing when measuring associations between physical activity and mental health is needed. By doing so, prescription of physical activity could be more accurately targeted.","Maynou, Laia; Hernández-Pizarro, Helena M.; Errea Rodríguez, María",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947122/,93

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: General wards, single-centre tertiary hospital in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if ≥18 years, had COVID-19, required FiO2 ≥ 0.28 or oxygen flow rate ≥4 L/min and consented to positioning. Main outcome measures: Feasibility measures included barriers to therapy, assistance required, and comfort. Short-term change in oxygenation (SpO2) and oxygen requirements before and 15 minutes after positioning. RESULTS: Thirteen patients, mean age 75 (SD 14) years; median Clinical Frailty Scale score 6 (IQR 4 to 7) participated in 32 sessions of prone or modified prone positioning from a total of 125 ward-based patients admitted with COVID-19 who received physiotherapy intervention. Nine of thirteen patients (69%) required physiotherapy assistance and modified positions were utilised in 8/13 (62%). SpO2 increased in 27/32 sessions, with a mean increase from 90% (SD 5) pre-positioning to 94% (SD 4) (mean difference 4%; 95%CI 3 to 5%) after 15 minutes. Oxygen requirement decreased in 14/32 sessions, with a mean pre-positioning requirement of 8 L/min (SD 4) to 7 L/min (SD 4) (mean difference 2 L/min; 95%CI 1 to 3 L/min) after 15 minutes.

This situation had the potential to lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which could result in an increase in severe cases and deaths. This analysis was based on findings from a field visit, carried out between June 30(th) and July 1(st), 2020, to a warehouse, to two health facilities, and a meeting with a community health worker, and an descriptive epidemiologic data analysis of health information system (HIS) to evaluate trends of the number of people tested for malaria and number of malaria cases reported, by comparing data from 2018, 2019 and 2020 for the period between January and May. The two health facilities and the warehouse had about two months of stock of antimalarial drugs, and patients with malaria symptoms were being tested for malaria at the COVID-19 screening site. The HIS data showed that the number of reported malaria cases decreased by 3.0% (177.646/172.246) in April, and 7.0% (173.188/161.812) in May, when comparing 2019 and 2020 data. People tested for malaria in community increased by 39.0% (190.370/264.730), between 2019 and 2020. The COVID-19 may have had a negative impact on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in health facility (HF).

The process from discovery research, through clinical trials and regulatory approval often takes more than 10 years. However, the critical need to expedite vaccine availability in the pandemic has meant that new approaches to development, manufacturing, and regulation have been required: this has necessitated many stages of product development, clinical trials, and manufacturing to be undertaken in parallel at a global level. Through the development of these innovative products, the world has the best chance of finding individual, or combinations of, vaccines that will provide adequate protection for the world’s population. Despite the huge scientific and regulatory achievements and significant investment to accelerate vaccine availability, it is essential that safety measures are not compromised. Here we focus on the post regulatory approval testing by independent laboratories that provides an additional assurance of the safety and quality of a product, with an emphasis on the UK experience through the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), an expert centre of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).","Rose, Nicola J.; Stickings, Paul; Schepelmann, Silke; Bailey, Marc J.

654208,The history of chemical laboratories: a thematic approach,2021-06-22,"Background: The availability of an early diagnostic tool for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) would have major public health implications. We investigated whether the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be detected in serum and plasma samples during the early stages of SARS and studied the potential prognostic implications of such an approach. Methods: We developed two real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays, one for the polymerase and the other for the nucleocapsid region of the virus genome, for measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV RNA in serum/plasma samples from SARS patients. Plasma samples were obtained from 12 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, as well as on days 7 and 14 after fever onset. Serum samples were also obtained from 23 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, 11 of whom subsequently required intensive care. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma/serum samples. The extracted RNA was subjected to analysis by the RT-PCR assays. Results: The RT-PCR system for the polymerase region detected SARS-CoV RNA in 50% of plasma and 78% of serum samples from SARS patients during the first week of illness. The detection rates for plasma dropped to 25% at day 14 after fever onset. The median serum SARS-CoV concentrations in patients who required and did not require intensive care unit admission during the course of hospitalization were 5800 and 140 copies/mL, respectively (Mann–Whitney test, P <0.005). These data were confirmed by the RT-PCR system for the nucleocapsid region, which showed an even higher detection rate of 87%. The correlation between the results obtained by the two RT-PCR systems was high (Pearson correlation analysis, r = 0.998; P <0.001). Conclusion: Plasma/serum SARS-CoV quantification represents a potentially useful early diagnostic and prognostic tool for SARS.","Ng, Enders K O; Hui, David S; Chan, K C Allen; Hung, Emily C W; Chiu, Rossa W K; Lee, Nelson; Wu, Alan; Chim, Stephen S C; Tong, Yu K; Sung, Joseph J Y; Tam, John S; Lo, Y M Dennis",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633867/,93

Existing data does not provide enough information to understand factors associated with increased deaths in those with intellectual disability. Establishing who is at high risk is important in developing prevention strategies, given risk factors or comorbidities in people with intellectual disability may be different to those in the general population. AIMS: To identify comorbidities, demographic and clinical factors of those individuals with intellectual disability who have died from COVID-19. METHOD: An observational descriptive case series looking at deaths because of COVID-19 in people with intellectual disability was conducted. Along with established risk factors observed in the general population, possible specific risk factors and comorbidities in people with intellectual disability for deaths related to COVID-19 were examined. Comparisons between mild and moderate-to-profound intellectual disability subcohorts were undertaken. RESULTS: Data on 66 deaths in individuals with intellectual disability were analysed. This group was younger (mean age 64 years) compared with the age of death in the general population because of COVID-19. High rates of moderate-to-profound intellectual disability (n = 43), epilepsy (n = 29), mental illness (n = 29), dysphagia (n = 23), Down syndrome (n = 20) and dementia (n = 15) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study exploring associations between possible risk factors and comorbidities found in COVID-19 deaths in people with intellectual disability. Our data provides insight into possible factors for deaths in people with intellectual disability. Some of the factors varied between the mild and moderate-to-profound intellectual disability groups.

Vaccination with live attenuated strains of IBV-H120 and NDV-LaSota are important for the control of IB and ND. However, conventional live attenuated vaccines are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated chickens. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious vaccines. In this study, using a previously established reverse genetics system, we generated a recombinant IBV virus based on the IBV H120 vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of NDV. The recombinant virus, R-H120-HN/5a, exhibited growth dynamics, pathogenicity and viral titers that were similar to those of the parental IBV H120, but it had acquired hemagglutination activity from NDV. Vaccination of SPF chickens with the R-H120-HN/5a virus induced a humoral response at a level comparable to that of the LaSota/H120 commercial bivalent vaccine and provided significant protection against challenge with virulent IBV and NDV. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the IBV H120 strain could serve as an effective tool for designing vaccines against IB and other infectious diseases, and the generation of IBV R-H120-HN/5a provides a solid foundation for the development of an effective bivalent vaccine against IBV and NDV.","Yang, Xin; Zhou, Yingshun; Li, Jianan; Fu, Li; Ji, Gaosheng; Zeng, Fanya; Zhou, Long; Gao, Wenqian; Wang, Hongning",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2764-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26873815/,93

In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test, intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the 3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills subscales: self-care (p = 0.001), work and study (p = 0.013), career and education planning (p = 0.011) and looking forward/goal settings (p < 0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to those in the control group by decreasing their consumption of processed food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index (p = 0.827). Also, there was a significant change in the mental health status (p = 0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score decreased after 3 months of the intervention implementation. This intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy habits leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity amongst university students.

We aim to determine the prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and their associated factors among Libyan populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil war. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among the Libyan population between July 18 and August 23, 2020. The data collected included basic demographic characteristics, level of education, employment status, COVID-19-related questions, and questions about abuse and domestic violence. This study assessed the psychological status of participants who were screened for anxiety symptoms using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Depressive symptoms were also screened for using the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Binomial logistic regression was used to predict the probability of insomnia, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 10,296 responses were recorded. Among the participants, 4,756 (46.2%) obtained a cut-off score of ≥ 3 which indicated depressive symptoms. For anxiety, 1,952 participants (19%) obtained a cut-off score of ≥ 15, which indicated anxiety symptoms. For the ISI, the mean (SD) was 11.4 (6.1) for the following categories: no clinical insomnia (0–7) 3,132 (30.4%), sub-threshold insomnia (1–7) 3,747 (36.4%), moderate severity clinical insomnia (8–14) 2,929 (28.4%), and severe clinical insomnia (15–21) 488 (4.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms were statistically associated with age, marital status, education level, occupational category, financial problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, health status, having a COVID-19 infection, current health status, suicide ideation, abuse or domestic violence, and lockdown compliance (p < 0.05). The regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between anxiety symptoms and age, education level, occupational status, financial problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, having a COVID-19 infection, health status, suicide ideation, abuse or domestic violence, and lockdown compliance (p < 0.05). The regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between insomnia and all study variables with the exception of age, educational level, and occupational status (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Confronted with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Libyan population exhibited high levels of psychological stress manifested in the form of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while one-third of the Libyan population suffered from clinical insomnia.

661025,Meteorological factors and domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities: A time-series analysis,2020-04-18,"RNA interference (RNAi), also known as gene silencing, is a biological process that prevents gene expression in certain diseases such as cancer. It can be used to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of treatments, particularly genetic therapies. However, challenges such as delivery of oligonucleotide drug to less accessible parts of the body and the high incidence of toxic side effects are encountered. It is therefore imperative to improve their delivery to target sites and reduce their harmful effects on noncancerous cells to harness their full potential. In this study, the role of RNAi in the treatment of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus disease plaguing many countries, has been discussed. This review aims to ascertain the mechanism and application of RNAi and explore the current challenges of RNAi therapy by identifying some of the cancer delivery systems and providing drug information for their improvement. It is worth mentioning that delivery systems such as lipid-based delivery systems and exosomes have revolutionized RNAi therapy by reducing their immunogenicity and improving their cellular affinity. A deeper understanding of the mechanism and challenges associated with RNAi in cancer therapy can provide new insights into RNAi drug development.","Tian, Zhili; Liang, Guohui; Cui, Kunli; Liang, Yayu; Wang, Qun; Lv, Shuangyu; Cheng, Xiaoxia; Zhang, Lei",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.644718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796026/,93

We aimed at describing the characteristics of these patients, antibiotics used, and conditions for which they received antibiotics. We carried out a cross‐sectional study. Setting: Thirty Health Primary Care Areas from 12 regions in Spain, covering 5,960,191 inhabitants. Patients having at least 30 packages of antibacterials for systemic use dispensed in 2017 were considered. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of antibiotic use, conditions for which antibiotics were prescribed, clinical characteristics of patients, comorbidities, concomitant treatments, and microbiological isolates. Patient’s average age was 70 years; 52% were men; 60% smokers/ex‐smokers; 54% obese. Overall, 93% of patients had, at least, one chronic condition, and four comorbidities on average. Most common comorbidities were cardiovascular and/or hypertension (67%), respiratory diseases (62%), neurological/mental conditions (32%), diabetes (23%), and urological diseases (21%); 29% were immunosuppressed, 10% were dead at the time of data collection. Patients received three antibiotic treatments per year, mainly fluoroquinolones (28%), macrolides (21%), penicillins (19%), or cephalosporins (12%). Most frequently treated conditions were lower respiratory tract (infections or prophylaxis) (48%), urinary (27%), and skin/soft tissue infections (11%). Thirty‐five percent have been guided by a microbiological diagnosis, being Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and Escherichia coli (16%) the most frequent isolates. In conclusion, high antibiotic consumers in the community were basically elder, with multimorbidity and polymedication. They frequently received broad‐spectrum antibiotics for long periods of time. The approach to infections in high consumers should be differentiated from healthy patients receiving antibiotics occasionally.","Fernández‐Urrusuno, Rocío; Meseguer Barros, Carmen Marina; Anaya‐Ordóñez, Sonia; Borrego Izquierdo, Yolanda; Lallana‐Álvarez, María Jesús; Madridejos, Rosa; Tejón, Esther Marco; Sánchez, Raquel Prieto; Pérez Rodríguez, Olatz; García Gil, María; Escudero Vilaplana, Belén; Riádigos, Genma M.

Millions of people have lost their lives due to COVID-19. Therefore, the accurate early detection and identification of severe COVID-19 cases can reduce the mortality rate and the likelihood of further complications. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been shown to be effective in the detection and diagnosis of several diseases, including COVID-19. This study used ML algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and DL model (containing six layers with ReLU and output layer with sigmoid activation), to predict the mortality rate in COVID-19 cases. Models were trained using confirmed COVID-19 patients from 146 countries. Comparative analysis was performed among ML and DL models using a reduced feature set. The best results were achieved using the proposed DL model, with an accuracy of 0.97.

The aim of this study was to learn how COVID-19 influenced patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing in particular on psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients and methods: A prospective, single-centre and analytical observational study was carried out in the IBD unit in August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone. A descriptive analysis was carried out and subsequently the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through logistic regression multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 426 patients were included with a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10-16). A higher level of stress was reported by those who were not married, women and those who experienced an increase in IBD-related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress based on the PSS-10 questionnaire. Conclusions: Although the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has probably had a significant emotional impact on Spaniards with IBD, IBD patients in general had lower PSS-10 scores.","Refaie, Engy; Mateo, Sandra García; Domínguez, Samuel Jesús Martínez; Gargallo-Puyuelo, Carla Jerusalén; Quilez, Laura Lario; Carrera-Lasfuentes, Patricia; Villarino, María Teresa Arroyo; García, Fernando Gomollón",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570521001540?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.03.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570521001540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023473/,93

667165,Development of an online research platform for use in a large-scale multicentre study,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Minor injuries are very common in the pediatric population and often occur in the home environment. Despite its prevalence, little is known about outcomes in children following minor injury at home. Understanding the impact of these injuries on children and their families is important for treatment, prevention, and policy. The objectives of our study were (1) To describe the distribution of short-term outcomes following pediatric minor injuries sustained at home and (2) To explore the relationship of injury type and patient and household demographics with these outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 102) aged 0–7 years with a minor injury sustained at home were recruited in an urban pediatric emergency department as part of the Child Housing Assessment for a Safer Environment (CHASE) observational study. Each patient had a home visit following the emergency department visit, where five parent-reported outcomes were assessed. Relationships were explored with logistic regression. RESULTS: The most common type of injury was soft tissue (57.8 %). 13.2 % of children experienced ≥ 7 days of pain, 21.6 % experienced ≥ 7 days of abnormal activity, 8.9 % missed ≥ 5 days of school, 17.8 % of families experienced ≥ 7 days of disruption, and 9.1 % of parents missed ≥ 5 days of work. Families reported a total of 120 missed school days and 120 missed work days. Children who sustained a burn had higher odds of experiencing pain (OR 6.97), abnormal activity (OR 8.01), and missing school (OR 8.71). The parents of children who sustained a burn had higher odds of missing work (OR 14.97). CONCLUSIONS: Families of children suffering a minor injury at home reported prolonged pain and changes in activity as well as significant school and work loss. In this cohort, burns were more likely than other minor injuries to have these negative short-term outcomes reported and represent an important target for interventions. The impact of these injuries on missed school and disruption of parental work warrants further consideration.","Molloy, Matthew J; Shields, Wendy; Stevens, Molly W; Gielen, Andrea C",Inj Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896423/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-021-00307-z,93

METHODS: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1017 residents of Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, sex, and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among five policies restricting local movement and four border control policies) they would support in five randomly assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics, and perceived policy effectiveness. RESULTS: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies but was generally higher for border control policies compared with internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies, while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher-income, and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.

669141,Numerical computations and theoretical investigations of a dynamical system with fractional order derivative,2021-08-03,"After the first reported case of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil, in 2015, a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed. Microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant’s head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes ZIKV. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using the High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (toll-like receptor signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways (neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal system development) that are associated with these interactors. Our novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of ZIKV for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.","Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.; Karunakaran, Kalyani B.; Correa-Menéndez, Josefina",F1000Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.9364.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29333229/,93

On 22 March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help flatten the curve. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. Methods: An online survey was open from the 23 April 2020 to the 11 May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (including 95% confidence intervals) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. Results: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18 to 29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; difference=6.4%; 95%CI: 3.6, 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=-3.3%; 95%CI: -7.0, -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95%CI:-26.9, -19.8). Solo sex activities increased, 14.6% (123/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; difference= -14.8%; 95%CI: -17.6, -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95%CI:1.0, 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95%CI:10.1, 19.2) increased during lockdown. Conclusion: Although significant declines in sexual activity during lockdown were reported, people did not completely stop engaging in sexual activities during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of ensuring availability of normal sexual and reproductive health services during global emergencies.","Coombe, J.; Kong, F.; Bittleston, H.; Williams, H.; Tomnay, J.; Vaisey, A.; Malta, S.; Goller, J.; Temple-Smith, M.; Bourchier, L.; Lau, A.; Chow, E.; Hocking, J.

Qualitative analysis of confidence, complacency and convenience across risk groups",2021-08-12,"Vitamin D deficiency significantly correlates with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molecular docking-based virtual screening studies predict that novel vitamin D and related lumisterol hydroxymetabolites are able to bind to the active sites of two SARS-CoV-2 transcription machinery enzymes with high affinity. These enzymes are the main protease (M(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which play important roles in viral replication and establishing infection. Based on predicted binding affinities and specific interactions, we identified 10 vitamin D3 (D3) and lumisterol (L3) analogs as likely binding partners of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and RdRP and, therefore, tested their ability to inhibit these enzymes. Activity measurements demonstrated that 25(OH)L3, 24(OH)L3, and 20(OH)7DHC are the most effective of the hydroxymetabolites tested at inhibiting the activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) causing 10%–19% inhibition. These same derivatives as well as other hydroxylumisterols and hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites inhibited RdRP by 50%–60%. Thus, inhibition of these enzymes by vitamin D and lumisterol metabolites may provide a novel approach to hindering the SARS-CoV-2 infection. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Active forms of vitamin D and lumisterol can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery enzymes, which indicates that novel vitamin D and lumisterol metabolites are candidates for antiviral drug research.","Qayyum, Shariq; Mohammad, Taj; Slominski, Radomir M.; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz; Tuckey, Robert C.; Raman, Chander; Slominski, Andrzej T.",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181461/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00174.2021,93

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.","Villar, José; Ariff, Shabina; Gunier, Robert B.; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Rauch, Stephen; Kholin, Alexey; Roggero, Paola; Prefumo, Federico; do Vale, Marynéa Silva; Cardona-Perez, Jorge Arturo; Maiz, Nerea; Cetin, Irene; Savasi, Valeria; Deruelle, Philippe; Easter, Sarah Rae; Sichitiu, Joanna; Soto Conti, Constanza P.; Ernawati, Ernawati; Mhatre, Mohak; Teji, Jagjit Singh; Liu, Becky; Capelli, Carola; Oberto, Manuela; Salazar, Laura; Gravett, Michael G.; Cavoretto, Paolo Ivo; Nachinab, Vincent Bizor; Galadanci, Hadiza; Oros, Daniel; Ayede, Adejumoke Idowu; Sentilhes, Loïc; Bako, Babagana; Savorani, Mónica; Cena, Hellas; García-May, Perla K.; Etuk, Saturday; Casale, Roberto; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Ikenoue, Satoru; Aminu, Muhammad Baffah; Vecciarelli, Carmen; Duro, Eduardo A.; Usman, Mustapha Ado; John-Akinola, Yetunde; Nieto, Ricardo; Ferrazi, Enrico; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Langer, Ana; Kennedy, Stephen H.; Papageorghiou, Aris T.",JAMA Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885740/; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/articlepdf/2779182/jamapediatrics_villar_2021_oi_210025_1618590386.78485.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.1050,93

This system facilitates management of XML schemas and on-demand creation and management of XML databases that conform to these schemas. They illustrate the use of this system in an application for genotype–phenotype correlation analyses. This application implements a method of phenotype–genotype correlation based on phylogenetic optimization of large data sets of mouse SNPs and phenotypic data. The application workflow requires the management and integration of genomic information and phenotypic data from external data repositories and from the results of phenotype–genotype correlation analyses. Our implementation supports the process of carrying out a complex workflow that includes large-scale phylogenetic tree optimizations and application of Maddison's concentrated changes test to large phylogenetic tree data sets.

We hypothesized that blockade of the interleukin (IL)-6 signaling pathway with tocilizumab would decrease depression and related symptomatology in a longitudinal cohort of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) patients, a medically ill population with a significant inflammation and psychopathology. Patients undergoing allogeneic HCT received either a single dose of tocilizumab one day prior to HCT (n = 25), or HCT alone (n = 62). The primary outcome included depressive symptoms at 28 days post HCT; anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain were assessed at pretreatment baseline and days +28, +100, and +180 post HCT as secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression demonstrated that preemptive treatment with tocilizumab was associated with significantly higher depression scores at D28 vs. the comparison group (β = 5.74; 95% CI 0.75, 10.73; P = 0.03). Even after adjustment for baseline depressive symptoms, propensity score, and presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (grades II–IV) and other baseline covariates, the tocilizumab-exposed group continued to have significantly higher depression scores compared to the nonexposed group at D28 (β = 4.73; 95% CI 0.64, 8.81; P = 0.02). Despite evidence that IL-6 antagonism would be beneficial, blockade of the IL-6 receptor with tocilizumab among medically ill patients resulted in significantly more—not less—depressive symptoms.","Knight, Jennifer M.; Costanzo, Erin S.; Singh, Suraj; Yin, Ziyan; Szabo, Aniko; Pawar, Deepa S.; Hillard, Cecilia J.; Rizzo, J.

METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during January and February 2020 amongst the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used among 399 young adult participants. The questionnaire was developed keeping in view of the already published study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the available literature on COVID-19. It included sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge, beliefs regarding coronavirus and the perception of precautionary measures taken by an individual. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p<0.05 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS There were more females 299 (75%) than male participants 100 (25%). The mean age was 20.9 ±2.30 years and 232 (58%) had graduate degrees. There is lack of knowledge and awareness about coronavirus as 226 (56.6%) participants claimed that coronavirus is actually the most dangerous virus in the world, and 171 (43%) did know that the common flu virus is potentially more lethal than coronavirus. Although a large majority of participants correctly identified sources of transmission, measures and precautions to be taken for coronavirus, their knowledge for symptom identification was deficient. The most pursued platform for information for coronavirus was found to be social media, followed by television and print media. CONCLUSIONS The study highlighted the level of awareness of coronavirus among young adults in Karachi, Pakistan. The study further pointed out the public knowledge gaps for the authorities concerned to help them develop more effective and successful awareness campaigns using preferred channels.","Mubeen, Syed Muhammad; Kamal, Shaheera; Kamal, Sufiyan; Balkhi, Fizra",JPMA.

Meanwhile in the community, many other contained patients could only use self‐care strategies, especially in countries that have set up a long and strict containment such as France. The study aimed to compare coping strategies deployed by patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS; a poorly recognised syndrome) to those with better known and referenced chronic conditions. An online flash survey was conducted during the containment period in partnership with French Patients Organizations including ME/CFS national association. Therefore, ‘Brief COPE’ version of Lazarus and Folkman's Ways of Coping Check List has been adapted to the specificity of the containment. The survey was e‐distributed in France from 15 April to 11 May 2020. Differences of coping strategies were analyzed using Wilcoxon–Mann–Withney test. Amongst 637 responses, 192 were complete, presenting a wide variety of diseases, including 93 ME/CFS. The latter have significantly different coping strategies than recognised diagnosed diseases patients: similar uses of emotion focused coping but less uses of seek social support and problem‐focused copings. In conclusion, coping strategies are different for those who deal with the daily experience of ME/CFS, highly disabling chronic condition with diagnostic ambiguity, low degree of medical and social recognition and without treatment. Better understanding of those strategies is needed to provide the means for health promotion researchers, managers and clinicians, to accompany those patients.","Moncorps, Florence; Jouet, Emmanuelle; Bayen, Sabine; Fornasieri, Isabelle; Renet, Sophie; Las‐Vergnas, Olivier; Messaadi, Nassir",Health Soc Care Community,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825299/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13376,93

A retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted. A review of the medical literature regarding hypermagnesemia, magnesium levels in critical care illness and electrolyte abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 was performed. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with hypermagnesemia and normomagnesemia were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Other known variables of disease severity were analyzed. 104 patients (54%) were identified with hypermagnesemia (≥2.5 mg/dL). 48 of those patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (46%, p<0.001). 34 patients required ventilator support (32%, p<0.0001). With age-adjusted logistic regression analysis hypermagnesemia was associated with mortality (p=0.007).

As in much of the industrialised world, dairy farming in Japan is rapidly changing. Many farmers are forced by neo-liberal agricultural policies to shift from small family operated farms to high-tech, high-speed, and high overhead industrial operations. This paper focuses on the history of dairy farming in the Tokachi region; more specifically one farm and the shift over a generation to a rotary parlour milking system. It addresses the linkages this mode of production has cultivated amongst humans, dairy cows and industrialized space. The parlour system at Great Hopes Farm allows five workers (aided by three more stall staff) to milk over 1000 cows, fifty at a time, three times a day. The impetus behind moving to parlour technology is that it increases productivity through mechanically enhanced observation and control. However this recent mechanical separation of human and cow during the milking process has led to affectively shared interspecies and inter-human alienation. The technology of the parlour system sets daily rhythms for bovine and human alike, and separates both from a process formerly dependent upon, specialized knowledge, affective empathy, and embodied knowledge. Human and bovine experience the systemic violence of the machine and what remains is a complex bio-politics of interspecies affect and the separation of “bare” and “political” life.","Hansen, Paul",J Rural Stud,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0743016713000107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288170/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016713000107,93

Prior studies had shown that the incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients could be as high as 25%. There are also autopsy reports showing evidence of viral tropism to the renal system. In this regard, COVID-19 can damage the kidneys and increase a patient's risk of requiring dialysis. Available evidence suggests that renal involvement in COVID-19 infection is not uncommon, and there has been an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease related to the pandemic. In this present review, we address COVID-19 and its effects on the renal system, including the pathophysiologic mechanisms. We also address current studies on the causes of injury to the renal system, the cause of kidney failure, its effect on mortality, the impact on dialysis patients, and the impact on renal transplant patients. COVID-19 disease may have unique features in individuals on chronic dialysis and kidney transplant recipients, requiring increased vigilance in limiting viral transmission in perioperative, in-patient, and dialysis center settings.","Kaye, Alan D.; Okeagu, Chikezie N.; Tortorich, Gregory; Pham, Alex D.; Ly, Eric I.; Brondeel, Kimberley C.; Eng, Matthew R.; Luedi, Markus M.; Urman, Richard D.; Cornett, Elyse M.",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511232/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521689621000094?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2021.02.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521689621000094,93

However, the magnitude of this reduction varies between studies. Method Electronic databases were searched from January 2020 to May 2021. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and, when necessary, full text to determine if studies met inclusion criteria. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. A narrative summary of eligible studies was synthesised, and meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model to pool the rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for hospital admissions. Exacerbation reduction was compared against the COVID-19 Containment and Health Index. Results A total of 13 of 745 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review, with data from nine countries. Seven studies could be included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rate ratio of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbations during the pandemic period was 0.50 (95% CI 0.42-0.58). Findings on the rate of community-treated exacerbations were inconclusive. Three studies reported a significant decrease in the incidence of respiratory viral infections compared with the pre-pandemic period. There was not a significant relationship between exacerbation reduction and the COVID-19 Containment and Health Index. Conclusion There was a 50% reduction in admissions for COPD exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic period, associated with a reduction in respiratory viral infections that trigger exacerbations. We provide pooled evidence supporting the potential effectiveness of COVID-19 preventive interventions in reducing the risk of admissions for COPD exacerbations.","Alqahtani, J.

681884,Opportunities and Challenges in Democratizing Immunology Datasets,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Entry screening tends to start with a search for febrile international passengers, and infrared thermoscanners have been employed for fever screening in Japan. We aimed to retrospectively assess the feasibility of detecting influenza cases based on fever screening as a sole measure. METHODS: Two datasets were collected at Narita International Airport during the 2009 pandemic. The first contained confirmed influenza cases (n = 16) whose diagnosis took place at the airport during the early stages of the pandemic, and the second contained a selected and suspected fraction of passengers (self-reported or detected by an infrared thermoscanner; n = 1,049) screened from September 2009 to January 2010. The sensitivity of fever (38.0°C) for detecting H1N1-2009 was estimated, and the diagnostic performances of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia at cut-off levels of 37.5°C, 38.0°C and 38.5°C were also estimated. RESULTS: The sensitivity of fever for detecting H1N1-2009 cases upon arrival was estimated to be 22.2% (95% confidence interval: 0, 55.6) among nine confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, and 55.6% of the H1N1-2009 cases were under antipyretic medications upon arrival. The sensitivity and specificity of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia ranged from 50.8-70.4% and 63.6-81.7%, respectively. The positive predictive value appeared to be as low as 37.3-68.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of entry screening is a product of the sensitivity of fever for detecting influenza cases and the sensitivity of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting fever. Given the additional presence of confounding factors and unrestricted medications among passengers, reliance on fever alone is unlikely to be feasible as an entry screening measure.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Kamiya, Kazuko",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21539735/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-111,93

Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss and lung pathology.

Understanding their perception of exposure risk is, therefore, important during the early phase of this pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the perception regarding risk of exposure to COVID-19 among Vietnamese hospital staff in Vietnam. Method: A cross-sectional online study was carried out to collect demographic data and risk exposure perception during the second week of the national lockdown in April 2020 in Vietnam. Seven hundred and forty two hospital staff were recruited using the snowball sampling to answer 5-point Likert scale questions regarding their risk exposure perception. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. Pearson coefficient analysis and multivariable regression models were applied to identify factors associated with the perceived COVID-19 exposure risk. Results: Participants perceived a high risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (score = 3.4, SD = 0.8). They also perceived the workplace response to COVID-19 as inadequate (score = 2.0, SD = 0.5). In particular, participants who worked in the emergency or intensive care departments were more likely to perceive an exposure risk, compared to those in infectious disease control departments (Coef. = −0.38, 95%CI: −0.74; −0.02). Participants from central regions perceived a lower risk of exposure to COVID-19 than those from northern regions (OR = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.28–0.96). Nurses were less likely than doctors to report being at risk of exposure to COVID-19 (OR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.33–0.95). Conclusions: We identified a high level of perceived risk regarding COVID-19 exposure among hospital staff during the unprecedented lockdown period in Vietnam. A comprehensive approach, incorporating improved risk communications, safety training and psychological support programs, for all hospital staff, including nurses and those residing in high population density areas, might further strengthen the national effort to control the pandemic.","Le, Xuan Thi Thanh; Nguyen, Quynh Thi; Onyango, Brenda; Nguyen, Quang Nhat; Pham, Quan Thi; Ta, Nhung Thi Kim; Nguyen, Thao Thanh; Le, Huong Thi; Vu, Linh Gia; Hoang, Men Thi; Vu, Giang Thu; Latkins, Carl A.; Ho, Roger C.

682509,Editors’ note: 2021 Special Issue on airway management,2021-06-21,"Prior to the World Health Organization’s announcement of total eradication in 1977 [J. Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 1735], smallpox was a worldwide pathogen. Vaccinations were ceased in 1980 and now with a largely unprotected world population, smallpox is considered the ideal biowarfare agent [Antiviral Res. 57 (2002) 1]. Infection normally occurs after implantation of the virus on the oropharyngeal or respiratory mucosa [J. Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 2127]. Smallpox virus can be detected from the throats of exposed individuals prior to onset of illness and prior to the infectious stage of the illness. A rapid, sensitive real-time assay to detect Variola virus (smallpox) has been developed using the Vaccinia virus, a surrogate of smallpox, as a target. Cyanine 5 dye-labeled anti-Vaccinia antibody was used in a sandwich immunoassay to produce a fluorescent signal in the presence of the Vaccinia virus. The signal was detected using the Analyte 2000 biosensor (Research International, Monroe, WA). The Analyte 2000 uses a 635 nm laser diode to provide excitation light that is launched into a polystyrene optical waveguide. Fluorescent molecules within the evanescent wave are excited and a portion of their emission energy recouples into the waveguide. A photodiode quantifies the emission light at wavelengths between 670 and 710 nm. The biosensor was able to detect a minimum of 2.5×10(5) pfu/ml of Vaccinia virus in seeded throat culture swab specimens.","Donaldson, Kim A; Kramer, Marianne F; Lim, Daniel V",Biosens Bioelectron,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566304000685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308237/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566304000685,93
683105,The effects of scientific messages and narratives about vaccination,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an immediate and large-scale uptake of online treatment for mental health care. However, there is uncertainty about what the “new normal” in mental health care will be like in post–COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","Bierbooms, Joyce J P A; van Haaren, Monique; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A; de Kort, Yvonne A W; Feijt, Milou; Bongers, Inge M B",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/21344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001835/,93

This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Cross-sectional data came from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) between April–July in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month distress across 2016/2017 and 2020, and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristics in 2016/2017 and 2020. Between the combined April–July 2016 and 2017 sample and April–July 2020 the prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers increased (2016/2017: moderate 20.66%, 19.02–22.43; severe 8.23%, 7.16–9.47; 2020: moderate 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11–31.60; OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.34–3.25; severe 11.04%, 9.30–13.12; OR = 2.16, 1.13–4.07). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16–24 years) and middle-age groups (45–54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate distress and older age groups (65+ years) increases in severe distress. There were increases of moderate distress among more disadvantaged social grades and both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Between April–July 2016/2017 and April–July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress among smokers differed between 2016/2017 and 2020 and represents a widening of inequalities.","Kock, Loren; Brown, Jamie; Shahab, Lion; Moore, Graham; Horton, Marie; Brose, Leonie",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150478/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101420,93

The transition to only emergent and essential urgent surgical cases raises the question, how and when will hospitals and surgery centers resume elective cases? As a large health care system providing multispecialty tertiary/quaternary care with across the Southeast United States, a collaborative approach to resuming elective surgery is critical. Numerous surgical societies have outlined a tiered approach to resuming elective surgery. The majority of these guidelines are suggestions which place the responsibility of making decisions about re-entry strategy on individual health care systems and practitioners, taking into account the local case burden, projected case surge, and availability of resources and personnel. This paper reviews challenges and solutions related to the resumption of elective surgeries and returning to the pre-COVID-19 surgical volume within an integrated health care system that actively manages 18 facilities, 111 operating rooms, and an annual operative volume exceeding 123,000 cases. We define the impact of COVID-19 across our surgical departments and outline the staged re-entry approach that is being taken to resume surgery within the health care system.","Wohler, Andrew D.; Kneisl, Jeffrey S.; Macknet, David M.; Hysong, Alexander A.; Kaney, Kathleen; Moroney, Scott; Hsu, Joseph R.",Med Care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273293/,93

RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 208 out of 736 patients (28.9 per cent) admitted to our institution with SARS-CoV-2 were referred for swallow assessment. Of the 208 patients, 102 were admitted to the intensive treatment unit for mechanical ventilation support, of which 82 were tracheostomised. The majority of patients regained near normal swallow function prior to discharge, regardless of intubation duration or tracheostomy status. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia is prevalent in patients admitted either to the intensive treatment unit or the ward with COVID-19 related respiratory issues. This paper describes the crucial role of intensive swallow rehabilitation to manage dysphagia associated with this disease, including therapeutic respiratory weaning for those with a tracheostomy.","Dawson, C; Capewell, R; Ellis, S; Matthews, S; Adamson, S; Wood, M; Fitch, L; Reid, K; Shaw, M; Wheeler, J; Pracy, P; Nankivell, P; Sharma, N",The Journal of laryngology and otology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022215120002443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33168109/,93
687827,∗-fuzzy measure model for COVID-19 disease,2021-04-12,"Noninvasive salivary antibody immunoassays can enable low-cost epidemiological surveillance of infections. This study involved developing and validating a multiplex suspension immunoassay on the Luminex platform to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid and spike (S) proteins, and the spike protein's S1 and S2 subunits and receptor binding domain. Multiple versions of these recombinant proteins acquired from commercial and noncommercial sources were evaluated. Assay development and validation utilized saliva and serum samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases procured from commercial sources and negative controls from a prepandemic survey. Saliva was also collected in a demonstration survey by mail involving adult individuals in the United States who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection 15 to 80 days prior to sample collection. The survey had an 83% valid sample return rate (192 samples from 38 states). Most COVID-19 cases (93%) reported mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. The final salivary assay based on the best-performing spike and nucleocapsid proteins had a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% bootstrap confidence interval, 82.1 to 91.7%) and specificity of 98.5% (95.0 to 100%) using 227 and 285 saliva samples, respectively. The same assay had 95.9% (92.8 to 98.9%) sensitivity and 100% (98.4 to 100%) specificity in serum (174 and 285 serum samples, respectively). Salivary and serum antibody responses to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were strongly correlated in 22 paired samples (r = 0.88 and r = 0.80, respectively). Antibody responses peaked at approximately 50 days postonset; greater illness severity was associated with stronger responses. This study demonstrated that a salivary antibody assay can be used in large-scale population surveys by mail to better characterize public health impacts of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Given the enormous impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing tools for population surveillance of infection is of paramount importance. This article describes the development of a multiplex immunoassay on a Luminex platform to measure salivary immunoglobulin G responses to the spike protein, its two subunits and receptor binding domain, and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. The assay validation utilized serum and saliva samples from prepandemic controls and recent COVID-19 cases. A survey by mail targeting recent COVID-19 cases across the United States also demonstrated the utility of safe, at-home self-collection of saliva. By incorporating multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, this assay may differentiate responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections from responses to most vaccines. Application of this noninvasive immunoassay in COVID-19 surveillance can help provide estimates of cumulative incidence rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in various communities and subpopulations, temporal patterns of antibody responses, and risk factors for infection.","Egorov, Andrey I; Griffin, Shannon M; Fuzawa, Miyu; Kobylanski, Jason; Grindstaff, Rachel; Padgett, William; Simmons, Steven; Hallinger, Daniel R; Styles, Jennifer N; Wickersham, Lindsay; Sams, Elizabeth; Hudgens, Edward; Wade, Timothy J",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00693-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523986/,93

There is an urgent need for a COVID-19 disease severity assessment that can assist in patient triage and resource allocation for patients at risk for severe disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and scale a clinical decision support system and mobile app to assist in COVID-19 severity assessment, management, and care. METHODS: Model training data from 701 patients with COVID-19 were collected across practices within the Family Health Centers network at New York University Langone Health. A two-tiered model was developed. Tier 1 uses easily available, nonlaboratory data to help determine whether biomarker-based testing and/or hospitalization is necessary. Tier 2 predicts the probability of mortality using biomarker measurements (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer) and age. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 models were validated using two external datasets from hospitals in Wuhan, China, comprising 160 and 375 patients, respectively. RESULTS: All biomarkers were measured at significantly higher levels in patients who died vs those who were not hospitalized or discharged (P<.001). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 internal validations had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98), respectively. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 external validations had AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the validity of the clinical decision support system and mobile app, which are now ready to assist health care providers in making evidence-based decisions when managing COVID-19 patient care.

Liver injury (elevated alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) often correlates with disease severity in COVID‐19 patients. The aim of this study is to identify pathological microthrombi in COVID‐19 patient livers by correlating their morphology with liver injury, and examine hyperfibrinogenemia and von Willebrand factor (vWF) as mechanisms of their formation. METHODS: Forty‐three post‐mortem liver biopsy samples from COVID‐19 patients were obtained from Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy. Three morphological features of microthrombosis (sinusoidal erythrocyte aggregation [SEA], platelet microthrombi [PMT], and fibrous thrombi) were evaluated. RESULTS: We found liver sinusoidal microthrombosis in 23 COVID‐19 patients (53%) was associated with a higher serum ALT and AST level compared to those without (ALT: 10‐fold, p = 0.04; AST: 11‐fold, p = 0.08). Of 43 livers, PMT and SEA were observed in 14 (33%) and 19 (44%) cases, respectively. Fibrous thrombi were not observed. Platelet microthrombi were associated with increased ALT (p < 0.01), whereas SEA was not (p = 0.73). In COVID‐19 livers, strong vWF staining in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells was associated with significantly increased platelet adhesion (1.7‐fold, p = 0.0016), compared to those with weak sinusoidal vWF (2‐fold, p < 0.0001). Sinusoidal erythrocyte aggregation in 19 (83%) liver samples was mainly seen in zone 2. Livers with SEA had significantly higher fibrinogen (1.6‐fold, p = 0.031) compared to those without SEA in COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Liver PMT is a pathologically important thrombosis associated with liver injury in COVID‐19, while SEA is a unique morphological feature of COVID‐19 patient livers. Sinusoidal vWF and hyperfibrinogenemia could contribute to PMT and SEA formation.","Kondo, Reiichiro; Kawaguchi, Nao; McConnell, Matthew J.; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Licini, Lisa; Valle, Clarissa; Bonaffini, Pietro A.; Sironi, Sandro; Alessio, Maria Grazia; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Zhang, Xuchen; Sun, Zhaoli; Utsumi, Teruo; Strazzabosco, Mario; Iwakiri, Yasuko",Hepatol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260803/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.13696,93

We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (≤0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30–0.76) and 0.59 (0.31–1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32–1.77) and 1.63 (1.32–2.02), respectively). We observed an increased risk of all COVID-19 disease states with older age and BMI ≥35 vs. 20–24 kg/m(2). Renal failure, respiratory failure, morbid obesity, acid-base balance disorder, white blood cell diseases, hydronephrosis and bacterial infections were associated with an increased risk of ICU admissions; sepsis, chronic skin ulcers, acid-base balance disorder and acidosis were associated with mortality.
