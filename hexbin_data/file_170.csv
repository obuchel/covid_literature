386,386,386,A Single Immunization with Soluble Recombinant Trimeric Hemagglutinin Protects Chickens against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1,10.450722,7.943779,2010-05-14,"BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.","Cornelissen, Lisette A.

493,493,493,Hepatitis G Virus associated aplastic anemia: A recent case from Pakistan,10.389489,7.768686,2011-01-21,"BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a serious and rare disorder characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses. CASE PRESENTATION: A female girl of age 11 year with a history of loose motion for one month, vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. CONCLUSION: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy.","Riaz Shah, Shahida Amjad; Idrees, Muhammad; Hussain, Abrar",Virol J,170,28
496,496,496,Charge-Surrounded Pockets and Electrostatic Interactions with Small Ions Modulate the Activity of Retroviral Fusion Proteins,10.108512,7.813715,2011-02-03,"Refolding of viral class-1 membrane fusion proteins from a native state to a trimer-of-hairpins structure promotes entry of viruses into cells. Here we present the structure of the bovine leukaemia virus transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) and identify a group of asparagine residues at the membrane-distal end of the trimer-of-hairpins that is strikingly conserved among divergent viruses. These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","Lamb, Daniel; Schüttelkopf, Alexander W.; van Aalten, Daan M.

544,544,544,Genomic Characterization and High Prevalence of Bocaviruses in Swine,10.500461,7.8221455,2011-04-15,"Using random PCR amplification followed by plasmid subcloning and DNA sequencing, we detected bocavirus related sequences in 9 out of 17 porcine stool samples. Using primer walking, we sequenced the nearly complete genomes of two highly divergent bocaviruses we provisionally named porcine bocavirus 1 isolate H18 (PBoV1-H18) and porcine bocavirus 2 isolate A6 (PBoV2-A6) which differed by 51.8% in their NS1 protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PBoV1-H18 was very closely related to a ∼2 Kb central region of a porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-LikeV) from Sweden described in 2009. PBoV2-A6 was very closely related to the porcine bocavirus genomes PBoV-1 and PBoV2 from China described in 2010. Among 340 fecal samples collected from different age, asymptomatic swine in five Chinese provinces, the prevalence of PBoV1-H18 and PBoV2-A6 related viruses were 45–75% and 55–70% respectively, with 30–47% of pigs co-infected. PBoV1-A6 related strains were highly conserved, while PBoV2-H18 related strains were more diverse, grouping into two genotypes corresponding to the previously described PBoV1 and PBoV2. Together with the recently described partial bocavirus genomes labeled V6 and V7, a total of three major porcine bocavirus clades have therefore been described to date. Further studies will be required to elucidate the possible pathogenic impact of these diverse bocaviruses either alone or in combination with other porcine viruses.","Shan, Tongling; Lan, Daoliang; Li, Linlin; Wang, Chunmei; Cui, Li; Zhang, Wen; Hua, Xiuguo; Zhu, Caixia; Zhao, Wei; Delwart, Eric",PLoS One,170,28
545,545,545,Analysis of codon usage and nucleotide composition bias in polioviruses,10.320448,7.9867473,2011-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is a human enterovirus and a member of the family of Picornaviridae and among the most rapidly evolving viruses known. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. However, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date. METHODS: The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values, nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for open reading frames (ORFs) among 48 polioviruses isolates including 31 of genotype 1, 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3. RESULTS: The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in poliovirus samples is low (mean ENC = 53.754 > 40). The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those polioviruses. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes. Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern (exists in the genotype-1 of polioviruses). No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived polioviruses (DVPVs), wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus genes. The relative abundance of dinucleotide (CpG) in the ORFs of polioviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1. CONCLUSION: The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution, especially for DVPVs genotype 1, but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines.","Zhang, Jie; Wang, Meng; Liu, Wen-qian; Zhou, Jian-hua; Chen, Hao-tai; Ma, Li-na; Ding, Yao-zhong; Gu, Yuan-xing; Liu, Yong-sheng",Virol J,170,1
612,612,612,Identification of a Highly Conserved H1 Subtype-Specific Epitope with Diagnostic Potential in the Hemagglutinin Protein of Influenza A Virus,10.189707,7.9797773,2011-08-19,"Subtype specificity of influenza A virus (IAV) is determined by its two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For HA, 16 distinct subtypes (H1–H16) exist, while nine exist for NA. The epidemic strains of H1N1 IAV change frequently and cause annual seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics, such as the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic. The recent introduction of pandemic A/H1N1 IAV (H1N1pdm virus) into humans re-emphasizes the public health concern about H1N1 IAV. Several studies have identified conserved epitopes within specific HA subtypes that can be used for diagnostics. However, immune specific epitopes in H1N1 IAV have not been completely assessed. In this study, linear epitopes on the H1N1pdm viral HA protein were identified by peptide scanning using libraries of overlapping peptides against convalescent sera from H1N1pdm patients. One epitope, P5 (aa 58–72) was found to be immunodominant in patients and to evoke high titer antibodies in mice. Multiple sequence alignments and in silico coverage analysis showed that this epitope is highly conserved in influenza H1 HA [with a coverage of 91.6% (9,860/10,767)] and almost completely absent in other subtypes [with a coverage of 3.3% (792/23,895)]. This previously unidentified linear epitope is located outside the five well-recognized antigenic sites in HA. A peptide ELISA method based on this epitope was developed and showed high correlation (χ(2) = 51.81, P<0.01, Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.741) with a hemagglutination inhibition test. The highly conserved H1 subtype-specific immunodominant epitope may form the basis for developing novel assays for sero-diagnosis and active surveillance against H1N1 IAVs.","Zhao, Rongmao; Cui, Shujuan; Guo, Li; Wu, Chao; Gonzalez, Richard; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia; Vernet, Guy; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao",PLoS One,170,28
840,840,840,Induction of GADD34 Is Necessary for dsRNA-Dependent Interferon-β Production and Participates in the Control of Chikungunya Virus Infection,10.454169,7.898627,2012-05-17,"Nucleic acid sensing by cells is a key feature of antiviral responses, which generally result in type-I Interferon production and tissue protection. However, detection of double-stranded RNAs in virus-infected cells promotes two concomitant and apparently conflicting events. The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2α) and inhibits protein synthesis, whereas cytosolic DExD/H box RNA helicases induce expression of type I-IFN and other cytokines. We demonstrate that the phosphatase-1 cofactor, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34/Ppp1r15a), an important component of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is absolutely required for type I-IFN and IL-6 production by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in response to dsRNA. GADD34 expression in MEFs is dependent on PKR activation, linking cytosolic microbial sensing with the ATF4 branch of the UPR. The importance of this link for anti-viral immunity is underlined by the extreme susceptibility of GADD34-deficient fibroblasts and neonate mice to Chikungunya virus infection.","Clavarino, Giovanna; Cláudio, Nuno; Couderc, Thérèse; Dalet, Alexandre; Judith, Delphine; Camosseto, Voahirana; Schmidt, Enrico K.; Wenger, Till; Lecuit, Marc; Gatti, Evelina; Pierre, Philippe",PLoS Pathog,170,28
889,889,889,"Ipomoelin, a Jacalin-Related Lectin with a Compact Tetrameric Association and Versatile Carbohydrate Binding Properties Regulated by Its N Terminus",10.291128,8.142352,2012-07-11,"Many proteins are induced in the plant defense response to biotic stress or mechanical wounding. One group is lectins. Ipomoelin (IPO) is one of the wound-inducible proteins of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) and is a Jacalin-related lectin (JRL). In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in its apo form and in complex with carbohydrates such as methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (Me-Man), methyl α-D-glucopyranoside (Me-Glc), and methyl α-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) in different space groups. The packing diagrams indicated that IPO might represent a compact tetrameric association in the JRL family. The protomer of IPO showed a canonical β-prism fold with 12 strands of β-sheets but with 2 additional short β-strands at the N terminus. A truncated IPO (ΔN10IPO) by removing the 2 short β-strands of the N terminus was used to reveal its role in a tetrameric association. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed IPO as a tetrameric form in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the binding constants (K(A)) of IPO and ΔN10IPO against various carbohydrates. IPO could bind to Me-Man, Me-Glc, and Me-Gal with similar binding constants. In contrast, ΔN10IPO showed high binding ability to Me-Man and Me-Glc but could not bind to Me-Gal. Our structural and functional analysis of IPO revealed that its compact tetrameric association and carbohydrate binding polyspecificity could be regulated by the 2 additional N-terminal β-strands. The versatile carbohydrate binding properties of IPO might play a role in plant defense.","Chang, Wei-Chieh; Liu, Kai-Lun; Hsu, Fang-Ciao; Jeng, Shih-Tong; Cheng, Yi-Sheng",PLoS One,170,1
919,919,919,Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Blocks Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase and Nuclear Factor-κB Activation to Downregulate Cytokine Production,10.30354,7.7602115,2012-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease threatening human health around the world. Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in DENV-2–infected bone-marrow–derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the TLR-triggered ERK–NF-κB activation and cytokine production.","Chang, Tsung-Hsien; Chen, Siang-Ru; Yu, Chia-Yi; Lin, You-Sheng; Chen, Yao-Shen; Kubota, Toru; Matsuoka, Mayumi; Lin, Yi-Ling",PLoS One,170,28
920,920,920,"High Influenza A Virus Infection Rates in Mallards Bred for Hunting in the Camargue, South of France",10.512416,7.8911223,2012-08-27,"During the last decade, the role of wildlife in emerging pathogen transmission to domestic animals has often been pointed out. Conversely, far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of game restocking, which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the 2008/2009 nor the 2009/2010 hunting seasons. In 2010 infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions. Measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced.","Vittecoq, Marion; Grandhomme, Viviane; Champagnon, Jocelyn; Guillemain, Matthieu; Crescenzo-Chaigne, Bernadette; Renaud, François; Thomas, Frédéric; Gauthier-Clerc, Michel; van der Werf, Sylvie",PLoS One,170,28
958,958,958,Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments,10.357549,7.80162,2012-10-11,"Influenza A virus (IAV) contains a segmented negative-strand RNA genome. How IAV balances the replication and transcription of its multiple genome segments is not understood. We developed a dual competition assay based on the co-transfection of firefly or Gaussia luciferase-encoding genome segments together with plasmids encoding IAV polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein. At limiting amounts of polymerase subunits, expression of the firefly luciferase segment was negatively affected by the presence of its Gaussia luciferase counterpart, indicative of competition between reporter genome segments. This competition could be relieved by increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of firefly or Gaussia reporter segment, respectively. The balance between the luciferase expression levels was also affected by the identity of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as segment length. In general it appeared that genome segments displaying inherent higher expression levels were more efficient competitors of another segment. When natural genome segments were tested for their ability to suppress reporter gene expression, shorter genome segments generally reduced firefly luciferase expression to a larger extent, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. The balance between different reporter segments was most dramatically affected by the introduction of UTR panhandle-stabilizing mutations. Furthermore, only reporter genome segments carrying these mutations were able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in infected cells. Our data indicate that IAV genome segments compete for available polymerases. Competition is affected by segment length, coding region, and UTRs. This competition is probably most apparent early during infection, when limiting amounts of polymerases are present, and may contribute to the regulation of segment-specific replication and transcription.","Widjaja, Ivy; de Vries, Erik; Rottier, Peter J.

JEV NS1-specific antibody responses could be a target in the differential diagnosis of different flavivirus infections. However, the epitopes on JEV NS1 are poorly characterized. The present study describes the full mapping of linear B-cell epitopes in JEV NS1. We generated eleven NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant NS1. For epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies, a set of 51 partially-overlapping peptides covering the entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened using monoclonal antibodies. Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), five linear epitope-containing peptides were identified. By sequentially removing amino acid residues from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptides, the minimal units of the five linear epitopes were identified and confirmed using monoclonal antibodies. Five linear epitopes are located in amino acids residues (5)AIDITRK(11), (72)RDELNVL(78), (251)KSKHNRREGY(260), (269)DENGIVLD(276), and (341)DETTLVRS(348). Furthermore, it was found that the epitopes are highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignment. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins from other flaviviruses reacted with the MAbs when they were tested for cross-reactivity, and all five epitope peptides were not recognized by sera against West Nile virus or Dengue virus. These novel virus-specific linear B-cell epitopes of JEV NS1 would benefit the development of new vaccines and diagnostic assays.","Hua, Rong-Hong; Liu, Li-Ke; Chen, Zhen-Shi; Li, Ye-Nan; Bu, Zhi-Gao",PLoS One,170,28

However, the mechanism of severe encephalitis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using a mouse model, we investigated the pathogenetic mechanisms that correlate with fatal JEV infection. Following extraneural infection with the JaOArS982 strain of JEV, infected mice exhibited clinical signs ranging from mild to fatal outcome. Comparison of the pathogenetic response between severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice revealed increased levels of TNF-α in the brains of severe cases. However, unexpectedly, the mortality rate of TNF-α KO mice was significantly increased compared with that of WT mice, indicating that TNF-α plays a protective role against fatal infection. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-α KO mice. However, exaggerated inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-α KO mice. Although these observations were also obtained in IL-10 KO mice, the mortality and enhanced inflammatory responses were more pronounced in TNF-α KO mice. Our findings therefore provide the first evidence that TNF-α has an immunoregulatory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS during JEV infection and consequently protects the animals from fatal disease. Thus, we propose that the increased level of TNF-α in severe cases was the result of severe disease, and secondly that immunopathological effects contribute to severe neuronal degeneration resulting in fatal disease. In future, further elucidation of the immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF-α will be an important priority to enable the development of effective treatment strategies for Japanese encephalitis.","Hayasaka, Daisuke; Shirai, Kenji; Aoki, Kotaro; Nagata, Noriyo; Simantini, Dash Sima; Kitaura, Kazutaka; Takamatsu, Yuki; Gould, Ernest; Suzuki, Ryuji; Morita, Kouichi",PLoS One,170,28

The genomic regions that can faithfully provide assessments consistent with those predicted with full-length genome sequences would be preferable to serve as good candidates of the phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here we employed a statistical method to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree construction as a way to determine which gene can match the genome well in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculation of linear correlations between the genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genome sequences. We applied this method to the phylogenetic analyses of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons and the possible factors affecting the method accuracy were also discussed in the calculations. The results revealed that this method could produce results consistent with those of previous studies about the proper consensus sequences that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer the genetic relationships.","Wang, Shuai; Luo, Xuenong; Wei, Wei; Zheng, Yadong; Dou, Yongxi; Cai, Xuepeng",PLoS One,170,22
1410,1410,1410,"A Compact, Multifunctional Fusion Module Directs Cholesterol-Dependent Homomultimerization and Syncytiogenic Efficiency of Reovirus p10 FAST Proteins",10.457817,8.168159,2014-03-20,"The homologous p10 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins of the avian (ARV) and Nelson Bay (NBV) reoviruses are the smallest known viral membrane fusion proteins, and are virulence determinants of the fusogenic reoviruses. The small size of FAST proteins is incompatible with the paradigmatic membrane fusion pathway proposed for enveloped viral fusion proteins. Understanding how these diminutive viral fusogens mediate the complex process of membrane fusion is therefore of considerable interest, from both the pathogenesis and mechanism-of-action perspectives. Using chimeric ARV/NBV p10 constructs, the 36–40-residue ectodomain was identified as the major determinant of the differing fusion efficiencies of these homologous p10 proteins. Extensive mutagenic analysis determined the ectodomain comprises two distinct, essential functional motifs. Syncytiogenesis assays, thiol-specific surface biotinylation, and liposome lipid mixing assays identified an ∼25-residue, N-terminal motif that dictates formation of a cystine loop fusion peptide in both ARV and NBV p10. Surface immunofluorescence staining, FRET analysis and cholesterol depletion/repletion studies determined the cystine loop motif is connected through a two-residue linker to a 13-residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER). The MPER constitutes a second, independent motif governing reversible, cholesterol-dependent assembly of p10 multimers in the plasma membrane. Results further indicate that: (1) ARV and NBV homomultimers segregate to distinct, cholesterol-dependent microdomains in the plasma membrane; (2) p10 homomultimerization and cholesterol-dependent microdomain localization are co-dependent; and (3) the four juxtamembrane MPER residues present in the multimerization motif dictate species-specific microdomain association and homomultimerization. The p10 ectodomain therefore constitutes a remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion module that directs syncytiogenic efficiency and species-specific assembly of p10 homomultimers into cholesterol-dependent fusion platforms in the plasma membrane.","Key, Tim; Duncan, Roy",PLoS Pathog,170,1

1437,1437,1437,A LC3-Interacting Motif in the Influenza A Virus M2 Protein Is Required to Subvert Autophagy and Maintain Virion Stability,10.111893,7.97145,2014-02-12,"Autophagy recycles cellular components and defends cells against intracellular pathogens. While viruses must evade autophagocytic destruction, some viruses can also subvert autophagy for their own benefit. The ability of influenza A virus (IAV) to evade autophagy depends on the Matrix 2 (M2) ion-channel protein. We show that the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 interacts directly with the essential autophagy protein LC3 and promotes LC3 relocalization to the unexpected destination of the plasma membrane. LC3 binding is mediated by a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in M2. The M2 LIR is required for LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in virus-infected cells. Mutations in M2 that abolish LC3 binding interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability. IAV therefore subverts autophagy by mimicking a host short linear protein-protein interaction motif. This strategy may facilitate transmission of infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny.","Beale, Rupert; Wise, Helen; Stuart, Amanda; Ravenhill, Benjamin J.; Digard, Paul; Randow, Felix",Cell Host Microbe,170,28

Based on a published design, we have generated several replication competent influenza A viruses carrying either fluorescent proteins or Gaussia luciferase. Reporter activity could be readily quantified in infected cultures, but the virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was more stable than viruses bearing fluorescent proteins and was therefore analyzed in detail. Quantification of Gaussia luciferase activity in the supernatants of infected culture allowed the convenient and highly sensitive detection of viral spread, and enzymatic activity correlated with the number of infectious particles released from infected cells. Furthermore, the Gaussia luciferase encoding virus allowed the sensitive quantification of the antiviral activity of the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) zanamivir and the host cell interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1–3, which are known to inhibit influenza virus entry. Finally, the virus was used to demonstrate that influenza A virus infection is sensitive to a modulator of endosomal cholesterol, in keeping with the concept that IFITMs inhibit viral entry by altering cholesterol levels in the endosomal membrane. In sum, we report the characterization of a novel influenza A reporter virus, which allows fast and sensitive detection of viral spread and its inhibition, and we show that influenza A virus entry is sensitive to alterations of endosomal cholesterol levels.","Eckert, Nadine; Wrensch, Florian; Gärtner, Sabine; Palanisamy, Navaneethan; Goedecke, Ulrike; Jäger, Nils; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Winkler, Michael",PLoS One,170,28

The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 °C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising vaccine candidate against EBOV. We recently showed that VLPs protect mice from lethal EBOV infection when given before or after viral infection. To elucidate pathways through which VLPs confer post-exposure protection, we investigated the role of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We found that VLPs lead to accelerated induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver and spleen of wild type mice, but not in Ifnar(-/-) mice. Accordingly, EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, unlike wild type mice succumbed to death even after VLP treatment. The ISGs induced in wild type mice included anti-viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral replication and excessive inflammatory responses. Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was much higher in WT mice without VLPs than mice treated with VLPs. In EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, however, uninhibited viral replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued, irrespective of VLP treatment, supporting the view that type I IFN signaling helps to limit viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses. Further analyses showed that VLP protection requires the transcription factor, IRF8 known to amplify type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages, the probable sites of initial EBOV infection. Together, this study indicates that VLPs afford post-exposure protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type I IFN signaling in the host.","Ayithan, Natarajan; Bradfute, Steven B.; Anthony, Scott M.; Stuthman, Kelly S.; Bavari, Sina; Bray, Mike; Ozato, Keiko",PLoS One,170,28

Non uniform usage of synonymous codons for a specific amino acid during translation of protein known as codon usage bias (CUB) is a unique property of the genome and shows species specific deviation. Analysis of codon usage bias with compositional dynamics of coding sequences has contributed to the better understanding of the molecular mechanism and the evolution of a particular gene. In this study, the complete nucleotide coding sequences of TP53 gene from eight different mammalian species were used for CUB analysis. Our results showed that the codon usage patterns in TP53 gene across different mammalian species has been influenced by GC bias particularly GC(3) and a moderate bias exists in the codon usage of TP53 gene. Moreover, we observed that nature has highly favored the most over represented codon CTG for leucine amino acid but selected against the ATA codon for isoleucine in TP53 gene across all mammalian species during the course of evolution.","Mazumder, Tarikul Huda; Chakraborty, Supriyo",PLoS One,170,1
1838,1838,1838,Homology-Independent Metrics for Comparative Genomics,10.446714,7.826365,2015-05-04,"A mainstream procedure to analyze the wealth of genomic data available nowadays is the detection of homologous regions shared across genomes, followed by the extraction of biological information from the patterns of conservation and variation observed in such regions. Although of pivotal importance, comparative genomic procedures that rely on homology inference are obviously not applicable if no homologous regions are detectable. This fact excludes a considerable portion of “genomic dark matter” with no significant similarity — and, consequently, no inferred homology to any other known sequence — from several downstream comparative genomic methods. In this review we compile several sequence metrics that do not rely on homology inference and can be used to compare nucleotide sequences and extract biologically meaningful information from them. These metrics comprise several compositional parameters calculated from sequence data alone, such as GC content, dinucleotide odds ratio, and several codon bias metrics. They also share other interesting properties, such as pervasiveness (patterns persist on smaller scales) and phylogenetic signal. We also cite examples where these homology-independent metrics have been successfully applied to support several bioinformatics challenges, such as taxonomic classification of biological sequences without homology inference. They where also used to detect higher-order patterns of interactions in biological systems, ranging from detecting coevolutionary trends between the genomes of viruses and their hosts to characterization of gene pools of entire microbial communities. We argue that, if correctly understood and applied, homology-independent metrics can add important layers of biological information in comparative genomic studies without prior homology inference.","Coutinho, Tarcisio José Domingos; Franco, Glória Regina; Lobo, Francisco Pereira",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,170,1
1841,1841,1841,Computational Docking Study of p7 Ion Channel from HCV Genotype 3 and Genotype 4 and Its Interaction with Natural Compounds,10.18418,8.202902,2015-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The current standard care therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection consists of two regimes, namely interferon-based and interferon-free treatments. The treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. In 2011, two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, boceprevir and telaprevir, were licensed that have shown enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) in phase III clinical trial, however, these interferon-free treatments are more sensitive to HCV genotype 1 infection. The variable nature of HCV, and the limited number of inhibitors developed thus aim in expanding the repertoire of available drug targets, resulting in targeting the virus assembly therapeutically. AIM: We conducted this study to predict the 3D structure of the p7 protein from the HCV genotypes 3 and 4. Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structure–activity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","Mathew, Shilu; Fatima, Kaneez; Fatmi, M.

1925,1925,1925,"Genomic analysis of codon usage shows influence of mutation pressure, natural selection, and host features on Marburg virus evolution",10.179773,7.792518,2015-08-26,"BACKGROUND: The Marburg virus (MARV) has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, belongs to the family Filoviridae, and is responsible for several outbreaks of highly fatal hemorrhagic fever. Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. RESULTS: Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.

The objectives of the present research were to apply microwave heating to RCA and indicate factors that contribute to the microwave selective heating effect. The microwave reaction temperature was strictly controlled using a microwave applicator optimized for enzymatic-scale reactions. Here, we showed that microwave-assisted RCA reactions catalyzed by either of the four thermostable DNA polymerases were accelerated over 4-folds compared with conventional RCA. Furthermore, the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating. We concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal RCA of DNA because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components, although the overall reaction temperatures were the same.","Yoshimura, Takeo; Suzuki, Takamasa; Mineki, Shigeru; Ohuchi, Shokichi",PLoS One,170,1

Hantaviruses related human cases have been observed throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. To date, 23 distinct species of hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir, have been identified. However, the diversity and number of hantaviruses are likely underestimated in China, and hantavirus species that cause disease in many regions, including Yunnan province, are unknown. RESULTS: In August 2012, we collected tissue samples from 189 captured animals, including 15 species belonging to 10 genera, 5 families, and 4 orders in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. Seven species were positive for hantavirus: Eothenomys eleusis (42/94), Apodemus peninsulae (3/25), Niviventer eha (3/27), Cryptotis montivaga (2/8), Anourosorex squamipes (1/1), Sorex araneus (1/1), and Mustela sibirica (1/2). We characterized one full-length genomic sequence of the virus (named fugong virus, FUGV) from a small oriental vole (Eothenomys eleusis). The full-length sequences of the small, medium, and large segments of FUGV were 1813, 3630, and 6531 nt, respectively. FUGV was most closely related to hantavirus LX309, a previously reported species detected in the red-backed vole in Luxi county, Yunnan province, China. However, the amino acid sequences of nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L) were highly divergent from those of Hantavirus LX309, with amino acid differences of 11.2, 15.3, and 12.7 %, respectively. In phylogenetic trees, FUGV clustered in the lineage corresponding to hantaviruses carried by rodents in the subfamily Arvicolinae. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hantavirus infection in small mammals was found in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. A novel hantavirus species FUGV was identified from the small oriental vole. This virus is phylogenetic clustering with another hantavirus LX309, but shows highly genomic divergence.","Ge, Xing-Yi; Yang, Wei-Hong; Pan, Hong; Zhou, Ji-Hua; Han, Xi; Zhu, Guang-Jian; Desmond, James S.; Daszak, Peter; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhang, Yun-Zhi",Virol J,170,28

However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-ΔP, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-ΔP replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-ΔP in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-ΔP expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-ΔP incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication.","Wongthida, Phonphimon; Jengarn, Juggragarn; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Koonyosying, Pongpisid; Srisutthisamphan, Kanjana; Wanitchang, Asawin; Leaungwutiwong, Pornsawan; Teeravechyan, Samaporn; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",PLoS One,170,28

The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. RESULTS: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0–0.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved. The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses. The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.

We constructed an arrayed library of ISGs from rhesus macaques and tested the ability of hundreds of individual macaque and human ISGs to inhibit early and late replication steps for 11 members of the retroviridae from various host species. These screens uncovered numerous ISGs with antiretroviral activity at both the early and late stages of virus replication. Detailed analyses of two antiretroviral ISGs indicate that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) can inhibit retroviral replication by metabolite depletion while tripartite motif-56 (TRIM56) accentuates ISG induction by IFNα and inhibits the expression of late HIV-1 genes.

IE1 and IE2 are derived from the same primary transcript by alternative splicing and regulation of their expression likely involves a complex interplay between cellular and viral factors. Here we show that knockdown of the host ubiquitin-dependent segregase VCP/p97, results in loss of IE2 expression, subsequent suppression of early and late gene expression and, ultimately, failure in virus replication. RNAseq analysis showed increased levels of IE1 splicing, with a corresponding decrease in IE2 splicing following VCP knockdown. Global analysis of viral transcription showed the expression of a subset of viral genes is not reduced despite the loss of IE2 expression, including UL112/113.

In the present study, we examined the roles of specific nuclear targeting domains in B1 localization as well as the effect of B1 nuclear localization on the cell cycle and host cell survival. The B1 protein of the Red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) was detected in GF-1 grouper cells as early as 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Using an EYFP-B1 fusion construct, we observed nuclear localization of the B1 protein (up to 99%) in GF-1 cells at 48 hpi. The nuclear localization of B1 was mediated by two arginine-rich nuclear targeting domains (B domain: (46)RRSRR(51); C domain: (63)RDKRPRR(70)) and domain C was more important than domain B in this process. B1 nuclear localization correlated with upregulation of p53 and p21((wef1/cip1)); downregulation of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and Mdm2; and G1/S cell cycle arrest in GF-1 cells. In conclusion, nuclear targeting of the RGNNV B1 protein via two targeting domains causes cell cycle arrest by up-regulating p53/p21 and down-regulating Mdm2, thereby regulating host cell survival.","Su, Yu-Chin; Reshi, Latif; Chen, Lei-Jia; Li, Wei-Han; Chiu, Hsuan-Wen; Hong, Jiann-Ruey",Sci Rep,170,8

Human SAMD9, a tumor suppressor and a restriction factor for poxviruses in cell lines, is antagonized by two classes of poxvirus proteins, represented by vaccinia virus (VACV) K1 and C7. A paralog of SAMD9, SAMD9L, is also encoded by some mammals, while only one of two paralogs is retained by others. Here, we show that SAMD9L functions similarly to SAMD9 as a restriction factor and that the two paralogs form a critical host barrier that poxviruses must overcome to establish infection. In mice, which naturally lack SAMD9, overcoming SAMD9L restriction with viral inhibitors is essential for poxvirus replication and pathogenesis. While a VACV deleted of both K1 and C7 (vK1L(-)C7L(-)) was restricted by mouse cells and highly attenuated in mice, its replication and virulence were completely restored in SAMD9L(-/-) mice. In humans, both SAMD9 and SAMD9L are poxvirus restriction factors, although the latter requires interferon induction in many cell types. While knockout of SAMD9 with Crispr-Cas9 was sufficient for abolishing the restriction for vK1L(-)C7L(-) in many human cells, knockout of both paralogs was required for abolishing the restriction in interferon-treated cells. Both paralogs are antagonized by VACV K1, C7 and C7 homologs from diverse mammalian poxviruses, but mouse SAMD9L is resistant to the C7 homolog encoded by a group of poxviruses with a narrow host range in ruminants, indicating that host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L genes serves as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission.","Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Yan, Bo; Si, Chuanping; Honda, Hiroaki; Nagamachi, Akiko; Sun, Lu-Zhe; Xiang, Yan",PLoS Pathog,170,1

In this study, we compared three preprocessing methods [preprocessing with normal saline (NS), dithiothreitol (DTT), and proteinase K (PK)] of sputum specimens on the extraction and detection of influenza A virus (IAV) nucleic acids. Based on the experimental results of 217 specimens, we found that DTT and PK could be used to improve the homogenization effects of sputum and increase the positive rates by 5.53–6.91% higher than that of the NS group. Comparison of 49 positive specimens in all of the three groups demonstrated that the threshold cycle values of the DTT group and PK group were significantly lower and their nucleic acid concentration and A(260)/A(280) ratio within 1.8–2.0 were higher than those of the NS group. Thus, sputum homogenization before nucleic acid extraction is essential for the accurate diagnosis of IAV infection.","Yu, Fei; Qiu, Ting; Zeng, Ying; Wang, Yiyin; Zheng, Shufa; Chen, Xiao; Chen, Yu",Front Med (Lausanne),170,28

The CUB and its shaping factors in the nuclear genomes of four sequenced cotton species, G. arboreum (A(2)), G. raimondii (D(5)), G. hirsutum (AD(1)) and G. barbadense (AD(2)) were analyzed in the present study. The effective number of codons (ENC) analysis showed the CUB was weak in these four species and the four subgenomes of the two tetraploids. Codon composition analysis revealed these four species preferred to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons. Correlation analysis indicated that the base content at the third position of codons affect the degree of codon preference. PR2-bias plot and ENC-plot analyses revealed that the CUB patterns in these genomes and subgenomes were influenced by combined effects of translational selection, directional mutation and other factors. The translational selection (P2) analysis results, together with the non-significant correlation between GC12 and GC3, further revealed that translational selection played the dominant role over mutation pressure in the codon usage bias. Through relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, we detected 25 high frequency codons preferred to end with T or A, and 31 low frequency codons inclined to end with C or G in these four species and four subgenomes. Finally, 19 to 26 optimal codons with 19 common ones were determined for each species and subgenomes, which preferred to end with A or T. We concluded that the codon usage bias was weak and the translation selection was the main shaping factor in nuclear genes of these four cotton genomes and four subgenomes.","Wang, Liyuan; Xing, Huixian; Yuan, Yanchao; Wang, Xianlin; Saeed, Muhammad; Tao, Jincai; Feng, Wei; Zhang, Guihua; Song, Xianliang; Sun, Xuezhen",PLoS One,170,1

We developed a cell-mediated drug screening method to monitor NTCP expression on the cell surface by generating a HepG2 cell line with tetracycline-inducible expression of NTCP and a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects cell-surface NTCP. Using this system, we screened a small molecule library for compounds that protected against HBV infection by targeting NTCP. We found that glabridin, a licorice-derived isoflavane, could suppress viral infection by inducing caveolar endocytosis of cell-surface NTCP with an IC(50) of ~40 μM. We also found that glabridin could attenuate the inhibitory effect of taurocholate on type I interferon signaling by depleting the level of cell-surface NTCP.

Co-evolution of viruses with their hosts has favored development of various strategies to evade the effects of IFNs, enabling viruses to survive inside host cells. One such strategy involves inhibition of IFN signaling pathways by non-structural proteins. In this review, we provide a brief overview of host signaling pathways inducing IFN production and their suppression by picornavirus non-structural proteins. Using this strategy, picornaviruses can evade the host immune response and replicate inside host cells.","Wang, Yining; Ma, Lina; Stipkovits, Laszlo; Szathmary, Susan; Li, Xuerui; Liu, Yongsheng",Front Microbiol,170,1

In endemic regions, HEV-1 or HEV-2 genotypes are frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women, while with zoonotic HEV (HEV-3 and HEV-4), chronic cases of hepatitis and severe neurological disorders are reported. Hence, it is important to characterize the interactions between HEV and its host. Here, we investigated the ability of the nonstructural polyprotein encoded by the first open reading frame (ORF1) of HEV to modulate the host early antiviral response and, in particular, the type I interferon (IFN-I) system. We found that the amino-terminal region of HEV-3 ORF1 (MetYPCP), containing a putative methyltransferase (Met) and a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) functional domain, inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activation and the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to IFN-I. We showed that the MetYPCP domain interfered with the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription protein (STAT) signalling pathway by inhibiting STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation after IFN-I treatment. In contrast, MetYPCP had no effect on STAT2 phosphorylation and a limited impact on the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway after IFN-II stimulation. This inhibitory function seemed to be genotype-dependent, as MetYPCP from HEV-1 had no significant effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. Overall, this study provides evidence that the predicted MetYPCP domain of HEV ORF1 antagonises STAT1 activation to modulate the IFN response.","Bagdassarian, Eugénie; Doceul, Virginie; Pellerin, Marie; Demange, Antonin; Meyer, Léa; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Pavio, Nicole",Viruses,170,28

In addition to simplifying the separation of binding and non-binding aptamer candidates, microbeads have facilitated the integration of other technologies such as emulsion PCR (ePCR) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to high-throughput selection techniques. Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Within this review we explore examples and applications of oligonucleotide functionalised microbeads in aptamer selection and reflect upon new opportunities arising for aptamer science.","Fraser, Lewis A.; Kinghorn, Andrew B.; Tang, Marco S.

The enzymatic activity of Cyp is inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug. To precisely determine the unfolding mechanism and the domain structure of Cyp, we have investigated a chimeric S. aureus Cyp (rCyp) using various probes. Our limited proteolysis and the consequent analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicate that rCyp is composed of one domain with a short flexible tail at the C-terminal end. We also show that the urea-induced unfolding of both rCyp and rCyp-CsA is completely reversible and proceeds via the synthesis of at least one stable intermediate. Both the secondary structure and the tertiary structure of each intermediate appears very similar to those of the corresponding native protein. Conversely, the hydrophobic surface areas of the intermediates are comparatively less. Further analyses reveal no loss of CsA binding activity in rCyp intermediate. The thermodynamic stability of rCyp was also significantly increased in the presence of CsA, recommending that this protein could be employed to screen new CsA derivatives in the future.","Seal, Soham; Polley, Soumitra; Sau, Subrata",PLoS One,170,1

Direct corneal infection of rabbits with 17syn+ propagated in Vero cells caused 60% (6 of 10) to develop severe central nervous system (CNS) disease as evidenced by seizures and/or paralysis; all neurologically impaired rabbits died. In contrast, infection of rabbits with 17syn+ propagated in BHK-21 cells induced seizures and was fatal in 10% (1 of 10). The cell-specific attenuation of a 17syn+ occurred after one growth cycle in BHK-21 cells. To determine whether the decreased virulence of the BHK-21 cell-grown virus correlated with a less severe CNS inflammatory reaction, CNS tissues from rabbits infected with 17syn+ grown in Vero and BHK-21 cells were compared. Histopathological analyses revealed no differences in the location or severity of inflammatory lesions from rabbits infected with virus grown in either cell type. Virus-induced corneal disease was less dependent upon the cell type used to propagate the virus as there were no significant differences in the type or severity of observed corneal lesions.

The aim of the developed assay is to help determine drug use in these areas and also to be a complement to interviewing patients, which will increase reliability of surveys. RESULTS: This assay detects quinine, mefloquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, lumefantrine, chloroquine and its metabolite desethylchloroquine in a 100-µl dried blood spot. Most of the drugs also have long half-lives that make them detectable at least 7 days after administration. The drugs are extracted from the dried blood spot with sequential extraction (due to the big differences in physicochemical properties), solid-phase extraction is used as sample clean-up and separation is performed with gradient-LC with MS ion-trap detection. CONCLUSION: Detection limits (S/N > 5:1) at 50 ng/ml or better were achieved for all drugs except lumefantrine (200 ng/ml), and thus can be used to determine patient compliance. A major advantage of using the ion-trap MS it that it will be possible to go back into the data and look for other drugs as needed.","Blessborn, Daniel; Romsing, Susanne; Bergqvist, Yngve; Lindegardh, Niklas",Bioanalysis,170,22

Standing on verge of exciting discoveries, research is being translated into therapies that are being widely administered to patients. Providing a hope for cure, where none existed before. This new body of knowledge has come from a better understanding of cancer genetics, molecular and sub molecular behavior, and understanding of cancer-generated cellular environments. These have led to development of immunotherapy and its many sub-genres, improvement and introduction of new radiation technologies, and decreasing toxicities of existing chemotherapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The purpose of this review is to have a summary look at this huge landscape of cancer therapy. Specially looking at toxicities that an anesthesiologist should be familiar with while providing perioperative care for these patients, complications like tumor lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndromes, Kounis syndrome, myocarditis, encephalopathies, and pituitary failure need to be kept in mind. SUMMARY: One should be knowledgeable about these therapies and approach these patients with a high index of suspicion. Anesthesiologists will need to refine preoperative assessment with appropriate testing and intraoperative and postoperative management in collaboration with oncologists, while involving the expertise of internists, cardiologist, and endocrinologists in helping assess and manage these patients in the perioperative period.","Andrabi, Tayab; French, Katy E.; Qazilbash, Muzaffar H.",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,170,11

We aimed to compare CD10, which has limited value in this scenario, with interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), a recently described sensitive and specific marker of endometrial stroma. Methods: We reviewed 25 hysterectomies containing endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma and adenomyosis. Tumor areas were classified as unequivocally myoinvasive or unequivocally noninvasive. Foci equivocal for invasion were also recorded. Immunohistochemistry for IFITM1 and CD10 was performed and scored in terms of intensity and distribution and classified as negative or positive. Results: Unlike CD10, IFITM1 staining showed significant differences in mean intensity (P < .0001) and distribution (P < .0001) between invasive vs noninvasive areas. Sixteen (84.2%) invasive and 34 (97.1%) noninvasive areas were positive for CD10 (P = .22). In contrast, none of the invasive vs 25 (71.4%) noninvasive areas were positive for IFITM1 (P < .0001). IFITM1 had 71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity in detecting stroma surrounding endometrioid adenocarcinoma, hence excluding myoinvasion. Eleven (45.8%) of 24 foci designated as equivocal stained with IFITM1. Conclusions: Compared with CD10, IFITM1 has superior performance distinguishing endometrial stroma of adenomyosis from mesenchyma surrounding invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma. IFITM1 expression is highly predictive of the absence of invasion and may be valuable in cases in which determining myoinvasion has staging implications.","Busca, Aurelia; Djordjevic, Bojana; Giassi, Ana; Parra-Herran, Carlos",Am J Clin Pathol,170,28

The 10 cysteine residues were changed to serine residues using site-directed mutagenesis. None of the cysteine mutant F proteins reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific for the mature conformation of the F protein, but eight of ten mutants reacted with an immature conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. The transport of these mutant proteins to the cell surface was drastically reduced. All of the cysteine mutant F proteins remained sensitive to endoglycosidase H (endo H) for 3 h after their synthesis. Moreover, cell surface transport of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein co-expressed with each of these cysteine mutant F proteins was also reduced. These results suggest that all cysteine residues participate in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, that co-translational disulfide bond formation is crucial to the correct folding and intracellular transport of the F protein, and that interaction of the F and HN proteins takes place intracellulary.","Segawa, Hiroaki; Kato, Masahiko; Yamashita, Tetsuro; Taira, Hideharu",J Biochem,170,1

It was found that synonymous codon and amino acid usage of PhiKZ was distinct from that of P. aeruginosa. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, the third codon position of the synonymous codons of PhiKZ carries mostly A or T base; codon usage bias in PhiKZ is dictated mainly by mutational bias and, to a lesser extent, by translational selection. A cluster analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage values of 16 myoviruses including PhiKZ shows that PhiKZ is evolutionary much closer to Escherichia coli phage T4. Further analysis reveals that the three factors of mean molecular weight, aromaticity and cysteine content are mostly responsible for the variation of amino acid usage in PhiKZ proteins, whereas amino acid usage of P. aeruginosa proteins is mainly governed by grand average of hydropathicity, aromaticity and cysteine content. Based on these observations, we suggest that codons of the phage-like PhiKZ have evolved to preferentially incorporate the smaller amino acid residues into their proteins during translation, thereby economizing the cost of its development in GC-rich P. aeruginosa.","Sau, K.; Sau, S.; Mandal, S.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation.

FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4(+) lymphocyte counts.

Genome transcription is a critical stage in the life cycle of a virus, as this is the process by which the viral genetic information is presented to the host cell protein-synthesis machinery for the production of the viral proteins needed for genome replication and progeny virion assembly. Viruses with dsRNA genomes face a particular challenge in that host cells do not produce proteins that can transcribe from a dsRNA template. One of the more striking observations about genome transcription in dsRNA viruses is that this process occurs efficiently only when the transcriptionally competent particle is fully intact. This observation suggests that all of the components of the transcriptionally competent particle, including the viral genome, the transcription enzymes, and the viral capsid, function together to produce and release messenger RNA transcripts and that each component has a specific and critical role to play in promoting the efficiency of this process.","Lawton, Jeffrey A; Estes, Mary K; Venkataram Prasad, B.V",Adv Virus Res,170,1

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver–kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver–kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver–kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.","Yap, Sufin; Vara, Roshni; Morais, Ana",Adv Ther,170,28

METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of 329 patients with severe acute pancreatitis from January 2014 to February 2019. We compared baseline characteristics, laboratory data, severity scores, types of persistent organ failure, and primary and secondary outcomes of patients with and without elevated arterial lactate levels at admission. A multivariate logistic regression analysis model and receiver operating characteristic curve were adopted to evaluate the value of arterial lactate ≥4 mmol/L for identifying high-risk patients. Trends in arterial lactate levels were compared between patients in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups over a period of 7 days. RESULTS: Compared to normal arterial lactate levels, patients with elevated arterial lactate levels show significantly higher incidences of multiple persistent organ failure (3% vs 30%, P < 0.01), death (2% vs 11%, P < 0.01), septic shock (4% vs 24%, P < 0.01), pancreatic infection (12% vs 37%, P < 0.01), abdominal compartment syndrome (3% vs 20%, P < 0.01), pancreatic necrosis (41% vs 63%, P < 0.01), and a need for ventilator support (26% vs 54%, P < 0.01). For predicting mortality, arterial lactate levels ≥4 mmol/L had a high hazard ratio (10, 95% CI; 3.7–27; P < 0.01) and the highest area under the curve (0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that initially elevated arterial lactate is independently associated with poor outcomes and death in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and may serve as an early high-risk stratification indicator.","Shu, Wenqing; Wan, Jianhua; Chen, Jie; He, Wenhua; Zhu, Yong; Zeng, Hao; Liu, Pi; Zhu, Yin; Xia, Liang; Lu, Nonghua",BMC Gastroenterol,170,28

As a result of their unique mechanism of action, they are more effective and less toxic treatment option and their clinical usage is increasing. While they are more commonly used, various adverse effects have been observed including life-threatening ones, including anaphylaxis. The aim of this review is to distinguish the anaphylaxis from other hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and provide a management algorithm for the anaphylactic reactions induced by biological agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Many case reports and series have been published regarding anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions (concerning cytokine release syndrome, acute infusion–related reactions) due to biologic agents. Although acute treatment of HSR varies according to the clinical presentation, desensitization with the drug is the major management option for subsequent administrations in the case of anaphylactic reactions. SUMMARY: Anaphylaxis and other immediate onset hypersensitivity reactions are occasionally difficult to differentiate from each other, and mixed-type reactions may be observed. Immediate management of anaphylaxis includes discontinuation of infusion, immediate administration of adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and other treatment options depending on the symptoms. After 30–120 min of the reaction, a blood sample for serum tryptase levels should be obtained and after 4–6 weeks skin testing with the culprit drug should be performed for decision of long-term management via either graded challenge or desensitization.","Akarsu, Aysegul; Soyer, Ozge; Sekerel, Bulent Enis",Curr Treat Options Allergy,170,28

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which nowadays has exceeded 2.5 million notified infections in the world and about 200,000 deaths, is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it’s necessary to make the systems and local capacities resilient to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities? METHODS. According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental, social, and economic aspects of the “period” of physical distancing. RESULTS. Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services’ plan; 04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities; 05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism. Medium-long term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07. re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services’ network; 09. integrate the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders’ awareness of the factors affecting Public Health in the cities.

Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.","Mortreux, Marie; Rosa-Caldwell, Megan E.",Life (Basel),170,1

Mutations in the SRD5A2 gene have been linked to 5α-reductase deficiency and prostate cancer. Finasteride and dutasteride, as SRD5A2 inhibitors, are widely used antiandrogen drugs for benign prostate hyperplasia. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme catalysis and inhibition for SRD5A2 and other eukaryotic integral membrane steroid reductases remain elusive due to a lack of structural information. Here, we report a crystal structure of human SRD5A2 at 2.8 Å, revealing a unique 7-TM structural topology and an intermediate adduct of finasteride and NADPH as NADP-dihydrofinasteride in a largely enclosed binding cavity inside the transmembrane domain. Structural analysis together with computational and mutagenesis studies reveal the molecular mechanisms of the catalyzed reaction and of finasteride inhibition involving residues E57 and Y91. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate high conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region that regulate NADPH/NADP(+) exchange. Mapping disease-causing mutations of SRD5A2 to our structure suggests molecular mechanisms for their pathological effects. Our results offer critical structural insights into the function of integral membrane steroid reductases and may facilitate drug development.","Xiao, Qingpin; Wang, Lei; Supekar, Shreyas; Shen, Tao; Liu, Heng; Ye, Fei; Huang, Junzhou; Fan, Hao; Wei, Zhiyi; Zhang, Cheng",Nat Commun,170,8

H(2) significantly suppressed increases in blood pressure after 5/6 nephrectomy. The anti-hypertensive effect of H(2) was also confirmed in rats in a stable hypertensive state 3 weeks after nephrectomy. To examine the detailed effects of H(2) on hypertension, we used an implanted telemetry system to continuously monitor blood pressure. H(2) exerted an anti-hypertensive effect not only during daytime rest, but also during night-time activities. Spectral analysis of blood pressure variability revealed that H(2) improved autonomic imbalance, namely by suppressing the overly active sympathetic nervous system and augmenting parasympathetic nervous system activity; these effects co-occurred with the blood pressure-lowering effect. In conclusion, 1-h daily exposure to H(2) exerts an anti-hypertensive effect in an animal model of hypertension.","Sugai, Kazuhisa; Tamura, Tomoyoshi; Sano, Motoaki; Uemura, Shizuka; Fujisawa, Masahiko; Katsumata, Yoshinori; Endo, Jin; Yoshizawa, Joe; Homma, Koichiro; Suzuki, Masaru; Kobayashi, Eiji; Sasaki, Junichi; Hakamata, Yoji",Sci Rep,170,1

Recent work showed that changes in diaphragm shear modulus (ΔSMdi) assessed using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) are strongly related to changes in Pdi (ΔPdi) in healthy subjects. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between ΔSMdi and ΔPdi in mechanically ventilated patients, and whether ΔSMdi is responsive to change in respiratory load when varying the ventilator settings. METHODS: A prospective, monocentric study was conducted in a 15-bed ICU. Patients were included if they met the readiness-to-wean criteria. Pdi was continuously monitored using a double-balloon feeding catheter orally introduced. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged using a linear transducer (SL10-2, Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, France). Ultrasound recordings were performed under various pressure support settings and during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). A breath-by-breath analysis was performed, allowing the direct comparison between ΔPdi and ΔSMdi. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) were used to investigate within-individual relationships between variables, and repeated measure correlations (R) were used for determining overall relationships between variables. Linear mixed models were used to compare breathing indices across the conditions of ventilation. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included and 930 respiratory cycles were analyzed. Twenty-five were considered for the analysis. A significant correlation was found between ΔPdi and ΔSMdi (R = 0.45, 95% CIs [0.35 0.54], p < 0.001). Individual correlation displays a significant correlation in 8 patients out of 25 (r = 0.55–0.86, all p < 0.05, versus r = − 0.43–0.52, all p > 0.06). Changing the condition of ventilation similarly affected ΔPdi and ΔSMdi. Patients in which ΔPdi–ΔSMdi correlation was non-significant had a faster respiratory rate as compared to that of patient with a significant ΔPdi–ΔSMdi relationship (median (Q1–Q3), 25 (18–33) vs. 21 (15–26) breaths.min(−1), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ultrasound SWE may be a promising surrogate to Pdi in mechanically ventilated patients. Respiratory rate appears to negatively impact SMdi measurement. Technological developments are needed to generalize this method in tachypneic patients.

However, the reliance on cross-sectional correlations and lack of adequate statistical controls are possible limitations. This study aims to add the evidence of longitudinal association to the literature by using Japanese representative longitudinal household panel data. We employed panel data analytical techniques such as the random-effects conditional logistic regression (RE-CLR) and the fixed-effects conditional logistic regression (FE-CLR) models with possible time variant confounders being controlled. Our sample was comprised of 14,717 observations of 3,501 individuals aged 22–59 years for five waves of the Japanese Household Panel Survey. We confirmed many of the factors associated with mental health reported in existing studies by analysing cross-sectional data. These significant associations are also longitudinal (within) associations estimated by the FE-CLR models. Such factors include unemployment, low household income, short nightly sleeping duration, and lack of exercise. However, we also found that several factors such as disposable income, living alone, and drinking habits are not significantly associated with mental health in the FE-CRL models. The results imply the reverse causality that poor mental health conditions cause lower disposal income, possibly due to the inability to exhibit higher productivity, but an increase in disposal income would not necessarily improve mental health conditions. In this case, aggressive policy interventions to increase the disposal income of people of lower socioeconomic backgrounds would not necessarily be effective to minimize health inequalities.","Nagasu, Miwako; Yamamoto, Isamu",PLoS One,170,11

Approaches to estimate these changes have been proposed, but most only consider single‐point missense variants and a static state of the protein, with those that incorporate dynamics are computationally expensive. Here we present DynaMut2, a web server that combines Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) methods to capture protein motion and our graph‐based signatures to represent the wildtype environment to investigate the effects of single and multiple point mutations on protein stability and dynamics. DynaMut2 was able to accurately predict the effects of missense mutations on protein stability, achieving Pearson's correlation of up to 0.72 (RMSE: 1.02 kcal/mol) on a single point and 0.64 (RMSE: 1.80 kcal/mol) on multiple‐point missense mutations across 10‐fold cross‐validation and independent blind tests. For single‐point mutations, DynaMut2 achieved comparable performance with other methods when predicting variations in Gibbs Free Energy (ΔΔG) and in melting temperature (ΔT (m)).

During peak hours (08:00−22:00), the waiting time prior to triage is prolonged, and several patients leave the ED before triage. In this project, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to revise patient flow from the time of arrival at the ED to the time of triage. Lean methodology was used to identify the redundancies and design a seamless flow process for ED patients. Through reorganising the triage area using minimal additional resources, the project team devised a novel floor plan for the triage area which provided a unique patient flow in the ED. The median patient wait time from arrival to triage was reduced from 27 min to 4.09 min and the percentage of patients leaving the ER before triage was reduced to 0%.

Here, we review three guiding principles that have been applied to the development of the currently available models: (1) establishing tolerance of the mouse host for the human graft; (2) opening hematopoietic niches so that they can be occupied by human cells; and (3) providing necessary support for human hematopoiesis. We then discuss four remaining challenges: (1) human hematopoietic lineages that poorly develop in mice; (2) limited antigen-specific adaptive immunity; (3) absent tolerance of the human immune system for its mouse host; and (4) sub-functional interactions between human immune effectors and target mouse tissues. While major advances are still needed, the current models can already be used to answer specific, clinically-relevant questions and hopefully inform the development of new, life-saving therapies.","Martinov, Tijana; McKenna, Kelly M.; Tan, Wei Hong; Collins, Emily J.; Kehret, Allie R.; Linton, Jonathan D.; Olsen, Tayla M.; Shobaki, Nour; Rongvaux, Anthony",Front Immunol,170,1

Evidence suggests that a rare population of cells within a tumor, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), exhibit stemness and phenotypic plasticity properties that are primarily responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, metastasis, cancer development, and tumor relapse. Different therapeutic approaches that target CSCs have been developed for tumor eradication. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In this review, we first provide an overview of different viewpoints about the origin of CSCs. Particular attention has been paid to views believe that CSCs are probably appeared through dysregulation of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) which reside in various tissues as the main candidate for tissue-specific stem cells. The expression of pluripotency markers in these two types of cells can strengthen the validity of this theory. In this regard, we discuss the common properties of CSCs and PSCs, and highlight the potential of PSCs in cancer studies, therapeutic applications, as well as educating the immune system against CSCs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the resemblance of CSCs to PSCs can provide an appropriate source of CSC-specific antigens through cultivation of PSCs which brings to light promising ideas for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine development.

Maternal exposure to PM during pregnancy is particularly harmful to children’s health since this is a phase of rapid human growth and development. METHOD: In this review, we synthesize the scientific evidence on adverse health outcomes in children following prenatal exposure to the smallest toxic components, fine (PM(2.5)) and ultrafine (PM(0.1)) PM. We highlight the established and emerging findings from epidemiologic studies and experimental models. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to fine and ultrafine PM directly and indirectly yields numerous adverse birth outcomes and impacts on children’s respiratory systems, immune status, brain development, and cardiometabolic health. The biological mechanisms underlying adverse effects include direct placental translocation of ultrafine particles, placental and systemic maternal oxidative stress and inflammation elicited by both fine and ultrafine PM, epigenetic changes, and potential endocrine effects that influence long-term health. CONCLUSION: Policies to reduce maternal exposure and health consequences in children should be a high priority. PM(2.5) levels are regulated, yet it is recognized that minority and low socioeconomic status groups experience disproportionate exposures. Moreover, PM(0.1) levels are not routinely measured or currently regulated. Consequently, preventive strategies that inform neighborhood/regional planning and clinical/nutritional recommendations are needed to mitigate maternal exposure and ultimately protect children’s health.

Rapid and accurate detection of lower respiratory tract colonization and/or infection with P. aeruginosa may advise targeted preventive (antibody-based) strategies and antibiotic therapy. To investigate this, we compared semi-quantitative culture results from 80 endotracheal aspirates (ETA) collected from mechanically-ventilated patients, to two culture and two non-culture-based methods for detection of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: P. aeruginosa-positive (n = 40) and -negative (n = 40) ETAs from mechanically ventilated patients analyzed initally by (i) routine semi-quantitative culture, were further analyzed with (ii) quantitative culture on chromogenic ChromID P. aeruginosa and blood agar; (iii) enrichment in brain heart infusion broth followed by plating on blood agar and ChromID P. aeruginosa; (iv) O-antigen acetylase gene-based TaqMan qPCR; and (v) GeneXpert PA PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 80 ETA samples included, one sample that was negative for P. aeruginosa by semi-quantitative culture was found to be positive by the other four methods, and was included in an “extended” gold standard panel. Based on this extended gold standard, both semi-quantitative culture and the GeneXpert PA assay showed 97.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The quantitative culture, enrichment culture and O-antigen acetylase gene-based TaqMan qPCR had a sensitivity of 97.6%, 89.5%, 92.7%, and a specificity of 97.4%, 100%, and 71.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This first evaluation of the GeneXpert PA assay with ETA samples found it to be as sensitive and specific as the routine, hospital-based semi-quantitative culture method. Additionally, the GeneXpert PA assay is easy to perform (hands-on time ≈ 5 min) and rapid (≈ 55 min assay time). The combination of the high sensitivity and high specificity together with the rapid acquisition of results makes the GeneXpert PA assay a highly recommended screening technique. Where this equipment is not available, semi-quantitative culture remains the most sensitive of the culture methods evaluated here for P. aeruginosa detection in ETA samples.

The protein is widely studied and its composition was revealed and sequenced already during the 1980s. The human immune system creates a good response against PT when measured in quantity. However, the serum anti-PT antibodies wane rapidly, and only a small amount of these antibodies are found a few years after vaccination/infection. Therefore, multiple approaches to study the functionality (quality) of these antibodies, e.g., avidity, neutralizing capacity, and epitope specificity, have been investigated. In addition, the long-term B cell memory (Bmem) to PT is crucial for good protection throughout life. In this review, we summarize the findings from functional PT antibody and Bmem studies. These results are discussed in line with the quantity of serum anti-PT antibodies. PT neutralizing antibodies and anti-PT antibodies with proper avidity are crucial for good protection against the disease, and certain epitopes have been identified to have multiple functions in the protection. Although PT-specific Bmem responses are detectable at least five years after vaccination, long-term surveillance is lacking. Variation of the natural boosting of circulating Bordetella pertussis in communities is an important confounding factor in these memory studies.","Barkoff, Alex-Mikael; Knuutila, Aapo; Mertsola, Jussi; He, Qiushui",Toxins (Basel),170,1

By using a murine model of chronic house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation, we tested the expression of several autophagy markers in the lung and spleen of asthma-like animals. Compared to control mice, in HDM-sensitized and challenged mice, the expression of sequestosome-1/p62, a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays an important role in the autophagy machinery, was raised in the splenocytes. In contrast, its expression was decreased in the neutrophils recovered from the bronchoalveolar fluid, indicating that autophagy was independently regulated in these two compartments. In a strategy of drug repositioning, we treated allergen-sensitized mice with the therapeutic peptide P140 known to target chaperone-mediated autophagy. A single intravenous administration of P140 in these mice resulted in a significant reduction in airway resistance and elastance, and a reduction in the number of neutrophils and eosinophils present in the bronchoalveolar fluid. It corrected the autophagic alteration without showing any suppressive effect in the production of IgG1 and IgE. Collectively, these findings show that autophagy processes are altered in allergic airway inflammation.

Ruxolitinib, the first FDA-approved JAK1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is efficient in reducing spleen size and improving patient symptoms, but it has not been shown to eradicate the MF clone. In this study, using functional genomics techniques, we identified the proteasome family as an additional therapeutic target and demonstrated that inhibition of the proteasome family by carfilzomib in combination with ruxolitinib enhanced suppression of primary MF cells in vitro. ABSTRACT: As the first FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis (MF), ruxolitinib improves clinical symptoms but does not lead to eradication of the disease or significant reduction of the mutated allele burden. The resistance of MF clones against the suppressive action of ruxolitinib may be due to intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms leading to activity of additional pro-survival genes or signalling pathways that function independently of JAK2/STAT5. To identify alternative therapeutic targets, we applied a pooled-shRNA library targeting ~5000 genes to a JAK2(V617F)-positive cell line under a variety of conditions, including absence or presence of ruxolitinib and in the presence of a bone marrow microenvironment-like culture medium. We identified several proteasomal gene family members as essential to HEL cell survival. The importance of these genes was validated in MF cells using the proteasomal inhibitor carfilzomib, which also enhanced lethality in combination with ruxolitinib. We also showed that proteasome gene expression is reduced by ruxolitinib in MF CD34(+) cells and that additional targeting of proteasomal activity by carfilzomib enhances the inhibitory action of ruxolitinib in vitro. Hence, this study suggests a potential role for proteasome inhibitors in combination with ruxolitinib for management of MF patients.","Claudiani, Simone; Mason, Clinton C.; Milojkovic, Dragana; Bianchi, Andrea; Pellegrini, Cristina; Di Marco, Antinisca; Fiol, Carme R.; Robinson, Mark; Ponnusamy, Kanagaraju; Mokretar, Katya; Chowdhury, Avirup; Albert, Michael; Reid, Alistair G.; Deininger, Michael W.; Naresh, Kikkeri; Apperley, Jane F.; Khorashad, Jamshid S.",Cancers (Basel),170,33

An application user can describe the agent-based simulation model only by writing script in SOARS script language without knowledge of Java classes. If needed, the user can customize the function of SOARS by implementing additional Java classes.

HSCT-associated pulmonary complications can be classified as infectious or noninfectious, and they often follow a predictable timeline, occurring during discrete phases of HSCT (pre-engraftment, early post-engraftment, late post-engraftment). However, certain post-HSCT pulmonary complications span the entire post-HSCT course. The most common causes of noninfectious pulmonary complications are related to the conditioning regimen used which can result in varying degrees of acute or delayed lung injury, the degree of recipient–donor HLA histoincompatibility, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source, the degree of graft manipulation, and the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), both acute and chronic. Infectious etiologies can be caused by any class of pathogen including bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan. They usually occur during periods of profound and/or prolonged neutropenia and/or impaired or delayed cellular and humoral immune recovery. Immunosuppression used to prevent or treat GvHD also places a HSCT recipient at high risk for developing pulmonary infections that can be life-threatening. This chapter discusses the most common pulmonary complications associated with HSCT by time period post-HSCT.","Kapadia, Malika; Shapiro, Terry Wikle",Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for the Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist,170,33

However, virus-induced changes at the sub-cellular and molecular levels are best studied in cultured cells; observations at this level can then be used to interpret changes found in whole animals. Viral cytopathology is as complex as cell biology itself; hence, it is not surprising that the subject is still largely at the descriptive level of understanding. The analysis of viral replication has been simplified at a biochemical level by the concept of strategies of viral replication; there is as yet no such unifying theme as to how DNA or RNA viruses redirect cellular metabolism and kill or transform infected cells. The chapter discusses the various types of interactions that can occur between virus and cell. Viruses may be categorized as cytocidal (lytic) and noncytocidal (nonlytic). Not all infections, whether cytocidal or noncytocidal, necessarily lead to the production of new virions. Cell changes of a profound nature, leading to cell death in some cases and cell transformation in others, may also occur in nonproductive (abortive) infections. Looked at from the point of view of the cell rather than the virus, certain kinds of cells are permissive, that is, they support complete replication of a particular virus, while others are non-permissive, that is, replication is blocked at some point. Cytopathic changes can occur in both productive and nonproductive infections and in permissive and nonpermissive cells.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non‐stationarity, and cross‐sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid‐19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre‐crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy‐makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post‐crisis, policy‐makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re‐establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery.","Lee, Chien‐Chiang; Olasehinde‐Williams, Godwin; Akadiri, Seyi Saint",,170,28

Simulations provided to younger normal-hearing adults were used to investigate the effect of sensation level, speech presentation level, and spectral shape in comparison to older adults with hearing loss. Method Measures were assessed in quiet, steady-state noise, and speech-modulated noise. Older adults with hearing loss listened to speech that was spectrally shaped according to their hearing thresholds. Younger adults with normal hearing listened to speech that simulated the hearing-impaired group's (a) reduced audibility, (b) increased speech levels, and (c) spectral shaping. Group comparisons were made based on speech recognition performance and masking release. Additionally, younger adults completed measures of listening effort and perceived speech quality to assess if differences across simulations in these outcome measures were similar to those for speech recognition. Results Across the various simulations employed, testing in the presence of a threshold matching noise best matched differences in speech recognition and masking release between younger and older adults. This result remained consistent across the other two outcome measures. Conclusions A combination of audibility, speech level, and spectral shape factors is required to simulate differences between listeners with normal and impaired hearing in recognition, listening effort, and perceived speech quality. The use of spectrally shaped and amplified speech in the presence of threshold matching noise best provided this simulated control.

DESIGN A cross-sectional correlational survey with a combination of a convenience and snowball sampling design. SETTING This study was conducted online from February 7 to 14, 2020, the third week after the lockdown of Wuhan city on January 23. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2,654 residents was contacted, 2,534 agreed to participate, and 2,215 completed valid questionnaires. The sample covered 30 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions of China, and a broader region. MEASURES The Uncertainty About COVID-19 Scale was applied to assess perceived public uncertainty. Five dimensions of health beliefs about COVID-19 and 12 health-related response behaviors were measured. ANALYSIS Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to identify associations. Mediation was assessed by a bootstrapping technique. RESULTS Five constructs of health beliefs were found to be significant predictors of multiple response behaviors. Uncertainty about COVID-19 has a direct relationship with general response behaviors (β=-0.119**) and sanitization practices (β=-0.068**). Emergency coping behaviors aside, uncertainty also partially mediated associations between perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, and perceived barriers influencing general response behaviors and sanitization practices, respectively. CONCLUSION Findings provide evidence-based information to government and policymakers for designing effective health communication messages and intervention strategies by targeting the key constructs of the health belief model and reducing perceived uncertainty about COVID-19. They support public health-related response behaviors to prevent COVID-19 spread among the population.","Wu, Dan; Rockett, Ian R H; Yang, Tingzhong; Yang, Xiaozhao Yousef; Wang, Mengmeng; Jiao, Can",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,170,23

Yet, conventional TMS configurations affect primarily neurons that are aligned parallel to the induced electric field by a fixed coil, making the activation orientation-specific. A novel method termed rotational field TMS (rfTMS), where two orthogonal coils are operated with a 90° phase shift, produces rotation of the electric field vector over almost a complete cycle, and may stimulate larger portion of the neuronal population within a given brain area. OBJECTIVE To compare the physiological effects of rfTMS and conventional unidirectional TMS (udTMS) in the motor cortex. METHODS Hand and leg resting motor thresholds (rMT), and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and latencies (at 120% of rMT), were measured using a dual-coil array based on the H7-coil, in 8 healthy volunteers following stimulation at different orientations of either udTMS or rfTMS. RESULTS For both target areas rfTMS produced significantly lower rMTs and much higher MEPs than those induced by udTMS, for comparable induced electric field amplitude. Both hand and leg rMTs were orientation-dependent. CONCLUSIONS rfTMS induces stronger physiologic effects in targeted brain regions at significantly lower intensities. Importantly, given the activation of a much larger population of neurons within a certain brain area, repeated application of rfTMS may induce different neuroplastic effects in neural networks, opening novel research and clinical opportunities.","Roth, Yiftach; Pell, Gaby S; Barnea-Ygael, Noam; Ankry, Moria; Hadad, Yafit; Eisen, Ami; Burnishev, Yuri; Tendler, Aron; Moses, Elisha; Zangen, Abraham",Brain stimulation,170,25

However, precise hemostatic changes in the very early stage of the disease are not completely studied. The aim of the study was to study von Willebrand factor (vWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) plasma levels and activity in the first hours (up to 24 h) of PAF clinical manifestation. Material and methods We selected consecutively 51 non-anticoagulated patients (26 men, 25 women, mean age: 59.84 ±1.60) with PAF and 52 controls (26 men, 26 women, mean age: 59.50 ±1.46 years) corresponding in gender, accompanying diseases and conducted treatment. The indicators were examined using enzyme-linked immunoassays and photometric tests. Results All patients were hospitalized between the 2nd and 24th h after the onset of arrhythmia (mean: 8.14 ±0.74 h). Higher FVIII levels (107.52 ±3.48% vs. 93.85 ±2.93%, p < 0.05) and activity (200.03 ±11.11% vs. 109.73 ±4.90%, p < 0.001) were found in the PAF group. vWF levels (178.40 ±12.95% vs. 119.53 ±6.12%, p < 0.001) and activity (200.92 ±12.45% vs. 110.80 ±5.14%, p < 0.001) were also higher. These changes did not depend on age, sex, body mass index or CHA2DS2-VASc score in the PAF group (p > 0.05). PAF duration was a significant predictor of increased FVIII levels and activity. Increased PAF duration was followed by increased values of the factors (r = 0.85, p < 0.001; r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Conclusions The results presented an activated coagulation cascade and endothelial injury, suggesting hypercoagulability still in the early hours of PAF. These changes in PAF did not correlate with CHA2DS2-VASc score risk factors, outlining PAF as a possible independent embolic risk factor.","Negreva, Mariya Negrinova; Prodanova, Krasimira; Vitlianova, Katerina; Madjova, Christiana",Archives of medical sciences.

Recently, epigenetic alterations have been included in the classification of the CRC molecular subtype, and this points out their prognostic impact. As epigenetic modifications are reversible, they may represent relevant therapeutic targets. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulates gene expression. For many years, the deregulation of DNA methylation has been considered to play a substantial part in CRC etiology and evolution. Despite considerable advances in CRC treatment, patient therapy response persists as limited, and their profit from systemic therapies are often hampered by the introduction of chemoresistance. In addition, inter-individual changes in therapy response in CRC patients can arise from their specific (epi)genetic compositions. In this review article, we summarize the options of CRC treatment based on DNA methylation status for their predictive value. This review also includes the therapy outcomes based on the patient's methylation status in CRC patients. In addition, the current challenge of research is to develop therapeutic inhibitors of DNMT. Based on the essential role of DNA methylation in CRC development, the application of DNMT inhibitors was recently proposed for the treatment of CRC patients, especially in patients with DNA hypermethylation.","Cervena, Klara; Siskova, Anna; Buchler, Tomas; Vodicka, Pavel; Vymetalkova, Veronika",Cells,170,16

The current study was performed to determine whether virtual robotic skill maintenance can serve as an adequate substitute for practice on a surgical robot. Eleven surgical residents with no prior robotic training were trained to a level of robotic proficiency with inanimate models, including a needle driving pad, a running suture pad, and ring placement on a rocking peg board. After reaching proficiency, each resident was tested on a complex tissue closure task. For the next 8 weeks, the only robotic activity was biweekly virtual robotic skills maintenance. After 8 weeks, the residents performed the tissue closure task twice with the robot, followed by evaluation on the inanimate models used to reach proficiency. Repeated-measures statistical analyses were used to compare between the three tissue closure trials and between the final test at week 0 and the evaluation at week 8 for the other inanimate models. Time to complete the tissue closure task was more than 20 % lower for the second evaluation at 8 weeks than for the other two trials (p < 0.05). Residents maintained their skills for needle driving, but times for suture running and rocking peg board increased by more than 20 % at 8 weeks (p < 0.01).

We have used next-generation sequencing and nonparametric statistical analysis to estimate a lower bound for the total number of different TCR beta (TCRB) sequences in human repertoires. We arrived at surprisingly high minimal estimates of 100 million unique TCRB sequences in naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cell repertoires of young adults. Naïve repertoire richness modestly declined two- to fivefold in healthy elderly. Repertoire richness contraction with age was even less pronounced for memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. In contrast, age had a major impact on the inequality of clonal sizes, as estimated by a modified Gini-Simpson index clonality score. In particular, large naïve T-cell clones that were distinct from memory clones were found in the repertoires of elderly individuals, indicating uneven homeostatic proliferation without development of a memory cell phenotype. Our results suggest that a highly diverse repertoire is maintained despite thymic involution; however, peripheral fitness selection of T cells leads to repertoire perturbations that can influence the immune response in the elderly.","Qi, Qian; Liu, Yi; Cheng, Yong; Glanville, Jacob; Zhang, David; Lee, Ji-Yeun; Olshen, Richard A; Weyand, Cornelia M; Boyd, Scott D; Goronzy, Jörg J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,170,1

The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-γ. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","Bos, Rinke; Rutten, Lucy; van der Lubbe, Joan E M; Bakkers, Mark J G; Hardenberg, Gijs; Wegmann, Frank; Zuijdgeest, David; de Wilde, Adriaan H; Koornneef, Annemart; Verwilligen, Annemiek; van Manen, Danielle; Kwaks, Ted; Vogels, Ronald; Dalebout, Tim J; Myeni, Sebenzile K; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J; Li, Zhenfeng; Barouch, Dan H; Vellinga, Jort; Langedijk, Johannes P M; Zahn, Roland C; Custers, Jerome; Schuitemaker, Hanneke",NPJ vaccines,170,1

Nowadays, no effective therapy is available, and the scientific community is moving to find a therapeutic choice to fight this silent enemy. Studies are ongoing on several therapeutic options, including antiviral agents, immunomodulant drugs, immunotherapy. Due to viral features, including the ability to start an inflammatory response that seems to be the fulcrum of COVID-19 pathogenic action, immunotherapy could represent a promising alternative waiting for the vaccine.

Affected calves were aged 13-18 weeks (Farm I), 6 months (Farm II), and 2-11 weeks (Farm III), and the mortality rate was 22/175 (13%), 5/80 (6%), and 60/900 (7%), respectively. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS Affected calves rapidly became moribund, were in respiratory distress, and had a fever (40-41°C). Post-mortem examination of nine calves revealed fibrinopurulent pleuritis, pericarditis, and peritonitis. This was confirmed histopathologically on tissues from three calves, one from each farm; aggregates of small Gram-negative coccobacilli were evident on Gram stain. Pasteurella multocida was cultured from tissues from affected calves on the three farms, and PCR of DNA extracted from tissue samples amplified cap-sular type B-specific DNA. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) demonstrated that all capsular type B isolates belonged to the same sequence type (ST), ST62, but did not belong to serotype B:2, the only B serotype classified as causing haemorrhagic septicaemia by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). DIAGNOSIS Pleuritis and peritonitis due to infection with P. multocida capsular type B strain. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Haemorrhagic septicaemia was excluded as a cause of disease from the three farms, however P. multocida was the primary agent in the affected calves. It is possible the agent has been present in New Zealand for some time but not reported, as there had been no transfer of animals between affected farms. Emergence of the syndrome could potentially be a result of factors other than just the presence of the organism, such as changing management. The syndrome described may be of increasing importance in the future.","McFadden, A M J; Christensen, H; Fairley, R A; Hill, F I; Gill, J M; Keeling, S E; Spence, R P",New Zealand veterinary journal,170,28

This review identifies patient-centered practices that ensure safety and reduce risk of infection transmission to health care workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS Consensus statements, guidelines, institutional recommendations, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and previous outbreaks were reviewed. A global interdisciplinary team analyzed and prioritized findings via electronic communications and video conferences to develop consensus recommendations. RESULTS Aerosol-generating procedures are commonly performed by nurses and other health care workers, most notably during suctioning, tracheostomy tube changes, and stoma care. Patient repositioning, readjusting circuits, administering nebulized medications, and patient transport also present risks. Standard personal protective equipment includes an N95/FFP3 mask with or without surgical masks, gloves, goggles, and gown when performing aerosol-generating procedures for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Viral testing of bronchial aspirate via tracheostomy may inform care providers when determining the protective equipment required. The need for protocols to reduce risk of transmission of infection to nurses and other health care workers is evident. CONCLUSION Critical care nurses and multidisciplinary teams often care for patients with a tracheostomy who are known or suspected to have COVID-19. Appropriate care of these patients relies on safeguarding the health care team.

These patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary medical team. Airway management, operative procedures, and transfusion needs of the patient with an oral penetration injury should be discussed before surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 63-year-old man with a history of recurrent hepatic duct cancer attempted suicide by advancing an intravenous pole through his mouth, neck, and thorax, ultimately penetrating into the right retroperitoneal space. A multidisciplinary team assembled by code blue emergently treated the patient, initially with fiberoptic intubation. The injured right lower lung was resected under one lung ventilation via a double lumen tube after tracheostomy. Fortunately, the pole did not injure any other organs or major vessels. Despite successful removal of the pole after lung resection, the patient died 14 days postoperatively due to his primary hepatic duct cancer. DISCUSSION We highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to this patient's management and discuss particular aspects of airway and transfusion management. CONCLUSION A systematic and multidisciplinary approach allowed successful removal of the drip pole and stabilization of the patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status.","Takaki, Shunsuke; Yamaguchi, Osamu; Morimura, Naoto; Goto, Takahisa",International journal of surgery case reports,170,29

The combination of single-site surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES™) can be used for totally transanal laparoendoscopic pull-through colectomy with J-pouch creation (TLPC-J). The aim of the present study was to provide evidence for the feasibility of TLPC-J in adult human cadavers. METHODS TLPC-J was performed in six fresh adult human cadavers. The procedure involved endorectal submucosal dissection from 1 cm above the dentate line to a point above the peritoneal reflection, where the rectal muscle was divided circumferentially. The edge of the mucosal cuff was closed distally in order to prevent fecal contamination and the endorectal tube was placed back into the abdomen. A Triport+™ or QuadPort+™ system was introduced transanally, and it served as a multiport device (MD). Resection of the entire colon, mobilization of the distal ileal segment, and extracorporeal suture of the ileal J-loop were performed via the transanal approach. The J-pouch was created using Endo GIA™. After removal of the MD, the J-pouch was sutured to the rectal wall. RESULTS TLPC-J was performed in all cadavers, with a mean operation duration of 236 ± 22 min. Conversion to either transabdominal laparoscopy or laparotomy was not required in any of the cadavers. No bowel perforation or damage to other organs was observed. The use of a curved endoscope greatly facilitated visualization during transanal laparoscopic dissection for partial and total colectomy, making the procedure feasible. All specimens were retrieved through the anus, eliminating the need for additional transabdominal incisions. CONCLUSIONS TLPC-J was technically feasible in adult human cadavers, and abdominal wall incisions were not required. However, clinical studies are needed to determine its feasibility in living adults.","Vahdad, M Reza; Cernaianu, Grigore; Semaan, Alexander; Klein, Tobias; Faran, Samuel; Zemon, Harry; Boemers, Thomas; Foroutan, Hamid Reza",Surgical endoscopy,170,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS Follow-up CT examinations of 14 patients (seven men, seven women; age range, 30-90 years) who underwent 16 RFA sessions for the treatment of primary (n = 9) or metastatic (n = 5) lung tumors with a mean follow-up of 35 +/- 15 (SD) months (range, 7-60 months) were retrospectively reviewed by two thoracic radiologists. The site and size of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were recorded at baseline and at follow-up 1, 3, and 6 months after RFA sessions. In addition, the size, type, and location of the ablated lesion or lesions were recorded. All complications from RFA were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS An increase in lymph node size was detected after 10 of 16 (62.5%) RFA sessions at 1-month follow-up. In four of 10 patients, only one node had enlarged, and in the remaining six patients, more than one nodal region had enlarged. The average increase in nodal size was 3 mm in the short-axis diameter and 4 mm in the long-axis diameter. Twenty-eight percent of RFA sessions were associated with enlargement of at least one lymph node to greater than 10 mm in short-axis diameter at 1-month follow-up. CT showed that nodes had decreased in size at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Lesion size, location, and complications were not shown to be significantly associated with mediastinal lymph node enlargement (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Recognition of reversible locoregional lymph node enlargement after RFA is important to prevent misdiagnosis of nodal metastatic disease.","Sharma, Amita; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Lanuti, Michael; Shepard, Jo-Anne O",AJR.

Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed. Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making. This study investigated whether surrogates' characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogates' accuracy and intervention selections. Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient. METHODS 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey. Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios. Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer. RESULTS When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogates' accuracy, F (6) = 3.03, R2 = .12, p = .008. Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5.95, R2 = .14, p = .00. Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions. CONCLUSIONS Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogates' characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS These findings can inform development of decision-making interventions to improve surrogates' accuracy. Providers may attend to variables highlighted by this study to support surrogates, particularly within the stressful context of COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.","Spalding, Rachael L; Edelstein, Barry",Patient education and counseling,170,24

This study determined whether combining bevacizumab (Bmab) with TAS-102 improves clinical outcomes in refractory mCRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from Japanese patients with refractory mCRC who received TAS-102 (35 mg/m2 , twice a day) with (T-B group) or without Bmab (TAS-102 monotherapy; T group) between July 2014 and December 2018. The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were median time to treatment failure, overall response rate, and the incidence of adverse events. Clinical outcomes were compared using propensity score matched analysis. RESULTS Data from 57 patients were analyzed (T-B group: 21 patients, T group: 36 patients). Median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 4.5 months, p < .001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that combination therapy with Bmab was significantly correlated with OS. Propensity score matched analysis confirmed that the median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 6.1 months, p = .006) and that there was a significant correlation between Bmab and OS. The incidence of hypertension (grade ≥2) as an adverse event was significantly higher in the T-B group than the T group (23.8% vs. 0.0%, p = .005), whereas other adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION Treatment with Bmab in combination with TAS-102 is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC refractory to standard therapies.

Research has indicated that yoga has promising potential in reducing stress in the workplace. However, there are very few studies exploring the impact of online streamed yoga on stress management for people-WFH. OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility and outcome of an online streamed yoga intervention on stress and wellbeing of people-WFH during COVID-19. METHODS A six-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) yoga intervention was designed with yoga (n = 26) and a wait-list control group (n = 26). A mixed two-way ANOVA was used to assess changes in standardised outcome measures at baseline and post-intervention. Likert and open-ended questions assessed enjoyment, acceptability and perceived benefits of the program, which were analysed thematically. RESULTS Compared with the control, the yoga group reported significant improvements in perceived stress, mental wellbeing, depression and coping self-efficacy, but not stress and anxiety. Participants experienced physical and mental health benefits and reported high acceptability and enjoyment of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS An online yoga intervention can help people WFH manage stress and enhance wellbeing and coping abilities.","Wadhen, Vipin; Cartwright, Tina",Work,170,1

We performed bilateral carotid ligation (n=9) in rabbits to simulate carotid occlusion, and sham surgery (n=3) for control. Upon euthanasia (n=3 at 5 days, n=6 at 6 months post ligation, and n=3 at 5 days after sham operation), vascular corrosion casts of the circle of Willis (CoW) were created. Using scanning electron microscopy, we quantified gross morphologic, macroscopic, and microscopic changes on the endocasts and compared findings with histologic data. At 5 days, CoW arteries of ligated animals increased caliber. The posterior communicating artery (PCom) increased length and tortuosity, and the ophthalmic artery (OA) origin presented preaneurysmal bulges. At 6 months, calibers were unchanged from 5 days, PComs further increased tortuosity while presenting segmental dilations, and the OA origin and basilar terminus presented preaneurysmal bulges. This exploratory study provides evidence that flow increase after carotid occlusion produces both compensatory arterial augmentation and pathologic remodeling such as tortuosity and saccular/fusiform aneurysm. Our findings may have considerable clinical implications, as these lesser-known consequences should be considered when managing patients with carotid artery disease or choosing carotid ligation as a therapeutic option.","Tutino, Vincent M; Mandelbaum, Max; Choi, Hoon; Pope, Liza C; Siddiqui, Adnan; Kolega, John; Meng, Hui",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,170,31

Patenting these new, nonobvious, and efficient technological solutions is a critical step in fostering the research and development, the huge investments as well as the commercial processes. This article considers the challenges of the current patent law as they apply to AI inventions in general and especially in the age of a global pandemic. The article proposes a novel solution to the hurdles of patenting AI technology by establishing a new patent track model for AI inventions (including the inventions that are made by AI systems and creative AI systems themselves). Unlike other publications promoting either complete abandonment of AI related patents, or advocating to maintain current patent laws, or recommending minor adjustment to patent laws, this article suggests a novel model of separate patent venue solely targeting AI inventions. The argument of this article is based on four pillars: the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter, the hurdle of the ""blackbox"" conundrum, the confusion of who is ""a person of ordinary skills in the art"" (""POSITA""), and the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model, a crucial step, especially during a global epidemic. The first pillar of the argument is the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter in AI inventions. We therefore propose the new AI patent track model that would extend the scope of patent protection to cover creative AI systems, including both the algorithms and trained models, and AI-made inventions in order to, inter alia, incentivize investments of the ""Multi-Players"". The second pillar of the argument of the argument is the hurdle posed by the ""blackbox"" conundrum of AI systems that undermines the explainability and transparency of the inventions. In analogy to already existing rules applied to microorganism patents that are hard to describe, we advise a depository rule for AI working models to sufficiently describe the otherwise inexplicable inventions. The third pillar arises from the confusion of who is a person of ordinary skills in regard to the nonobviousness assessment of AI inventions. We submit an alternative standard of ""a skilled person using an ordinary AI tool in the art"" under the new track model to enable the evaluation of the patentability of complex AI inventions. The fourth pillar of the argument is the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model on the grounds that the current patent law regime has posed substantial hurdles and uncertainties for patenting AI inventions with regard to almost all patentability requirements. We analyzed each of the requirements to demonstrate that most, if not all, aspects of patent law are not suitable in the AI era; only a revolutionary new patent model specific for AI inventions could solve all the concerns while maintaining the patent incentive for innovations. Our model also suggests an expedited examination with the aid of AI tools and a shortened patent lifetime in light of the fast AI development and technology elimination speed. The article concludes with the hope to harness AI technology for the wellbeing of humanity, in general and especially during tough times in the current COVID-19 era and in general.","Yanisky-Ravid, Shlomit; Jin, Regina",SSRN,170,19

Few studies have evaluated the effect of the learning curve, and the limitations of most of these studies were the number of women included and the multiplicity of surgeons undertaking the procedure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a caseload of 100 patients during the learning curve of a single experienced surgeon performing LM. METHODS A prospective comparative analysis of 200 consecutive cases of LM was conducted between December 2004 and March 2013. Outcomes of the first 100 procedures (Group A) were compared with the later 100 (Group B). RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 39 years (24-54 years), with a mean BMI of 27 kg/m(2) (16-46). Both the groups were very similar with regard to the number, size and weight of myomas removed, the duration of surgery, and blood loss. More women were sent home within 24 h in the second group (27 vs 10.2 %, p = 0.002). Group A suffered significantly higher complication rates compared to Group B (11 vs 7, p < 0.05). The laparotomy conversion rate was 1.5 % (3 in Group A, none in Group B). CONCLUSIONS After a caseload of 100 patients during the learning curve, there was no difference in outcomes apart from increased confidence to discharge patients after 24 h and reduced complication rates. Thus, mere numbers do not influence the number/size of fibroids removed, operating time, or blood loss but do influence complication rates and post-operative discharge times.","Shah, Savan; Odejinmi, Jimi F; Agarwal, Nilesh",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology of India,170,19

We focus not only on experimental results but also discuss theoretical and simulation studies regarding kinetic and structural aspects of heteroaggregation processes arising in such systems. In the first part of this work, heteroaggregation of oppositely charged particles is reviewed. When the interactions are short ranged, binary diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation takes place. In this case, the short time behavior of the system follows the Hogg, Healy and Fuerstenau (HHF) theory. At long times, however, stable aggregates may form and remain in the system. Furthermore, cluster discrimination is observed, clusters that differ only by one constituent particle were found to behave quite differently. When the range of the interactions is increased, the latter effects become more pronounced. The fractal dimension of heteroaggregates is, in general, smaller than the values reported for fast and slow homoaggregation processes. In some cases, even values close to unity were obtained. This means that heteroaggregates have an open branched structure that may approach a chain-like morphology. In the second part of this work, we briefly discuss similar effects arising in heteroaggregation phenomena due to differences in particle size and chemical composition. The third part of this review tackles recent developments in the field of equilibrium phase diagrams of binary colloids. In the last section, the relatively small number of papers about heteroaggregation processes in two-dimensional systems is also discussed.","López-López, J M; Schmitt, A; Moncho-Jordá, A; Hidalgo-Álvarez, R",Soft matter,170,1

The present study reports an unusual case of C. krusei pneumonia that was initially suspected to be a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) case. A 64-year-old Saudi Arabian male patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough and dyspnea that persisted for 6 days. The patient presented fever (oral temperature, 38.5°C) and slight tachypnea (25 respirations/min). A chest computerized tomography demonstrated unclear lung fields, diffuse pathological changes in the two lungs and multiple lymphadenectasis in the retrocaval and para-aortic arch area. The patient received 95-98% oxygen (6 l/min) for 24 h, as well as sulbactam sodium/cefoperazone sodium (1:1) injection (3.0 g) every 12 h, oral oseltamivir capsules (75 mg/time) twice a day, medaron injection (80 mg/time) and 750 ml fluid infusion; however, he succumbed to the disease on day 2 after admission. The infection was diagnosed by sputum smear and culture subsequent to patient mortality. A sputum smear showed a large fungal infection and sputum culture revealed the presence of C. krusei infection. Serum procalcitonin concentrations were 4.73 µg/l and 7.23 µg/l on days 2 and 3 after admission, respectively. In conclusion, the diagnosis of Candida pneumonia should be strongly considered in the presence of growth of Candida from a sputum culture and based on a suggestive computed tomography image. Tumescent diaphragmatic lymph nodes may also be an important symptom of Candida pneumonia. Treatment should be initiated immediately to improve tissue oxygenation, restore cardiovascular function and improve other organ functions.","Tan, Mingming; Wang, Junwei; Hu, Peiyang; Wang, Bin; Xu, Wanghua; Chen, Jiao",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,170,19

Technical success generally remains high although ""failure-to-cross"" still complicates 5-20% of cases. Extended efforts to cross long, occlusive lesions can utilize significant hospital and practitioner resources. The hospital is typically reimbursed for this effort as facility fees are charged by the hour and materials are charged per use. However, given the lack of a CPT® code for ""failure-to-cross,"" practitioners are rarely appropriately compensated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the predictors, technical details, outcomes, and costs of ""failure-to-cross"" during PPI. METHODS All PPI procedures over a two-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, results, costs, and reimbursements obtained from hospital cost accounting were compared between successful therapeutic interventions, crossing failures and diagnostic angiograms without attempted intervention. RESULTS A total of 146 consecutive PPIs were identified; the rate of ""failure-to-cross"" was 11.6% (17 patients). The majority of patients with ""failure-to-cross"" were male (82%) with single-vessel run-off (53%). Compared to successful interventions, the incidences of chronic-limb threatening ischemia (82% vs. 70%, p=0.34) and infrapopliteal occlusive disease were similar (47% vs. 31%, p=0.20). ""Failure-to-cross"" procedures were just as long as successful procedures; there were no significant differences in fluoroscopy time (27±10 vs. 24±14 min, p=0.52), in-room time (106±98 vs. 103±44 min, p=0.84) or contrast dye volume utilization (73±37 vs. 96±54 ml, p=0.12). As expected, ""failure-to-cross"" procedures incurred far higher hospital charges and costs as compared to non-interventional diagnostic angiograms (charges $13,311±6067 vs. $7690±1942, p<0.01; costs $5289±2099 vs. $2826±1198, p<0.01). Despite the additional time and effort spent attempting to cross difficult lesions, the operators were reimbursed at the same low rate as a purely diagnostic procedure (average fee charge $7360; average reimbursement $992). After 1-year, the 17 patients in whom lesions could not be crossed were treated with either advanced interventional procedures with success (n=2), surgical bypass grafting (n=5), extremity amputation (n=4) or no additional intervention in their salvaged limb (n=6). CONCLUSION Patients whose lesions cannot be crossed during PPI fare worse than patients undergoing successful interventions. Hospital costs and charges appropriately reflect the high technically difficulty and resource utilization of extended attempts at endovascular therapy. For practitioners, crossing lesions during PPI is truly a ""pay-for-performance"" procedure in that only successful procedures are reasonably reimbursed.","El Khoury, Rym; Cataneo, Jose L; Paredes, Juan A; Schwartz, Alexander M; Jacobs, Chad E; White, John V; Schwartz, Lewis B",Annals of vascular surgery,170,16

Therefore, measures to ensure that medical waste is managed safely and in an environmentally sound manner will avoid negative health and environmental effects from such waste, thus protecting the health of patients, health workers and the public in general. Despite that infectious medical waste generation rate is important for management planning and policy development, there is a limitation on national data availability and its accuracy, particularly in developing economies. This study analyses the infectious healthcare waste generation rates and management patterns in Lebanon before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study illuminates on the impact of COVID-19 on the existing challenges of waste management in Lebanon. It highlights the need for proper management and disposal of the amounts of medical waste generated to reduce contamination risks or related environmental threats, particularly during the pandemic. It also shows that Lebanon has a defective system for monitoring of waste from healthcare institutions and gaps in waste statistics.

As a result, a sharp increase in prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia against different groups of people was observed in different geographical locations. This chapter presents the psychological and social sources of stereotypes and prejudices that take forms in the COVID-19 pandemic. These sources can be located in psychosocial processes, such as (i) socially generated and reinforced fears; (ii) human responses to stress induced by certain types of stimuli; (iii) sense of helplessness based on the lack of control over reality; (iv) psychological responses reinforced by conformism (crowd psychology); and (v) the stigmatization process. The chapter also presents the main groups of increased risk of experiencing prejudice and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Asians, health-care workers, COVID-19 patients, and their relatives). Moreover, it provides a documented example of such behaviors. The groups at higher risk of more adverse effects of COVID-19 due to pre-pandemic discrimination are also discussed. Finally, initiatives taken to mitigate the discrimination associated with COVID-19 are presented, as well as the recommendations and good practices for preventing these behaviors during future outbreaks and for limiting discrimination against COVID-19 until the disease can be contained.","Rzymski, Piotr; Mamzer, Hanna; Nowicki, Michał",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,170,16

Few large prospective trials have examined the proximal sides of vessels not ligated in addition to sealing during surgery. We therefore assessed feasibility of an energy device to seal pulmonary artery and vein branches without further ligation. METHODS This prospective, preoperative registration study at 2 institutions evaluated safety of energy sealing with the LigaSure (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), with no additional reinforcing material such as suture ligation, for pulmonary vessels as large as 7 mm during anatomic lung resection (cohort 1 study). A postoperative hemorrhage occurred in the 128th case, so a cohort 2 study proceeded after we changed inclusion criterion for pulmonary arteries from a maximum of 7 mm to a maximum of 5 mm. RESULTS In cohort 1 (n = 128) and cohort 2 (n = 200), 216 and 250 pulmonary arteries and 189 and 213 pulmonary veins, respectively, were treated with energy sealing. Overall postoperative hemorrhage rate was 0.3% (1/328 patients); however, no serious postoperative complications were associated with energy sealing among the 200 patients in cohort 2. Subsequent inspection of the torn artery stump confirmed that the bleeding in the 128th case was in an area adjacent to the sealing zone. CONCLUSIONS Energy sealing without reinforcement allows secure treatment during lung resection of pulmonary arteries as large as 5 mm in diameter and pulmonary veins as large as 7 mm.","Okada, Morihito; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Takamochi, Kazuya; Tsutani, Yasuhiro; Oh, Shiaki; Suzuki, Kenji",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,170,1

We sought to determine the effect of baseline CT and angiography on outcomes in the Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) trial and to identify patients who would benefit from endovascular stroke therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The primary end point was a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. Subgroup and classification and regression tree analysis was performed on baseline ASPECTS, site of occlusion, clot length, collateral status, and onset-to-treatment time. RESULTS Smaller baseline infarct (n = 145) (ASPECTS 8-10) was associated with better outcomes in patients treated with thrombectomy versus IV tPA alone (66% versus 41%; rate ratio, 1.62) compared with patients with larger baseline infarcts (n = 44) (ASPECTS 6-7) (42% versus 21%; rate ratio, 1.98). The benefit of thrombectomy over IV tPA alone did not differ significantly by ASPECTS. Stratification by occlusion location also showed benefit with thrombectomy across all groups. Improved outcomes after thrombectomy occurred in patients with clot lengths of ≥8 mm (71% versus 43%; rate ratio, 1.67). Outcomes stratified by collateral status had a benefit with thrombectomy across all groups: none-fair collaterals (33% versus 0%), good collaterals (58% versus 44%), and excellent collaterals (82% versus 28%). Using a 3-level classification and regression tree analysis, we observed optimal outcomes in patients with favorable baseline ASPECTS, complete/near-complete recanalization (TICI 2b/3), and early treatment (mean mRS, 1.35 versus 3.73), while univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed significantly better results in patients with higher ASPECTS. CONCLUSIONS While benefit was seen with endovascular therapy across multiple subgroups, the greatest response was observed in patients with a small baseline core infarct, excellent collaterals, and early treatment.","Jadhav, A P; Diener, H-C; Bonafe, A; Pereira, V M; Levy, E I; Baxter, B W; Jovin, T G; Nogueira, R G; Yavagal, D R; Cognard, C; Purcell, D D; Menon, B K; Jahan, R; Saver, J L; Goyal, M",AJNR.

There is significant variation in weight change after bariatric surgery and much interest in identifying preoperative factors that may contribute to these differences. This report evaluates the associations of a comprehensive set of baseline factors and 3-year weight change. SETTING Ten hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers in the United States. METHODS Adults undergoing a first bariatric surgical procedure as part of clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009. Participants completed research assessments utilizing standardized and detailed data collection on over 100 preoperative and operative parameters for individuals undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Weight was measured 3 years after surgery. Percent weight change for RYGB or LAGB from baseline to 3 years was analyzed as both a continuous and dichotomous outcome with cut points at 25% for RYGB and 10% for LAGB. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to identify independent baseline predictors of the continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. RESULTS The median weight loss 3 years after surgery for RYGB (n = 1513) participants was 31.5% (IQR: 24.6%-38.4%; range, 59.2% loss to .9% gain) of baseline weight and 16.0% (IQR: 8.1%-23.1%; range, 56.1% loss to 12.5% gain) for LAGB (n = 509) participants. The median age was 46 years for RYGB and 48 years for LAGB; 80% of RYGB participants and 75% of LAGB participants were female; and the median baseline body mass index (BMI) was 46 kg/m(2) for RYGB and 44 kg/m(2) for LAGB. For RYGB, black participants lost 2.7% less weight compared with whites and participants with diabetes at baseline had 3.7% less weight loss at year 3 than those without diabetes at baseline. There were small but statistically significant differences in weight change for RYGB in those with abnormal kidney function and current or recent smoking. For LAGB participants, those with a large band circumference had 75% greater odds of experiencing less than 10% weight loss after adjusting for BMI and sex. CONCLUSIONS Few baseline variables were associated with 3-year weight change and the effects were small. These results indicate that baseline variables have limited predictive value for an individual's chance of a successful weight loss outcome after bariatric surgery.

The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may cause local citrullination of proteins, potentially triggering anti-citrullinated protein antibody production. However, it is not known if oral dysbiosis precedes the onset of clinical arthritis. This study comprehensively characterised the oral microbiome in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive at-risk individuals without clinical synovitis (CCP+at risk). METHODS Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy and diseased sites in 48 CCP+at risk, 26 early RA and 32 asymptomatic healthy control (HC) individuals. DNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. Taxonomic profile and functional capability of the subgingival microbiome were compared between groups. RESULTS At periodontally healthy sites, CCP+at risk individuals had significantly lower microbial richness compared with HC and early RA groups (p=0.004 and 0.021). Microbial community alterations were found at phylum, genus and species levels. A large proportion of the community differed significantly in membership (523 species; 35.6%) and structure (575 species; 39.1%) comparing CCP+at risk and HC groups. Certain core species, including P. gingivalis, had higher relative abundance in the CCP+at risk group. Seventeen clusters of orthologous gene functional units were significantly over-represented in the CCP+at risk group compared with HC (adjusted p value <0.05). CONCLUSION Anti-CCP positive at-risk individuals have dysbiotic subgingival microbiomes and increased abundance of P. gingivalis compared with controls. This supports the hypothesis that the oral microbiome and specifically P. gingivalis are important in RA initiation.","Cheng, Zijian; Do, Thuy; Mankia, Kulveer; Meade, Josephine; Hunt, Laura; Clerehugh, Val; Speirs, Alastair; Tugnait, Aradhna; Emery, Paul; Devine, Deirdre",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,170,1

Here we report that suramin, a 100-year-old drug, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and acts by blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for treatment of COVID-19. The 2.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites. One site directly blocks the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clashes with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic site, thus inhibiting RdRp activity. Suramin blocks viral replication in Vero E6 cells, although the reasons underlying this effect are likely various. Our results provide a structural mechanism for a nonnucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.","Yin, Wanchao; Luan, Xiaodong; Li, Zhihai; Zhou, Ziwei; Wang, Qingxing; Gao, Minqi; Wang, Xiaoxi; Zhou, Fulai; Shi, Jingjing; You, Erli; Liu, Mingliang; Wang, Qingxia; Jiang, Yi; Jiang, Hualiang; Xiao, Gengfu; Zhang, Leike; Yu, Xuekui; Zhang, Shuyang; Eric Xu, H",Nature structural & molecular biology,170,1

Purpose: The aims of present review were to determine whether the biologic treatment of psoriasis increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and if biologics affect the clinical course of COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: We searched database of MEDLINE (PubMed) for key term of psoriasis biologic and COVID-19 until June 9, 2020 and all published 14 papers and an experience from Iran (10509 cases) related to the psoriatic patients on biologics and COVID-19 along with relevant papers were summarized. In spite of limitation in some reports, due to some of strengths that will be discussed, all papers were included in this review. Results: According to 8769 medical reports around 0.3% of psoriatic patients had COVID-19 and the rate of hospitalization was 0.1%. No death due to COVID-19 was reported among 10509 patients. Reports indicated psoriatic patients on biologics were not more susceptible to COVID-19 and the severe clinical course of disease. Conclusion: While there is not definitive controlled trial data, the available evidence suggests that patients with psoriasis without COVID-19 can continue the biologic therapy for psoriasis.","Ebrahimi, Ali; Sayad, Babak; Rahimi, Zohreh",The Journal of dermatological treatment,170,23

These ligands were designed to provide a pH-dependent relaxivity response upon complexation with Mn2+ in aqueous solution. The protonation constants of the ligands and the stability constants of the Mn2+ complexes were determined using potentiometric titrations complemented by spectrophotometric experiments. The deprotonations of the sulfonamide groups of the ligands are characterized by protonation constants of log KiH = 10.36 and 10.59 for DPASAm3- and HNO2ASAm2-, respectively. These values decrease dramatically to log KiH = 6.43 and 5.42 in the presence of Mn2+, because of the coordination of the negatively charged sulfonamide groups to the metal ion. The higher log KiH value in [Mn(DPASAm)]- is related to the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, while the metal ion in [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- is six-coordinated. The X-ray crystal structure of Na[Mn(DPASAm)(H2O)]·2H2O confirms the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, where the coordination environment is fulfilled by the donor atoms of the two picolinate groups, the amine N atom, the N atom of the sulfonamide group, and a coordinated water molecule. The lower conditional stability of the [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- complex and the lower protonation constant of the sulfonamide group results in complex dissociation at relatively high pH (<7.0). However, protonation of the sulfonamide group in [Mn(DPASAm)]- falls into the physiologically relevant pH window and causes a significant increase in relaxivity from r1p = 3.8 mM-1 s-1 at pH 9.0 to r1p = 8.9 mM-1 s-1 at pH 4.0 (10 MHz, 25 °C).","Uzal-Varela, Rocío; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Aurora; Martínez-Calvo, Miguel; Carniato, Fabio; Lalli, Daniela; Esteban-Gómez, David; Brandariz, Isabel; Pérez-Lourido, Paulo; Botta, Mauro; Platas-Iglesias, Carlos",Inorganic chemistry,170,1

Despite the fact that the laparoscopic approach has become the gold standard for many colorectal procedures, it has never been extensively investigated in SFC due to lack of an agreed consensus on the appropriate operative procedure. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study is to evaluate the oncologic value of laparoscopic segmental resection with complete mesocolic excision (CME) for cancer located in the splenic flexure. METHODS All data of consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic resection with CME for SFC from January 2005 to December 2017 at five different tertiary centers were retrospectively analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) test was used to assess the overall survival (OS) and the disease-free survival (DFS) rates after surgery. Univariate Cox regression was used to explore the association between OS and other independent factors. RESULTS Recurrence was observed in 13 (11.6%) patients and a significant association between disease stage and recurrence (P < 0.001) was found with a higher proportion of stage IV patients in the recurrence group (46.1% vs. 7.1%). During a median follow-up of 43 months (range 12-149), 13 deaths occurred, all of them due to disease progression. KM curves for all stages showed an estimated survival rate of 51% at 148 months. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic segmental resection with CME appears to be an oncologically safe and effective procedure for treatment of SFC and may be considered as a standard surgical method for elective management of the disease. In the future, routine lymph node mapping could be used to confirm this hypothesis.","Bracale, Umberto; Merola, Giovanni; Pignata, Giusto; Corcione, Francesco; Pirozzi, Felice; Cuccurullo, Diego; De Palma, Giovanni Domenico; Cassinotti, Elisa; Sciuto, Antonio; Boni, Luigi",Surgical endoscopy,170,5

For the severe variant, PI*Z, the correlation coefficient (CC) was 0.8584 for the number of patients and 0.8713 for the number of deaths. For the milder variant, PI*S, it was 0.5818 and 0.6326, respectively. In Japan, the number of patients and deaths correlated with the population size with a CC of 0.6667 and 0.7074 respectively, and was proportional to the population size to the power of 1.65 and 1.54. The prevalence of AAT deficiency also correlated with the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19. In countries with high prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the initial rise, the daily number of patients and that of deaths ran parallel at a high level for more than 6 months without sign of abatement. In countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, after the first wave of the epidemic, the number of the deaths decreased continuously while the number of patients remained the same or even increased resulting in a decreasing case-fatality rate. When the cumulative number of deaths was plotted on the y-axis against the cumulative number of patients on the x-axis, plots fell on a straight line in countries with a high prevalence of AAT deficiency; while in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency, a break appeared, after which the plots fell on flatter slope indicating decreasing case-fatality rate. The observation suggests emergence of an attenuated variant in countries with a low prevalence of AAT deficiency.","Yoshikura, Hiroshi",Global health & medicine,170,1

METHODS A randomized controlled noninferiority trial was performed at a single academic institution. Women undergoing planned cesarean delivery who desired sterilization were randomized to salpingectomy or standard tubal ligation. The primary outcome was length of time of the sterilization procedure, with the noninferiority margin set at 5 minutes. With a one-sided independent sample t test, to achieve a power of 90% with an α of 0.05, 18 women needed to complete each intervention. RESULTS Forty-four women were enrolled, with 19 successfully undergoing salpingectomy and 18 undergoing standard tubal ligation. Salpingectomy could not be completed in 1 of 20 patients (as a result of adhesions). Baseline demographics were equivalent between groups. Salpingectomy procedure time was noninferior to standard tubal ligation, with a mean difference of 0.5 minutes, with a mean sterilization procedure time of 5.6 minutes in the salpingectomy group and 6.1 minutes in the standard tubal ligation group (P <.05, one-sided 95% CI upper bound 1.8 minutes). There was no difference between cesarean delivery with salpingectomy compared with cesarean delivery with standard tubal ligation in median total operating time (60 vs 68 minutes, P=.34) or estimated blood loss (600 vs 700 mL, P=.09). No patients in either group required reoperation or readmission. CONCLUSION Salpingectomy procedure time was not longer than standard tubal ligation during cesarean delivery, with a mean difference of 30 seconds. There was a high completion rate for salpingectomy (95%) and no apparent increase in complications.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) achieved response rates around 20% in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 8% of patients becoming long-term survivors. Outcomes have improved with the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy or the combination of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Areas covered. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs varied across clinical trials and real-life studies. The onset of irAEs was 10 weeks. Toxic deaths from irAEs following anti-PD(L)1 administration resulted mainly from pneumonitis. Some irAEs such as rash and thyroiditis were probably associated with better clinical outcomes, though confounding biases exist. Investigations are on-going to determine ideal biomarkers to predict the occurrence, to screen for and to diagnose irAEs. Expert opinion. Prevention, anticipation, detection, treatment and careful monitoring are the five principles that characterize our management of irAEs. Distinguishing immune-induced pneumonitis from progression, pseudo progression, hyper progression or other etiologies (COVID-19) can be particularly challenging in lung cancer due to the baseline vulnerable pulmonary function and thus requires caution and teamwork. We treat patients according to institutional and international guidelines and we only rechallenge them with ICIs after resolution of the AE and corticosteroid tapering.","Abdayem, Pamela; Planchard, David",Expert opinion on drug safety,170,12

We now report the final overall survival (OS) and subgroup analysis according to the pathological stage (TNM 7th edition) for treatment efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients who underwent curative resection for pathologically confirmed high-risk stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive either UFT/LV (300 mg/m2 of UFT and 75 mg/day of LV on days 1-28, every 35 days, five cycles) or SOX (100 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin on day 1 and 80 mg/m2/day of S-1 on days 1-14, every 21 days, eight cycles). The primary endpoint was DFS and the patients' data were updated in February 2020. RESULTS A total of 478 patients in the UFT/LV group and 477 patients in the SOX group were included in the final analysis. With a median follow-up time of 74.3 months, the 5-year DFS rate was 55.2% in the UFT/LV group and 58.1% in the SOX group [stratified hazard ratio (HR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.11; P = 0.3973], and the 5-year OS rates were 78.3% and 79.1%, respectively (stratified HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76-1.24; P = 0.8175).

OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of increasing perioperative blood flow using fluids with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs. Outcomes were mortality, morbidity, resource utilization and health status. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012) and EMBASE (1982 to March 2012). We manually searched the proceedings of major conferences and personal reference databases up to December 2011. We contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for published and unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials with or without blinding. We included studies involving adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery (patients having a procedure in an operating room). The intervention met the following criteria. 'Perioperative' was defined as starting up to 24 hours before surgery and stopping up to six hours after surgery. 'Targeted to increase global blood flow' was defined by explicit measured goals that were greater than in controls, specifically one or more of cardiac index, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, stroke volume (and the respective derived indices), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)), oxygen extraction ratio (0(2)ER) or lactate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data. We contacted study authors for additional data. We used Review Manager software. MAIN RESULTS We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.05, P = 0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and the intervention was better than control when inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models were used, RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The results were also sensitive to withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The rates of three morbidities were reduced by increasing global blood flow: renal failure, RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.90); respiratory failure, RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.93); and wound infections, RR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84). There were no differences in the rates of nine other morbidities: arrhythmia, pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary oedema, or venous thrombosis. The number of patients with complications was reduced by the intervention, RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80). Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by a mean of 1.16 days (95% CI 0.43 to 1.89, P = 0.002). There was no difference in critical care length of stay. There were insufficient data to comment on quality of life and cost effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It remains uncertain whether increasing blood flow using fluids, with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs, reduces mortality in adults undergoing surgery. The primary analysis in this review (mortality at longest follow-up) showed no difference between the intervention and control, but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, the withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and is dominated by a single large RCT. Overall, for every 100 patients in whom blood flow is increased perioperatively to defined goals, one can expect 13 in 100 patients (from 40/100 to 27/100) to avoid a complication, 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8/100 to 6/100), 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10/100 to 5/100), and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10/100 to 6/100). On average, patients receiving the intervention stay in hospital one day less. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.","Grocott, Michael P W; Dushianthan, Ahilanandan; Hamilton, Mark A; Mythen, Michael G; Harrison, David; Rowan, Kathy",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,170,6

The RBC lifespan values obtained by Levitt's CO breath test were lower than those obtained by the 15 N-glycine labeling technique. The RBC lifespan values determined from the 15 N-glycine labeling technique and the CO breath test were significantly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of R=0.98 (p<0.05), while the R2 of the linear regression equation was 0.96.

More than 80% of UK adult intensive care units have subsequently changed practice. Undetected oesophageal intubation has recently been listed as a 'Never Event' in UK practice, with capnography mandated. We investigated whether the NAP4 recommendations have been embedded into paediatric and neonatal intensive care practice by conducting a telephone survey of senior medical or nursing staff in UK paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Response rates were 100% for paediatric intensive care units and 90% for neonatal intensive care units. A difficult airway policy existed in 67% of paediatric intensive care units and in 40% of neonatal intensive care units; a pre-intubation checklist was used in 70% of paediatric intensive care units and in 42% of neonatal intensive care units; a difficult intubation trolley was present in 96% of paediatric intensive care units and in 50% of neonatal intensive care units; a videolaryngoscope was available in 55% of paediatric intensive care units and in 29% of neonatal intensive care units; capnography was 'available' in 100% of paediatric intensive care units and in 46% of neonatal intensive care units, and 'always available' in 100% of paediatric intensive care units and in 18% of neonatal intensive care units. Death or serious harm occurring secondary to complications of airway management in the last 5 years was reported in 19% of paediatric intensive care units and in 26% of neonatal intensive care units. We conclude that major gaps in optimal airway management provision exist in UK paediatric intensive care units and especially in UK neonatal intensive care units. Wider implementation of waveform capnography is necessary to ensure compliance with the new 'Never Event' and has the potential to improve airway management.","Foy, K E; Mew, E; Cook, T M; Bower, J; Knight, P; Dean, S; Herneman, K; Marden, B; Kelly, F E",Anaesthesia,170,14

STUDY DESIGN s a nested study in a prospective observational study, we acquired continuous data on heart rate, SPO2, CrSO2 and CFOE. Data averaged for the duration of TnEcho study were compared with the data collected during a baseline period immediately before the start of echocardiography. The duration of the baseline and study periods was the same. TnEcho evaluation included assessment of preload, afterload, contractility, left and right ventricular output, patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. RESULT We analyzed 138 data pairs before and during TnEcho in 22 extremely preterm infants (gestational age 25.9 ± 1.2 weeks; range 23 to 27). There was no significant difference in heart rate between baseline and TnEcho period. There was a statistical, but clinically negligible, difference between baseline and TnEcho in SPO2 (median (quartile) 91.4% (88.9, 94.2) vs 91.3% (88.9, 94), P = 0.048), CrSO2 (76.8% (70.7, 81.5) vs 74.9% (69.5, 80.1), P<0.0001) and CFOE (15.8% (9.8, 23.6) vs 17.5% (11.3, 24.7), P<0.0001). The changes in the parameters monitored were similar in preterm infants who developed peri/intraventricular hemorrhage and in those who did not. CONCLUSION Although there were statistically significant changes in SPO2, CrSO2 and CFOE, the alterations were minimal and unlikely of clinical relevance. Thus, cerebral hemodynamics and systemic and cerebral oxygenation are not perturbed during TnEcho and the procedure is well tolerated by the extremely preterm infants during the postnatal transitional period.","Noori, S; Seri, I",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,170,1

Lentivirus-mediated miR-210 overexpression enhanced the microvessel density and the number of neural progenitor cells in the ischemic mouse brain (P < 0.05) and improved neurobehavioral outcomes in the ischemic mouse (P < 0.05). MiR-210 upregulation increased mBDNF/proBDNF protein expression in the normal and ischemic mouse brain. The dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that BDNF was the direct target of miR-210. CONCLUSION MiR-210 is a crucial ischemic stroke-associated MicroRNAs and a potential target for the stroke therapy.","Zeng, Li-Li; He, Xiao-Song; Liu, Jian-Rong; Zheng, Chao-Bo; Wang, Yong-Ting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,170,7

We focused on a new, recently reported method of esophageal elongation using botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and evaluated the efficacy of BTX-A injection around esophageal anastomoses with tension in a rabbit model. METHODS Twenty rabbits aged 8-10 weeks and weighing 1.27-1.72 kg underwent resections of the esophagus measuring 1.5 cm long using an anterior cervical approach. Esophagoesophagostomies were performed after intramural administration of Xeomin™ (3 U/body) in the BTX-A group and saline in the control group. Morphological and histological evaluations were examined on postoperative day 14. RESULTS Six rabbits in each group survived. The BTX-A group showed significantly less postoperative anastomotic stricture and less fibrosis than the control group. Changes in wall thickness on both sides of the anastomotic areas were equivalent between the two groups, and no muscle fracturing was observed. CONCLUSION Local administration of BTX-A for esophagoesophagostomy significantly reduced postoperative anastomotic stricture with less fibrosis than that observed in the control group. Reduced anastomotic tension with BTX-A presumably contributed to better anastomotic healing. Determining the optimum dose of BTX-A is necessary for clinical application.","Usui, Yoshiko; Ono, Shigeru",Pediatric surgery international,170,1

The purpose of this study was to standardize preanalytical conditions for measurement of serum levels of fibrinogen alpha C-chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC 5.9) and to test the diagnostic value of this peptide for detection of early hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic hepatitis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Serum FIC 5.9 levels were measured by a sandwich ELISA. Effects on the serum FIC 5.9 level of temperature, the time between venipuncture and serum separation, and the types of collection tubes used were examined. The diagnostic value of serum FIC 5.9 as an early indicator of hepatic fibrosis due to HCV was then assessed. RESULTS FIC 5.9 was produced in a time- and temperature-dependent manner after venipuncture. Abnormal FIC 5.9 values were found in 89.5% of FI stage patients. Receiver operating characteristic analyses confirmed the superiority of FIC 5.9 over other conventional markers for early detection of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The serum FIC 5.9 level may be an early indicator of hepatic fibrosis in HCV-related chronic liver diseases. This study provides an example of a pipeline from biomarker discovery by proteome analysis to assay optimization and preliminary clinical validation.","Sogawa, Kazuyuki; Noda, Kenta; Umemura, Hiroshi; Seimiya, Masanori; Kuga, Takahisa; Tomonaga, Takeshi; Nishimura, Motoi; Kanai, Fumihiko; Imazeki, Fumio; Takizawa, Hirotaka; Yoneda, Masato; Nakajima, Atsushi; Tsutsumi, Mikihiro; Yokosuka, Osamu; Nomura, Fumio",Proteomics.

Genetics is an important factor leading to schizophrenia, but its exact role is still unclear. Many studies have focused on neurotransmitters and regulators that participate in the processes mediated by these neurotransmitters. Alcohol dehydrogenase may not only catalyze the oxidation of retinol and ethanol but also be involved in a variety of neurotransmitter metabolic pathways. Therefore, our study investigated whether ADH7 gene variations in the Chinese Han population were associated with schizophrenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from a cohort of 275 schizophrenic patients (136 men and 139 women) and 313 healthy controls (160 men and 153 women) from the Northern Han Chinese population. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium analysis were performed. Differences in genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using the chi-square test and correlation analysis. The distribution of the CC + TT genotype of rs284787 was statistically different between the case and control groups (p = 0.026, OR = 1.448); however, the difference disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Linkage analysis indicated that rs739147, rs284787, rs3805329, rs894369, rs3805331, and rs284786 were closely linked in one block. The haplotype analysis found no association between the composed haplotypes and the occurrence of schizophrenia. Our study showed that the ADH7 gene was not associated with the risk of schizophrenia. Additional studies with larger cohorts of different ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.","Zeng, Kuo; Li, Ya; Gao, Meng; Liu, Yong-Ping; Xu, Feng-Ling; Xia, Xi; Yao, Jun; Wang, Bao-Jie",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,170,16

Phylogenetically, noroviruses are divided into seven genogroups, with each divided into multiple genotypes. NoVs belonging to genogroup II and genotype 4 (GII.4) are globally most prevalent. Genetic diversity among the NoVs and the periodic emergence of novel strains present a challenge for the development of vaccines and antivirals to treat NoV infection. NoV protease is essential for viral replication and is an attractive target for the development of antivirals. The available structure of GI.1 protease provided a basis for the design of inhibitors targeting the active site of the protease. These inhibitors, although potent against the GI proteases, poorly inhibit the GII proteases, for which structural information is lacking. To elucidate the structural basis for this difference in the inhibitor efficiency, we determined the crystal structure of a GII.4 protease. The structure revealed significant changes in the S2 substrate-binding pocket, making it noticeably smaller, and in the active site, with the catalytic triad residues showing conformational changes. Furthermore, a conserved arginine is found inserted into the active site, interacting with the catalytic histidine and restricting substrate/inhibitor access to the S2 pocket. This interaction alters the relationships between the catalytic residues and may allow for a pH-dependent regulation of protease activity. The changes we observed in the GII.4 protease structure may explain the reduced potency of the GI-specific inhibitors against the GII protease and therefore must be taken into account when designing broadly cross-reactive antivirals against NoVs.IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (NoVs) cause sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. They are divided into seven genogroups (GI to GVII), with each genogroup further divided into several genotypes. Human NoVs belonging to genogroup II and genotype 4 (GII.4) are the most prevalent. Currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for NoV infection. The protease encoded by NoV is considered a valuable target because of its essential role in replication. NoV protease structures have only been determined for the GI genogroup. We show here that the structure of the GII.4 protease exhibits several significant changes from GI proteases, including a unique pairing of an arginine with the catalytic histidine that makes the proteolytic activity of GII.4 protease pH sensitive. A comparative analysis of NoV protease structures may provide a rational framework for structure-based drug design of broadly cross-reactive inhibitors targeting NoVs.","Viskovska, Mariya A; Zhao, Boyang; Shanker, Sreejesh; Choi, Jae-Mun; Deng, Lisheng; Song, Yongchen; Palzkill, Timothy; Hu, Liya; Estes, Mary K; Venkataram Prasad, B V",Journal of virology,170,16

Methods PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for evaluations of depression interventions in LMICs reporting at least one implementation outcome published through March 2019. Results A total of 8714 studies were screened, 759 were assessed for eligibility, and 79 studies met inclusion criteria. Common implementation outcomes reported were acceptability (n = 50; 63.3%), feasibility (n = 28; 35.4%), and fidelity (n = 18; 22.8%). Only four studies (5.1%) reported adoption or penetration, and three (3.8%) reported sustainability. The Sub-Saharan Africa region (n = 29; 36.7%) had the most studies. The majority of studies (n = 59; 74.7%) reported outcomes for a depression intervention implemented in pilot researcher-controlled settings. Studies commonly focused on Hybrid Type-1 effectiveness-implementation designs (n = 53; 67.1), followed by Hybrid Type-3 (n = 16; 20.3%). Only 21 studies (26.6%) tested an implementation strategy, with the most common being revising professional roles (n = 10; 47.6%). The most common intervention modality was individual psychotherapy (n = 30; 38.0%). Common study designs were mixed methods (n = 27; 34.2%), quasi-experimental uncontrolled pre-post (n = 17; 21.5%), and individual randomized trials (n = 16; 20.3). Conclusions Existing research has focused on early-stage implementation outcomes. Most studies have utilized Hybrid Type-1 designs, with the primary aim to test intervention effectiveness delivered in researcher-controlled settings. Future research should focus on testing and optimizing implementation strategies to promote scale-up of evidence-based depression interventions in routine care. These studies should use high-quality pragmatic designs and focus on later-stage implementation outcomes such as cost, penetration, and sustainability.","Wagenaar, Bradley H; Hammett, Wilson H; Jackson, Courtney; Atkins, Dana L; Belus, Jennifer M; Kemp, Christopher G",Global mental health,170,16

It has been suggested that correction of a high grade internal rectal prolapse (HIRP) is also worthwhile for patients with faecal incontinence. The aim of the present study is to compare the results of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) in patients with faecal incontinence associated with either an ERP or a HIRP. METHOD Consecutive patients suffering from faecal incontinence, who underwent a LVR between June 2010 and October 2012, were identified from a prospective database. All patients underwent preoperative defaecating proctography, anorectal manometry and ultrasound. Symptoms were assessed preoperatively and at 1 year after operation using a standardized questionnaire incorporating the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI; range 0-61) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). RESULTS LVR was performed in 50 incontinent patients with a HIRP, and in 41 patients with an ERP. Preoperatively, the FISI was higher in patients with HIRP (HIRP 42 versus ERP 30, P < 0.01). The recurrence rate at 1 year was similar in both groups (HIRP 6 % versus ERP 2 %, P = 0.156). The FISI scores were significantly reduced in both groups (HIRP 48 % versus ERP 50 %, both P < 0.01). GIQLI was equally improved in both groups (HIRP 17 % versus ERP 18 %, both P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for the treatment of faecal incontinence achieves equivalent outcomes in both patients with an external rectal prolapse or high grade internal rectal prolapse.","Gosselink, M P; Joshi, H; Adusumilli, S; van Onkelen, R S; Fourie, S; Hompes, R; Jones, O M; Cunningham, C; Lindsey, I",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,170,5

Maternal birthing position may influence pelvic capacity because upright positions optimize capacity, possibly due to free movement of the pelvic joints. Herein, pelvic capacity was assessed by comparing changes in pelvic dimensions across pregnancy and during three birthing positions. MATERIAL AND METHODS This diagnostic imaging study of 50 pregnant women was conducted at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Pelvic measurements were obtained with 1.5 T magnetic resonance pelvimetry during gestational weeks 20 and 32, in three birthing positions: kneeling squat, semi-lithotomy and supine. Pelvic capacity was compared between gestational weeks and positions. RESULTS There is an overall increase in pelvic capacity from gestational week 20 to 32 at both the pelvic inlet and outlet, in all three positions. Comparing pelvic capacity at gestational week 32 between the semi-lithotomy and supine positions revealed that the pelvic inlet was larger in the supine position, whereas the mean pelvic outlet was 0.2 cm (P < 0.001) larger in the semi-lithotomy position. Likewise, the pelvic inlet was larger in the supine compared with the kneeling squat position. Shifting from supine to kneeling squat position increased the midplane and pelvic outlet dimensions by up to one cm (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The finding herein of an increased pelvic capacity as the pregnancy progresses is novel. Further, the results indicate that the supine position is optimal for increasing pelvic inlet size, while the semi-lithotomy and kneeling squat positions are optimal for increasing mid- and outlet-pelvic capacities.","Kjeldsen, Louise L; Blankholm, Anne Dorte; Jurik, Anne Grethe; Salvig, Jannie D; Maimburg, Rikke D",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,170,20

The analysis of variance results showed that the selected quadratic model with interaction (R2 = 0.9802) was statistically significant. The experimental results showed that the degradation quantity of methylene blue increased when the ts value increased and T decreased. We have evaluated the photocatalytic activity of this supported catalyst (TiO2-GP) with a laboratory reactor under natural condition; the maximum removal (96.03%) was obtained at ts = 331 min, T = 559 °C and (TiO2) = 2.38 g/l. The method of desirability function was used to obtain the best combination of factor settings for achieving the maximum of degradation quantity ((TiO2) = 2.6 (g/l), T = 600 (°C) and ts = 240 (min)).

A national decline in procedures performed by hospitalists has prompted questions about their procedural competency. Additionally, though simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) has been shown to be effective among trainees whether this approach has enduring benefits for independent practitioners who already have experience is unknown. We aimed to assess the baseline procedural skill of hospitalists already credentialed to perform procedures. We hypothesised that simulation-based training of hospitalists would result in durable skill gains after several months. DESIGN Prospective cohort study with pretraining and post-training measurements. SETTING Single, large, urban academic medical centre in the USA. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-two out of 38 eligible participants defined as hospitalists working on teaching services where they would supervise trainees performing procedures. INTERVENTIONS One-on-one, 60 min SBML of lumbar puncture (LP) and abdominal paracentesis (AP). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Our primary outcome was the percentage of hospitalists obtaining minimum passing scores (MPS) on LP and AP checklists; our secondary outcomes were average checklist scores and self-reported confidence. RESULTS At baseline, only 16% hospitalists met or exceeded the MPS for LP and 32% for AP. Immediately after SBML, 100% of hospitalists reached this threshold. Reassessment an average of 7 months later revealed that only 40% of hospitalists achieved the MPS. Confidence increased initially after training but declined over time. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalists may be performing invasive bedside procedures without demonstration of adequate skill. A single evidence-based training intervention was insufficient to sustain skills for the majority of hospitalists over a short period of time. More stringent practices for certifying hospitalists who perform risky procedures are warranted, as well as mechanisms to support skill maintenance, such as periodic simulation-based training and assessment.","Hale, Caleb; Crocker, Jonathan; Vanka, Anita; Ricotta, Daniel N; McSparron, Jakob I; Huang, Grace C",BMJ open,170,16

Understanding the extent to which these relationships are causal is important both to inform investments in education and health, as well as to understand the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for a causal link between education and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in low and middle-income countries. Education indicators included exposure to formal schooling and learning. SRH outcomes included: age at first sex, age at first marriage, age at first pregnancy/birth, contraceptive use, fertility, and HIV status and other sexually transmitted infections. When possible, we also conducted meta-analyses to estimate mean effects by outcome, and to understand sources of variation between studies. Results We identified 35 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Although many of the studies report evidence of a causal relationship between education and one or more SRH outcomes, estimated effects are often small in magnitude. Our meta-analyses reveal mostly null mean effects, with the exception of small effects of increased grade attainment on lower fertility and HIV positive status. We also found inconsistent evidence supporting mechanisms linking education and SRH. Conclusions This review demonstrates that, although investments in schooling may have positive ripple effects for sexual and reproductive health in some circumstances, those effects may not be as large or consistent as expected. Further, our understanding of the circumstances in which schooling is most likely to improve SRH remains somewhat limited. An accurate picture of whether and when improvements in education lead to better health outcomes is essential for the achievement of global development goals.","Psaki, Stephanie R; Chuang, Erica K; Melnikas, Andrea J; Wilson, David B; Mensch, Barbara S",SSM - population health,170,1

METHODS The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost to COVID-19 were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost through death (YLL) and the number of years lived with disability (YLD), on the basis of laboratory-confirmed notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany in 2020 (documented as of 18 January 2021). The methodology was based on that used in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Pre-existing diseases do not enter into the determination of YLL; rather, the residual life expectancy that is applied in this calculation corresponds to a mean age-specific level of morbidity. RESULTS 305 641 years of life were lost to COVID-19 in Germany in 2020. The percentage of DALY lost by persons under 70 was 34.8% in men and 21.0% in women. 99.3% of the COVID-19 disease burden was accounted for by death (YLL). The daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for COVID-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. Persons who died of COVID-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. Men lost more years of life than women (11.0 vs. 8.1 years). CONCLUSION The effects of COVID-19 on public health can be expressed through the burden of disease indicators. This method yields additional information that should be put to use early in the course of future outbreaks.","Rommel, Alexander; Lippe, Elena von der; Plass, Dietrich; Ziese, Thomas; Diercke, Michaela; Heiden, Matthias An der; Haller, Sebastian; Wengler, Annelene",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,170,31

Home monitors were issued at implant and wound reviews were done remotely via photo messages at one month or if prompted by the patient. Existing patients were given monitors on an ad hoc basis. A dedicated physiologist worked off site on home monitoring clinics. We assess the impact on our service and on patient experience of these changes one year after implementation. Methods Baseline characteristics of age at implant and distance of home address from hospital were collected from all patients undergoing pacemaker home monitoring. Patients were surveyed using an adapted version of the Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire (GS-PEQ). Comparison was made with our standard face-to-face follow-up model (1, 3, and 12 months). Results Data was collected for 326 patients. 233 received a new permanent pacemaker from March 2020 onwards and 93 existing patients were issued with a home monitor. Average age at pacemaker implant was 80.6 year (± 9.9 years). The average one-way distance from home to outpatient clinic saved was 15.1 miles (±10.4). 567 face-to-face appointments were saved. In an average day the off-site physiologist reviewed over 100 patient records, contacted 10 patients by phone and dictated reports on 20 patients (14 clinic patients and 6 home monitor alerts).Of patients surveyed 88% agreed with the statement 'I feel safe being cared for solely with a remote monitoring service', 84% agreed with the statement 'I receive the same standard of care via remote monitoring and face-toface appointments'. Time saved by avoiding a face to face appointment was more than 1 hour for 90% of respondents. Those surveyed requested communication of reassuring monitoring, the ability to contact the pacing team in the event of concerns and clearer instructions for the home monitoring device. Only 34% of newly implanted patients were able to send a photo message of their wound at one month without prompting or assistance. We did not get a post procedure photo in 38% and the rest either spoke to us about the wound or had a face-to face visit. There was a significant difference in mean age between those who sent a photo (73.72) and those who didn't (81.38) (P = 0.000607). Conclusion Rapid role out of a remote monitoring service for permanent pacemakers across Somerset was feasible, produced significant savings in clinics and was well received by patients. There were significant time savings for physiologists and patients. However remote wound monitoring in elderly patients was problematic due to the difficulty sending photo messages.","Furniss, G.; Shurlock, J.; Dayer, M.; Heatley, R.; Wilson, L.; Gratton, B.; Roach, M.",Heart,170,1

Infectious cDNA clones of these viruses are necessary molecular tools to understand viral biology and to create effective vaccines. The traditional approach to rescuing virus from an infectious cDNA clone requires propagating large amounts of plasmids in bacteria, which can result in unwanted mutations in the viral genome due to bacterial toxicity or recombination and requires specialized equipment and knowledge to propagate the bacteria. Here, we present an alternative to the bacterial-based plasmid platform that uses rolling circle amplification (RCA), an in vitro technology that amplifies plasmid DNA using only basic equipment. We demonstrate that the use of RCA to amplify plasmid DNA is comparable to the use of a midiprepped plasmid in terms of viral yield, albeit with a slight delay in virus recovery kinetics. RCA, however, has lower cost and time requirements and amplifies DNA with high fidelity and with no chance of unwanted mutations due to toxicity. We show that sequential RCA reactions do not introduce mutations into the viral genome and, thus, can replace the need for glycerol stocks or bacteria entirely. These results indicate that RCA is a viable alternative to traditional plasmid-based approaches to viral rescue. Importance The development of infectious cDNA clones is critical to studying viral pathogenesis and for developing vaccines. The current method for propagating clones in bacteria is limited by the toxicity of the viral genome within the bacterial host, resulting in deleterious mutations in the viral genome, which can only be detected through whole-genome sequencing. These mutations can attenuate the virus, leading to lost time and resources and potentially confounding results. We have developed an alternative method of preparing large quantities of DNA that can be directly transfected to recover infectious virus without the need for bacteria by amplifying the infectious cDNA clone plasmid using rolling circle amplification (RCA). Our results indicate that viral rescue from an RCA product produces a viral yield equal to bacterial-derived plasmid DNA, albeit with a slight delay in replication kinetics. The RCA platform, however, is significantly more cost and time-efficient compared to traditional approaches. When the simplicity and costs of RCA are combined, we propose that a shift to an RCA platform will benefit the field of molecular virology and could have significant advantages for recombinant vaccine production.","Marano, Jeffrey M.; Chuong, Christina; Weger-Lucarelli, James",bioRxiv,170,15

The aim of this work was to identify if there had been a rise of childhood suicide during the COVID pandemic; using data from England's National Child Mortality Database (NCMD). Method: Child suicide rates between April to December 2020 were compared with those in 2019 using negative binomial regression models, and characteristics compared. In a subset (1st January to 17th May 2020) further characteristics and possible contributing factors were obtained. Results: A total of 193 likely childhood deaths by suicide were reported. There was no evidence overall suicide deaths were higher in 2020 than 2019 (RR 1.09 (0.80-1.48), p=0.584) but weak evidence that the rate in the first lockdown period (April to May 2020) was higher than the corresponding period in 2019 (RR 1.56 (0.86-2.81), p=0.144). Characteristics of individuals were similar between periods. Restriction to education and other activities, disruption to care and support services, tensions at home and isolation appeared to be contributing factors. Limitations: As child suicides are fortunately rare, the analysis is based on small numbers of deaths with limited statistical power to detect anything but major increases in incidence. Conclusion: We found no consistent evidence that child suicide deaths increased during the COVID-19 pandemic although there was a concerning signal they may have increased during the first UK lockdown. A similar peak was not seen during the following months, or the second lockdown.","Odd, D. E.; Williams, T.; Appleby, L.; Gunnell, D.; Luyt, K.",,170,16

We sought to describe the dynamics of respiratory involvement in children hospitalized with gastrointestinal (GI) diarrheal disease. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational longitudinal study of Malawian children 2-24 months hospitalized with diarrhea. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, induced sputum and stool specimens were collected. Participants that were positive by cryptosporidium PCR in any of the three compartments were followed up with fortnightly visits up to 8 weeks post-enrollment. Results: Of the 162 children recruited, participants had mild-moderate malnutrition, 36 (22%) were PCR-positive for cryptosporidium at enrollment (34 stool, 11 sputum, and 4 NP) and 27 completed the majority of follow-up visits (75%). Cryptosporidium was detected in all compartments over the 4 post-enrollment visits, most commonly in stool (94% at enrollment with mean cycle thresholds (Ct) of 28.8+/-4.3 to 44% at 8 weeks with Ct 29.9+/-4.1), followed by sputum (31% at enrollment with mean Ct 31.1+/-4.4 to 20% at 8 weeks with Ct 35.7+/-2.6), then NP (11% with mean Ct 33.5+/-1.0 to 8% with Ct 36.6+/-0.7). Participants with cryptosporidium detection in both the respiratory and GI tract over the study period reported respiratory and GI symptoms in 81% and 62% of study visits, respectively, compared to 68% and 27%, respectively, for those with only GI detection, and had longer GI shedding (17.5+/-6.6 v. 15.9+/-2.9 days). Conclusion: Cryptosporidium was detected in both respiratory and GI tracts throughout the 8 weeks post-enrollment.

Objectives: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical experiences, research opportunities, and well-being of rheumatology trainees. Methods: A voluntary, anonymous, web-based survey was administered in English, Spanish, or French from 19/08/2020 to 05/10/2020. Adult and paediatric rheumatology trainees worldwide in training in 2020 were invited to participate via social media and email. Using multiple choice questions, Likert scales, and free text answers, we assessed trainee patient care activities, redeployment, research, and well-being. Results: The 302 respondents were from 33 countries, with most (83%, 252/302) in adult rheumatology training. Many trainees (45%, 135/300) reported an increase in non-rheumatology clinical work (e.g. care of COVID-19 patients), with 52% of these (70/135) also continuing rheumatology clinical work. COVID-19 redeployment was not optional for 68% (91/134). Trainees reported a negative impact of the pandemic in their growth in rheumatology (Figure 1). They also reported a substantial impact on several training areas: outpatient clinics (79%, 238/302), inpatient consultations (59%, 177/302), formal teaching (55%, 167/302), procedures (53%, 147/302), teaching opportunities (52%, 157/302), and ultrasonography (36%, 110/302), with 87-96% perceiving a negative impact on these areas. Only 54% (159/294) reported feeling comfortable with their level of clinical supervision during the pandemic (Figure 1). Many trainees (46%, 128/280) reported changes in research experiences during the pandemic;39% (110/285) reported that COVID-19 negatively affected their ability to continue their pre-pandemic research and 50% (142/285) reported difficulty maintaining research goals (Figure 1). Some rheumatology trainees reported having health condition(s) putting them at high risk for COVID-19 (10%, 30/302) and 14% of trainees (41/302) reported having had COVID-19 (Table 1). Only 53% (160/302) reported feeling physically safe in the workplace while 25% (76/302) reported not feeling physically safe;reasons included lack of training about COVID-19, lack of comfort in the clinical setting, insufficient personal protective equipment, immunocompromised state, and pregnancy. Half (151/302) reported burnout and 68% (204/302) an increase in stress from work during the pandemic (Figure 1), whilst 25% (75/302) reported that changes to their training programme negatively impacted their physical health. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the experience of rheumatology training as well as the well-being of trainees globally.

We investigated and verified the accuracy of 12 relatively low-cost sensor models that retail for less than $45 and are advertised as infection control measures on a major e-commerce site. Our results indicate that 25% of the tested sensors can be used to identify trends in CO2 concentration, if correctly calibrated. However, 67% of sensors did not respond to the presence of CO2, which suggests that a type of pseudo-technique is used to display the CO2 concentration. We recommend that these sensors are not suitable for infection prevention purposes. Furthermore, 58% of the investigated sensors showed significant responses to the presence of alcohol. Owing to the widespread use of alcohol in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, sensors that react to alcohol can display inaccurate values, resulting in inappropriate ventilation behavior. Therefore, we strongly recommended that these sensors not be used.

Most have focused on virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic medicine, having been centered by reactive strategies to control the pandemic. Meanwhile, publications addressing the ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic drivers of virus emergence, and potential strategies to prevent future outbreaks have been sparse. Here, we highlight the necessity of complementary and transdisciplinary insight and methodologies from an integrated perspective to study emergent diseases.

These skills are used to determine digital readiness of pre-service teachers. The paper reports on validation of an adjusted set of 54 performance statements which were categorized into seven digital learning domains. The seven digital learning domains were validated based on structural equation modelling which was then confirmed by factor analysis using AMOS software. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of a multi-layered model where all digital learning domains are positively connected to each other. Our findings therefore suggest a strong statistical validity of the performance statement inventory. The findings also point to the fact that pre-service teachers are in a transit phase from digital immigrants to digital natives. That, in the context of Covid-19 pandemic, implies the need to invest in appropriate preparation and training of pre-service teachers to teach in an online environment. The inventory for measuring digital literacy can be used to assess teachers’ digital readiness on a regular basis, thereby enabling them to adjust the teaching materials and pedagogy to achieve the required level of digital readiness, as defined by the school. ©ACPIL.","Peled, Y.; Kurtz, G.; Avidov-Ungar, O.",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,170,22

Here we constructed the biosynthetic pathway of D-glucaric acid in S. cerevisiae INVSc1 whose opi1 was knocked out and obtained two engineered strains, LGA-1 and LGA-C, producing record breaking titers of D-glucaric acid, 9.53 ± 0.46 g/L and 11.21 ± 0.63 g/L D-glucaric acid from 30 g/L glucose and 10.8 g/L myo-inositol in the mode of fed-batch fermentation, respectively. Due to the genetic stability and the outperformance in subsequent applications, however, LGA-1 was a preferable strain. As one of the top chemicals from biomass, there have been no reports on D-glucaric acid production from lignocellulose, which is the most abundant renewable on earth. Therefore, the biorefinery processes of lignocellulose for D-glucaric acid production including separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) were investigated in this work and CBP by an artificial microbial consortium composed of Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 and S. cerevisiae LGA-1 was found to have relatively high D-glucaric acid titers and yields after 7 d fermentation, 0.54 ± 0.12 g/L D-glucaric acid from 15 g/L Avicel, and 0.45 ± 0.06 g/L D-glucaric acid from 15 g/L steam exploded corn stover (SECS), respectively. In attempts to design the microbial consortium for more efficient CBP the team consisted of the two members, T. reesei Rut-C30 and S. cerevisiae LGA-1, was found to be the best with excellent work distribution and collaboration.

Using a retroviral expression vector, two fusion proteins were expressed in rat pituitary (GH3) cells: a control protein consisting of the beta-lactamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee alpha-globin (142 amino acids); and a chimera of the somatostatin signal peptide and proregion (82 amino acids) fused to alpha-globin. Control globin was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as determined by accurate cleavage of its signal peptide; however, alpha- globin was not secreted but was rapidly and quantitatively degraded intracellularly with a t 1/2 of 4-5 min. Globin degradation was insensitive to chloroquine, a drug which inhibits lysosomal proteases, but was inhibited at 16 degrees C suggesting proteolysis occurred during transport to the cis-Golgi apparatus. In contrast to the control globin, approximately 30% of the somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein was transported to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus where it was endoproteolytically processed. Processing of the chimera occurred in an acidic intracellular compartment since cleavage was inhibited by 25 microM chloroquine. 60% of the transported chimera was cleaved at the Arg-Lys processing site in native prosomatostatin yielding ""mature"" alpha-globin. Most significantly, approximately 50% of processed alpha-globin was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a common phenomenon in many clinical cases, including liver surgery and transplantation. Inflammatory mediators are vital contributors to the expansion of hepatic damage after I/R injury (I/RI), and therefore, targeting inflammation is a considerable candidate for the management of hepatic I/RI and its complications. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided equally into four groups: 1) Control (Vehicle) group, in which rats underwent laparotomy and received normal saline; 2) SILI group, in which rats underwent laparotomy, and 30 mg/kg silibinin was injected intraperitoneal (IP); 3) I/R group, in which rats underwent I/R and received normal saline; and 4) I/R + SILI group, who encountered I/R after laparotomy and received silibinin. After one hour of ischemia and three hours of reperfusion, blood and liver tissue samples were assembled for future biochemical, histological, and gene expression studies. RESULTS: In vivo analysis attested that serum AST and ALT activities were significantly lessened by silibinin in the SILI + I/R group (p <0.001). Silibinin ameliorated inflammatory liver tissue injuries, including neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, hepatocyte degeneration, cytoplasmic vacuolation, vascular endothelial damages, and sinusoid dilation observed in the I/R group. During I/R, NLRP3 and NF-κB gene expression showed a significant increment compared to the control group (p <0.001), which could be alleviated by silibinin (p <0.01). CONCLUSION: The results evidence that adjusting the expression of NLRP3 and NF-κB genes during I/R is probably one of the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of silibinin.","Zarpou, Setareh; Mosavi, Hadis; Bagheri, Abouzar; Malekzadeh Shafaroudi, Majid; Khonakdar-Tarsi, Abbas",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,170,4

SARS CoV total immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgG, IgA, and IgM [IgGAM]) was the first antibody to be detectable. There was no difference in time to seroconversion between the patients who survived (n = 14) and those who died (n = 6). Although SARS CoV IgM was still detectable by IF tests with 8 of 11 patients at 7 months postinfection, the geometric mean titers dropped from 282 at 1 month postinfection to 19 at 7 months (P = 0.001). In contrast, neutralizing antibody and SARS CoV IgGAM and IgG antibody titers remained stable over this period. The SARS CoV antibody response was sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting IF IgG antibody titers for human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63. There was no change in IF IgG titer for virus capsid antigen from the herpesvirus that was used as an unrelated control, Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, patients who had OC43 infections, and probably also 229E infections, without prior exposure to SARS CoV had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting virus but not for SARS CoV.

Among these mRNAs, only mRNA 1 is efficiently packaged into MHV particles. MHV N protein binds to all MHV mRNAs, whereas envelope M protein interacts only with mRNA 1. This M protein-mRNA 1 interaction most probably determines the selective packaging of mRNA 1 into MHV particles. A short cis-acting MHV RNA packaging signal is necessary and sufficient for packaging RNA into MHV particles. The present study tested the possibility that the selective M protein-mRNA 1 interaction is due to the packaging signal in mRNA 1. Regardless of the presence or absence of the packaging signal, N protein bound to MHV defective interfering RNAs and intracellularly expressed non-MHV RNA transcripts to form ribonucleoprotein complexes; M protein, however, interacted selectively with RNAs containing the packaging signal. Moreover, only the RNA that interacted selectively with M protein was efficiently packaged into MHV particles. Thus, it was the packaging signal that mediated the selective interaction between M protein and viral RNA to drive the specific packaging of RNA into virus particles. This is the first example for any RNA virus in which a viral envelope protein and a known viral RNA packaging signal have been shown to determine the specificity and selectivity of RNA packaging into virions.","Narayanan, K; Makino, S",Journal of virology,170,1

Formalin-fixed intestinal tissues were examined by light and electron microscopy for attaching and effacing (AE) lesions characteristic of EPEC, and frozen (-75 C) intestinal contents were examined for presence of EPEC. Escherichia coli isolates were characterized on the basis of epithelial cell attachment, fluorescent actin staining (FAS) test, and presence of E. coli attaching/effacing (EAE), shigalike toxin (SLT) type I, SLT II, and bundle-forming pilus (BFP) genes by polymerase chain reaction procedures. EPEC isolates were examined for pathogenicity and ability to induce AE lesions in experimentally inoculated young turkeys. AE lesions were identified by light microscopy in Giemsa-stained intestines from 7 of 12 PEMS-affected turkey flocks. Lesions consisted of bacterial microcolonies attached to epithelial surfaces with epithelial degeneration at sites of attachment and inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria. Electron microscopy confirmed the identity of AE lesions in six of seven flocks determined to have AE lesions by light microscopy. EPEC were identified in 4 of 12 flocks on the basis of the presence of EAE genes a nd absence of SLT I and SLT II genes; all isolates lacked BFP genes. EPEC isolates produced AE lesions and variable mortality in turkeys coinfected with turkey coronavirus. In total, EPEC were associated with 10 of 12 (83%) naturally occurring PEMS cases on the basis of identification of AE lesions and/or EPEC isolates.

The SARS outbreak was unique in its rapid transmission and it resulted in heavy stress in first-line healthcare workers, particularly in the emergency department. AIM : To determine the influence of SARS on the psychological status, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, of the staff in the emergency department. METHODS To investigate whether different working conditions in the hospital led to different psychological effects on healthcare workers, the psychological effect on emergency department staff in the high-risk ward was compared with that on psychiatric ward staff in the medium-risk ward. Davidson Trauma Scale-Chinese version (DTS-C) and Chinese Health Questionnaire-12 (CHQ-12) items were designed to check the psychological status of the staff in the month after the end of the SARS outbreak. RESULTS 86 of 92 (93.5%) medical staff considered the SARS outbreak to be a traumatic experience. The DTS-C scores of staff in the emergency department and in the psychiatric ward were significantly different (p = 0.04). No significant difference in CHQ score was observed between the two groups.

The main reasons that worsen the course of COVID-19 in patients with DM are features of DM and mutual influence of DM and COVID-19; the influence of separate medicines groups used in the treatment of both diseases; shortcomings in the organization of patients' treatment and care. The main factor that is crucial in the management of these patients is the normalization of blood sugar level and carbohydrates metabolism achieved by all possible means.","Halushko, O; Loskutov, O; Kuchynska, I; Synytsyn, M; Boliuk, M",Georgian medical news,170,32

Hence, we deliver our perspectives and recommendations based on the current situation in Indonesia to enforce their safeties. We encourage stakeholders to implement a systematic approach by employing stringent prevention strategies, ensuring adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) provision and equitable PPE distribution, and routine HCWs screening to prevent nosocomial clusters, in addition to the provision of psychosocial support to HCWs by offering social aids and psychological sessions. Furthermore, social stigma and discrimination toward HCWs and patients should also be addressed and mitigated, thus preventing concealments of patients' history and alleviating emotional burdens. We believe that providing continuous support to HCWs would lead to key benefits in ensuring a winning battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevance for Patients HCWs are pivotal players in winning the battle against the COVID- 19 pandemic. Ensuring their safety and well-being will enable them to deliver better healthcare services, thus resulting in mutual benefit for themselves, the patients, and the nation's recovery.","Lazarus, Gilbert; Meyer, Markus; Depfenhart, Markus; Tjahjadi, Angela Kimberly; Dewayanti, Santi Rahayu; Dakota, Iwan; Siswanto, Bambang Budi",Journal of clinical and translational research,170,9

In the past 3 years, several novel respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human coronavirus NL63, were discovered. Here we report the discovery of another novel coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia who had just returned from Shenzhen, China. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the amount of CoV-HKU1 RNA was 8.5 to 9.6 x 10(6) copies per ml in his nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) during the first week of the illness and dropped progressively to undetectable levels in subsequent weeks. He developed increasing serum levels of specific antibodies against the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of CoV-HKU1, with immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers of 1:20, 1:40, and 1:80 and IgG titers of <1:1,000, 1:2,000, and 1:8,000 in the first, second and fourth weeks of the illness, respectively. Isolation of the virus by using various cell lines, mixed neuron-glia culture, and intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice was unsuccessful. The complete genome sequence of CoV-HKU1 is a 29,926-nucleotide, polyadenylated RNA, with G+C content of 32%, the lowest among all known coronaviruses with available genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that CoV-HKU1 is a new group 2 coronavirus. Screening of 400 NPAs, negative for SARS-CoV, from patients with respiratory illness during the SARS period identified the presence of CoV-HKU1 RNA in an additional specimen, with a viral load of 1.13 x 10(6) copies per ml, from a 35-year-old woman with pneumonia. Our data support the existence of a novel group 2 coronavirus associated with pneumonia in humans.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Chu, Chung-ming; Chan, Kwok-hung; Tsoi, Hoi-wah; Huang, Yi; Wong, Beatrice H L; Poon, Rosana W S; Cai, James J; Luk, Wei-kwang; Poon, Leo L M; Wong, Samson S Y; Guan, Yi; Peiris, J S Malik; Yuen, Kwok-yung",Journal of virology,170,28

These included staff medical sick leave for febrile illness, inpatient fevers, inpatient pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, febrile illnesses with significant travel history and sudden unexplained deaths from pneumonia/ adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS Surveillance data on medical sick leave of staff, all inpatient fevers, all febrile (temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees Celsius) inpatient pneumonia, including atypical pneumonia, and deaths from pneumonia were collected from sick leave reports, ward reports, isolation room rounds and mortuary reports from 1 to 28 September 2003. RESULTS Baseline results show 167 (1.4/1000 staff-days) observed in staff sick leave for febrile illnesses, and 1798 (71.3/1000 bed-days) observed for inpatient fever. There were 40, 31 and 12 instances, respectively, of staff having temperatures of high fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees Celsius), prolonged sick leave (3 days or more), and repeated sick leave (within 7 days) for febrile illnesses. An average of 4.6 wards a day potentially fulfilled the World Health Organisation SARS alert criteria. Of 27 cases with fever, pneumonia and a total white count of less than 10,000 cells per cubic mm as per Ministry of Health, Singapore criteria for the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, only five were identified by clinicians. CONCLUSION Surveillance is time-consuming and current recommendations are not specific enough to be used practically. Surveillance indicators for inpatients must overcome a high degree of background noise.","Escudero, I H G; Chen, M I; Leo, Y S",Singapore medical journal,170,1

METHODS Recurrence was analyzed retrospectively in SARS patients referred to our hospital from April to May this year to understand the clinical features, the recurrent related factors, the response of treatment and the outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and twenty three patients with SARS were referred to the First Hospital of Peking University from 8, April to 14, May this year and of whom 51 were the critical. Twenty-five patients experienced recurrence, account for 20.3% of total patients (25/123) and 31.4% of critical patients. The clinical features included recurrent fever, worsened breathlessness, exacerbation in radiological lesions and elevated LDH, etc.. These patients were treated with glucocorticoids. Eleven of them were mechanical ventilated. Twenty-one patients recovered. Pulmonary fibrosis were left in 2 patients and another 2 patients died. CONCLUSION The recurrence of symptoms in SARS patients is one of the common clinical feature of critical patients with SARS. Mechanism of recurrence in SARS patient is unknown. Management with glucocorticoids and noninvasive ventilation can control the progression in these patients effectively.","Nie, Ligong; Li, Haichao; Que, Chengli; Wang, Guangfa; Ma, Jing; Li, Nan; Gao, Zhidong; Xu, Xiaoyuan",Beijing da xue xue bao.

In this generalized Thomson problem, the patterns of the adsorbed chain are analyzed in the space of the toroidal coordinates and in terms of the orientation of each chain segment. Various patterns are found, including double spirals, disclination-like structures, Janus tori, and uniform wrappings, arising from the long-range electrostatic interaction and the toroidal geometry. Their broken mirror symmetry is quantitatively characterized by introducing an order parameter, an integral of the torsion. The uniform packing, which breaks the mirror symmetry the least, has the lowest value of the order parameter. In addition, it is found that the electrostatic energy of confined chains on tori conforms to a power law regardless of the screening effect in some typical cases studied. Furthermore, we study random walks on tori that generate chain configurations in the large screening limit or at large thermal fluctuation; some features associated with the toroidal geometry are discussed.","Yao, Zhenwei; Olvera de la Cruz, Monica","Physical review.

This is a systematic review in which the databases of Chocrane, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science as well as reliable journals including Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Jama and also Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publications were searched.Out of 169 documents discovered during the literature review, 56 ones were somehow related to the association between MMR vaccine and COVID-19, of which 11 ones mentioned the association between these two, and 8 of them contained a hypothesis about this relationship. A quasi-trial study reported the positive effect of the MMR vaccine on reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms among those who received it. Also, a cross-sectional study showed an association between the level of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) mumps and COVID-19. Moreover, a genomic data analysis study also reported the effect of Rubella Immunoglobulin G (IgG) level on COVID-19. It seems that due to the similarity of respiratory diseases including measles, rubella, and mumps to COVID-19, MMR vaccine should be investigated more deeply to see if it is effective in order to deal with this novel disease.","Taheri Soodejani, Moslem; Basti, Moslem; Tabatabaei, Seyyed Mohammad; Rajabkhah, Kourosh",International journal of molecular epidemiology and genetics,170,33

XFEL experiments are a challenge to computing in two ways: i) due to the high cost of running XFELs, a fast turnaround time from data acquisition to data analysis is essential to make informed decisions on experimental protocols; ii) data collection rates are growing exponentially, requiring new scalable algorithms. Here we report our experiences analyzing data from two experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) during September 2020. Raw data were analyzed on NERSC's Cori XC40 system, using the Superfacility paradigm: our workflow automatically moves raw data between LCLS and NERSC, where it is analyzed using the software package CCTBX. We achieved real time data analysis with a turnaround time from data acquisition to full molecular reconstruction in as little as 10 min -- sufficient time for the experiment's operators to make informed decisions. By hosting the data analysis on Cori, and by automating LCLS-NERSC interoperability, we achieved a data analysis rate which matches the data acquisition rate. Completing data analysis with 10 mins is a first for XFEL experiments and an important milestone if we are to keep up with data collection trends.","Blaschke, Johannes P; Brewster, Aaron S; Paley, Daniel W; Mendez, Derek; Sauter, Nicholas K; Kröger, Wilko; Shankar, Murali; Enders, Bjoern; Bard, Deborah",ArXiv,170,12

Equivalent sensitivity as in the ELISA was obtained when the same sera were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests. The virus purification techniques described resulted in highly suitable antigens for all indirect ELISA established. Since IIF requires no purified antigens, this test is recommended as an alternative to ELISA as well as to HI and complement fixation (CF) tests for laboratories lacking the necessary equipment for high speed centrifugation. A high incidence of false positive HI reactions was found particularly in Reo 3 routine serology. An updated survey of seromonitoring showed that European murine colonies appeared to be infected far less with Reo 3 if ELISA or IIF tests were employed. During 1982-1984, only 13% of the mouse colonies screened possessed Reo 3 positive sera whereas no natural Reo 3 infection was found in rat colonies. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the coronaviruses of rats exhibited the highest incidence in murine colonies. A total of 60% of mouse and 41% of rat colonies were found to be infected by these viruses. In comparison with earlier serological surveys, the relative incidence of other murine infections was similar. Antibodies against Bacillus piliformis (Tyzzer's disease) were detected by the IIF test in 41% of the rat colonies screened.","Kraft, V; Meyer, B",Laboratory animal science,170,11

The purpose of this study was to understand the visible and invisible potential challenges being faced by the 1st year medical and dental students while attending digital anatomy classes. METHODS: The present study was conducted on 81st year medical and dental students who were admitted to their respective college in August 2019 and were willing to participate in the study. A multiple choice close-ended questionnaire regarding their opinion on virtual classes was designed and feedback was taken from the students. RESULTS: Majority (65%) of the students agreed that they missed their traditional anatomy learning i.e., dissection courses, face to face lectures and interaction with mentors. The students strongly felt the lack of confidence and difficulty in the topics completed without dissections, models, microscopic slides and other modalities. 83% felt lack of proper gadgets, high-band width and strong internet connections, a potential barrier in their digital learning. Lack of self-motivation was felt by 69% students. CONCLUSIONS: The current situation of anatomy education is not intentional, and is not the long term silver bullet solution for a visual subject like anatomy. Though learners face a lot of challenges, however, a shift to online must be supported at this time of health crisis. As the digital learning may go for indefinite period, the feedback of students may be helpful for relevant and timely modifications in digital anatomy education.","Singal, Anjali; Bansal, Agam; Chaudhary, Priti; Singh, Harsimranjit; Patra, Apurba",,170,10

As health care organizations move from crisis mobilization to a new landscape of health and social needs, organizational health literacy offers practical building blocks to provide high-quality, efficient, and meaningful care to patients and their families. Organizational health literacy is defined by the Institute of Medicine as ""the degree to which an organization implements policies, practices, and systems that make it easier for people to navigate, understand, and use information and services to take care of their health."" METHODS: This article synthesizes insights from organizational health literacy in the context of current major health care challenges and toward the goal of innovation in patient-centered care. We first provide a brief overview of the origins and outlines of organizational health literacy research and practice. Second, using an established patient-centered innovation framework, we show how the existing work on organizational health literacy can offer a menu of effective, patient-centered innovative options for care delivery systems to improve systems and outcomes. Finally, we consider the high value of management focusing on organizational health literacy efforts, specifically for patients in health care transitions and in the rapid transformation of care into myriad distance modalities. RESULTS: This article provides practical guidance for systems and informs decisions around resource allocation and organizational priorities to best meet the needs of patient populations even in the face of financial and workforce disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational health literacy principles and guidelines provide a road map for promoting patient-centered care even in this time of crisis, change, and transformation. Health system leaders seeking innovative approaches can have access to well-established tool kits, guiding models, and materials toward many organizational health literacy goals across treatment, diagnosis, prevention, education, research, and outreach.","Sentell, Tetine; Foss-Durant, Anne; Patil, Uday; Taira, Deborah; Paasche-Orlow, Michael K; Trinacty, Connie Mah",,170,12

This has resulted in the reduction of air pollution concentrations observed globally. This study is aimed at examining the concentration changes in air pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) during the period March-April 2020. Data from both satellite observations (for NO2) and ground-based measurements (for all other pollutants) were utilized to analyze the changes when compared against the same months between 2015-2019. Globally, space borne NO2 column observations observed by satellite (OMI on Aura) were reduced by approximately 9.19% and 9.57%, in March and April 2020, respectively because of public health measures enforced to contain the coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19). On a regional scale and after accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, most monitoring sites in Europe, USA, China, and India showed declines in CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations during the period of analysis. An increase in O3 concentrations occurred during the same period. Meanwhile, four major cities case studies i.e. in New York City (USA), Milan (Italy), Wuhan (China), and New Delhi (India) have also shown a similar reduction trends as observed on the regional scale, and an increase in ozone concentration. This study highlights that the reductions in air pollutant concentrations have overall improved global air quality likely driven in part by economic slowdowns resulting from the global pandemic.","Bray, Casey D; Nahas, Alberth; Battye, William H; Aneja, Viney P",Atmos Environ (1994),170,13

Positive impacts on the spread of multiresistant pathogens and infections in general may be observed with the implementation of general preventative measures for the spread of infectious disease such as social distancing, reduced travel and increased personal hygiene. This pandemic has accelerated the development of novel technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, that may be used to fight other diseases. These should be capitalized upon to manage the ongoing antimicrobial resistance pandemic in the background. However, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic is fueling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance due to high rates of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, the high use of biocides and the interruption of treatment for other conditions. Clinical uncertainty driven by the lack of effective diagnostics and practice of telemedicine may have driven the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. As pathogens know no borders, increased focus is needed for infectious diseases still threatening low- and middle-income countries such as tuberculosis.

Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases.

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (ß = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.","Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun",Brain Behav Immun,170,21

The experience of moral distress in nurses might be magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To explore causes of moral distress in nurses caring for Covid-19 patients and identify strategies to enhance their moral resiliency. RESEARCH DESIGN: A qualitative study using a qualitative content analysis of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We purposively sampled 31 nurses caring for Covid-19 patients in the acute care units within large academic medical systems in Maryland and New York City during April to June 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. RESULTS: We identified themes and sub-themes representative of major causes of moral distress in nurses caring Covid-19 patients. These included (a) lack of knowledge and uncertainty regarding how to treat a new illness; (b) being overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the Covid-19 illness; (c) fear of exposure to the virus leading to suboptimal care; (d) adopting a team model of nursing care that caused intra-professional tensions and miscommunications; (e) policies to reduce viral transmission (visitation policy and PPE policy) that prevented nurses to assume their caring role; (f) practicing within crisis standards of care; and (g) dealing with medical resource scarcity. Participants discussed their coping mechanisms and suggested future strategies. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our study affirms new causes of moral distress related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Institutions need to develop a supportive ethical climate that can restore nurses' moral resiliency. Such a climate should include non-hierarchical interdisciplinary spaces where all providers can meet together as moral peers to discuss their experiences.","Silverman, Henry J; Kheirbek, Raya Elfadel; Moscou-Jackson, Gyasi; Day, Jenni",Nurs Ethics,170,24

However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. RESULTS: Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting.

The Act is designed to raise awareness of, prevent, control, and eradicate infectious or communicable diseases to address public health emergencies and reduce health risks. A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Bangladesh on 8 March 2020, and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a gazette on 23 March, listing COVID-19 as an infectious disease and addressing COVID-19 as a public health emergency. The gazette empowers the government to monitor the spread of infection. Despite there being an infrastructure of research ethics committees in almost all hospitals in Bangladesh, a lack of such committees in the clinical setting often forces healthcare professionals to allocate scarce healthcare resources to the task. These personnel are often either influenced by materialistic matters or guided by the emergency policies, without reaching a consensus on how to allocate scarce resources in times of need, especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethical dilemmas often arise when a number of patients with COVID-19, especially in poor and middle-class areas, are denied care while elites are prioritized to receive such scarce resources. Resource allocation in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh appears to be unethical and in direct conflict with the biomedical principles of non-maleficence and procedural justice. The findings of this study suggest that the Act needs substantive changes in the stipulation of policy directing hospitals in the provision of resource allocation framework. Furthermore, parliament should produce guidance outlining how to successfully implement the law with the aim of protecting public health in times of emergency, especially the COVID-19 pandemic.","Siraj, Md Sanwar; Dewey, Rebecca Susan; Hassan, A S M Firoz Ul",Asian Bioeth Rev,170,16

Methods: Participants completed online self-report measures of study constructs. Results: As predicted, students experiencing more stress related to COVID-19 endorsed more symptoms of depression. Student stress was also associated with less use of engagement coping responses. Primary engagement and secondary engagement coping responses mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and symptoms of depression.

This study sought to assess the pandemic's psychological impact on the Israeli public. METHODS: Using mixed methods we assessed Israeli adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the quantitative study, participants (N=1407) completed an online battery of measures assessing psychological variables and perceived threat related to COVID-19. Statistical analyses included tests for between-group differences and Pearson correlations. The qualitative study entailed in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted by telephone (N=38). RESULTS: The quantitative findings indicate that about 48% of the public had negative emotional reactions and 20% perceived they were liable to contract the virus. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between these feelings and the degree of perceived threat. Three major themes emerged from the qualitative study: 1) a sense of shock and chaos; 2) gradual adjustment to the new reality; and 3) fears and concerns for self and family members. The study's results revealed the following sources of participants' emotional responses and sense of threat: health concerns regarding themselves and their loved ones; employment concerns; problems with children and spouses caused by being together at home; and difficulties entailed in working at home. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals many of the psychological variables and perceived threats related to COVID-19 in Israel. While social distancing may make people feel safer, it can also increase their feelings of isolation, stress and frustration and cause difficulties in many life situations. The findings point to the necessity of addressing the public's perceived susceptibility and emotional reactions about COVID-19.","Levkovich, Inbar; Shinan-Altman, Shiri",International health (Online),170,1

The aim of this study was to summarize the incidence of OCD in HCWs. We searched the databases PubMed/MEDLINE (1980-present), EMBASE (1980-present) and Cochrane Library (1992-present) through May 2020 using the search term 'incidence of contact dermatitis in HCWs' according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, 16 studies (six cohorts; 10 register-based) with follow-up periods between 1987 and 2013 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of OCD reported in studies using registers of occupational diseases ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 per 10 000 person-years. The cohort studies reported incidence from 15.9 to 780.0 per 10 000 person-years; the incidence was higher in studies which included apprentice nurses. A higher incidence was also observed amongst dental practitioners, particularly dental technicians and nurses, compared to other HCWs. Studies reporting incidence data are very scarce and results differed by study design, type of contact dermatitis and investigated HCWs. Our study highlighted the dearth of high-quality data on the incidence of OCD and the possible underestimation of disease burden. Prospective cohort studies with harmonized designs, especially exposure assessment and outcome ascertainment, are required to provide more accurate, valid and recent estimates of the incidence of OCD. A high incidence amongst specific occupational groups suggests the need to undertake intervention studies with a focus on prevention, particularly during pandemics such as COVID-19.","Larese Filon, F; Pesce, M; Paulo, M S; Loney, T; Modenese, A; John, S M; Kezic, S; Macan, J",J.

The resulting collective hysteria may have contributed to policy errors by governments not in line with health recommendations. While mass hysteria can occur in societies with a minimal state, we show that there exist certain self-corrective mechanisms and limits to the harm inflicted, such as sacrosanct private property rights. However, mass hysteria can be exacerbated and self-reinforcing when the negative information comes from an authoritative source, when the media are politicized, and social networks make the negative information omnipresent.

Plants are sessile organisms that can be exposed to environmental stress. Plants alter their cellular processes to survive under potentially unfavorable conditions. Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that has a crucial role in various cellular signaling processes in abiotic stress response. In this study, we characterized Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4, OsSIRP4, a membrane and cytosol-localized RING E3 ligase in rice. OsSIRP4 transcripts were highly induced under salt stress in rice. We found that OsSIRP4 possesses E3 ligase activity; however, no E3 ligase activity was observed with a single amino acid substitution (OsSIRP4C269A). The results of the yeast two hybrid system, in vitro pull-down assay, BiFC analysis, in vitro ubiquitination assay, and in vitro degradation assay indicate that OsSIRP4 regulates degradation of a substrate protein, OsPEX11-1 (Oryza sativa peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11-1) via the 26S proteasomal system. Phenotypic analysis of OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants demonstrated hypersensitivity to salt response compared to that of the wild type and mutated OsSIRP4C269A plants. In addition, OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants exhibited significant low enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, and accumulation of proline and soluble sugar, but a high level of H2O2. Furthermore, qRT data on transgenic plants suggest that OsSIRP4 acted as a negative regulator of salt response by diminishing the expression of genes related to Na+/K+ homeostasis (AtSOS1, AtAKT1, AtNHX1, and AtHKT1;1) in transgenic plants under salt stress. These results suggest that OsSIRP4 plays a negative regulatory role in response to salt stress by modulating the target protein levels.","Kim, Ju Hee; Jang, Cheol Seong",Plant mol. biol,170,19

A deeper understanding of patient perspectives will inform strategies to optimize adherence with vision-preserving therapies. Objective: To evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 exposure risk and their association with appointment attendance among patients at high risk of both reversible and irreversible vision loss from lapses in care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study included a nonvalidated telephone survey designed in April and May of 2020 and a retrospective medical record review conducted in parallel with survey administration from May 22 to August 18, 2020. Participants were recruited from 2 tertiary eye care centers (Emory Eye Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and W.K. Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan). The study included a random sample of patients with diagnoses of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy (DR) who received an intravitreal injection between January 6 and March 13, 2020, and were scheduled for a second injection between March 13 and May 6, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between perceptions regarding COVID-19 risks and loss to follow-up. Results: Of 1004 eligible patients, 423 (42%) were successfully contacted, and 348 (82%) agreed to participate (participants' mean [SD] age, 75 [12] years; 195 women [56%]; 287 White [82%] patients). Respondents had a mean (SD) of 2.7 (1.1) comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, and 77 (22%) knew someone with COVID-19. Of all respondents, 163 (47%) were very concerned or moderately concerned about vision loss from missed treatments during the pandemic. Although 208 (60%) believed the COVID-19 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exposure at the eye clinic was extremely unlikely or unlikely, 49 (14%) believed it was extremely likely or likely. Seventy-eight participants (22%) were lost to follow-up. Concern regarding COVID-19 exposure during clinic visits (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.4) and diagnosis of DR (vs AMD) (OR, 8.130; 95% CI, 3.367-20.408) were associated with an increase in likelihood of loss to follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients at high risk for vision loss from lapses in care, many expressed concerns regarding the effect of the pandemic on their ability to receive timely care. Survey results suggest that fear of SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with a roughly 4-fold increase in the odds of patient loss to follow-up. These results support the potential importance of clearly conveying infection-control measures.","Lindeke-Myers, Aaron; Zhao, Peter Yu Cheng; Meyer, Benjamin I; Liu, Elaine A; Levine, David A; Bennett, Olivia M; Ji, Sunjong; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Rao, Rajesh C; Jain, Nieraj",JAMA ophthalmol.

This tool can be applied to all other surgical specialties. DESIGN: Prospective case series of 166 patients. SETTING: Single-centre tertiary neurosurgical department. PARTICIPANTS: All patients awaiting an elective neurosurgical procedure were included in this study. All emergency or life-threatening neurosurgical pathologies affecting patients were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk assessment tool identified patients with progressive neurology and stratified need for surgery against risk of harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Using our risk stratification tool, 6.6% patients required expedited surgery and a further 11.4% patients were removed completely from the waiting list. The majority of patients 47%, required surgery within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: This simple tool encourages surgical departments to establish contact with patients during COVID-19. The clinician acquires up-to-date information regarding patient symptomatology and subsequently determines surgical priority, a timescale required for surgery and overall uses of NHS resources efficiently.

The primary outcome was the occurrence of acute respiratory failure during hospital stay. Of 625 patients, 56 (9%) had respiratory failure. Some selected demographic, epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features as well as radiologic features at admission and treatment during hospitalisation were significantly different in patients with and without respiratory failure. The multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (in years) (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.10; P = 0.0002), respiratory rate (breaths/minute) (OR, 1.23; 95% CI: 1.08-1.40; P = 0.0020), lymphocyte count (109/l) (OR, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05-0.69; P = 0.0157) and pulmonary opacity score (per 5%) (OR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.19-1.61; P < 0.0001) at admission were associated with the occurrence of respiratory failure. Older age, increased respiratory rate, decreased lymphocyte count and greater pulmonary opacity score at admission were independent risk factors of respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: On January 27, 2020 the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES) agreed to operate the New Jersey Coronavirus Hotline. Call patterns, subject matter, and staffing and infrastructure strategies that were implemented to meet the demand are described. In addition, a sample of 1500 individual calls were collected and analyzed in an endeavor to describe call times, call days, area from which the call originated, callers to the hotline, primary language of the caller, and why a call was placed to the hotline. Binomial regression analysis was utilized in an attempt to identify significant patterns. RESULTS: Since the inception of the hotline through October 31, NJPIES responded to 57,579 calls for COVID-19 information. Most calls (68.7%) were regarding testing for COVID-19 and for general questions/symptoms. Call types varied when they were analyzed by time of day with calls for general questions/symptoms and where to get tested for COVID-19 showing a significant association for the early morning hours, how to obtain test results being significantly associated with the afternoon hours, and how to renew or obtain a medical license showing a significant association to the evening hours. We additionally noted that specific call types became significant when analyzed on a week-to-week basis and as specific events, like the enactment of the CARES Act of 2020, occurred. CONCLUSION: Although not the traditional role of a regional Poison Control Center, pandemic response synergizes with the workflow of this hotline because the infrastructure, staffing, and healthcare expertise are already present. Poison centers can rapidly adapt through scaling and process change to meet the needs of the public during times of public health threats.","Meaden, Christopher W; Ramdin, Christine; Ruck, Bruce; Nelson, Lewis S; Soukas, Chloe; Hirsch, Mitchell; Alsharif, Peter; Beckford, David; Calello, Diane P",Clin Toxicol (Phila),170,16

The new CoViD-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), developed in China, is characterized as a rapid compilation tool (10 minutes), easily understandable and appreciated by people. AIM: The objectives of this study were: (1) the validation of the Italian version of the CPDI, and (2) the measurement of the prevalence of peritraumatic distress in this phase 1 CoViD-19. METHOD: CPDI has been translated using a standard forward-backward-translation procedure and offered online to 329 people (191 females and 137 males, aged 46.49 ± 13.58 years). The CPDI showed an internal-consistency of Cronbach's &#945; =0.916. Content validity was judged satisfactory by two psychologists experienced in stress and trauma. The construct validity is given by the high correlation with the dimensions of Intrusion, Avoidance and Hyperarousal as measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (r=0.63, r=0.57, r=0.71, respectively). RESULTS: Our results are comparable to the Chinese ones. A third of people experienced symptoms of mild/moderate and severe peritraumatic distress. Females have higher scores, compared to males. Older people are more resilient, compared to younger, and those who have been in quarantine report less distress than those didn't, as evidenced by the results of the multivariate logistic regression model. High distress was associated with use of psychotropic drugs (AOR=4.28; 95% CI=1.55-11.85), sleeping remedies (AOR=4.05; 95% CI=2.07-7.94), be worried about dying in case of contagion CoViD-19 (AOR=3.33; 95% CI=1.83-6.06), female gender (AOR=2.95; 95% CI=1.58-5.53) and have a religious belief (AOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.05-3.70). To be aged 51-71 years, to have been in quarantine and to have received psychological support were variables associated with lower distress scores. CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the Italian version are satisfactory and confirm that CPDI is a tool fast, non-intrusive, administered online, and therefore 'safe' in a phase with a high risk of contagion. It allows, like a psychic thermoscan, to quickly detect the needs of the population and propose equally rapid interventions.","Costantini, Anna; Mazzotti, Eva",Riv Psichiatr,170,20

Similar concerns, such as those associated with poverty, impair performance on cognitive control tasks. If ongoing concerns about COVID-19 substantially increase the tendency to mind wander in tasks requiring sustained attention, these worries could degrade performance on a wide range of tasks, leading, for example, to increased traffic accidents, diminished educational achievement, and lower workplace productivity. In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults' concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention. Experiment 1 tested mainly European participants during an early phase of the pandemic. After completing a survey probing COVID-related concerns, participants engaged in a continuous performance task (CPT) over two, 4-min blocks, during which they responded to city scenes that occurred 90% of the time and withheld responses to mountain scenes that occurred 10% of the time. Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT. These findings suggest that although COVID-19 increased anxiety in a broad swath of society, young adults are able to hold these concerns in a latent format, minimizing their impact on performance in a demanding sustained attention task.","Jun, Jihyang; Toh, Yi Ni; Sisk, Caitlin A; Remington, Roger W; Lee, Vanessa G",Cogn Res Princ Implic,170,16

METHODS: Data on Covid-19 deaths across 3,108 contiguous U.S. counties from the Johns Hopkins University and social determinants of health (SDoH) data from the County Health Ranking and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were fitted to Bayesian semi-parametric spatiotemporal Negative Binomial models, and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to assess the associations. Exceedance probabilities were used for detecting clusters. RESULTS: As of October 31, 2020, the median mortality rate was 40.05 per 100, 000. The monthly urban mortality rates increased with unemployment (IRRadjusted:1.41, 95%CrI: 1.24, 1.60), percent Black population (IRRadjusted:1.05, 95%CrI: 1.04, 1.07), and residential segregation (IRRadjusted:1.03, 95%CrI: 1.02, 1.04).

Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. We assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial in adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to 400 mg sofosbuvir, 60 mg daclatasvir and 1200 mg ribavirin (intervention group) or to standard care (control group). The primary endpoint of this study was length of hospital stay. This study is registered by IRCT.ir under the ID: IRCT20200328046886N1. RESULTS: Between 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 48 patients were recruited; 24 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 24 to the control group. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days in both groups (P = 0.398). The number of ICU admissions in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group was not significantly lower than the control group (0 versus 4, P = 0.109). There was no difference in the number of deaths between the groups (0 versus 3, P = 0.234). The cumulative incidence of recovery was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm (Gray's P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial was too small to make definitive conclusions. There were trends in favour of the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm for recovery and lower death rates. However, there was an imbalance in the baseline characteristics between the arms.

This article summarizes the efforts, successes, and challenges experienced by ISU-CVM clinical faculty during this transition. Numerous data sources were reviewed, including college records and announcements, faculty survey results, and student rotation evaluations. Data were explored using quantitative and qualitative methods. Between March and July 2020, 36 faculty from 15 different clinical services invested approximately 5,000 hours in delivering virtual content to 165 VM4 students from ISU-CVM and Caribbean veterinary schools. With departmental, college, and university assistance, faculty effectively used educational technologies (Zoom, Canvas, Echo360) and developed adaptive and innovative methods for virtual content delivery. Virtual VM4 rotations were collectively well received and appreciated by students, and student evaluation scores were statistically equivalent or higher for virtual rotations than for the corresponding in-person rotations in the preceding year. Although certain hands-on skills could not be adequately acquired in a virtual environment, students gained theoretical knowledge and case-based problem-solving skills in the online format. Faculty reported satisfaction with their adaptability and resilience in these challenging circumstances. These findings demonstrate that ISU-CVM clinical faculty invested substantial time and effort to transition in-person clinical rotations to virtual format during the early COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly noteworthy given that many of these same faculty simultaneously served as essential personnel managing clinical cases in the university's teaching hospital.","Ward, Jessica L; Mulherin, Brenda L; Vengrin, Courtney A",J Vet Med Educ,170,0

This study assessed prevalence of, and antecedent factors and care access for the two common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, to support health system improvements. METHODS: Data was from a population based nationally representative survey. Prevalence of hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure &#8805; 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &#8805; 90 mmHg or a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose &#8805;6.1 mmol/L or a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes. Care-cascades for hypertension and diabetes were created with four stages: being tested, diagnosed, treated, and achieving control. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate individual-level factors - including symptoms of mental illness - associated with having hypertension or diabetes, and with progressing through the hypertension care cascade. Whether people at overt increased risk of hypertension or diabetes (defined as > 50 years old, BMI > 30 kg/m2, or currently smoking) were more likely to be tested was assessed using chi squared. RESULTS: Prevalence of hypertension was 33.5% (CI 30.6-36.5). Older age (OR 7.7, CI 4.93-12.02), some education (OR 0.6, CI 0.44-0.89), obesity (OR 3.1, CI 2.12-4.44), and raised fasting blood glucose (OR 2.4, CI 2.38) were significantly independently associated with hypertension. Only 10.9% (CI 8.6-13.8) of the entire hypertensive population achieved blood pressure control, associated factors were being female (OR 4.8, CI 2.33-9.88), formally employed (OR 3.0, CI 1.26-7.17), and overweight (OR 2.5, CI 1.29-4.76). The prevalence of diabetes was 4.4% (CI 3.4-5.5), and associated with old age (OR 14.1, CI 6.05-32.65) and almost significantly with obesity (OR 2.1, CI 1.00-4.37). Only 11.9% (CI 6.6-20.6) of the diabetic population had achieved control. Individuals at overt increased risk were more likely to have been tested for hypertension (chi2 19.4) or diabetes (chi2 33.2) compared to the rest of the population. Symptoms of mental illness were not associated with prevalence of disease or progress through the cascade. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of hypertension and suboptimal management along the care cascades indicates a large unmet need for hypertension and diabetes care in Zanzibar.","Jorgensen, Jutta M Adelin; Hedt, Kaya Helene; Omar, Omar Mwalim; Davies, Justine I",BMC Public Health,170,19

The clinical spectrum caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections can range from asymptomatic infection to mild undifferentiated febrile illness to severe respiratory disease with multiple complications. Elderly patients (aged 60 and above) with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus appear to be at highest risk of a severe disease outcome. To protect against pulmonary immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host primarily depends on two distinct defense strategies: resistance and disease tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to suppress and eliminate incoming viruses. By contrast, disease tolerance refers to host responses that promote host health regardless of their impact on viral replication. Disruption of either resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms or both could underpin predisposition to elevated risk of severe disease during viral infection. Aging can disrupt host resistance and disease tolerance by compromising immune functions, weakening of the unfolded protein response, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction, and altering metabolic processes. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying declining host defense in elderly individuals could thus pave the way to provide new opportunities and approaches for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","Mok, Darren Z L; Chan, Candice Yuen Yue; Ooi, Eng Eong; Chan, Kuan Rong",FEBS j,170,24

However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for the cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility and are not amenable to high-throughput screening. Methods: To address these limitations, we explored the use of a cell-based luciferase complementation reporter to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. We constructed lentiviral vectors that co-express 3CLpro and a split reporter in which two luciferase fragments were linked by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage of the reporter was expected to result in loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro was expected to result in significantly higher levels of luciferase activity. Results: In the absence of inhibitors, we found that most of the luciferase reporter was cleaved by 3CLpro, resulting in low luciferase activity. However, inhibition of 3CLpro, either with the small molecule GC376 or an inactivating mutation (C145A), prevented cleavage and resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in luciferase reporter activity. We also found that our reporter assay can easily distinguish between cytotoxicity and true inhibition of 3CLpro. With this assay, we screened 31 additional small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit 3CLpro. Of these, only four compounds exhibited significant activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in cells: boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496. Conclusion: We have developed a novel luciferase complementation reporter assay for identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in living cells. The assay is sensitive, rapid, easy to perform, and can readily differentiate cytotoxicity from 3CLpro inhibition, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. This assay should greatly facilitate efforts to identify more potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.","Rawson, J.; Duchon, A.; Nikolaitchik, O.; Pathak, V. K.; Hu, W.

Currently, there is a dearth of effective targeted therapies against viruses. Natural products isolated from traditional herbal plants have had a huge impact on drug development aimed at various diseases. Lapachol is a 1,4- naphthoquinone compound that has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects against several diseases. SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (nsps) play an important role in the viral replication cycle. Nsp9 seems to play a key role in transcription of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening by docking and molecular dynamics suggests that lapachol derivatives can interact with Nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2. Complexes of lapachol derivatives V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI with the Nsp9 RNA binding site were subjected to molecular dynamics assays, to assess the stability of the complexes via RMSD. All complexes were stable over the course of 100 ns dynamics assays. Analyses of the hydrogen bonds in the complexes showed that lapachol derivatives VI and IX demonstrated strongest binding, with a stable or increasing number of hydrogen bonds over time. Our results demonstrate that Nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2 could be an important target in prospecting for ligands with antiviral potential.

In mammalian species oligomannose N-glycans can have up to 9 Man; meanwhile structures can grow to over 200 units in yeast mannan. The highly dynamic nature, branching complexity, and 3D structure of oligomannoses have been recently highlighted for their roles in immune escape and infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2. The architectural features that allow these N-glycans to perform their functions are yet unclear, due to their intrinsically disordered nature that hinders their structural characterization. In this work we will discuss the results of over 54 µs of cumulative sampling by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of differently processed, free (not protein-linked) oligomannose N-glycans common in vertebrates. We then discuss the effects of a protein surface on their structural equilibria based on over 4 µs cumulative MD sampling of the fully glycosylated CD16a Fc Î³ receptor (FcÎ³RIIIa), where the type of glycosylation is known to modulate its binding affinity for IgG1s, regulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results show that the protein's structural constraints shift the oligomannoses conformational ensemble to promote conformers that satisfy the steric requirements and hydrogen bonding networks demanded by the protein's surface landscape. More importantly, we find that the protein does not actively distort the N-glycans into structures not populated in the unlinked forms in solution. Ultimately, the highly populated conformations of the Man5 linked glycans support experimental evidence of high levels of hybrid complex forms at N45 and show a specific presentation of the arms at N162, which may be involved in mediating binding affinity to the IgG1 Fc.","Fogarty, Carl A; Fadda, Elisa",J Phys Chem B,170,20

This paper investigates the differences in the level of income and expenditure between chronically-ill people and non-chronic population. Data were gathered from a national level survey conducted namely, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka. These data were statistically analysed with one-way and two-way ANOVA, to identify the factors that cause the differences among different groups. For the first time, this study makes an attempt using survey data, to examine the differences in the level of income and expenditure among chronically-ill people in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity (being unemployed due to the disability associated with the respective chronic illness), in the age category of 40-65, having an educational level of tertiary education or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. If workforce population is compelled to lose jobs, it can lead to income insecurity and impair their quality of lives. Under above findings, it is reasonable to assume that most health care expenses are out of pocket. Furthermore, the study infers that chronic illnesses have a statistically proven significant differences towards the income and expenditure level. This has caused due to the interaction of demographic and socio-economic characteristics associated with chronic illnesses. Considering private-public sector partnerships that enable affordable access to health care services for all as well as implementation of commercial insurance and community-based mutual services that help ease burden to the public, are vital when formulating effective policies and strategies related to the healthcare sector. Sri Lanka is making strong efforts to support its healthcare sector and public, which was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) in early 2020. Therefore, findings of this paper will be useful to gain insights on the differences of chronic illnesses towards the income and expenditure of chronically-ill patients in Sri Lanka.","Jayathilaka, Ruwan; Joachim, Sheron; Mallikarachchi, Venuri; Perera, Nishali; Ranawaka, Dhanushika",PLoS One,170,16

Clinical teams at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) needed resources for identifying and assimilating the medical literature regarding COVID-19, which was expanding and evolving daily. HMH leaders reached out to HMSOM leaders for assistance. The HMSOM leadership and faculty quickly organized a literature review elective. APPROACH: Eight second-year medical students participated in a literature review elective course to research and synthesize the COVID-19 clinical literature to provide synopses of best practices for various clinical teams. By March 23, students were searching the literature and writing reports independently, mentored by a senior dean (an infectious diseases specialist) and supported by the associate dean of libraries and library team. The library team updated and categorized student reports daily on a website dedicated to the elective. OUTCOMES: During the 6-week elective, 8 students produced 70 reports synthesizing the emerging COVID-19 literature to help answer practitioners' clinical questions in real time. One student report was posted on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. All 70 were published online in Elsevier's health education faculty hub. On course evaluations, students expressed regret about not being directly involved in patient care but articulated their gratitude to be able to contribute to the clinical teams. NEXT STEPS: In June 2020, the students returned to their clinical clerkships as COVID-19 clinical volumes declined and personal protective equipment became more available. Students continued to be available to the clinical teams to assist with COVID-19 questions. This literature review elective can serve as a model for other medical schools to use to deploy students to help synthesize the evolving literature on COVID-19 or other rapidly emerging research topics.","Boscamp, Jeffrey R; Duffy, Christopher P; Barsky, Carol; Stanton, Bonita F",Acad Med,170,15

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Seven musculoskeletal care centers within New York City and Long Island. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-eight recent and 115 historical hip fracture patients. INTERVENTION: Patients with hip fractures occurring between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2020, or between February 1, 2019, and April 15, 2019, were prospectively enrolled in an orthopaedic trauma registry and chart reviewed for demographic and hospital quality measures. Patients with recent hip fractures were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs), or COVID negative (C-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Hospital quality measures, inpatient complications, and mortality rates. RESULTS: Seventeen (12.2%) patients were confirmed C+ by testing, and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus but were never tested. The C+ cohort, when compared with Cs and C- cohorts, had an increased mortality rate (35.3% vs. 7.1% vs. 0.9%), increased length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate, and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the care of patients with hip fracture during the pandemic. Although practice patterns generally remained unchanged, treating physicians need to understand the increased morbidity and mortality in patients with hip fracture complicated by COVID-19.

We further screen the generated molecules by using a set of deep learning classifiers in conjunction with novel physicochemical features derived from high-throughput molecular simulations. The proposed approach is employed for designing non-toxic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with strong broad-spectrum potency, which are emerging drug candidates for tackling antibiotic resistance. Synthesis and wet lab testing of only twenty designed sequences identified two novel and minimalist AMPs with high potency against diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including the hard-to-treat multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, as well as low in vitro and in vivo toxicity. The proposed approach thus presents a viable path for faster discovery of potent and selective broad-spectrum antimicrobials with a higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods.","Das, Payel; Sercu, Tom; Wadhawan, Kahini; Padhi, Inkit; Gehrmann, Sebastian; Cipcigan, Flaviu; Chenthamarakshan, Vijil; Strobelt, Hendrik; Santos, Cicero dos; Chen, Pin-Yu; Yang, Yi Yan; Tan, Jeremy; Hedrick, James; Crain, Jason; Mojsilovic, Aleksandra",,170,29

Incompliance with infection control guidelines of healthcare workers (HCWs) may increase their risk of exposure to infectious disease, especially under pandemics. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of compliance with the infection prevention and control practices among HCWs in different healthcare settings and its relationship with their views on workplace infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Nurses in Hong Kong were invited to respond to a cross-sectional online survey, in which their views on workplace infection and prevention policy, compliance with standard precautions and self-reported health during pandemics were collected. Results: The respondents were dissatisfied with workplace infection and prevention policy in terms of comprehensiveness (62%), clarity (64%), timeliness (63%), and transparency (60%). For the protective behavior, the respondents did not fully comply with the standard precautions when they were involved in medical care. Their compliance was relatively low when having proper patient handling (54%) and performing invasive procedures (46%). A multivariate analysis model proved that the level of compliance of the standard precautions was positively associated with the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy among high risk group (0.020; 95% CI: 0.005-0.036), while older respondents had higher level of compliance among the inpatient and outpatient groups (coefficient range: 0.065-0.076). The higher level of compliance was also significantly associated with working in designated team and having chronic condition of the respondents among high-risk and inpatient groups. Conclusions: Standard precautions are the most important elements to reduce cross-transmission among HCWs and patients while the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy would increase the compliance among the high-risk group. An overall suboptimal compliance and poor views on the infection prevention and control guidelines is a warning signal to healthcare system especially during pandemics.","Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi; Ho, Kin-Fai; Dong, Dong; Cheung, Annie Wai-Ling; Yau, Peter Sen-Yung; Chan, Emily Ying-Yang; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Chien, Wai-Tong; Chen, Frank Youhua; Poon, Simon; Zhang, Qingpeng; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),170,1

As of 2 August 2020, 129,151 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, including 91,949 recovered cases and 4,867 deaths. After the announcement of lockdown in early April 2020, situation in Iraq was getting steady until late May 2020, when daily COVID-19 infections have raised suddenly due to gradual easing of lockdown restrictions. In this context, it is important to develop a forecasting model to evaluate the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq and so to guide future health policy. METHODS: COVID-19 lag data were made available by the University of Anbar through their online analytical platform (https://www.uoanbar.edu.iq/covid/), engaged with the day-to-day figures form the Iraqi health authorities. 154 days of patient data were provided covering the period from 2 March 2020 to 2 August 2020. An ensemble of feed-forward neural networks has been adopted to forecast COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. Also, this study highlights some key questions about this pandemic using data analytics. RESULTS: Forecasting were achieved with accuracy of 87.6% for daily infections, 82.4% for daily recovered cases, and 84.3% for daily deaths. It is anticipated that COVID-19 infections in Iraq will reach about 308,996 cases by the end of September 2020, including 228,551 to recover and 9,477 deaths. CONCLUSION: The applications of artificial neural networks supported by advanced data analytics represent a promising solution through which to realise intelligent solutions, enabling the space of analytical operations to drive a national health policy to contain COVID-19 pandemic.","Aljaaf, Ahmed J; Mohsin, Thakir M; Al-Jumeily, Dhiya; Alloghani, Mohamed",J Biomed Inform,170,16

The authors describe a new surgical strategy for LFS based on anatomical considerations using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT analysis. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 78 consecutive patients surgically treated for LFS at the lumbosacral junction (2013-2017). The location and extent of stenosis, including the narrowest site and associated pathology (bone or soft tissue), were measured using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT. Stenosis was defined as medial intervertebral foraminal (MF; inner edge to pedicle center), lateral intervertebral foraminal (LF; pedicle center to outer edge), or extraforaminal (EF; outside the pedicle). Lumbar (low-back pain, leg pain) and patient satisfaction visual analog scale (VAS) scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores were evaluated. Surgical outcome was evaluated 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: Most instances of stenosis existed outside the pedicle's center (94%), including LF (58%), EF (36%), and MF (6%). In all MF cases, stenosis resulted from soft-tissue structures. The narrowest stenosis sites were localized around the pedicle's outer border. The areas for sufficient nerve decompression were extended in MF+LF (10%), MF+LF+EF (14%), LF+EF (39%), LF (11%), and EF (26%). No iatrogenic pars interarticularis damage occurred. The JOA score was 14.9 ± 2.6 points preoperatively and 22.4 ± 3.5 points at 2 years postoperatively. The JOA recovery rate was 56.0% ± 18.6%. The VAS score (low-back and leg pain) was significantly improved 2 years postoperatively (p < 0.01). According to patients' self-assessment of the minimally invasive surgery, 62 (79.5%) chose ""surgery met my expectations"" at follow-up. Nine patients (11.5%) selected ""I did not improve as much as I had hoped but I would undergo the same surgery for the same outcome."" CONCLUSIONS: Most LFS existed outside the pedicle's center and was rarely noted in the pars region. The main regions of stenosis were localized to the pedicle's outer edge. Considering this anatomical distribution of LFS, the authors recommend that lateral fenestration should be the first priority for foraminal decompression. Other surgical options including foraminotomy, total facetectomy, and hemilaminectomy likely require more bone resections than LFS treatment. The microendoscopic surgery results were very good, indicating that this minimally invasive surgery was suitable for treating this disease.","Murata, Shizumasa; Minamide, Akihito; Iwasaki, Hiroshi; Nakagawa, Yukihiro; Hashizume, Hiroshi; Yukawa, Yasutsugu; Tsutsui, Shunji; Takami, Masanari; Okada, Motohiro; Nagata, Keiji; Yoshida, Munehito; Schoenfeld, Andrew J; Simpson, Andrew K; Yamada, Hiroshi",J Neurosurg Spine,170,16

This case study is compared to the findings compiled at the 2018 conference ""To Boldly Preserve: Archiving for the Next Half-Century of Spaceflight."" The findings of this conference found that collecting space history is often fragmented by three factors: early space actors are in the twilight of their careers and loss of historical memories and materials is imminent, there is a vast expansion of the number of actors in the space industry which makes collection more difficult, and that the digital age has changed both the nature of the material and the methods by which LAMS collect them. Libraries, Archives, and Museums (LAMs) can and should develop a collaborative approach to collecting space history and ensure that acquisition and preservation of these materials goes beyond one small step and is instead one giant leap.","Grimsley, Reagan L",Acta astronaut,170,16

However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combining a diverse set of individual prediction models, ensemble method can synergise a robust and well-performing model by choosing the most competent ones for individual patients.","Wu, Honghan; Zhang, Huayu; Karwath, Andreas; Ibrahim, Zina; Shi, Ting; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Kun; Sun, Jiaxing; Dhaliwal, Kevin; Bean, Daniel; Cardoso, Victor Roth; Li, Kezhi; Teo, James T; Banerjee, Amitava; Gao-Smith, Fang; Whitehouse, Tony; Veenith, Tonny; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Wu, Xiaodong; Dobson, Richard; Guthrie, Bruce",J. am. med. inform. assoc,170,24

METHODS: We carried out a prospective multicentre cohort study based on 32 CF centres and 6597 patients. Centres were contacted to collect baseline and follow-up data of patients who reported symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or who had contact with a positive/suspected case between the end of February and July 2020. Symptoms and clinical course of the infection were compared between patients who tested positive by molecular testing (cases) and those who tested negative (controls). RESULTS: Thirty patients were reported from the centres, 16 of them tested positive and 14 tested negative. No differences in symptoms and outcome of the disease were observed between groups. Fever, cough, asthenia and dyspnea were the most frequently reported symptoms. Eight cases (50%) were hospitalized but none required ICU admission. Two adults with a history of lung transplant required non-invasive ventilation, none required ICU admission and all patients fully recovered without short-term sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The course of SARS-CoV-2 in our patients was relatively favorable. However, COVID-19 should not be considered a mild disease in CF patients, particularly for those with severely impaired respiratory function and organ transplant.","Colombo, Carla; Alicandro, Gianfranco; Daccó, Valeria; Gagliano, Vanessa; Morlacchi, Letizia Corinna; Casciaro, Rosaria; Pisi, Giovanna; Francalanci, Michela; Badolato, Raffaele; Bignamini, Elisabetta; Messore, Barbara; Lucanto, Maria Cristina; Leonetti, Giuseppina; Maschio, Massimo; Cipolli, Marco",PLoS One,170,20

Given the fact that pollution will increase as social distancing rules are relaxed, we summarized the current understanding of how air pollution may affect COVID-19 transmission and discussed several possible mechanisms. Air pollution exposure can dysregulate the human immune response and make people more susceptible to infections, and affect infectivity. For example, in response to exposure to air pollution, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 will increase, which is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This may increase the efficiency of viral infection. It is also possible that air pollution can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread by increasing the transmission, and potentially, SARS-CoV-2 can also survive longer when attached to a pollutant.","Wang, Baoming; Chen, Hui; Chan, Yik Lung; Oliver, Brian G",,170,20

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a questionnaire to assess attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. MethodsWe performed a reliability and validity study in a sample of the general population in Greece. Data were collected online through social media between 15 August and 7 September 2021. Thus, a convenience sample was obtained. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed with a Delphi study, an exploratory factor analysis, and a test-retest study. Also, we calculated Cronbachs coefficient alpha for the factors that emerged from the exploratory factor analysis. ResultsThe final study included 1959 adults from the general population in Greece. Our four-factor model explained 73% of the variance and confirmed out initial hypothesis regarding the factors of the questionnaire. In particular, we found the following four factors: (a) fear against the COVID-19 (five items), (b) information regarding the COVID-19 (two items), (c) compliance with hygiene measures (two items), and (d) trust in COVID-19 vaccination (seven items). Cronbachs coefficients alpha for the four factors that emerged from the exploratory factor analysis were greater than 0.82. Pearsons correlation coefficients for the 16 items and the four factors were greater than 0.67 (p-value<0.001 in all cases). ConclusionsWe developed a reliable and valid questionnaire to measure attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. Further studies should be conducted to expand our knowledge and infer more valid results.","Galanis, Petros A; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Moisoglou, Ioannis; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,170,22

We highlight some of the reasons why creating a 'transferable' model for an epidemic is harder than creating a transferable model for molecular simulations. We describe a simple model to illustrate the large effect of decreasing the number of social contacts on the suppression of outbreaks of an infectious disease. Although we do not aim to model the COVID19 pandemic, we choose model parameter values that are not unrealistic for COVID19. We hope to provide some intuitive insight in the role of social distancing. As our calculations are almost analytical, they allow us to understand some of the key factors influencing the spread of a disease. We argue that social distancing is particularly powerful for diseases that have a fat tail in the number of infected persons per primary case. Our results illustrate that a 'bad' feature of the COVID19 pandemic, namely that super-spreading events are important for its spread, could make it particularly sensitive to truncating the number of social contacts.","Wang, X.

In this study, three RT-ddPCR assays (N1, N2, N3) were used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in weekly samples from nine WWTPs in southeastern Virginia. In the first several weeks of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 detections were sporadic. Frequency of detections and overall concentrations of RNA within samples increased from mid March into late July. During the twenty-one week study, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 101 to 104 copies 100 mL-1 in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, it is likely that communities will see increased incidence of small, localized outbreaks.

The new suspected cases of COVID-19 data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We used the lagged series of SMSI to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers during this period. To avoid overfitting, five methods, namely subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, were used to estimate coefficients. We selected the optimal method to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We further validated the optimal method for new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 31 December 2019 to 17 February 2020.

The optimal method was the subset selection method, which had the lowest estimation error and a moderate number of predictors. The subset selection method also significantly correlated with the new confirmed COVID-19 cases after validation. SMSI findings on lag day 10 were significantly correlated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. SMSI could be a significant predictor of the number of COVID-19 infections. SMSI could be an effective early predictor, which would enable governments' health departments to locate potential and high-risk outbreak areas.","Qin, Lei; Sun, Qiang; Wang, Yidan; Wu, Ke-Fei; Chen, Mingchih; Shia, Ben-Chang; Wu, Szu-Yuan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),170,24

Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated the effects of the most prominent determining factors on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy) or within residential areas, and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases for public mobility in retail and recreational areas or workplaces, awareness measured by searches for ""corona"" in Google, higher rainfall, and some socio-demographic factors. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were found to be effective in reducing case numbers. This comprehensive causal graph analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","Steiger, Edgar; Mussgnug, Tobias; Kroll, Lars Eric",PLoS One,170,24

Although patient cells can directly model the effects of a drug, their availability and capacity for expansion are limited compared with transformed/immortalized cells or tumor-derived cell lines. An additional caveat is that the latter may harbor genetic and metabolic abnormalities making them unsuitable for drug screening. Therefore, it is important to create physiologically relevant human-cell models that can replicate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, thus facilitating drug testing.

The effects of some structural characteristics of gambling activities that increase gambling behavior were studied among disordered gamblers in treatment in this unique scenario. In fact, studies investigating the effects of the lockdown on problem gamblers (PGs) under treatment are missing. The aims of this study were to analyze patients' gambling behavior and craving during the lockdown and to conduct a comparison between gambling disorder (GD) symptoms at the beginning of the treatment and during lockdown. The study was conducted in Italy, the European country with the largest gambling market and the first to be affected by the virus. Data were collected through a semi-structured telephone interview conducted by healthcare professionals. Participants were 135 PGs under treatment (109 males, mean age = 50.07). Results showed that most PGs achieved a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less gambling behavior, GD symptoms, and lower craving. No shift toward online gambling and very limited shift towards other potential addictive and excessive behaviors occurred. The longer the treatment, the more monitoring is present and the better the results in terms of symptoms reduction. Individual and environmental characteristics during the lockdown favored the reduction in symptoms.

Sweden is uniquely suited for our study because the voluntary nature of lockdown in Sweden allowed us to assess the level of compliance to recommendations and its effects on greenhouse gas emissions. First, we assessed the change of perceived quality of life (QOL) among 746 individuals from Stockholm region due to adhering to lockdown measures.

DESIGN: Observational study conducted from 21 April to 6 May 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. SETTING: Research conducted in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy). PARTICIPANTS: Out of 2195 eligible participants, 1961 healthcare workers with the full range of professional profiles (89.3%) completed the survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Levels of burn-out, assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burn-out in each MBI-GS dimension (emotional exhaustion, EX; professional efficacy, EF; cynicism, CY). RESULTS: Overall, 38.3% displayed high EX, 46.5% low EF and 26.5% high CY. Burn-out was frequent among staff working in intensive care units (EX 57.0%; EF 47.8%; CY 40.1%), and among residents (EX 34.9%; EF 63.9%; CY 33.4%) and nurses (EX 49.2%; EF 46.9%; CY 29.7%). Being a resident increased the risk of burn-out (by nearly 2.5 times) in all the three MBI subscales and being a nurse increased the risk of burn-out in the EX dimension in comparison to physicians. Healthcare staff directly engaged with patients with COVID-19 showed more EX and CY than those working in non-COVID wards. Finally, the risk of burn-out was higher in staff showing pre-existing psychological problems, in those having experienced a COVID-related traumatic event and in those having experienced interpersonal avoidance in the workplace and personal life. CONCLUSIONS: Burn-out represents a great concern for healthcare staff working in a large tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact is more burdensome for front-line junior physicians. This study underlines the need to carefully address psychological well-being of healthcare workers to prevent the increase of burn-out in the event of a new COVID-19 healthcare emergency.","Lasalvia, Antonio; Amaddeo, Francesco; Porru, Stefano; Carta, Angela; Tardivo, Stefano; Bovo, Chiara; Ruggeri, Mirella; Bonetto, Chiara",BMJ Open,170,6

Considering party manifestos between 1991 and 2018, we ask: how have Quebec major political parties treated immigration policy issues over time? We argue that Quebec's immigration partisan space is organised by a liberal-restrictive immigration policy continuum and a jurisdictional axis. Mapping provincial political parties' positions, we document a stable clustering towards liberal policy positions but a clear cleavage on the jurisdictional axis. We show that the emergence in 2012 of a highly moderate centre right party-the Coalition Avenir Québec-broke with these established positions and drove a politicisation of the issue.

METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/mL; intensive care: 59.5 U/mL) than in outpatients (3.8 U/mL; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity. Further harmonization of antibody quantification might assist to monitor the humoral immune response after COVID-19 disease or vaccination.","Irsara, Christian; Egger, Alexander E; Prokop, Wolfgang; Nairz, Manfred; Loacker, Lorin; Sahanic, Sabina; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Thomas; Holzer, Barbara; Mayer, Wolfgang; Schennach, Harald; Loeffler-Ragg, Judith; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Hartmann, Boris; Tancevski, Ivan; Weiss, Günter; Binder, Christoph J; Anliker, Markus; Griesmacher, Andrea; Hoermann, Gregor",Clin Chem Lab Med,170,20

We adopted a patient-tailored thromboprophylaxis protocol based on clinical and laboratory presentations for these patients in our institution. We hypothesised that patients who received high-intensity thromboprophylaxis treatment would experience fewer thrombotic events. The aims of our study were to explore the incidence of thrombotic events in this population; to assess independent factors associated with thrombotic events and to evaluate the incidence of haemorrhagic events. A retrospective review of all adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March and 29 May 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of venous and arterial thrombotic events diagnosed during the ICU stay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the independent factors associated with thrombotic events. A total of 188 patients met the inclusion criteria. All received some type of thromboprophylaxis treatment except for six patients who did not receive any prophylaxis. Of the 182 patients who received thromboprophylaxis, 75 (40%) received high-intensity thromboprophylaxis and 24 (12.8%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. Twenty-one patients (11.2%) experienced 23 thrombotic events (incidence rate of 12.2% (95%CI 7.9-17.8)), including 12 deep venous thromboses, 9 pulmonary emboli and 2 peripheral arterial thromboses. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that only D-dimer (OR 2.80, p = 0.002) and high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen (OR 0.20, p = 0.01) were independently associated with thrombotic events. Thirty-one patients (16.5%) experienced haemorrhagic events; among them, 13 were classified as major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Therapeutic anticoagulation, but not the high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen, was associated with major bleeding. A proactive approach to the management of thromboembolism in critically ill COVID-19 patients utilising a high-intensity thromboprophylaxis regimen in appropriately selected patients may result in lower thrombotic events without increasing the risk of bleeding.","Atallah, B; Sadik, Z G; Salem, N; El Nekidy, W S; Almahmeed, W; Park, W M; Cherfan, A; Hamed, F; Mallat, J",Anaesthesia (Lond.),170,7

Currently, during the second wave, the situation is still far from normality. Here we describe the changes that took place, and are still ongoing, in the clinical practice. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients activity, ER and urgent procedures in SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients have been analyzed over seven weeks (October 26th-December 13th, 2020) and compared with the correspondent period in 2019 and the same timeframe during the first wave (February 24th-April 10th). RESULTS: 2019 vs. 2020: Overall admissions decreased by 39.8%; however, while admissions for elective surgery dropped by 42.0%, urgent surgeries increased by 117.0%. Rehabilitation admissions declined by 85.2%. White and green priority ER consultations declined by 41.6% and 52.0%, respectively; yellow and red increased by 766.7% and 400.0%, respectively. Second vs. first wave: Overall admissions increased by 58.6% with a smoother decrement in weekly admissions than during the first wave. Disparity of acute admissions vs. rehabilitation expanded: Acute cases increased by 63.6% while rehabilitation cases decreased by 8.7%. Admissions to triage procedures increased by 72.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Activity levels are far from normality during the second COVID-19 wave. Elective surgery and outpatients-related activities are still strongly limited compared to 2019 while the number of urgent cases treated increased consistently. SARS-CoV-2 positive emergencies are slightly higher than during the first wave.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 301 pneumonic lesions (150 ground-glass opacity [GGO], 52 crazy paving [CP], 99 consolidation) obtained from nonenhanced thorax CT scans of 74 AP (46 male and 28 female; 48.25±13.67 years) and 60 COVID-19 (39 male and 21 female; 48.01±20.38 years) patients were segmented manually by two independent radiologists, and Location, Size, Shape, and First- and Second-order radiomics features were calculated. RESULTS: Multiple parameters showed significant differences between AP and COVID-19-related GGOs and consolidations, although only the Range parameter was significantly different for CPs. Models developed by using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for the whole group of GGO and consolidation lesions predicted COVID-19 consolidation and AP GGO lesions with low accuracy (46.1% and 60.8%, respectively). Thus, instead of subjective classification, lesions were reclassified according to their skewness into positive skewness group (PSG, 78 AP and 71 COVID-19 lesions) and negative skewness group (NSG, 56 AP and 44 COVID-19 lesions), and group-specific models were created. The best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were respectively 0.774, 75.8%, 74.6%, and 76.9% among the PSG models and 0.907, 83%, 79.5%, and 85.7% for the NSG models. The best PSG model was also better at predicting NSG lesions smaller than 3 mL. Using an algorithm, 80% of COVID-19 and 81.1% of AP patients were correctly predicted. CONCLUSION: During periods of increasing AP, radiomics parameters may provide valuable data for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19.","Gülbay, Mutlu; Özbay, Bahadir Orkun; Mendi, Bökebatur Ahmet Rasit; Bastug, Aliye; Bodur, Hürrem",PLoS One,170,24

As communities shut down to reduce disease spread, all aspects of life have been altered, including sleep. This study investigated changes in sleep patterns and correlates of sleep health in a global sample and examined relationships between sleep health and psychological distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTINGS: Online survey distributed between April 19 and May 3, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Total 6882 participants (18-94 years) across 59 countries. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep health (RU-SATED), demographics, pandemic-related factors, mood. RESULTS: More than half the sample shifted their sleep toward later bed- and wake-times, and more than a third reported increased sleep disturbances during the pandemic. Older age, being partnered, and living in a higher income country were associated with better sleep health, while a stricter level of quarantine and pandemic-related factors (being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties transitioning to working from home) were associated with poorer sleep health. Domestic conflict was the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health. Poorer sleep health was strongly associated with greater depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants from Latin America reported the lowest sleep health scores. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated factors have impacted sleep health on a global level. While our data are correlational, sleep health is strongly linked with mental health and could play a protective role against developing mental distress during pandemic-related isolation. Sleep health should be incorporated into public health messages aimed at helping people cope with the effects of a pandemic to maintain optimal mental and physical health.","Yuksel, Dilara; McKee, Grace B.; Perrin, Paul B.; Alzueta, Elisabet; Caffarra, Sendy; Ramos-Usuga, Daniela; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; Baker, Fiona C.",Sleep Health,170,1

METHODS: In a manikin study paramedics and emergency physicians performed Advanced-Cardiac-Life-Support in three settings: ERC guidelines 2015 (Control), COVID-19-guidelines as suggested with minimum staff (COVID-19-minimal-personnel); COVID-19-guidelines with paramedics and an emergency physician (COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager). Main outcome measures were no-flow-time, quality metrics as defined by ERC and time intervals to first chest compression, oxygen supply, intubation and first rhythm analysis. Data were presented as mean±standard deviation. RESULTS: Thirty resuscitation scenarios were completed. No-flow-time was markedly prolonged in COVID-19-minimal-personnel [113±37sec] compared to Control [55±9sec] and COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager [76±38sec](p<0.001 each). In both COVID-19-groups chest compressions started later [COVID-19-minimal-personnel:32±6sec; COVID-19-advancedairway-manager:37±7sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (21±5sec)], but oxygen supply [COVID-19-minimal-personnel:29±5sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:34±7sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (77±19sec)] and first intubation attempt [COVID-19-minimalpersonnel: 111±14sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:131±20sec; each p<0.001 vs. Control (178±44sec)] were performed earlier. However, time interval to successful intubation was similar [Control:198±48sec; COVID-19-minimal-personnel:181±42sec; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager:130±25sec] due to a longer intubation time in COVID-19-minimalpersonnel [61±35sec] compared to COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager (p=0.002) and control [19±6sec;p<0.001]. Time to first rhythm analysis was more than doubled in COVID-19-minimal-personnel [138±96sec] compared to control [50±12sec;p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed chest compressions and prolonged no-flow-time markedly reduced the quality of resuscitation. These negative effects were attenuated by increasing the number of staff and by adding an experienced airway manager. The use of endotracheal intubation for reducing aerosol release during resuscitation should be discussed critically as its priorization is associated with an increase in no-flow-time.","Jansen, Gerrit; Ebeling, Nicole; Latka, Eugen; Krüger, Stefan; Scholz, Sean S; Trapp, Simon; Granneman, Julia J; Thaemel, Daniel; Chandwani, Suraj; Sauzet, Odile; Rehberg, Sebastian W; Borgstedt, Rainer",Minerva anestesiol,170,1

Here, we describe the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) regularly followed at a reference center in Northern Italy. The study period started from COVID-19 outbreak (February 22, 2020) until the time of writing. Moreover, we provide a review of the literature, showing that most cases reported so far are AIC developed during or secondary to COVID-19 infection. At variance, data about AIC pre-existing to COVID infection are scanty. The 4 patients here described (2 autoimmune hemolytic anemias, AIHA, 1 Evans syndrome, and 1 immune thrombocytopenia) with COVID-19 pneumonia belong to a large cohort of 500 AIC patients, making this study nearly population-based. The observed frequency (4/501; 0.7%) is only slightly superior to that of the general population admitted to hospital/intensive care unit (0.28/0.03%, respectively) in Lombardy in the same period of observation. All cases occurred between March 21 and 25, whilst no more AIC were recorded later on. Although different in intensity of care needed, all patients recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, with apparently no detrimental effect of previous/current immunomodulatory treatments. AIHA relapse occurred in two patients, but promptly responded to therapy. With limitations due to sample size, these results suggest a favorable outcome and a lower-than-expected incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with previously diagnosed AIC, and allow speculating that immunomodulatory drugs used for AIC may play a beneficial rather than a harmful effect on COVID-19 infection.","Barcellini, Wilma; Giannotta, Juri Alessandro; Fattizzo, Bruno",Front Immunol,170,20

Europe is not an equidistant observer of this conflict: European views of China have become much more critical, particularly with regard to human rights, China’s increasingly assertive regional posture and its perceived attempts to export its authoritarian political model. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased rather than mitigated mistrust. For Europe, the idea of “decoupling” from China is not an option. Rather Europe is developing its own instruments for a more coordinated China policy.

However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and ϕ6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and ϕ6 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1% (±3.6%) and 18.2% (±9.5%) for the enveloped MHV and ϕ6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6% (±16.7%) and 85.5% (±24.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively.

Very recently, the COVID-19 outbreak has exposed the lack of quick approaches for screening people who may have risen risk of pathogen contact. One proposed non-invasive potential approach to recognize the viral infection is analysis of exhaled gases. It has been indicated that the nitric oxide is one of most important biomarkers which might be emanated by respiratory epithelial cells. Using density functional theory calculations, here, we introduced a novel Au-decorated BN nanotube-based breathalyzer for probable recognition of NO gas released from the respiratory epithelial cells in the presence of interfering CO(2) and H(2)O gases. This breathalyzer benefits from different advantages including high sensitivity (sensing response = 101.5), high selectivity, portability, short recovery time (1.8 μs at 298 K), and low cost.","Ge, Chenjiao; Li, Mingli; Li, Mingxuan; Peyghan, Ali Ahmadi",J Mol Liq,170,23

The debate scene was established numerically, and two cases, i.e., only Trump being infected and both Trump and the first lady being infected, were set up for risk analysis. The infection probabilities at different positions were assessed by using the Wells–Riley equation with consideration of the effects of air distribution and face mask. It was concluded that (1) the infection risks of Biden and Wallace were lower due to the reasonable distance from Trump, with the maximum probability of 0.34% at 40 quanta/h for both Trump and the first lady being infected; (2) the infection probabilities in the audience area were lower for the long distance from the debate stage, with the maximum probability of 0.35%. Wearing masks resulted in a notable decrease in the infection probability to 0.09%; and (3) there was a certain local area surrounding Trump and the first lady with a relatively greater infection probability. The preliminary analysis provides some reference for protection of the next presidential debate and other public events.","Shao, Xiaoliang; Li, Xianting",Phys Fluids (1994),170,1

Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (−52.68%) and CO (−30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","Mahato, Susanta; Pal, Swades; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal",Sci Total Environ,170,16

Few alternative simple assays are available to follow up disease activity. Considering that the disease can remain elusive for years, identification of antibodies fluctuating in biological fluids as relevant biomarkers of immune response is a challenge. In previous studies, we reported that anti-N-glucosylated (N-Glc) peptide antibodies that can be easily detected in Solid-Phase Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (SP-ELISA) on MS patients’ sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin of non-typeable Haemophilus Influenzae. Since multivalency can be useful for diagnostic purposes to allow an efficient coating in ELISA, we report herein the development of a collection of Multiple N-glucosylated Peptide Epitopes (N-Glc MEPs) to detect anti-N-Glc antibodies in MS. To this aim, a series of N-Glc peptide antigens to be represented in the N-GlcMEPs were tested in competitive ELISA. We confirmed that the epitope recognized by antibodies shall contain at least 5-mer sequences including the fundamental N-Glc moiety. Using a 4-branched dendrimeric lysine scaffold, we selected the N-Glc MEP 24, carrying the minimal epitope Asn(Glc) anchored to a polyethylene glycol-based spacer (PEG) containing a 19-atoms chain, as an efficient multivalent probe to reveal specific and high affinity anti-N-Glc antibodies in MS.","Nuti, Francesca; Fernandez, Feliciana Real; Sabatino, Giuseppina; Peroni, Elisa; Mulinacci, Barbara; Paolini, Ilaria; Pisa, Margherita Di; Tiberi, Caterina; Lolli, Francesco; Petruzzo, Martina; Lanzillo, Roberta; Morra, Vincenzo Brescia; Rovero, Paolo; Papini, Anna Maria",Brain Sci,170,20

Therapeutic communication is essential for assessing the quality of patients’ care. The present study aimed to assess how the forced use of the mask influenced the communication before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS. An online questionnaire was administered including two socio-demographic items, such as sex, as male and female, and role, as nurse or patient, and the Quality of Communication Questionnaire (QOC) for twice, referring to the period before and during the pandemic. RESULTS. 178 subjects participated in the study, of which 60 (33.7%) were patients and 118 (66.3%) were nurses. During the pandemic, patients reported no significant differences in the perception of the quality of nurse-patient communication. While nurses recorded a lower perception of communication quality during the pandemic period than before. CONCLUSIONS. The patient willingly accepted the use of the face mask unlike nurses considered it a further obstacle to an effective communication between nurse-patient. However, it could be considered the emotional and caring overload that each nurse had stored during the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the fear of contagion that had gripped the lives of nurses on a daily basis.","Vitale, Elsa; Giammarinaro, Maria Pia; Lupo, Roberto; Fortunato, Rosa Silvia; Archetta, Valeria; Caldararo, Cosimo; Germini, Francesco",Acta Biomed,170,9

Aim: We evaluated the impact of an infectious disease specialist (IDS) on implementing an ASP in a resource-limited setting in Korea. Methods: A retrospective study was performed at a NAC hospital between June 2015 and August 2018. An IDS has led an ASP at the hospital since June 2017. We used an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate longitudinal effects of the IDS-led ASP on the amount of antibiotic use and incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) acquisition. Findings: Total antibiotic use changed from 698.82 ± 74.41 to 602.09 ± 69.94 defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (PDs) after intervention. An immediate reduction in the use of carbapenems, glycopeptides, penicillins, and other antibiotics followed the IDS-led ASP. The 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems prescription rates decreased in slope after the intervention. Incidence of MDRO acquisition changed from 1.38, 0.78, and 0.21/1000 PDs to 1.06, 0.15, and 0.32/1000 PDs in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii acquisition immediately decreased following intervention. Conclusion: An IDS can implement a successful ASP by reducing antibiotic consumption and MDRO acquisition at resource-limited NAC hospitals.","Kim, Yong Chan; Kim, Eun Jin; Heo, Jung Yeon; Choi, Young Hwa; Ahn, Jin Young; Jeong, Su Jin; Ku, Nam Su; Choi, Jun Yong; Yeom, Joon-sup; Kim, Ha Yan",J Clin Med,170,21

We sought to estimate the incidence of TKR using demographics, incidence rates, lengths of hospital stay, and costs from 1996 to 2010 by analyzing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 154,553 patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were selected from the records. To compare the rate of TKR between covariables, we calculated the TKR risk ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) of these variables (gender, age, age group, and primary diagnoses). A 2-tailed P-value of .05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical package SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all the statistical analyzes. We analyzed 154,553 TKRs performed by surgeons in Taiwan from 1996 to 2010. The overall crude incidence increased from 26.4 to 74.55 TKR per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2010. TKR incidence for the 70 to 79 years age group increased from 227 to 505 per 100,000 people from 1996 to 2010. The age-standardized rate ratios for TKR of women to men ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. The mean average length of stay in hospital was 15 days in 1996 and decreased to 8 days in 2010. During the study period, the adjusted mean cost per patient decreased from US$7485 to US$4827. Health expenditures for TKR were 5% of total National Health Insurance expenditure every year. Over the 15-year period, Taiwan's TKR incidence tripled, which is consistent with population ageing.

There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on. METHODS The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question 'What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?', which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial social distancing measures. RESULTS 7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or 'other' lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: 1) vulnerability to COVID-19; 2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; 3) wide-reaching uncertainty; and 4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect objective, as well as subjective, aspects of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include i) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; ii) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, iii) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, iv) improving the government and healthcare response.","Philip, K.

Assessing the severity of the disease for worsening patients is of importance in making decisions related to supportive mechanical ventilation and aggressive treatments. This was a prospective, non-randomized study that included hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID19. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed during hospitalization, and we calculated a prediction paradigm for 30-day mortality based on the serum levels of interleukin1β (IL1β), interleukin6 (IL6), interleukin8 (IL8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) measured by next-generation ELISA. Data of 71 COVID19 patients, mean age 62 years, SD13.8, 50 males, 21 females, were analyzed. Twelve (16.9%) patients died within 7–39 days of their first COVID19 positive nasopharyngeal test. Levels of IL6 and TNFα were significantly higher in patients that did not survive. IL6 predicted mortality at the cut-off value of 163.4 pg/ml, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 57.6%.

Objective To measure burnout and describe the work and psychosocial factors affecting pharmacists during COVID-19, and to compare males and females. Setting An online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists practicing in any setting in Australia during April and June 2020. Method The survey collected demographic data, burnout scores using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), psychosocial and work-related variables using questions adapted from previous surveys. It was tested for readability by a group of pharmacists and academic clinicians before distribution via social media and professional organisations. Main outcome measure Burnout was calculated using mean MBI scores, descriptive statistics were used to report work and psychosocial variables and Pearson’s chi-square compared males and females. Results Overall, 647 responses were analysed. Most participants were female n = 487 (75.7%) with hospital n = 269 (42.2%) and community n = 253 (39.9%) pharmacists well represented. Mean (SD) for emotional exhaustion (possible range 0–54) and depersonalisation (possible range 0–30) were 28.5 (13.39) and 7.98 (5.64), which were higher (increased burnout) than reported pre-COVID-19. Personal accomplishment (range 0–48, lower scores associated with burnout) mean (SD) 36.58 (7.56), was similar to previously reported. Males reported higher depersonalisation indicating more withdrawal and cynicism. Working overtime, medication supply and patient incivility were reported to affect work. Conclusion Pharmacists are experiencing burnout, with work and psychosocial factors affecting them during COVID-19. Knowledge of this and that males experience more depersonalisation is valuable to inform advocacy and interventions to support pharmacists.","Johnston, Karlee; O’Reilly, Claire L.; Scholz, Brett; Georgousopoulou, Ekavi N.; Mitchell, Imogen",Int J Clin Pharm,170,7

In this situation, healthcare workers experienced high levels of stress, anxiety and depression due to the heavy workload and working conditions. Although Spain experienced a progressive decline in the number of COVID-19 cases until the last week of May (when a flattening of the case curve was achieved) and the work overload among health workers was substantially reduced, several studies have shown that this work overload is associated with the later emergence of psychological symptoms induced by stress. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and compassionate fatigue in health professionals. The sample consisted of 973 health professionals 16.5% men, 82.9% women, and one non-binary person. The data were collected through an online questionnaire sent to the participants by e-mail. DASS-21 was used to measure anxiety, stress and depression, PCL-C to measure post-traumatic stress and ProQOL -vIV to measure compassion fatigue. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to these levels of psychological symptomatology were evaluated. The results reveal that after the work overload experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers report psychological symptoms, post-traumatic stress and compassion fatigue. It is therefore recommended that these professionals be provided with psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of COVID-19, and consequently improve their mental health.","Dosil, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo, Iratxe; Picaza, Maitane; Jaureguizar, Joana",Front Psychol,170,29

Several different patterns of serologic response to VIT were seen; some subjects had a dominant IgG(4) response, some had a combined IgG(4) and IgG(1) response, and some had an exclusively IgG(1) response. In some subjects specific IgE levels increased during the induction phase and then decreased, whereas in others specific IgE levels progressively decreased from the start of VIT. CONCLUSION: Advax adjuvant favorably enhanced the immunogenicity of HBVIT, with an early and prolonged switch to specific IgG(4) production. The ability of Advax adjuvant to enhance VIT efficacy warrants further study.","Heddle, Robert; Smith, Anthony; Woodman, Richard; Hissaria, Pravin; Petrovsky, Nikolai",J Allergy Clin Immunol,170,1

Arteriviruses and coronaviruses are grouped together in the order Nidovirales, based on similarities in genome organization and expression strategy. Over the past decade, crystal structures of several viral proteins, electron microscopic studies of the virion, as well as biochemical and in vivo studies on protein–protein interactions have led to a greatly increased understanding of PRRSV structural biology. At this point, crystal structures are available for the viral proteases NSP1α, NSP1β and NSP4 and the nucleocapsid protein, N. The NSP1α and NSP1β structures have revealed additional non-protease domains that may be involved in modulation of host functions. The N protein forms a dimer with a novel fold so far only seen in PRRSV and other nidoviruses. Cryo-electron tomographic studies have shown the three-dimensional organization of the PRRSV virion and suggest that the viral nucleocapsid has an asymmetric, linear arrangement, rather than the isometric core previously described. Together, these studies have revealed a closer structural relationship between arteri- and coronaviruses than previously anticipated.","Dokland, Terje",Virus Res,170,16

We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. SUMMARY: Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.","Striley, Catherine W.; Hoeflich, Carolin C.",Curr Opin Psychiatry,170,1

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. RESULTS: 15 International publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients’ COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing the use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.","Radulesco, Thomas; Lechien, Jerome R.; Sowerby, Leigh J.; Saussez, Sven; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Sargi, Zoukaa; Lavigne, Philippe; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Lim, Chwee Ming; Tangjaturonrasme, Napadon; Vatanasapt, Patravoot; Puya, Dehgani-Mobaraki; Fakhry, Nicolas; Ayad, Tareck; Michel, Justin",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,170,28

Reliable and accurate short and long-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths, both at the national and provincial level, are a key aspect of the strategy to handle the COVID-19 epidemic in the country. METHODS: In this paper we apply the previously validated approach of phenomenological models, fitting several non-linear growth curves (Richards, 3 and 4 parameter logistic, Weibull and Gompertz), to produce short term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the national level as well as the provincial level. Using publicly available daily reported cumulative case and death data up until 22 June 2020, we report 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30-day ahead forecasts of cumulative cases and deaths. All predictions are compared to the actual observed values in the forecasting period. RESULTS: We observed that all models for cases provided accurate and similar short-term forecasts for a period of 5 days ahead at the national level, and that the three and four parameter logistic growth models provided more accurate forecasts than that obtained from the Richards model 10 days ahead. However, beyond 10 days all models underestimated the cumulative cases. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 23,551–26,702 cases in 5 days and an additional 47,449–57,358 cases in 10 days. While the three parameter logistic growth model provided the most accurate forecasts of cumulative deaths within the 10 day period, the Gompertz model was able to better capture the changes in cumulative deaths beyond this period. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 145–437 COVID-19 deaths in 5 days and an additional 243–947 deaths in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing both the predictions of deaths and cases to the observed data in the forecasting period, we found that this modeling approach provides reliable and accurate forecasts for a maximum period of 10 days ahead.

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychosocial status of informal caregivers of community-dwelling adults over an eight-year period. Informal caregivers of adult care-recipients were identified from Wave 1 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) cohort. Multivariate regression analysis models were constructed to assess the association between participant’s psychosocial characteristics and informal caregiving. Multilevel modelling explored the psychosocial changes between caregivers and non-caregivers over eight years. 1375 informal caregivers and 2750 age-matched non-caregivers were analyzed. Self-reported loneliness (Odd Ratio (OR): 0.26; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01–0.51) and relationship status (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16–0.46) were independently associated with caregiving. Caregivers were more socially isolated with less holidaying abroad (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35–0.66), attendance to church (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11–0.49), or charity groups (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.14–0.55). On multilevel analysis, over time (eight-years), caregivers reported greater loneliness (p < 0.01), change in relationship status (p = 0.01) and reduced control, autonomy, and pleasure (p ≤ 0.01) compared to non-caregivers. Given the deleterious effects caregiving can place on health and wellbeing, further interventions are required to improve these psychosocial factors.","Smith, Toby; Saunders, Amanda; Heard, Jay",Geriatrics (Basel),170,24

This sudden change in the dental education program may have affected the academic standards of dental students. This study aimed to evaluate the overall satisfaction and effectiveness of online learning in pediatric dentistry of undergraduate dental students’ during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was sent to three dental schools, and responses were collected from dental school students. Questions included the demographics, perspectives of online classes, comparison of online and offline pediatric dentistry classes and opinions on how dental schools are handling the pandemic. Students’ perspectives on online classes were evaluated based on satisfaction with online education. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Most students took online classes from home (80.9%) using Zoom (50.4%). The majority reported overall program satisfaction (74.1%) and agreed that universities implemented online classes well (55%). Students who were in favor of online classes responded more positively to questions on the effectiveness and safety of online learning (p < 0.05). Regardless of satisfaction with online education, the students agreed that the online education shift was the right decision in pandemic outbreak.

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through binding and internalization of the viral spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels.

In this 3-month follow-up study, we examined discharged patients who had received hUC-MSC therapy to assess the safety of this therapy and the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of these patients. The follow-up cohort consisted of 28 discharged severe COVID-19 patients who received either the standard treatment (the control group) or the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC therapy. We examined liver function, kidney function, pulmonary function, coagulation, tumor markers, and vision. We also conducted electrocardiography (ECG) analysis, let the patients answer the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and performed computed tomography (CT) imaging for assessing the lung changes. No obvious adverse effects were observed in the hUC-MSC group after 3 months. Measurements of blood routine index, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, liver and kidney function, coagulation, ECG, tumor markers, and vision were almost within the normal ranges in both the treatment and control groups.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients’ clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin colonization. The median age was 64 years (14–88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients.

To inform policymaking to address children's mental health in high-income countries we aimed to identify updated data on disorder prevalence. METHODS We identified epidemiological studies reporting mental disorder prevalence in representative samples of children aged 18 years or younger-including a range of disorders and ages and assessing impairment (searching January 1990 through February 2021). We extracted associated service-use data where studies assessed this. We conducted meta-analyses using a random effects logistic model (using R metafor package). FINDINGS Fourteen studies in 11 countries met inclusion criteria, published from 2003 to 2020 with a pooled sample of 61 545 children aged 4-18 years, including eight reporting service use. (All data were collected pre-COVID-19.) Overall prevalence of any childhood mental disorder was 12.7% (95% CI 10.1% to 15.9%; I2=99.1%). Significant heterogeneity pertained to diagnostic measurement and study location. Anxiety (5.2%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity (3.7%), oppositional defiant (3.3%), substance use (2.3%), conduct (1.3%) and depressive (1.3%) disorders were the most common. Among children with mental disorders, only 44.2% (95% CI 37.6% to 50.9%) received any services for these conditions. CONCLUSIONS An estimated one in eight children have mental disorders at any given time, causing symptoms and impairment, therefore requiring treatment. Yet even in high-income countries, most children with mental disorders are not receiving services for these conditions. We discuss the implications, particularly the need to substantially increase public investments in effective interventions.

Genetic background of the host seems to be partly responsible for severe phenotype and genes related to innate immune response seem critical host determinants. The C9orf72 gene has a role in vesicular trafficking, autophagy regulation and lysosome functions, is highly expressed in myeloid cells and is involved in immune functions, regulating the lysosomal degradation of mediators of innate immunity. A large non-coding hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in this gene is the main genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both characterized by neuroinflammation and high systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines, while HREs of intermediate length, although rare, are more frequent in autoimmune disorders. C9orf72 full mutation results in haploinsufficiency and intermediate HREs seem to modulate gene expression as well and impair autophagy. Herein, we sought to explore whether intermediate HREs in C9orf72 may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Although we found intermediate HREs in only a small portion of 240 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the magnitude of risk for requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation conferred by harboring intermediate repeats >10 units in at least one C9orf72 allele was more than twice respect to having shorter expansions, when adjusted for age (odds ratio (OR) 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–5.37, p = 0.040). The association between intermediate repeats >10 units and more severe clinical outcome (p = 0.025) was also validated in an independent cohort of 201 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. These data suggest that C9orf72 HREs >10 units may influence the pathogenic process driving more severe COVID-19 phenotypes.","Zanella, Isabella; Zacchi, Eliana; Piva, Simone; Filosto, Massimiliano; Beligni, Giada; Alaverdian, Diana; Amitrano, Sara; Fava, Francesca; Baldassarri, Margherita; Frullanti, Elisa; Meloni, Ilaria; Renieri, Alessandra; Castelli, Francesco; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia",Int J Mol Sci,170,20

Previous studies have shown that many approved drugs developed for other clinical indications inhibit EBOV and LASV and that combinations of these drugs provide synergistic suppression of EBOV, often by blocking discrete steps in virus entry. We hypothesize that repurposing of combinations of orally administered approved drugs provides effective suppression of arenaviruses. In this report, we demonstrate that arbidol, an approved influenza antiviral previously shown to inhibit EBOV, LASV, and many other viruses, inhibits murine leukemia virus (MLV) reporter viruses pseudotyped with the fusion glycoproteins (GPs) of other arenaviruses (Junin virus [JUNV], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV], and Pichinde virus [PICV]). Arbidol and other approved drugs, including aripiprazole, amodiaquine, sertraline, and niclosamide, also inhibit infection of cells by infectious PICV, and arbidol, sertraline, and niclosamide inhibit infectious LASV. Combining arbidol with aripiprazole or sertraline results in the synergistic suppression of LASV and JUNV GP-bearing pseudoviruses. This proof-of-concept study shows that arenavirus infection in vitro can be synergistically inhibited by combinations of approved drugs. This approach may lead to a proactive strategy with which to prepare for and control known and new arenavirus outbreaks.","Herring, Shawn; Oda, Jessica M.; Wagoner, Jessica; Kirchmeier, Delaney; O’Connor, Aidan; Nelson, Elizabeth A.; Huang, Qinfeng; Liang, Yuying; DeWald, Lisa Evans; Johansen, Lisa M.; Glass, Pamela J.; Olinger, Gene G.; Ianevski, Aleksandr; Aittokallio, Tero; Paine, Mary F.; Fink, Susan L.; White, Judith M.; Polyak, Stephen J.",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,170,1

Some patients develop features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Elevated levels of IL-6 were reported to be associated with severe disease, and anti-IL-6R tocilizumab has been shown to be effective in some patients. This retrospective multicenter case–control study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who received standard of care with or without tocilizumab. Primary outcome was the progression to intubation or death. PSMATCH (SAS) procedure was used to achieve exact propensity score (PS) matching. Data from 1289 patients were collected, and study population was reduced to 1073 based on inclusion–exclusion criteria. The composite outcome was observed more frequently in tocilizumab-users, but there was a significant imbalance between arms in all critical parameters. Primary analyses were carried out in 348 patients (174 in each arm) after exact PS matching according to gender, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Logistic regression models revealed that tocilizumab significantly reduced the intubation or death (OR 0.40, p = 0.0017). When intubation is considered alone, tocilizumab-users had > 60% reduction in odds of intubation. Multiple imputation approach, which increased the size of the matched patients up to 506, provided no significant difference between arms despite a similar trend for intubation alone group. Analysis of this retrospective cohort showed more frequent intubation or death in tocilizumab-users, but PS-matched analyses revealed significant results for supporting tocilizumab use overall in a subset of patients matched according to gender, ferritin and procalcitonin levels.

In this study, we describe the presentation of Covid-19 patients in a Swedish prehospital care system, and asses the predictive value of Covid-19 suspicion as documented by dispatch and ambulance nurses. METHODS: Data for all patients with dispatch, ambulance, and hospital records between January 1–August 31, 2020 were extracted. A descriptive statistical analysis of patients with and without hospital-confirmed Covid-19 was performed. In a subset of records beginning from April 14, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of documented Covid-19 suspicion in dispatch and ambulance patient care records. RESULTS: A total of 11,894 prehospital records were included, of which 481 had a primary hospital diagnosis code related to-, or positive test results for Covid-19. Covid-19-positive patients had considerably worse outcomes than patients with negative test results, with 30-day mortality rates of 24% vs 11%, but lower levels of prehospital acuity (e.g. emergent transport rates of 14% vs 22%). About half (46%) of Covid-19-positive patients presented to dispatchers with primary complaints typically associated with Covid-19. Six thousand seven hundred seventy-six records were included in the assessment of predictive value. Sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 71–80) and 82% (78–86) for dispatch and ambulance suspicion respectively, while specificities were 86% (85–87) and 78% (77–79). CONCLUSIONS: While prehospital suspicion was strongly indicative of hospital-confirmed Covid-19, based on the sensitivity identified in this study, prehospital suspicion should not be relied upon as a single factor to rule out the need for isolation precautions. The data provided may be used to develop improved guidelines for identifying Covid-19 patients in the prehospital setting.","Spangler, Douglas; Blomberg, Hans; Smekal, David",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,170,18

We benchmarked serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NP in non-human primates against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (HexaPro) using a panel of circulating mutants. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are similarly resilient to many RBD residue substitutions tested although mutations at and surrounding position 484 have negative consequences for neutralization. Mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens displaying multiple sarbecovirus RBDs elicit broad neutralizing activity in mice and protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that multivalent sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and motivates advancing such broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic.","Walls, Alexandra C.; Miranda, Marcos C.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Pham, Minh N.; Greaney, Allison; Arunachalam, Prabhu S.; Navarro, Mary-Jane; Tortorici, M.

We examined the prevalence and correlates of HHP in adolescents. We used nationally representative data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (2003–2017) from 92 countries. HHP were categorized as “appropriate”, “inappropriate” and “lacking” based on the information about “hand washing before eating”, “hand washing after using the toilet”, and “hand washing with soap”. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to assess the role of socio-demographic, health, lifestyle, school, and family-related variables in HHP. Among 354,422 adolescents (13–17 years), only 30.3% were found to practice appropriate hand hygiene. Multivariable models suggest that sedentary behavior (adjusted relative risk ratio (ARRR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.31–1.51)), and bullying victimization (ARRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10–1.30) promoted inappropriate HHP. In contrast, parental supervision (ARRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.50–0.59) and parental bonding (ARRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.87) were protective against inappropriate HHP. From a policy perspective, hand hygiene promotion policies and programs should focus on both school (bullying, exercise) and family-level factors (parental supervision and parental bonding) factors.","Jatrana, Santosh; Hasan, Md.

Randomized trials are limited on patient-centered outcomes. We designed this pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effect of ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative compared with standard of care alone as a control group (CG) in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation (MV). We also provided preliminary evidence on clinically relevant outcomes to plan a larger trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pilot, active-controlled, open-label RCT was conducted at medical, surgical, and transplant ICUs at a large tertiary and quaternary care medical institution (King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia). The study included adult patients who were intubated within 24 h, expected to require MV for the next calendar day, and had institutional pain and sedation protocol initiated. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adjunct ketamine infusion 1–2 μg/kg/min for 48 h or CG alone. RESULTS: Of 437 patients screened from September 2019 through November 2020, 83 (18.9%) patients were included (43 in CG and 40 in ketamine) and 352 (80.5%) were excluded. Average enrollment rate was 3–4 patients/month. Consent and protocol adherence rates were adequate (89.24% and 76%, respectively). Demographics were balanced between groups. Median MV duration was 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 3–9.25 days) in ketamine and 5 (IQR 2–8 days) in CG. Median VFDs was 19 (IQR 0–24.75 days) in ketamine and 19 (IQR 0–24 days) in the CG (p = 0.70). More patients attained goal Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale at 24 and 48 h in ketamine (67.5% and 73.5%, respectively) compared with CG (52.4% and 66.7%, respectively). Sedatives and vasopressors cumulative use, and hemodynamic changes were similar. ICU length-of-stay was 12.5 (IQR 6–21.2 days) in ketamine, compared with 12 (IQR 5.5–23 days) in CG. No serious adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative agent appeared to be feasible and safe with no negative impact on outcomes, including hemodynamics. This pilot RCT identified areas of improvement in study protocol before conducting a large, adequately powered, multicenter RCT which is likely justified to investigate ketamine association with patient-centered outcomes further.

Although most of these social media posts involved practitioners from abroad, this article explores whether they would attract fitness to practise investigations had they been posted by UK-based medical and dental practitioners. In particular, it asks whether such conduct comes into conflict with the existing professional standards issued by the General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Dental Council (GDC). It questions also whether those guidelines should be updated and/or further clarified in view of the extraordinary circumstances posed by the pandemic. METHOD: An exploratory study was conducted using sensationalist pandemic-related social media posts by doctors and dentists discovered during the first half of 2020 (n = 11). The contents were analysed qualitatively using documentary analysis using coding terms based on the professional standards on social media published by both the GMC and the GDC. The codes generated common and recurring themes that were used to structure discussion. FINDINGS: This study provides a partial insight as to the likely motivations of doctors and dentists to use social media in a manner that may not necessarily lend well to the professional standards expected. In a majority of instances, doctors and dentists who posted social media material with a sensationalist outlook tended to focus on single-issue campaigns pertaining to specific aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. These issues included controversial commentary on acute shortages of personal protective equipment and attendant occupational risks to clinical staff to Covid-19 infection; criticisms directed towards regulatory bodies in the handling of the pandemic; and professional advice to the general public which was later found to be inaccurate. CONCLUSIONS: Social media offer opportunities for healthcare professionals to play a constructive role in raising awareness, disseminating information, and promoting solidarity in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, doctors and dentists must carefully consider the ethical and professional pitfalls involved in sensationalist social media posts. The GMC and the GDC should, at the same time, regularly update and clarify their social media guidance in response to major global events like a pandemic as well as advances in social media technology.","Law, Richard WM; Kanagasingam, Shalini; Choong, Kartina A",Digit Health,170,29

The “Well-being of Children in Lockdown” (WCL) scale was used to measure the well-being of adolescents using these same parameters. The results point out that the general well-being of adolescents in the pandemic situation was situated at an intermediate level. Taking into account the different aspects measured within the general well-being, the domains that obtained the lowest scores were the domains of addictions and playful and creative activities. Intermediate scores were also obtained in the physical activity, emotional and academic domains, with the routine and academic domains having the highest scores. Boys and younger adolescents are those who show higher scores in the general well-being. Moreover, correlations appear between academic task stress and emotions, playful and creative activities, addictions, physical activity, routine, academic and overall well-being.","Berasategi Santxo, Naiara; Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Dosil-Santamaria, Maria",Front Psychol,170,20

Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, for studies published between January 2020 and January 2021 that reported CK-MB, COVID-19 severity and mortality (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021239657). RESULTS: Fifty-five studies in 11,791 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that CK-MB concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status than patients with low severity or survivor status (standardized mean difference, SMD, 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01, p<0.001). The rate of patients with CK-MB values above the normal range was also significantly higher in the former than the latter (60/350 vs 98/1,780; RR ​= ​2.84, 95%CI 1.89 to 4.27, p<0.001; I(2) ​= ​19.9, p ​= ​0.254). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I(2) ​= ​93.4%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not modified (effect size range, 0.77 to 0.84). Begg's (p ​= ​0.50) and Egger's (p ​= ​0.86) t-tests did not show publication bias. In meta-regression analysis, the SMD was significantly and positively associated with the white blood count, aspartate aminotransferase, myoglobin, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. CONCLUSIONS: Higher CK-MB concentrations were significantly associated with severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients. This biomarker of myocardial injury might be useful for risk stratification in this group.","Zinellu, Angelo; Sotgia, Salvatore; Fois, Alessandro G.; Mangoni, Arduino A.",Adv Med Sci,170,29

It is important to quantify the error rates of test equipment under field conditions, which might differ significantly from those obtained in the laboratory. A literature review on SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to construct a clinical test confusion matrix. A simple correction method for bulk test results is then demonstrated with examples. The required sensitivity and specificity of a test are explored for societal needs and use cases, before a sequential analysis of common example scenarios is explored. The analysis suggests that many of the people with mild symptoms and positive test results are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some regions. It is concluded that current and foreseen alternative tests can not be used to “clear” people as being non-infected. Recommendations are given that regional authorities must establish a programme to monitor operational test characteristics before launching large scale testing; and that large scale testing for tracing infection networks in some regions is not viable, but may be possible in a focused way that does not exceed the working capacity of the laboratories staffed by competent experts. RT-PCR tests can not be solely relied upon as the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at scale, instead clinical assessment supported by a range of expert diagnostic tests should be used.","Bentley, P.M.",Heliyon,170,1

This accentuates the need for a therapy that can reduce the severity of COVID-19. Clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of remdesivir in shortening recovery time and decreasing progression to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. However, some studies have highlighted its lack of efficacy in patients on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This study uncovers some underlying immune response differences between responders and non-responders to remdesivir treatment. Immunological analyses revealed an upregulation of tissue repair factors BDNF, PDGF-BB and PIGF-1, as well as an increase in ratio of Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 to Th1-associated cytokine IFN-γ. Serological profiling of IgG subclasses corroborated this observation, with significantly higher magnitude of increase in Th2-associated IgG2 and IgG4 responses. These findings help to identify the mechanisms of immune regulation accompanying successful remdesivir treatment in severe COVID-19 patients.","Chan, Yi-Hao; Young, Barnaby E.; Fong, Siew-Wai; Ding, Ying; Goh, Yun Shan; Chee, Rhonda Sin-Ling; Tan, Seow-Yen; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Tambyah, Paul A.; Leo, Yee-Sin; Ng, Lisa F.

Initially, these were undertaken based on data from influenza outbreaks in which children were highly susceptible and important in community-wide transmission. An argument was made that school closures were necessary to prevent harm to vulnerable adults, especially the elderly. Although data are still accumulating, the recently described complication, pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, is extremely rare and children remain remarkably unaffected by COVID-19. We also do not have evidence that children are epidemiologically important in community-wide viral spread. Previous studies have shown long-term educational, social, and medical harms from school exclusion, with very young children and those from marginalized groups such as immigrants and racialized minorities most affected. The policy and ethical implications of ongoing mandatory school closures, in order to protect others, need urgent reassessment in light of the very limited data of public health benefit.","Silverman, Michael; Sibbald, Robert; Stranges, Saverio",Can J Public Health,170,30

While some commercial electronic air cleaners can be effective in reducing primary pollutants and inactivating bioaerosol, studies on the formation of secondary products from oxidation chemistry during their use are limited. Here, we measured oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and the chemical composition of particles generated from a hydroxyl radical generator in an office. During operation, enhancements in OVOCs, especially low-molecular-weight organic acids, were detected. Rapid increases in particle number and mass concentrations were observed, corresponding to the formation of highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (O:C ∼ 1.3), with an enhanced signal at m/z 44 (CO(2)(+)) in the organic mass spectra. These results suggest that organic acids generated during VOC oxidation contributed to particle nucleation and SOA formation. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride also increased during the oxidation without a corresponding increase in ammonium, suggesting organic nitrate, organic sulfate, and organic chloride formation. As secondary species are reported to have detrimental health effects, further studies should not be limited to the inactivation of bioaerosol or reduction of particular VOCs, but should also evaluate potential OVOCs and SOA formation from electronic air cleaners in different indoor environments.","Joo, Taekyu; Rivera-Rios, Jean C.; Alvarado-Velez, Daniel; Westgate, Sabrina; Ng, Nga Lee",Environ Sci Technol Lett,170,1

This article presents a chest X-ray image-based automated COVID-19 detection system which can be employed with the RT-PCR test to improve the diagnosis rate. In the proposed approach, the textural features are extracted from the chest X-ray images and local binary pattern (LBP) based images. Further, the image-based and LBP image-based features are jointly investigated. Thereafter, highly discriminatory features are provided to the classifier for developing an automated model for COVID-19 identification. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated over 2905 chest X-ray images of normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 infected persons on various class combinations to analyze the robustness. The developed method achieves 97.97% accuracy (acc) and 99.88% sensitivity (sen) for classifying COVID-19 X-ray images against pneumonia infected and normal person's X-ray images. It attains 98.91% acc and 99.33% sen for COVID-19 X-ray against the normal X-ray classification.

It focuses on the period of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) between 2000 and 2015 and the first years of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from 2016 to 2018. The paper aims also to assess the level of subsidies for sanitation services in Algeria and the lack of full cost recovery. We then emphasise the idle capacity for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the risks of wastewater discharge on public health and ecological integrity. Our methodological approach is multidimensional and based on a critical reading of reports by institutions responsible for the implementation of sanitation policy. We used water and sanitation data from the water authorities to evaluate the funding of the sanitation subsector and to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of this sub-sector. This study was also facilitated by semi-structured interviews with executive staff in water institutions responsible for the implementation of sanitation policy in Algeria. In the period studied (2000–2018) we find that the sanitation subsector benefited from a significant investment budget (or budgetary allocations) of nearly US$7.58 billion (in constant 1999 US$), representing 20.53% of the total budget allocated to the water sector. However, the low absorption capacity, estimated at 62.7% between 2000 and 2015, meant that the capital expenditure of achieving MDG target 7.C related to sanitation was US$4.38 billion (in constant 1999 US$) out of US$6.98 billion allocated for the same period. The study shows that the decline in real investment since 2009, with a funding gap that increased from 201.49% in 2015 to 385.56% in 2018, casts uncertainty on the fulfillment of SDG targets 6.2 and 6.3 related to sanitation. It is thus very difficult to meet the level of investment planned for 2030. It seems, therefore, that the SDGs will only be comfortably achieved if reforms towards the sustainable recovery of sanitation service costs are undertaken.","Kherbache, Nabil; Oukaci, Kamal",World Dev Perspect,170,14

In contrast to the existing literature, that relies heavily on qualitative accounts of the epidemic and ethnography, this study tests the dynamics of the connections between critical actors with quantitative network analysis. This novel approach explores how individuals are embedded in social relationships and how this may affect the production and use of evidence. The meso-level analysis, conducted between March and June 2019, is based on the traces of individuals' engagement found in secondary sources. Source material includes policy and strategy documents, committee papers, meeting minutes and personal correspondence. Social network analysis software, UCINet, was used to analyse the data and Netdraw for the visualisation of the network. Far from being one cohesive community of experts and government officials, the network of 134 people was weakly held together by a handful of super-connectors. Social scientists’ poor connections to the government embedded biomedical community may explain why they were most successful when they framed their expertise in terms of widely accepted concepts. The whole network was geographically and racially almost entirely isolated from those affected by or directly responding to the crisis in West Africa. Nonetheless, the case was made for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response. The challenge now is moving from the rhetoric to action on complex infectious disease outbreaks in ways that value all perspectives equally.","Georgalakis, James",Soc Sci Med,170,16

This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of adolescents. METHODS: A cohort study with schoolchildren from southern Brazil was conducted. Data on adolescents’ OHRQoL were collected from December 2019 to February 2020 (T1), before the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. Posteriorly, the data were collected again in June and July of 2020 (T2), under the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. The OHRQoL was assessed using the Brazilian short version of the CPQ11-14. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the degree of social distancing were also assessed. Changes in OHRQoL between T1 and T2 were evaluated by adjusted Multilevel Poisson regression models for repeated measures. RESULTS: From 290 individuals evaluated at T1, 207 were reevaluated at T2 (response rate of 71.3%). The overall CPQ11-14 mean score was significantly lower during the pandemic, reducing from 10.8 at T1 to 7.7 at T2. This significant reduction was also observed for all CPQ domains, indicating a lower negative impact of oral conditions on adolescents' quality of life during the pandemic. Adolescents from families that had a middle or low degree of social distancing during the pandemic and whose parents were harmed in employment had higher CPQ11-14 scores. CONCLUSION: Overall and specific-domains CPQ-14 scores were significantly lower during the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak, indicating a decrease in the perception of oral health problems by adolescents over that period.","Knorst, Jessica Klöckner; Brondani, Bruna; Tomazoni, Fernanda; Vargas, Andressa Weber; Cósta, Marina Dutra; da Silva Godois, Leonardo; Mendes, Fausto Medeiros; Ardenghi, Diego Machado; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado",Qual Life Res,170,5

Antibody testing is an option for case management and epidemiologic studies, with high specificity and variable sensitivity. However, characteristics of local populations may affect performance of these tests. For this reason, the National Institute of Health (INS) and regulatory agencies in Colombia require verification of diagnostic accuracy of tests introduced to the Colombian market. METHODS: We conducted a validation study of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 test for qualitative detection of IgG using the Abbott Architect i2000SR. Participants and retrospective samples were included from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, age ≥18 years, and ≥8 days elapsed since initiation of symptoms. Pre-pandemic plasma samples (taken before October 2019) were used as controls. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and agreement (kappa) of the Abbott IgG test compared to the gold standard (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The overall sensitivity was 83.1% (95% CI: 75.4–100). Sensitivity among patients with ≥14 days since the start of symptoms was 85.7%, reaching 88% in samples collected from patients with COVID-19 symptoms onset >60 days. Specificity was 100% and the kappa index of agreement was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.642–0.965). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show high sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott IgG test in a Colombian population, which meet the criteria set by the Colombian INS to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Data from our patient groups also suggest that IgG response is detectable in a high proportion of individuals (88.1%) during the first two months following onset of symptoms.","Castro, Maria del Mar; Caicedo, Isabella; Ortiz-Rojas, Helen Johanna; Castillo, Carmen Manuela; Medina, Adriana Giovanna; Alexander, Neal; Gómez, Maria Adelaida; Albornoz, Ludwig L.",PLoS One,170,20

However, there are currently no general approaches for forming precisely oriented antibody assemblies with controlled valency. We describe the computational design of two-component nanocages that overcome this limitation by uniting form and function. One structural component is any antibody or Fc fusion and the second is a designed Fc-binding homo-oligomer that drives nanocage assembly. Structures of 8 antibody nanocages determined by electron microscopy spanning dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral architectures with 2, 6, 12, and 30 antibodies per nanocage match the corresponding computational models. Antibody nanocages targeting cell-surface receptors enhance signaling compared to free antibodies or Fc-fusions in DR5-mediated apoptosis, Tie2-mediated angiogenesis, CD40 activation, and T cell proliferation; nanocage assembly also increases SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization by α-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and Fc-ACE2 fusion proteins.

Exaggerated pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia may be related to endothelial dysfunction in hypoxia susceptible. We hypothesize that baseline BNP levels can predict hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals. MAIN METHODS: The pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia was compared in 35 male healthy individuals divided into two groups based on BNP levels (Group 1 ≤ 15 and Group 2 > 15 pg/ml). Acute normobaric hypoxia was administered to both the groups, to confirm hypoxia susceptibility in Group 2. KEY FINDINGS: Unlike Group 1, Group 2 had elevated post hypoxia BNP levels (26 vs 33.5 pg/ml, p = 0.002) while pulmonary artery pressure was comparable. A negative correlation with tissue oxygen consumption (delta pO(2)) and compartmental fluid shift was seen in Group 1 only. Endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 resulted in reduced vascular compliance leading to elevation of mean blood pressure on acute hypoxia exposure. BNP showed a positive correlation with endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 and has been linked to pre-diabetic disorder (HbA1c 6 ± 0.44%) and may additionally represent a lower cross-sectional area of vascular bed related to vascular remodeling mediated by chronic hypoxia. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals may be related to endothelial dysfunction that limits vascular compliance during hypoxic stress. BNP level showed positive correlation with HbA1c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO(2) (r = −0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to endothelial dysfunction contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals. BNP levels≤15 pg/ml at sea level is indicative of hypoxia resistance.","Khatri, Rahul; Gupta, Rajinder K.; Vats, Praveen; Bansal, Vishal; Yadav, Anand Kumar; Reddy, Prasanna K.; Bharadwaj, Abhishek; Chaudhary, Pooja; Sharma, Shivani; Bajaj, Amir Chand; Deskit, Padma; Dass, Deepak; Baburaj, Thiruthara P.; Singh, Shashi Bala; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Life Sci,170,27

One area needing more study is anthrax-related events. A computational framework that utilizes machine learning techniques was created to collect tweets discussing anthrax, further categorize them as relevant by the month of data collection, and detect discussions on anthrax-related events. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to detect discussions on anthrax-related events and to determine the relevance of the tweets and topics of discussion over 12 months of data collection. METHODS: This is an infoveillance study, using tweets in English containing the keyword “Anthrax” and “Bacillus anthracis”, collected from September 25, 2017, through August 15, 2018. Machine learning techniques were used to determine what people were tweeting about anthrax. Data over time was plotted to determine whether an event was detected (a 3-fold spike in tweets). A machine learning classifier was created to categorize tweets by relevance to anthrax. Relevant tweets by month were examined using a topic modeling approach to determine the topics of discussion over time and how these events influence that discussion. RESULTS: Over the 12 months of data collection, a total of 204,008 tweets were collected. Logistic regression analysis revealed the best performance for relevance (precision=0.81; recall=0.81; F(1)-score=0.80). In total, 26 topics were associated with anthrax-related events, tweets that were highly retweeted, natural outbreaks, and news stories. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that tweets related to anthrax can be collected and analyzed over time to determine what people are discussing and to detect key anthrax-related events. Future studies are required to focus only on opinion tweets, use the methodology to study other terrorism events, or to monitor for terrorism threats.","Miller, Michele; Romine, William; Oroszi, Terry",JMIR Public Health Surveill,170,8

We present molecular genetic immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic data on SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and viral load (VL) in lungs, mediastinum lymph nodes, and the spleen of 36 patients who died from COVID-19. Lymphopenia <1 × 10(9)/L was observed in 23 of 36 (63.8%) patients. In 12 of 36 cases (33%) SARS-CoV-2 was found in lung tissues only with a median VL of 239 copies (range 18–1952) SARS-CoV-2 cDNA per 100 copies of ABL1. Histomorphological changes corresponding to bronchopneumonia and the proliferative phase of DAD were observed in these cases. SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into the lungs, lymph nodes, and spleen was detected in 23 of 36 patients (58.4%) and was associated with the exudative phase of DAD in most of these cases. The median VL in the lungs was 12,116 copies (range 810–250281), lymph nodes—832 copies (range 96–11586), and spleen—71.5 copies (range 0–2899). SARS-CoV-2 in all cases belonged to the 19A strain. A immunohistochemical study revealed SARS-CoV-2 proteins in pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and bronchiolar epithelial cells in lung tissue, sinus histiocytes of lymph nodes, as well as cells of the Billroth pulp cords and spleen capsule. SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cell, macrophages, and lymphocytes. The infection of lymphocytes with SARS-CoV-2 that we discovered for the first time may indicate a possible link between lymphopenia and SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxic effect.","Abdullaev, Adhamjon; Odilov, Akmaljon; Ershler, Maxim; Volkov, Alexey; Lipina, Tatiana; Gasanova, Tatiana; Lebedin, Yuri; Babichenko, Igor; Sudarikov, Andrey",Viruses,170,24

Carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglion cysts, and trigger digits are some of the most common pathologies treated by hand surgeons. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient's interest in elective hand surgery for these conditions is uncertain. The objective of this study is to use Google Trends to track online interest in elective hand surgery in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Online search trends regarding elective orthopaedic hand surgery were obtained via Google Trends from November 2019 to November 2020. Three common hand pathologies in lay terms (""carpal tunnel,"" ""‘ganglion cyst’ + ‘wrist cyst,’"" and ""trigger finger"") and three hand surgery-specific keywords (""hand surgery,"" ""carpal tunnel surgery,"" and ""trigger finger surgery"") were used as search terms. The search volume index (SVI) graphs for the United States for both sets of search terms were then generated from the Google Trends data and compared to the seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases per day as reported by the CDC. A separate SVI graph was then created for the search term ""coronavirus” and was compared against both sets of search terms as above. Results Search trends for all elective hand pathologies and surgery-specific keywords remained constant from November 2019 to the beginning of March 2020 and then decreased significantly within a one-month period following the peak in COVID-19 cases the week of March 15, 2020. Search trends for these keywords increased to baseline levels over the next few months. The search trend for ""coronavirus"" demonstrated a small search volume index peak of 13 during January 2020 followed by the maximum peak of 100 during the week of March 15, 2020, corresponding to the decrease in search trends of elective hand surgery at that time. Conclusions Online interest in elective hand surgery remained constant prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there was a marked decrease in search trends of elective hand surgery with the rise in daily reported COVID-19 cases, suggesting that patient's interest in elective hand surgery decreased with the onset of the pandemic.","Mohty, Kurt M; Lashkari, Nassim; Gittings, Daniel J; Bell, Jennifer A; Stevanovic, Milan; Nicholson, Luke T",Cureus,170,26

Although there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different SARSCoV genes, codon usage bias in SARSCoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. By comparing synonymous codon usage patterns in different viruses, we observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in these virus genes was virus specific and phylogenetically conserved, but it was not host specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARSCoV was diverged far from all three known groups of Coronavirus. Compositional constraints could explain most of the variation of synonymous codon usage among these virus genes, while gene function is also correlated to synonymous codon usages to a certain extent. However, translational selection and gene length have no effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes.","Gu, Wanjun; Zhou, Tong; Ma, Jianmin; Sun, Xiao; Lu, Zuhong",Virus Res,170,27

Such tools can significantly improve resource allocation and patient management within hospitals. From the statistical point of view, extended time-to-event models are required to account for competing risks (discharge from hospital) and censoring so that active cases can also contribute to the analysis. METHODS: We used the hospital-based open Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study with 630 COVID-19 patients from Isfahan, Iran. Competing risk methods are used to develop a death risk chart based on the following variables, which can simply be measured at hospital admission: sex, age, hypertension, oxygen saturation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. The area under the receiver operator curve was used to assess accuracy concerning discrimination between patients discharged alive and dead. RESULTS: Cause-specific hazard regression models show that these baseline variables are associated with both death, and discharge hazards. The risk chart reflects the combined results of the two cause-specific hazard regression models. The proposed risk assessment method had a very good accuracy (AUC = 0.872 [CI 95%: 0.835–0.910]).

We reported the epidemiological, viral, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients infected with the Delta VOC during the local outbreak in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: We extracted the epidemiological and clinical information pertaining to the 159 cases infected with the Delta VOC across seven transmission generations between May 21 and June 18, 2021. The whole chain of the Delta VOC transmission was described. Kinetics of viral load and clinical characteristics were compared with a cohort of wild-type infection in 2020 admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. FINDINGS: There were four transmission generations within the first ten days. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain. In cases with critical illness, the proportion of patients over the age of 60 was higher in the Delta VOC group than in the wild-type strain (100.0% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.03). The Delta VOC had a higher risk than wild-type infection in deterioration to critical status (hazards ratio 2.98 [95%CI 1.29-6.86]; p = 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Infection with the Delta VOC is characterized by markedly increased transmissibility, viral loads and risk of disease progression compared with the wild-type strain, calling for more intensive prevention and control measures to contain future outbreaks.

Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018–19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018–2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.

In this study, we present an experiment aimed at analyzing human behavior in simple teleoperated pick-and-place tasks in a simulated scenario and at devising a suitable model for early estimation of the current proximal intention. We show that scan paths are, as expected, heavily shaped by the current intention and that two types of Gaussian Hidden Markov Models, one more scene-specific and one more action-specific, achieve a very good prediction performance, while also generalizing to new users and spatial arrangements. We finally discuss how behavioral and model results suggest that eye movements reflect to some extent the invariance and generality of higher-level planning across object configurations, which can be leveraged by cooperative robotic systems.","Fuchs, Stefan; Belardinelli, Anna",Front Neurorobot,170,1

Evidence has indicated that hyperinflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 are the main cause of pathogenicity in the severe cases of patients who have died during the current viral disease. Monocytes and macrophages as the most important cells of the innate arm of the immune system play a substantial part in the body's defense against viral infections. They mainly respond to the microbial antigens by producing inflammatory mediators to remove pathogens and repair tissue injury. Nevertheless, aberrant alterations in their function such as cytokine storm can be so harmful to the host in the acute respiratory distress syndrome cases caused by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, inflammatory responses stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 have affected the other vital organs of the body including the heart. As cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients have been reported in several studies. During the infection, monocytes and macrophages may be involved in the hypersensitive and exacerbated reactions that contribute to the tissue damage, especially lung injury resulted in its dysfunction and respiratory disorder. In this review, we discuss both advantageous and disadvantageous about the pathological potential of monocytes and macrophages during the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to clarify their mutual effects on immune processing as a fist line defender in the current disease.","Meidaninikjeh, Sepideh; Sabouni, Nasim; Marzouni, Hadi Zare; Bengar, Sajad; Khalili, Ahmad; Jafari, Reza",Life Sci,170,16

METHOD: Virtual OTVs were piloted at two centers, and within one week expanded to 4 additional centers. Patients participating in vOTVs were surveyed about their satisfaction with vOTVs, quality of vOTVs, and confidence in their physician’s ability to manage their care through vOTVs, as well as their support of, and preferences related to vOTVs. Participating physicians were also surveyed about their comfort and satisfaction with vOTVs. Medical Directors at non-participating centers within our network were surveyed regarding their reasoning for not using vOTVs. RESULTS: In week 1, 72 of 81 patients between 2 pilot centers were seen using vOTVs. In week 2, 189 of 211 patients were seen using vOTVs at 6 centers. Patient satisfaction and confidence in their physician’s ability to address their concerns through the vOTV was high at 4.75 on a 5-point scale. Patients were overall very supportive (4.67) and found the quality of the visits to be as good as, or better, than their prior in person weekly OTV (3.75). Physicians participating in the vOTVs felt very comfortable in their ability to manage patients though this platform (5.0), and on average did not report any difference in terms of efficiency of visits (3.0). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual OTVs were easy to implement and well received by patients and participating physicians. Our experience suggests that vOTVs can be implemented rapidly using available technology, and with a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction during this pandemic with similar efficiency to in person OTVs.","Roof, Kevin S.; Butler, Jerome M.; Thakkar, Vipul V.; Doline, Robert M.; Kuremsky, Jeffrey G.; Konefal, John B.; McCammon, Robert J.",Adv Radiat Oncol,170,33

There is little comparative data investigating the effect of HA-AKI on mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and a control group of general population suffering from Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HA-AKI development was assessed in a group of stage 3–5 CKD patients and control group without CKD among adult patients hospitalized for Covid-19. The role of AKI development on the outcome (in-hospital mortality and admission to the intensive care unit [ICU]) of patients with and without CKD was compared. RESULTS: Among 621 hospitalized patients (age 60 [IQR: 47–73]), women: 44.1%), AKI developed in 32.5% of the patients, as stage 1 in 84.2%, stage 2 in 8.4%, and stage 3 in 7.4%. AKI developed in 48.0 % of CKD patients, whereas it developed in 17.6% of patients without CKD. CKD patients with HA-AKI had the highest mortality rate of 41.1% compared to 14.3% of patients with HA-AKI but no CKD (p < 0.001). However, patients with AKI+non-CKD had similar rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death rate to patients with CKD without AKI. Adjusted mortality risks of the AKI+non-CKD group (HR: 9.0, 95% CI: 1.9–44.2) and AKI+CKD group (HR: 7.9, 95% CI: 1.9–33.3) were significantly higher than that of the non-AKI+non-CKD group. CONCLUSION: AKI frequently develops in hospitalized patients due to Covid-19 and is associated with high mortality. HA-AKI has worse outcomes whether it develops in patients with or without CKD, but the worst outcome was seen in AKI+CKD patients.","ÖZTÜRK, Savaş; TURGUTALP, Kenan; ARICI, Mustafa; ÇETİNKAYA, Hakkı; ALTIPARMAK, Mehmet Rıza; AYDIN, Zeki; SOYPAÇACI, Zeki; BORA, Feyza; KARA, Ekrem; CEBECİ, Egemen; ÖZLER, Tuba Elif; DÖLARSLAN, Mürşide Esra; SİPAHİ, Savaş; AYAR, Yavuz; ŞAHİN, İdris; BAKIRDÖĞEN, Serkan; İSLAM, Mahmud; GÖRGÜLÜ, Numan; ÖĞÜTMEN, Melike Betül; ŞENGÜL, Erkan; GÜNGÖR, Özkan; SEYAHİ, Nurhan; TOKGÖZ, Bülent; ODABAŞ, Ali Rıza; TONBUL, Halil Zeki; SEZER, Siren; YILDIZ, Alaattin; ATEŞ, Kenan",Turk J Med Sci,170,30

Within 6 months, nearly 750,000 deaths are claimed by COVID-19 across the globe. This called for immediate social, scientific, technological, public and community interventions. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, global efforts are underway to develop preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, Spike (S) glycoprotein (a.k.a S Protein) is the most studied target known to trigger strong host immune response. A detailed analysis of S protein-based epitopes enabled us to design a novel B-cell-derived T-cell Multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine candidate. This involved a systematic and comprehensive computational protocol consisting of prediction of dual-purpose epitopes and designing an MEBP vaccine construct. This was followed by 3D structure validation, MEBP complex interaction studies, in silico cloning and vaccine dose-based immune response simulation to evaluate the immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct. The dual-purpose epitope prediction protocol was designed such that the same epitope elicits both humoral and cellular immune response unlike the earlier designs. Further, the epitopes predicted were screened against stringent criteria to ensure selection of a potent candidate with maximum antigen coverage and best immune response. The vaccine dose-based immune response simulation studies revealed a rapid antigen clearance through antibody generation and elevated levels of cell-mediated immunity during repeated exposure of the vaccine. The favourable results of the analysis strongly indicate that the vaccine construct is indeed a potent vaccine candidate and ready to proceed to the next steps of experimental validation and efficacy studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP molecular test was standardized, establishing the detection limit with Vero cells of isolated Peruvian strains of SARS-CoV-2, and the robustness to various concentrations of primers. The laboratory validation was performed with 384 nasal and pharyngeal swab samples (UFH) obtained between March and July 2020. The field validation was performed with 383 UFH obtained from COVID-19 suspected symptomatic cases. All samples were tested by RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR. The RT-qPCR was considered as the reference standard test. The concordance measures and diagnostic performance were calculated. RESULTS: The detection limit was consistent in cases with Ct <30 in both tests, showing efficiency to detect up to 1000 copies/µL of the target gene. Robustness was evidenced with half of the primer concentrations and 20 µL of final volume. Absence of amplification was identified for other HCoVs. Concordance showed a kappa index of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.93) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84 - 0.94) in laboratory and field settings, respectively. The sensitivity value in the laboratory was 87.4% (95% CI: 80.8 - 92.4) and 88.1% in the field (95% CI: 81.6 - 92.9). The specificity value in both settings was 98.8% (95% CI: 96.4-99.7). CONCLUSIONS: The in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test was successfully validated based on its adequate robustness, no cross-reactions, good concordance, and diagnostic performance compared to RT-qPCR.","Escalante-Maldonado, Oscar; Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Donaires, Fernando; Solis-Sanchez, Gilmer; Gallesi, Italo; Pampa-Espinoza, Luis; Huaringa, Maribel; Rojas-Serrano, Nancy; García, Coralith; Angles-Yanqui, Eddie; Gavilán, Ronnie Gustavo; Durães-Carvalho, Ricardo; Mendez-Rico, Jairo; Cabezas, César; Marques-Simas, Paulo Vitor",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,170,16

Barriers to access can be both spatial and non-spatial. Measurements of spatial access, such as the Enhanced Floating 2-Step Catchment Area and other floating catchment area measures, produce similar patterns of access. However, the extent to which different measurements of socioeconomic barriers to access correspond with each other has not been examined. Using West Virginia as a case study, we compute indices based upon the literature and measure the correlations among them. We find that all indices positively correlate with each other, although the strength of the correlation varies. Also, while there is broad agreement in the general spatial trends, such as fewer barriers in urban areas, and more barriers in the impoverished southwestern portion of the state, there are regions within the state that have more disagreement among the indices. These indices are to be used to support decision-making with respect to placement of rural residency students from medical schools within West Virginia to provide students with educational experiences as well as address health care inequalities within the state. The results indicate that for decisions and policies that address statewide trends, the choice of metric is not critical. However, when the decisions involve specific locations for receiving rural residents or opening clinics, the results can become more sensitive to the selection of the index. Therefore, for fine-grained policy decision-making, it is important that the chosen index best represents the processes under consideration.","Conley, Jamison; Hong, Insu; Williams, Amber; Taylor, Rachael; Gross, Thomson; Wilson, Bradley",Health Serv Outcomes Res Methodol,170,16

The method was tested using data from 80 countries from 6 continents. We found that Johnson Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) were extremely well fitted to the data (R2>0.99) and that Johnson CDFs were much better fitted to the data at their tails than either the commonly used Normal or Lognormal CDFs. Fitted Johnson CDFs can be used to obtain basic parameters of the infection wave, such as the percentage of the population infected during an infection wave, the days of the start, peak and end of the infection wave, as well as the durations of the infection wave of the waves increase and decrease. These parameters can be easily interpreted biologically and used both for describing the infection wave dynamics and in further statistical analysis. The usefulness of the parameters obtained was analysed with respect to the relation between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the population density, and the percentage of the population infected during an infection wave, the starting day and the duration of the infection wave in the 80 countries. We found that all the above parameters were significantly dependent on the GDP per capita, but only the percentage of the population infected was significantly dependent on the population density in these countries. If used with caution, this method has a limited ability to predict the future trajectory and parameters of an ongoing infection wave.","Cmiel, Adam M; Cmiel, Bogdan",,170,1

METHODS: Using GSEA, we compared our previous transcriptome analysis of neurons injured by glutamate and treated with the ARB Candesartan (GSE67036) with transcriptional signatures from SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and lung postmortem (GSE147507), PBMC and BALF samples (CRA002390) from COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Hundreds of genes upregulated in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 transcriptomes were similarly upregulated by glutamate and normalized by Candesartan. Gene Ontology analysis revealed expression profiles with greatest significance and enrichment, including proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine activity, the NF-kappa B complex, alterations in innate and adaptive immunity, with many genes participating in the COVID-19 cytokine storm. CONCLUSIONS: There are similar injury mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and neuronal injury, equally reduced by ARB treatment. This supports the hypothesis of a therapeutic role for ARBs, ameliorating the COVID-19 cytokine storm.","Elkahloun, Abdel G.; Saavedra, Juan M.",Biomed Pharmacother,170,4

Cardiovascular disease is a dominant comorbidity and prognostic factors predicting risk for critical courses are highly needed. Moreover, immunomechanisms underlying COVID-induced myocardial damage are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate prognostic markers to identify patients at risk. RESULTS: Only patients with pericardial effusion (PE) developed a severe disease course, and those who died could be identified by a high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio. Ten out of 19 COVID-19 patients presented with PE, 7 (78%) of these had elevated APACHE-II mortality risk-score, requiring mechanical ventilation. At admission, PE patients showed signs of systemic and cardiac inflammation in NMR and impaired cardiac function as detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), whereas parameters of myocardial injury e.g. high sensitive troponin-t (hs-TnT) were not yet increased. During the course of disease, hs-TnT rose in 8 of the PE-patients above 16 ng/l, 7 had to undergo ventilatory therapy and 4 of them died. FACS at admission showed in PE patients elevated frequencies of CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells among all CD3+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of Tregs and CD14(+)HLA(−)DR(+)-monocytes. A high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in PE patients, and was associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines. By contrast, patients without PE and PE patients with a low CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio neither had to be intubated, nor died. CONCLUSIONS: PE predicts cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TTE should be performed at admission. Immunological parameters for dysfunctional antiviral immunity, such as the CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio used here, supports risk assessment by predicting poor prognosis.","Duerr, G.D.; Heine, A.; Hamiko, M.; Zimmer, S.; Luetkens, J.A.; Nattermann, J.; Rieke, G.; Isaak, A.; Jehle, J.; Held, S.A.E.; Wasmuth, J.C.; Wittmann, M.; Strassburg, C.P.; Brossart, P.; Coburn, M.; Treede, H.; Nickenig, G.; Kurts, C.; Velten, M.",Life Sci,170,14

DATA SOURCES: We retrieved review articles and original research from MEDLINE, OVID, and PubMed (1950-June 2009) that addressed our topic of interest, using the terms respiratory virus, asthma, IgE, atopy, and viral-induced wheeze. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma. RESULTS: Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic disease. We provide information from our mouse model that suggests that dendritic cells, IgE, and FcɛRI are critical to the induction of atopy. Studies of patients taking antiviral agents (eg, ribavirin or palvizumab) support the notion that interfering with respiratory viral infections may decrease the development of atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies suggest strongly that viral infections may predispose patients to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases. Further, mechanistic studies are necessary to allow for the development of targeted therapeutics to prevent the translation of viral into atopic disease.","Kumar, Amit; Grayson, Mitchell H.",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,170,23

METHODS: We used data from a prospective multicenter reperfusion therapy registry to compare the care process—including the time from symptom onset to treatment, number of treated patients, and discharge disposition—and treatment outcomes between before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. RESULTS: Upon the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, the number of patients receiving endovascular treatment to decrease temporarily but considerably. The use of emergency medical services by stroke patients increased from 91.5% before to 100.0% during the COVID-19 outbreak (p=0.025), as did the median time from symptom onset to hospital visit [median (interquartile range), 91.0 minutes (39.8–277.0) vs. 176.0 minutes (56.0–391.5), p=0.029].

We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week’s survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants’ desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding “Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,” to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, “Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public.” PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.","Bartels, Sophia M.; Gora Combs, Katherine; Lazard, Allison J.; Shelus, Victoria; Davis, C.

All data were surveyed by questionnaires online and offline, and participants were required to fill in the monthly average of daily step counts were recorded an application on participants’ smartphone devices from Pre-COVID-19 (2019 year) and during COVID-19 (2020 year). Participants were 834 adults (males: 54.4%, female: 45.6%) and all statistical analyses were summarized by SPSS 25.0 program. The monthly average of daily step counts was 6747.09 during Pre-COVID-19, but the PA during COVID-19 was 5812.11 daily step counts per month. Also, there were significant pairwise differences between average PA Pre-COVID-19 and each level of social distancing (p < 0.001). After COVID-19, the participants who slept less than 7 h decreased by 3.6%, while those who slept more than 9 h increased by that much. As a result of BW, 269 participants responded their BW changed during COVID-19, and 199 of them reported they gained BW during COVID-19 (74.0%). Although self-reported questionnaires may have led to an under-or over-estimation of ST and BW, the present study found that the environment in which the COVID-19 is prevalent had adverse relationships on PA, ST, and BW. Therefore, it is important to identify strategies to motivate individuals for remaining physically active and getting adequate sleep while maintaining social distancing due to the presence of the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Park, Jeong-Hui; Yoo, Eunhye; Kim, Youngdeok; Lee, Jung-Min",Int J Environ Res Public Health,170,1

First, a novel mutation-immune model is proposed to modify the classical SIR model to simulate the transmission of mutable viruses that can be permanently immunized in small-world networks. Then, the influences of the size, coordination number and disorder parameter of the small-world network on the spread of the epidemic are analyzed in detail. Finally, the influences of mutation cycle and infection rate on epidemic transmission in small-world network are investigated further. The results show that the structure of the small-world network and the virus mutation cycle have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic. For viruses that can be permanently immunized, virus mutation is equivalent to making the immune cycle of human beings from infinite to finite. The dynamical behavior of the modified SIR epidemic model changes from an irregular, low-amplitude evolution at small disorder parameter to a spontaneous state of wide amplitude oscillations at large disorder parameter. Moreover, similar transition can also be found in increasing mutation cycle parameter. The maximum valid variation mutation decreases with the increase of disorder parameter and coordination number, but increase with respect to system size. In addition above, as the infection rate increases, the fraction of the infected increases and then decreases. As the mutation cycle increases, the time-average fraction of the infected and the infection rate corresponding to the maximum time-average fraction of the infected also decrease. As one conclusion, the results could give a deep understanding Pandemic with mutation and permanent immune spreading, from viewpoint of small-world network.","Cao, Shengli; Feng, Peihua; Wang, Wei; Shi, Yayun; Zhang, Jiazhong",Nonlinear Dyn,170,1

The sustainability of healthcare systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study was aimed at the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCW in a German hospital, as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. METHODS: Between March and June 2020, we performed this study using a combination of RT-PCR test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ELISA to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCW in a German hospital by repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPS and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. In three participants (0.34%) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. CONCLUSION: Our study reports low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. It might, however, indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees. Our study protocol may serve as a thought-provoking example for future pandemic containment protocols in hospitals.","Herzberg, Jonas; Vollmer, Tanja; Fischer, Bastian; Becher, Heiko; Becker, Ann-Kristin; Sahly, Hany; Honarpisheh, Human; Guraya, Salman Yousuf; Strate, Tim; Knabbe, Cornelius",Int J Infect Dis,170,11

METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar searches were carried out using the keywords. Pertinent clinical information related to pediatric otolaryngology was reviewed from journals, Texas Medical Board guidelines as well as institutional guidelines. Updated information from the Centers for Disease Control through social media was identified via Google search. STUDY DESIGN: Safety measures and clinical work-flow protocols were developed to protect patients, families, and staff. Protocols included a rotation schedule for providers and ancillary staff, guidelines for in-clinic visits and alteration to surgical block and surgical case cadence to minimize exposure of providers and staff to COVID-19. Algorithms and guidelines were reviewed and revisions made at each phase of the pandemic related to in-clinic visits, telemedicine visits, and surgical cases. CONCLUSION: In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, otolaryngologists and pediatric otolaryngologists are amongst sub-specialties with an increased risk of exposure. It is imperative that a modification in clinical workflow is created to minimize the risk of exposure to providers and staff while continuing to provide care to patients.

This study aimed to investigate how the range of ready meals in Australian supermarkets has changed from 2014 to 2020, and how products vary by price, serving size, nutrient composition and Health Star Rating. Product information was obtained from the FoodTrack™ packaged food database for the years 2014 to 2019 and from an instore audit of products available in Adelaide, Australia for 2020. There was a 13% annual average increase in the number of ready meals available in supermarkets. Serving size did not change (median 350 g, p-trend = 0.100) and price increased modestly from 2014 to 2020 (median $1.67 to $1.79/100 g, p-trend < 0.001), with chilled ready meals being the most expensive. A modest decrease in sodium density from 2014 to 2020 (median 275 to 240 mg/100 g, p-trend < 0.001) was seen. However, the category has a wide range in Health Star Ratings and nutrient composition, highlighting the importance of appropriate consumer choice to optimise health benefits.

The COVID19 pandemic has made it necessary to abruptly adjust outpatient care methods in various medical settings that needlessly require consultations in person to monitor and change the disease management of patients in specific risk groups. People with diabetes represent a vulnerable population who need to be protected from avoidable outpatient clinic visits, particularly in times of influenza or other pandemic outbreaks. However, the treatment and care of patients with diabetes and its comorbidities require careful and regular monitoring and therapy adjustments by medical staff. Advanced age or cognitive impairment and insufficient access to the health care system due to low socioeconomic status can complicate the use of possible alternatives to in-person consultations in outpatient clinics or physicians' offices. Telemedicine solutions may offer suitable alternatives to standard face-to-face consultations in outpatient settings and provide sufficient access to appropriate diabetes care. Nevertheless, telemedicine methods for monitoring diabetes issues are yet to find widespread use due to numerous barriers, such as a lack of acceptance and doubt about its time- and cost-effectiveness, availability, and potential technical and regulatory issues. This article offers an overview of existing applications that provide telemedicine diabetes care. Furthermore, it discusses potential ways to restructure and revolutionize diabetes outpatient care.","Aberer, Felix; Hochfellner, Daniel A.; Mader, Julia K.",Diabetes Ther,170,16

The rationale for this design was to drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity while avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). METHODS: We explored the set of computationally predicted SARS-CoV-2 HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, examining protein source, concurrent human/murine coverage, and population coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, sequence conservation, source protein abundance, and coverage of high frequency HLA alleles. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering for surface accessibility, sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. RESULTS: From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. From 3730 (MHC-I) and 5045 (MHC-II) candidate ligands, 292 CD8(+) and 284 CD4(+) T cell epitopes were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we proposed a set of 22 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies. We curated a dataset of ~ 1000 observed T cell epitopes from convalescent COVID-19 patients across eight studies, showing 8/15 recurrent epitope regions to overlap with at least one of our candidate peptides. Of the 22 candidate vaccine peptides, 16 (n = 10 T cell epitope optimized; n = 6 B cell epitope optimized) were manually selected to decrease their degree of sequence overlap and then synthesized. The immunogenicity of the synthesized vaccine peptides was validated using ELISpot and ELISA following murine vaccination. Strong T cell responses were observed in 7/10 T cell epitope optimized peptides following vaccination. Humoral responses were deficient, likely due to the unrestricted conformational space inhabited by linear vaccine peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we find our selection process and vaccine formulation to be appropriate for identifying T cell epitopes and eliciting T cell responses against those epitopes. Further studies are needed to optimize prediction and induction of B cell responses, as well as study the protective capacity of predicted T and B cell epitopes.

National, state, and local governments employed precautions, including mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing policies, to alleviate the burden on healthcare workers and slow the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) virus until an efficacious vaccine was made widely available. By early spring of 2021, three effective and well-tolerated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines emerged and underwent broad distribution. Throughout the course of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, several key logistical and psychological issues surfaced. Of these, access to vaccines and vaccination hesitancy are cited as two substantial hindrances towards vaccination. Noting the demand for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and its highly sensitive storage requirements, accurate dose allocation is critical for vaccinating the population quickly and successfully. Here, we propose the use of social data as a tool to predict vaccination participation by correlating Google searches with state-level daily vaccination. We identified a temporal and regionally-ubiquitous Google search syntax that broadly captures daily vaccination trends. By correlating trends in the search syntax with daily vaccination rates, we were able to quantify the correlation and identify optimal lag periods between Google searches and daily vaccination. This work highlights the importance of analyzing social data as a metric to effectively arrange vaccination roll-outs, identify voluntary vaccination participation, and identify inflection points in vaccination participation. In addition, social data assessments can help direct dose allocation, identify geographic areas that may seek, but lack, access to the vaccines, and actively prepare for fluctuations in vaccination demands.","McCarthy, Alec D; McGoldrick, Daniel J; Holubeck, Phil A; Cohoes, Cavan; Bilek, Laura D",Cureus,170,16

METHODS: This was a retrospective and comparative study conducted on patients with DME. Main outcome measures were mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to month 4. RESULTS: Forty-three eyes (23 eyes in the anti-VEGF group and 20 eyes in the DEX group) were included. Mean BCVA significantly improved from 37.7 ± 25.3 and 35.7 ± 22.0 letters at baseline to 45.4 (23.9) (mean adjusted BCVA improvement 7.6 ± 20.8 letters, p = 0.033) and 46.1 ± 26.0 (mean adjusted BCVA improvement 10.6 ± 15.9 letters, p = 0.049) at month 4 in the anti-VEGF and DEX groups, respectively, with no significant differences between study groups (mean adjusted BCVA difference 2.8 letters, 95% CI − 9.4 to 14.9 letters, p = 0.648). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of eyes that achieved a BCVA improvement of ≥ 5, ≥ 10, and ≥ 15 letters between groups. CRT was significantly reduced from baseline to month 4 in both DEX (mean adjusted CRT reduction 167.3 ± 148.2 µm, p = 0.012) and anti-VEGF groups (mean adjusted CRT reduction 109.9 ± 181.9 µm, p < 0.001), with no differences between them (mean adjusted CRT difference 56.1 µm, 95% CI − 46.0 to 158.2 µm, p = 0.273). Of 20 eyes in the DEX group, 16 (80.0%) and 9 (45.0%) eyes achieved a CRT reduction of ≥ 20% from baseline at 2 months and at 4 months, respectively.

Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. Results: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. Conclusions: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. As home specimen collection options receive regulatory approval, they should be scaled rapidly by health systems.","Siegler, Aaron J; Hall, Eric; Luisi, Nicole; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Wilde, Gretchen; Sanchez, Travis; Bradley, Heather; Sullivan, Patrick S",,170,20

Antibiotics are often inappropriately used for the treatment of pharyngitis, which can contribute to antimicrobial resistance, therefore non-antibiotic treatments which have broad antiseptic effects may be more appropriate. Amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) are present in some antiseptic lozenges and have established benefits in providing symptomatic relief and some in vitro antiviral action. METHODS: Seven bacterial species associated with pharyngitis, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and Staphylococcus aureus, were exposed to an AMC/DCBA lozenge dissolved in artificial saliva. In vitro bactericidal activity was measured as a log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs). RESULTS: Bactericidal activity was recorded against all organisms after 1 minute. Greater than 3 log(10) reductions in CFUs were observed at 1 minute for S. pyogenes (log(10) reduction CFU/mL ± SD, 5.7±0.1), H. influenza (6.1±0.1), A. haemolyticum (6.5±0.0) and F. necrophorum (6.5±0.0), at 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae (6.3±0.0) and M. catarrhalis (5.0±0.9) and at 10 minutes for S. aureus (3.5±0.1). CONCLUSION: An AMC/DCBA lozenge demonstrated a greater than 99.9% reduction in CFUs against all tested species within 10 minutes, which is consistent with the time a lozenge remains in the mouth. Patients with uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis may benefit from the antibacterial action of antiseptic AMC/DCBA lozenges. Furthermore, AMC/DCBA lozenges may be more relevant and appropriate than antibiotics for pharyngitis associated with a self-limiting viral URTI.","Matthews, Derek; Atkinson, Robert; Shephard, Adrian",Int J Gen Med,170,20

We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of HCoV that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting. HCoV was detected in 28 (11%) of the 261 clinical specimens obtained from patients presenting with symptoms of RTI ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia. Only 1 (0.4%) of the 243 control specimens obtained from patients without symptoms of RTI showed the presence of HCoV.

COVID-19 and responses to the pandemic could undermine food production, processing and marketing, but the most concerning impacts are on the demand-side – economic and physical access to food. This paper identifies three complementary frameworks that can contribute to understanding these effects, which are expected to persist into the post-pandemic phase, after lockdowns are lifted. FAO’s ‘four pillars’– availability, access, stability and utilisation – and the ‘food systems’ approach both provide holistic frameworks for analysing food security. Sen’s ‘entitlement’ approach is useful for disaggregating demand-side effects on household production-, labour-, trade- and transfer-based entitlements to food. Drawing on the strengths of each of these frameworks can enhance the understanding of the pandemic’s impacts on food security, while also pinpointing areas for governments and other actors to intervene in the food system, to protect the food security of households left vulnerable by COVID-19 and public responses.","Devereux, Stephen; Béné, Christophe; Hoddinott, John",Food Secur,170,24

Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=354; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=939; 72%). Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from <1% in early November, 2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians 5.8x10 (6) and 2.0 x10 (5) IU/ml respectively; p=2x10 (-15)). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seronegative and seropositive subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (4.0x10 (6) and 1.6x10 (6) IU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects and resistance to seroconversion indicate less effective clearance by innate and adaptive immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 strain, viral loads and antibody status define subgroups for analysis of treatment efficacy.","Ratcliff, Jeremy; Nguyen, Dung; Fish, Matthew; Rynne, Jennifer; Jennings, Aislinn; Williams, Sarah; Al-Beidh, Farah; Bonsall, David; Evans, Amy; Golubchik, Tanya; Gordon, Anthony C; Lamikanra, Abigail; Tsang, Pat; Ciccone, Nick A; Leuscher, Ullrich; Slack, Wendy; Laing, Emma; Mouncey, Paul R; Ziyenge, Sheba; Oliveira, Marta; Ploeg, Rutger; Rowan, Kathryn M; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Roberts, David J; Menon, David K; Estcourt, Lise; Simmonds, Peter; Harvala, Heli",J Infect Dis,170,27

The amplification could be finished in 45 min under isothermal condition at 62 °C by employing a set of four primers targeting VP2 gene of PPV. LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity than PCR, with a detection limit of 5 copies of PPV genomic DNA per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including canine parvovirus, parvovirus B19, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine peudorabies virus. The detection rate of PPV LAMP for 125 clinical samples was 97.6% and appeared higher than that of PCR method. The result indicated the potential usefulness of the technique as a simple, rapid procedure for the detection of PPV.","Chen, Hao-tai; Zhang, Jie; Yang, Sheng-hai; Ma, Li-na; Ma, Yan-ping; Liu, Xiang-tao; Cai, Xue-peng; Zhang, Yong-guang; Liu, Yong-sheng",J Virol Methods,170,10

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, tick borne encephalitis virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described. We summarize some major human outbreaks caused by consumption of sheep milk and products made thereof, and finally discuss their implications.","van den Brom, René; de Jong, Aarieke; van Engelen, Erik; Heuvelink, Annet; Vellema, Piet",Small Rumin Res,170,16

METHODS: This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with their experience (P = 0.701). Five of six senior residents responded that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS. CONCLUSION: This early experience suggests that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits. Residency programs should consider offering senior resident-performed ISBCS to select patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Tiffany A; Chen, Stephanie P; Ahmad, Tessnim R; Pasricha, Neel D; Parikh, Neeti; Ramanathan, Saras",Indian J Ophthalmol,170,20

All these are zoonotic infection which means these has transmitted from animal to human. Another similarity amongst these infections is that bat is supposed to be primary reservoir for these viruses. 2019-nCoV was reported by WHO on 31 December 2020 which is spreading with alarming rate. WHO has considered this infection as pandemic which means that if the infection is misled then it will spread fear and will cause unnecessary suffering and death. The onset of infection shows general symptoms of flu which later on develops to pneumonia. The main challenge of the infection is that a defined vaccine or medicine is still under trial. Treatment is done on the basis of symptoms and recovery is dependent on the immune response of the patients. This review article is based on meta-analysis of the data where the relation between reproduction number (R(0)) and infection rate is well depicted. Most of the countries has R(0) > 1 which says the infection is epidemic. Symptoms and possible treatment till date is well defined in this paper.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to understand the factors associated with underuse of EA by caregivers of pediatric patients with food allergy. METHODS: A survey was administered to 200 caregivers of pediatric patients with food allergies to assess most severe lifetime allergic reaction, EA education, use and factors associated with incorrect use or underutilization. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four surveys were completed; 118 (72%) of lifetime most severe reactions warranted EA use, but the EA was used in only 45 (38.1%). Reasons caregivers indicated for not administering the EA included: reactions did not seem severe enough, it was the patient’s first allergic reaction, use of other medication, and fear of using EA. CONCLUSION: Multiple factors contribute to underuse of EA for the treatment of severe allergic reactions. Results from this study highlight the need for continuous EA education in caregivers of and pediatric patients with food allergies, using a mutlipronged approach targeting clear symptom recognition and alleviation of fear of EA use.","Glassberg, Brittany; Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna; Wang, Julie",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,170,20

According to current available data, the cytokine storm appears to be the most life-threatening symptom of severe COVID-19 cases accompanied with lung fibrosis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of soluble β-galactoside-binding lectin families, has been implicated as a key regulator in various inflammation conditions in addition to its well-documented roles in cancer. The pro-inflammatory activity of Gal-3 in the inflammatory response and lung fibrosis of COVID-19 has been proposed by emerging studies, which suggested that inhibition of Gal-3 may represent a novel treatment approach for COVID-19 patients. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. ICC accounts for 10–25% of primary liver cancers with limited therapeutic options, which has higher incidence in Asian countries, particularly in China. Cancer patients, including ICC patients, are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their impaired immune system. It is thus undoubtedly a challenge for our oncology department to establish effective treatment strategies under the influence of the COVID-19 crisis. According to our management procedures in the COVID-19 era, emergency treatment will be applied to ICC patients who are under life-threatening conditions, despite the COVID-19 infection. To the best of our knowledge, the modulatory function of Gal-3 in ICC is still barely explored to date. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Gal-3 for ICC patients or those comprised with COVID-19, we herein report our preliminary investigation into roles of Gal-3 in ICC. Our results exhibited that the expression of Gal-3 was significantly up-regulated in ICC tissues, and a significant correlation was observed between its overexpression and malignant progression of ICC cells. We further discussed the activity and possible molecular mechanisms of Gal-3 in ICC, which may pave the ways for further exploring the possibility of Gal-3 as a potential therapeutic target for treating ICC patients or those with COVID-19-related conditions.","Li, Hao; Li, Jianmin; Xiao, Wei; Zhang, Yujing; Lv, Yuan; Yu, Xing; Zheng, Jiao",Front Mol Biosci,170,1

However, limited information is available for risk stratification in PIV-infected patients with hematologic malignancy with or without HCT. Patients with hematologic malignancy diagnosed with PIV from January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively included in a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as the detection of PIV in a nasopharyngeal sample with URTI symptoms without new pulmonary infiltrates. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined as detection of PIV in either upper or lower respiratory tract samples with new pulmonary infiltrates, with or without hypoxia. PIV-associated mortality was defined as death with respiratory failure and persistent LRTI within 90 days after diagnosis. The study included 143 adult patients. Of these, 55 (38%) progressed to or initially presented with LRTI. Among these, 22 (40%) died from PIV-associated mortality. An immunodeficiency risk score was developed from associated risk factors using a multivariable Cox regression model. Patients were stratified into low (0–2), moderate (3–5), and high risk (6–8) groups with PIV-associated mortalities of 0%, 9%, and 67%, respectively (p < 0.005, Harrell’s C-index = 0.84). PIV infection can result in substantial mortality in patients with hematologic malignancy if it progresses to LRTI.

Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia. METHODS: For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation.

Since ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), ensuring optimal personal-protective equipment (PPE) preparedness is important. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate PPE-preparedness across intensive care units (ICUs) in six Asia-Pacific countries during the initial phase of COVID-19 pandemic, defined as World Health Organization (WHO) guideline-adherence, training healthcare workers (HCWs), procuring stocks and responding appropriately to suspected cases. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was circulated to ICUs from Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India and Philippines in 633 Level II/III ICUs. FINDINGS: 263 intensivists responded, representing 231 individual ICUs eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68%-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. 97% either conformed to or exceeded WHO recommendations for PPE-practice. 59% employed airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol-generation-procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock-awareness (best in HK/Singapore/NZ). High-flow-nasal-oxygenation and non-invasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7%, 83.3% respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50%, 80% respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. 38% reported not having specialized airway teams. Showering and “buddy-systems” were underutilized. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). CONCLUSIONS: Many ICUs in the Asian-Pacific reported suboptimal PPE-preparedness in several domains, particularly related to PPE-training, practice and stock-awareness, which requires remediation. Adoption of low-cost approaches such as buddy-systems should be encouraged. The complete avoidance of high-flow nasal oxygenation reported by several intensivists needs reconsideration. Consideration must be given to standardise PPE guidelines to minimize practice variations. Urgent research to evaluate PPE-preparedness and SARS-CoV-2 transmission is required.","Rajamani, Arvind; SUBRAMANIAM, Ashwin; SHEKAR, Kiran; HAJI, Jumana; LUO, Jinghang; BIHARI, Shailesh; WONG, Wai Tat; GULLAPALLI, Navya; RENNER, Markus; Alcancia, Claudia Maria; Ramanathan, Kollengode",Aust Crit Care,170,17

Of these 82 patients, 35 (43%) were declined for LT, 27 (33%) were wait‐listed for LT, 5 (6%) improved, and 15 (18%) died. Psychosocial factors were the most common reasons for being declined for LT (49%). Predictors for listing and receiving LT on multivariate analysis included Hispanic race (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; P = 0.003), Asian race (OR, 1.52; P = 0.02), non‐Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.49; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (OR, 1.38; P = 0.04), serum albumin (OR, 1.13; P = 0.01), and Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD)‐Na (OR, 1.02; P = 0.003). Public insurance (i.e., Medicaid) was a predictor of not being listed for LT on multivariate analysis (OR, 0.77; P = 0.02). Excluding patients declined for psychosocial reasons, predictors of being declined for LT on multivariate analysis included Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF‐C) score >51.5 (OR, 1.26; P = 0.03), acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade 3 (OR, 1.41; P = 0.01), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (OR, 1.38; P = 0.01), and respiratory failure (OR, 1.51; P = 0.01).

The first foci started and the first dead infected individual was from Hilal which refers mainly to the role or rural places in starting and transmission of COVID-19 in Iraq. Many of the infections resulted in non-traveling persons because they were contaminated by contact (96%). Therefore, contact is perceived to be the best-recognized form of transmission.

RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patient’s family members: 0.006, 95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in critical care. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the health benefits of averting 1 COVID-19 infection in the United States are substantial. Efforts to curb infections must weigh the costs against these benefits.","Basu, Anirban; Gandhay, Varun J.",Value Health,170,1

Presently, there are no clinically approved drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Herein, we discovered Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral activity showing a strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction. Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for the clinical development of potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Olaleye, Omonike A.; Kaur, Manvir; Onyenaka, Collins; Adebusuyi, Tolu",Heliyon,170,20

This study aims to examine how fact-checking habit influences COVID-19 knowledge in the COVID-19 infodemic. Study Design This study uses a cross-sectional survey. Methods During the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, we conducted an online survey and collected data from 3000 representative Chinese internet users. The study measured COVID-19 knowledge as a dependent variable, fact-checking habit as an independent variable, and general science knowledge and negative emotion as moderators. Internet use and several demographic factors were used as control variables. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between fact-checking habit and COVID-19 knowledge as a function of science knowledge and negative emotion. Results Fact-checking habit was negatively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, and the relationship was moderated by general science knowledge and negative emotion. For those with less science knowledge or higher levels of negative emotion, COVID-19 knowledge was lower with the increase of experience in fact-checking. Conclusions During a pandemic, individuals may not be able to obtain high-quality information, even if they regularly fact-check information, and especially when they lack knowledge about science or are influenced by negative emotion. To promote health knowledge during a public health crisis, basic science literacy must be promoted and the psychological impact of the crisis on the population must also be considered.","Yu, Wenting; Shen, Fei",Public Health,170,7

Based on the latest scientific literature published up to May 1, 2021 and the PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science database searches, keywords related to SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the thyroid gland and benign thyroid diseases were searched. COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include non-thyroid syndrome, hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. The authors paid special attention to the treatment of thyroid disease during the pandemic. The emphasis was on radioiodine therapy, which is of high clinical value due to the lower risk of neutropenia or agranulocytosis. It is currently unknown whether COVID-19 may lead to de novo thyroid dysfunction or if it can aggravate an existing thyroid disease. Patients with uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis are in a risk group for complications (e.g., cytokine storm) from any infection (especially from SARS-CoV-2 infection). Moreover, this group of patients should receive more extensive care, bearing in mind the neutropenia from taking antithyroid drugs, which may mask the symptoms of COVID-19.","Czarnywojtek, Agata; Ochmanska, Alicja; Zgorzalewicz-Stachowiak, Malgorzata; Sawicka-Gutaj, Nadia; Matyjaszek-Matuszek, Beata; Wozniak, Magdalena; Ruchala, Marek",Adv Clin Exp Med,170,7

A machine learning algorithm was developed in order to identify a subpopulation of COVID-19 patients for whom hydroxychloroquine was associated with improved survival; this population might be relevant for study in a clinical trial. A pragmatic trial was conducted at six United States hospitals. We enrolled COVID-19 patients that were admitted between 10 March and 4 June 2020. Treatment was not randomized. The study endpoint was mortality; discharge was a competing event. Hazard ratios were obtained on the entire population, and on the subpopulation indicated by the algorithm as suitable for treatment. A total of 290 patients were enrolled. In the subpopulation that was identified by the algorithm, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a statistically significant (p = 0.011) increase in survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11–0.75). Adjusted survival among the algorithm indicated patients was 82.6% in the treated arm and 51.2% in the arm not treated. No association between treatment and mortality was observed in the general population. A 31% increase in survival at the end of the study was observed in a population of COVID-19 patients that were identified by a machine learning algorithm as having a better outcome with hydroxychloroquine treatment. Precision medicine approaches may be useful in identifying a subpopulation of COVID-19 patients more likely to be proven to benefit from hydroxychloroquine treatment in a clinical trial.","Burdick, Hoyt; Lam, Carson; Mataraso, Samson; Siefkas, Anna; Braden, Gregory; Dellinger, R.

Our IRB-approved observational study included consecutive 241 adult patients (> 18 years; 105 females; 136 males) with RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent non-contrast chest CT at one of the two tertiary care hospitals (site A: Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; site B: Firoozgar Hospital Iran). We recorded patient age, gender, comorbid conditions, laboratory values, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and final outcome (recovery or death). Two thoracic radiologists reviewed all chest CTs to record type, extent of pulmonary opacities based on the percentage of lobe involved, and severity of respiratory motion artifacts. Thin-section CT images were processed with the prototype (Siemens Healthineers) to obtain quantitative features including lung volumes, volume and percentage of all-type and high-attenuation opacities (≥ −200 HU), and mean HU and standard deviation of opacities within a given lung region. These values are estimated for the total combined lung volume, and separately for each lung and each lung lobe. Multivariable analyses of variance (MANOVA) and multiple logistic regression were performed for data analyses. About 26% of chest CTs (62/241) had moderate to severe motion artifacts. There were no significant differences in the AUCs of quantitative features for predicting disease severity with and without motion artifacts (AUC 0.94–0.97) as well as for predicting patient outcome (AUC 0.7–0.77) (p > 0.5). Combination of the volume of all-attenuation opacities and the percentage of high-attenuation opacities (AUC 0.76–0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.82) had higher AUC for predicting ICU admission than the subjective severity scores (AUC 0.69–0.77, 95% CI 0.69–0.81). Despite a high frequency of motion artifacts, quantitative features of pulmonary opacities from chest CT can help differentiate patients with favorable and adverse outcomes.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bezerra Cavalcanti Rockenbach, Marcio Aloisio; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Doda Khera, Ruhani; Bizzo, Bernardo C.; Buch, Varun; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Mohseni, Iman; Mitschke, Matthias; Zimmermann, Mathis; Durlak, Felix; Rauch, Franziska; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K.",J Digit Imaging,170,20

The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the closure of educational institutions. This situation kept students socially distant, with little adaptation time, interfering with their quality of life. METHODS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of life of higher education students in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 775 students were selected by convenience sampling. Study with a quantitative, descriptive, correlational approach. The WHOQOL-bref instrument adapted from WHO was applied. Data analysis was undertaken using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. RESULTS: Students' self-assessment about Quality of Life is globally superior to the self-assessment with their satisfaction with health, where the female students have lower average values than the male students. The WHOQOL-bref domains referring to Quality of Life with higher values were the Physical and the Environment ones, with the Social Relations and Psychological domains having the lowest values. CONCLUSIONS: The development of this study made it possible to achieve the objective set. The domain of social relations has low average values, with students from IPSantarem standing out, with lower self-assessment of QoL in this domain, compared to those from IPLeiria. In the psychological domain, the low average values in both institutes stand out, especially in IPLeiria, where the average is less than 50%, in both genders.","Figueiredo, Maria do Carmo; Amendoeira, José; Rosa, Marta; Matos, Rui; Silva, Mário; Gonzaga, Luís",Eur J Public Health,170,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin resistance was induced in rats with a fructose-rich diet and confirmed from baseline analysis of FBS (>250 mg/dl), insulin (>25 µIU/ml), and HOMA-IR (>10). For 12 weeks, the insulin-resistant rats were treated exclusively with 5000 mg/kg b.w avicularin (DAvi) or by dietary placement on lettuce (DLet) or a combination of both and compared with non-insulin resistant rats. RESULTS: Avicularin reversed alterations in HbA1c and insulin levels. DLet produced no significant effect on the incretins GLP 1 (P=0.909) and GIP (P=0.990), but DAvi slightly stimulated GLP 1 but not GIP. A strong positive correlation was found between improved β-cell responsiveness and the insulin signaling molecules: Akt2 (r=0.7248), IRS 1 (r=0.5173), and PI3K (r=0.7892). Only the combined avicularin and lettuce reversed the Akt2 levels (P=0.728). The lettuce meal slightly stimulated PI3K but normalized IRS 1 while avicularin treatment slightly stimulated IRS 1 but restored the PI3K levels (P=0.815). The positive correlation between β-cell responsiveness and hexokinase (r=0.5959), PFK (r=0.6222), and PK (r=0.6591) activities were statistically significant. Alterations in glycolytic kinases were reversed by DLet and in combination with avicularin. CONCLUSION: A combined pharmacological and dietary approach with avicularin and lettuce is required to effectively reverse insulin resistance.","Amadi, Joy A.; Amadi, Peter U.; Njoku, Uche C.; Onitchi, Chioma L.",Iran J Basic Med Sci,170,16

The seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. RESULTS: BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent. The phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian strains of BRSV and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of BRSV.","Klem, Thea B; Rimstad, Espen; Stokstad, Maria",BMC Vet Res,170,16

Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Schulien, Isabel; Kemming, Janine; Oberhardt, Valerie; Wild, Katharina; Seidel, Lea M.; Killmer, Saskia; Sagar,; Daul, Franziska; Lago, Marilyn Salvat; Decker, Annegrit; Luxenburger, Hendrik; Binder, Benedikt; Bettinger, Dominik; Sogukpinar, Oezlem; Rieg, Siegbert; Panning, Marcus; Huzly, Daniela; Schwemmle, Martin; Kochs, Georg; Waller, Cornelius F.; Nieters, Alexandra; Duerschmied, Daniel; Emmerich, Florian; Mei, Henrik; Schulz, Axel; Llewellyn-Lacey, Sian; Price, David A.; Boettler, Tobias; Bengsch, Bertram; Thimme, Robert; Hofmann, Maike; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph",bioRxiv,170,20

By November 30, 2020, when this paper was written, 13.5 million cases were reported in the U.S. with over 268 000 deaths. Historically, vaccines have been one of the most effective and efficient technical tools for controlling a communicable disease. While the development of these vaccines has certainly been a challenge, it could be more challenging to achieve robust vaccine uptake because of many barriers. In this review, we focused on two types of barriers documented from long-term experience in the U.S.: structural and attitudinal. Structural barriers are systemic issues that impact one's ability to access a service, and they include time, transportation, cost, and clinic or outlet location; while attitudinal barriers are beliefs or perceptions that impact the willingness of at-risk individuals to seek out and/or accept a service. In the context of vaccination they include beliefs about the communicable disease, beliefs about vaccines, fear, and trust in healthcare and governmental agencies. Of the attitudinal barriers, public trust is a barrier that is of particular importance. In addition to affecting reception of vaccines, it may exacerbate disparities and reduce the likelihood of success of a vaccination program. Recommendations are made to overcome attitudinal barriers to help improve the effectiveness of vaccination programs for COVID-19 control in the U.S., such as building public support through bipartisan endorsements and leveraging social media platforms to promote vaccination.","Fisk, Rebecca J.",Glob Health J,170,1

BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID‐19 may experience MI during the course of the viral infection. However, this association is currently poorly understood. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients with concomitant COVID‐19 and MI who underwent coronary angiography. Quantitative and qualitative coronary angiography were analyzed by two observers in an independent core lab. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included, of whom 142 (93.4%) had COVID‐19 diagnosis confirmation. The median time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 5 (1–10) days. A total of 83 (54.6%) patients presented with ST‐elevation MI. The median angiographic Syntax score was 16 (9.0–25.3) and 69.0% had multi‐vessel disease. At least one complex lesion was found in 73.0% of patients, 51.3% had a thrombus containing lesion, and 57.9% had myocardial blush grades 0/1. The overall in‐hospital mortality was 23.7%.

The time series available for the analysis represent the purchases (expenditure and quantities) of all consumers and by income groups were used to compute price and quantity indices all the meats together and for each meat (i.e., beef, lamb, pork, poultry, and other meats) and fish. The changes in expenditure were decomposed into changes in prices, quantities purchased and changes in quality purchased (trading up/down in quality) i.e., whether cheaper meat or fish were purchased. A further extension of the analysis was produced by considering the evolution of calories, saturated fats and sodium per purchased quantity for meat and fish during the period of study. The results indicate that although the shares of quantities remained relatively constant, the calories, saturated fats and sodium from the purchased quantities showed an increasing trend, indicating that most of the incomes groups were lowering the nutritional quality of their meat and fish purchases. This is clearly shown by the fact “other meats” represents on average 39 percent of the calories contributed by meat and fish, 49 per cent of the saturated fats and about 68 of the total sodium in meat and fish during the lockdown period.

Results show that the best classification performances can be achieved if ResNet152 is used. This CNN has achieved [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] up to 0.94, suggesting the possibility of applying CNN to the classification of the clinical picture of COVID-19 patients using an X-ray image of the lungs. When higher layers are frozen during the training procedure, higher [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values are achieved. If ResNet152 is utilized, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values up to 0.96 are achieved if all layers except the last 12 are frozen during the training procedure.","Lorencin, Ivan; Baressi Šegota, Sandi; Anđelić, Nikola; Blagojević, Anđela; Šušteršić, Tijana; Protić, Alen; Arsenijević, Miloš; Ćabov, Tomislav; Filipović, Nenad; Car, Zlatan",J Pers Med,170,20

Although several drugs have been announced to be partially effective treatments for this disease, no approved vaccine is available. Here, we described the construction of a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum strain expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results showed that the spike gene with optimized codons could be efficiently expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum and exhibited high antigenicity. The highest protein yield was obtained under the following conditions: cells were induced with 50 ng/mL SppIP at 37 °C for 6–10 h. The recombinant spike (S) protein was stable under normal conditions and at 50 °C, pH = 1.5, or a high salt concentration. Recombinant L. plantarum may provide a promising food-grade oral vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Maopeng; Fu, Tingting; Hao, Jiayi; Li, Letian; Tian, Mingyao; Jin, Ningyi; Ren, Linzhu; Li, Chang",Int J Biol Macromol,170,24

However, the hallmark of the 1-3-7 strategy is timeliness, with strict deadlines for reporting and response to accelerate elimination. This paper outlines Thailand’s experience adapting and implementing the 1-3-7 strategy, including success factors such as a cross-sectoral Steering Committee, participation in a collaborative regional partnership, and flexible local budgets. The programme continues to evolve to ensure prompt and high-quality case management, capacity maintenance, and adequate supply of lifesaving commodities based on surveillance data.

We assessed IL-6 in a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with different degrees of disease severity, and compared it with clinical and laboratory findings. We found higher levels of IL-6 in patients with more severe pneumonia according to CURB-65 scale (p = 0.001), with ICU mechanical ventilation requirements (p = 0.02), and who subsequently died (p = 0.003). Of the clinical and analytical parameters analyzed in the current study, the serum levels of IL-6 was the most effective predictor of disease severity. From the data obtained in ROC curve analysis, we defined a cut-off point for serum IL-6 levels of 35 pg/mL above which both the risk of mortality (OR = 20.00, 95 % CI 4.214-94-912, p = 0.0001) and ICU admission (OR = 12.750, 95 % CI 2,159-75,3,3, p = 0.005) were increased.

Information regarding cardiac markers for precise risk-stratification is limited. We aim to discover sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarkers for optimizing management and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 2954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment from the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China from February 4 to April 10 were included in this retrospective cohort. Serum levels of cardiac markers were collected after admission. Coronary artery disease diagnosis and survival status were recorded. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing from different cohorts of non-COVID-19 were performed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. RESULTS: Among 2954 COVID-19 patients in the analysis, the median age was 60 years (50–68 years), 1461 (49.5%) were female, and 1515 (51.3%) were severe/critical. Compared to mild/moderate (1439, 48.7%) patients, severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of BNP (42 [24.6%] vs 7 [1.1%]), hs-TNI (38 [48.1%] vs 6 [1.0%]), α- HBDH (55 [10.4%] vs 2 [0.2%]), CK-MB (45 [36.3%] vs 12 [0.9%]), and LDH (56 [12.5%] vs 1 [0.1%]) had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to patients with normal levels. The same trend was observed in the ICU admission rate. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of BNP (52 [46.5%] vs 119 [16.5%]), hs-TNI (24 [26.7%] vs 9.6 [%], α- HBDH (86 [55.5%] vs 443 [34.4%]), CK-MB (27 [17.4%] vs 97 [7.5%]), and LDH (65 [41.9%] vs 382 [29.7%]), when compared with those without coronary artery disease. There was enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls. From regression analysis, patients with five elevated cardiac markers were at a higher risk of death (hazards ratio 3.4 [95% CI 2.4–4.8]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease represented a higher abnormal percentage of cardiac markers, accompanied by high mortality and ICU admission rate. BNP together with hs-TNI, α- HBDH, CK-MB and LDH act as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing coronary artery disease.

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative and sustainable strategies informed by comparative risk assessment are increasingly needed to ensure that local economic, social, demographic, and epidemiological risks and potentials are accounted for in the national COVID-19 responses.

It starts from viral adherence to host cells through an interaction between spike glycoprotein 1 (S1) containing a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). One of the useful strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection is to inhibit the attachment of RBD to ACE2. Therefore, the current work proposed potent peptides against SARS-CoV-2 infection by carrying out MM-PBSA calculation based on the binding of 52 antiviral peptides (AVPs) to RBD. Considering the binding free energies of AVPs to RBD, cyanovirin-N (CV-N) showed the strongest RBD binding affinity among 52 AVPs. Upon structural analysis of RBD complex with CV-N, it was observed that 12 of the 13 key residues of RBD binding to ACE2 were hijacked by CV-N. CV-N bound to RBD at a smaller affinity of 14.9 nM than that of ACE2 and inhibited the recruitment of S1 to human alveolar epithelial cells. Further analysis revealed that CV-N suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 18.52 μg/mL. This study demonstrated a drug screening for AVPs against SARS-CoV-2 and discovered a peptide with inspiring antiviral properties, which provided a promising strategy for the COVID-19 therapeutic approach.

The disease quickly spread to countries around the world and was transmitted in healthcare settings. Infection control professionals had to formulate a response to potential cases of SARS presenting to healthcare facilities. OBJECTIVE: To formulate and operationalize a plan for education and training of staff and to ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and adherence to infection control protocols to prevent SARS transmission in a large urban healthcare institution. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force was charged with maintaining up-to-date knowledge about the SARS epidemic and providing education and training to staff in the hospital and outlying clinics. Signage for SARS triage and SARS isolation was created. Policies and checklists were developed for designated patient areas, and SARS carts and boxes stocked with PPE were obtained for these areas. A new “observer” role was created to ensure adherence to isolation procedures when caring for SARS patients. An educational video was made for distribution to healthcare workers. RESULTS: The SARS task force developed a cohesive package of policies, procedures, signage, and patient education in multiple languages. We developed a system to supply PPE and education to staff who might care for SARS patients. A new video will make staff education more accessible, especially for those working off-site or during nontraditional hours. CONCLUSION: The SARS task force responded to an emerging infectious threat and is a model for continued response to potential biological emergencies.","Haas∗, J.; Saiman, L.",American Journal of Infection Control,170,22

We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS. METHODS: We tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection. Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia. SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. INTERPRETATION: Replication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.

In addition, infection of RAG1−/− or CXCL9−/− mice with a recombinant MHV expressing CXCL9 (MHV-CXCL9) resulted in protection from disease that correlated with reduced viral titers within the brain and NK cell-mediated protection in the liver. Survival in MHV-CXCL9-infected CXCL9−/− mice was associated with reduced viral burden within the brain that coincided with increased T cell infiltration. Similarly, viral clearance from the livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice was accelerated but independent of increased T cell or NK cell infiltration.

Questions included demographics, access to HIV/STI testing and HIV care, and sexual behaviours 3 months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. RESULTS: We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender. The median age was 28 years (IQR: 23–37 years), and 531 of 957 (55.5%) were of mixed ethnicity (mixed Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181 of 470) of cis-women, 58.4% (184 of 315) cis-men and 45.0% (27 of 60) non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% of cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants.

The use of convalescent plasma is one such option as convalescent plasma has previously been used for treating outbreaks of Ebola, influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory (SAR) viruses. Therefore, we carried out an early systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy and its effects on COVID-19 patient outcomes. A structured and rigorous systematic review was carried out that included all studies conducted on this topic between December 2019 and June 2020. A total of 10 studies containing a mix of case reports, case series, observational studies, and randomized control trials were identified. Most of the studies lacked randomization and included only small groups of patients. Considering the limitations in the design of current studies, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion. However, our results showed that plasma therapy produces notable improvements in patients' clinical symptoms and radiological and biochemical parameters associated with COVID-19 infection. Based on the available information, it is difficult to draw a tangible conclusion about whether plasma therapy improves patient mortality.

Despite the availability of vaccines or antiviral drugs, personal hygiene is considered as effective means as the first-hand measure against viral infections. The green tea catechins, in particular, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are known to exert potent antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated the green tea extract as a safe personal hygiene against viral infections. RESULTS: Using the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a model, we examined the duration of the viral inactivating activity of green tea extract (GTE) under prolonged storage at various temperature conditions. Even after the storage for 56 days at different temperatures, 0.1% GTE completely inactivated 10(6) PFU of the virus (6 log(10) reduction), and 0.01% and 0.05% GTE resulted in 2 log(10) reduction of the viral titers. When supplemented with 2% citric acid, 0.1% sodium benzoate, and 0.2% ascorbic acid as anti-oxidant, the inactivating activity of GTE was temporarily compromised during earlier times of storage. However, the antiviral activity of the GTE was steadily recovered up to similar levels with those of the same concentrations of GTE without the supplements, effectively prolonging the duration of the virucidal function over extended period. Cryo-EM and DLS analyses showed a slight increase in the overall size of virus particles by GTE treatment. The results suggest that the virucidal activity of GTE is mediated by oxidative crosslinking of catechins to the viral proteins and the change of physical properties of viral membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The durability of antiviral effects of GTE was examined as solution type and powder types over extended periods at various temperature conditions using human influenza A/H1N1 virus. GTE with supplements demonstrated potent viral inactivating activity, resulting in greater than 4 log(10) reduction of viral titers even after storage for up to two months at a wide range of temperatures. These data suggest that GTE-based antiviral agents could be formulated as a safe and environmentally friendly personal hygiene against viral infections.","Lee, Yun Ha; Jang, Yo Han; Kim, Young-Seok; Kim, Jinku; Seong, Baik Lin",J Biol Eng,170,18

Most of the universities in Vietnam were based on face to face learning until the sudden outbreak of COVID-19. This research study was conducted with 145 respondents and Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used for data analysis. The participants were undergraduate and post-graduate students in public and private universities who studied online during the pandemic in Vietnam. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors have an impact on students’ intentions to study online. The results show that institutional support and perceived enjoyment (satisfaction) affects the students’ intentions to study the course online in the future. Perceived enjoyment (PE) affects the online learning intentions (OLI) and PE is affected by ICT infrastructure and internet speed and access. Hence, this research adds new research variable defined as extrinsic factors (ICT infrastructure and access to the internet), which indirectly influences students’ intentions to learn online. Given the increased use of smart phones with this generation, it is advisable to integrate mobile technology in online learning and QR codes can be one of the ways to integrate that in the course materials. It is further recommended that to increase the perceived enjoyment of the students with the online learning, the lecturers might be encouraged to use videos, audios and instant messaging to contact and provide the feedback to the students. It is important for universities to prepare for any such future crisis. This study results will provide a useful insight to design the online courses effectively by considering all the factors impacting students’ intention and satisfaction.","Maheshwari, Greeni",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),170,1

Recent research has indicated that radio-logical images carry essential information about the COVID-19 virus. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted automated detection of lung infections may serve as a potential diagnostic tool. It can be augmented with conventional medical tests for tackling COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting COVID-19 and pneumonia using chest X-ray images. The proposed method can be described as a three-step process. The first step includes the segmentation of the raw X-ray images using the conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) for obtaining the lung images. In the second step, we feed the segmented lung images into a novel pipeline combining key points extraction methods and trained deep neural networks (DNN) for extraction of discriminatory features. Several machine learning (ML) models are employed to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lung images in the final step. A comparative analysis of the classification performance is carried out among the different proposed architectures combining DNNs, key point extraction methods, and ML models. We have achieved the highest testing classification accuracy of 96.6% using the VGG-19 model associated with the binary robust invariant scalable key-points (BRISK) algorithm. The proposed method can be efficiently used for screening of COVID-19 infected patients.","Bhattacharyya, Abhijit; Bhaik, Divyanshu; Kumar, Sunil; Thakur, Prayas; Sharma, Rahul; Pachori, Ram Bilas",Biomed Signal Process Control,170,19

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a prior probability of COVID-19 greater than 18%, at least two negative test results would be needed to lower the chances of COVID-19 below 5%. Caution is advised in generalizing these findings to other versions of the RT-PCR test that are being used in diverse geographic regions.","Padhye, N. S.",,170,9

Enormous amounts of resources were utilized to shift surgical practices to a “disaster footing” with most elective surgeons assuming new roles to offset the anticipated burden from surgical and medical personnel delivering acute care. As the number of COVID-19-infected patients began to plateau in the state of Ohio, a four-phase “Responsible Return to Surgery” approach was adopted in concert with the Ohio Department of Health and the Ohio Hospital Association. This approach was adopted understanding that a simple return to the status quo prior to the COVID-19 pandemic might be harmful to patients, providers, and staff. The discrete phases undertaken at our quaternary care institution for a responsible return to non-essential surgery are outlined with the goal of ensuring timely care, minimizing community transmission, and preserving personal protective equipment. Operationalizing these phases relied upon the widespread use of telehealth, systematic COVID-19 testing, and real-time monitoring of hospital and personal protective equipment resources.","Poulose, Benjamin K.; Phieffer, Laura S.; Mayerson, Joel; Like, Daniel; Forrest, L.

Soil, water, livestock and plant foods are directly or indirectly exposed to antibiotics due to their agricultural use or contamination. This selective pressure has acted synergistically to bacterial competition in nature to breed antibiotic-resistant (AR) bacteria. Research over the past few decades has focused on the emergence of AR pathogens in food products that can cause disease outbreaks and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but One Health approaches have lately expanded the focus to include commensal bacteria as ARG donors. Despite the attempts of national and international authorities of developed and developing countries to reduce the over-prescription of antibiotics to humans and the use of antibiotics as livestock growth promoters, the selective flow of antibiotic resistance transmission from the environment to the clinic (and vice-versa) is increasing. This review focuses on the mechanisms of ARG transmission and the hotspots of antibiotic contamination resulting in the subsequent emergence of ARGs. It follows the transmission of ARGs from farm to plant and animal food products and provides examples of the impact of ARG flow to clinical settings. Understudied and emerging antibiotic resistance selection determinants, such as heavy metal and biocide contamination, are also discussed here.","Skandalis, Nicholas; Maeusli, Marlène; Papafotis, Dimitris; Miller, Sarah; Lee, Bosul; Theologidis, Ioannis; Luna, Brian",Antibiotics (Basel),170,6

This study aims to compare the diagnostic value of clinical features and faecal immunochemical test (FIT) results to identify those at a higher risk of CRC, thereby facilitating effective triage of patients. METHODS: We undertook a review of all patients referred for investigation of CRC at our centre between September 2016 and June 2018. Patients were identified using a prospectively recorded local database. We performed a logistic regression analysis of factors associated with a diagnosis of CRC. RESULTS: One-thousand-and-seven-hundred-eighty-four patients with FIT results were included in the study. Change in bowel habit (CIBH) was the most common referring clinical feature (38.3%). Patients diagnosed with CRC were significantly older than those without malignancy (74.0 years vs 68.9 years, p = 0.0007). Male patients were more likely to be diagnosed with CRC than females (6.5% vs 2.5%, Chi-squared 16.93, p < 0.0001). CRC was diagnosed in 3.5% (24/684) with CIBH compared to 8.1% (6/74) with both CIBH and iron deficiency anaemia. No individual or combination of referring clinical features was associated with an increased diagnosis of CRC (Chi-squared, 8.03, p = 0.155). Three patients with negative FIT results (< 4 µg Hb/g faeces) were diagnosed with CRC (3/1027, 0.3%). The highest proportion of cancers detected was in the ≥ 100 µg Hb/g faeces group (55/181, 30.4%). CONCLUSION: In a multivariate model, FIT outperforms age, sex and all symptoms prompting referral. FIT has greater stratification value than any referral symptoms. FIT does have value in patients with iron deficiency anaemia.","Bailey, J. A.; Ibrahim, H.; Bunce, J.; Chapman, C. J.; Morling, J. R.; Simpson, J. A.; Humes, D.

It is therefore important to understand which PROs patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease consider most important to track for disease management. METHODS: Adult US patients within the ArthritisPower registry with ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia syndrome, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus were invited to select between 3 and 10 PRO symptom measures they felt were important to digitally track for their condition via the ArthritisPower app. Over the next 3 months, participants (pts) were given the option to continue tracking their previously selected measures or to remove/add measures at 3 subsequent monthly time points (month [m] 1, m2, m3). At m3, pts prioritized up to 5 measures. Measures were rank-ordered, summed, and weighted based on pts rating to produce a summary score for each PRO measure. RESULTS: Among pts who completed initial selection of PRO assessments at baseline (N = 253), 140 pts confirmed or changed PRO selections across m1–3 within the specified monthly time window (28 days ± 7). PROs ranked as most important for tracking were PROMIS Fatigue, Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Duration of Morning Joint Stiffness, and Sleep Disturbance. Patient’s preferences regarding the importance of these PROs were stable over time. CONCLUSION: The symptoms that rheumatology patients prioritized for longitudinal tracking using a smartphone app were fatigue, physical function, pain, and morning joint stiffness.
