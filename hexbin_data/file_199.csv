495,"Spatial dynamics of the 1918 influenza pandemic in England, Wales and the United States",2011-02-06,"There is still limited understanding of key determinants of spatial spread of influenza. The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale. To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the US. Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries. For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison. Early in the major wave, long distance infective interactions predominated, with local infection events more likely as the epidemic became widespread. For the US, with fewer more widely dispersed cities, statistical power was lacking to estimate population size dependence or the degree of density dependence, with the preferred model depending on distance only. We find that parameters estimated from the England and Wales dataset can be applied to the US data with no likelihood penalty.","Eggo, Rosalind M.; Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3033019/,199

In Danish pig herds, a H1N2 subtype named H1N2dk is one of the main circulating swIAV. In this cohort study, the infection dynamic of swIAV was evaluated in a Danish pig herd by sampling and PCR testing of pigs from two weeks of age until slaughter at 22 weeks of age. In addition, next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify and characterize the complete genome of swIAV circulating in the herd, and to examine the antigenic variability in the antigenic sites of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Overall, 76.6% of the pigs became PCR positive for swIAV during the study, with the highest prevalence at four weeks of age. Detailed analysis of the virus sequences obtained showed that the majority of mutations occurred at antigenic sites in the HA and NA proteins of the virus. At least two different H1N2 variants were found to be circulating in the herd; one H1N2 variant was circulating at the sow and nursery sites, while another H1N2 variant was circulating at the finisher site. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that individual pigs had recurrent swIAV infections with the two different H1N2 variants, but re-infection with the same H1N2 variant was also observed. Better understandings of the epidemiology, genetic and antigenic diversity of swIAV may help to design better health interventions for the prevention and control of swIAV infections in the herds.","Bhatta, Tarka Raj; Ryt-Hansen, Pia; Nielsen, Jens Peter; Larsen, Lars Erik; Larsen, Inge; Chamings, Anthony; Goecke, Nicole B.; Alexandersen, Soren",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551734/,199
16319,Sugammadex is associated with shorter hospital length of stay after open lobectomy for lung cancer: a retrospective observational study,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND: The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) is commonly used in hospitals to titrate medications for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), but may be difficult to apply to intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are too sick or otherwise unable to communicate. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency of CIWA-Ar monitoring among ICU patients with AWS and variation in CIWA-Ar monitoring across patient demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: The study included all adults admitted to an ICU in 2017 after treatment for AWS in the Emergency Department of an academic hospital that standardly uses the CIWA-Ar to assess AWS severity and response to treatment. Demographic and clinical data, including Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) assessments (an alternative measure of agitation/sedation), were obtained via chart review. Associations between patient characteristics and CIWA-Ar monitoring were tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: After treatment for AWS, only 56% (n = 54/97) of ICU patients were evaluated using the CIWA-Ar; 94% of patients had a documented RASS assessment (n = 91/97). Patients were significantly less likely to receive CIWA-Ar monitoring if they were intubated or identified as Black. CONCLUSIONS: CIWA-Ar monitoring was used inconsistently in ICU patients with AWS and completed less often in those who were intubated or identified as Black. These hypothesis-generating findings raise questions about the utility of the CIWA-Ar in ICU settings. Future studies should assess alternative measures for titrating AWS medications in the ICU that do not require verbal responses from patients and further explore the association of race with AWS monitoring.","Steel, Tessa L.; Giovanni, Shewit P.; Katsandres, Sarah C.; Cohen, Shawn M.; Stephenson, Kevin B.; Murray, Ben; Sobeck, Hillary; Hough, Catherine L.; Bradley, Katharine A.; Williams, Emily C.",Addict Sci Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988382/,199
19299,Multivariate meta-analysis of critical care meta-analyses: a meta-epidemiological study,2021-07-18,"This article provides an overview of diagnostic evaluation and ablation treatment assessment in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Only studies, in the English language from January 2010 to January 202, evaluating the diagnostic tools and assessment of ablative therapies in HCC patients were included. We found 173 clinical studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. HCC may be noninvasively diagnosed by imaging findings. Multiphase contrast-enhanced imaging is necessary to assess HCC. Intravenous extracellular contrast agents are used for CT, while the agents used for MRI may be extracellular or hepatobiliary. Both gadoxetate disodium and gadobenate dimeglumine may be used in hepatobiliary phase imaging. For treatment-naive patients undergoing CT, unenhanced imaging is optional; however, it is required in the post treatment setting for CT and all MRI studies. Late arterial phase is strongly preferred over early arterial phase. The choice of modality (CT, US/CEUS or MRI) and MRI contrast agent (extracelllar or hepatobiliary) depends on patient, institutional, and regional factors. MRI allows to link morfological and functional data in the HCC evaluation. Also, Radiomics is an emerging field in the assessment of HCC patients. Postablation imaging is necessary to assess the treatment results, to monitor evolution of the ablated tissue over time, and to evaluate for complications. Post- thermal treatments, imaging should be performed at regularly scheduled intervals to assess treatment response and to evaluate for new lesions and potential complications.","Granata, Vincenza; Grassi, Roberta; Fusco, Roberta; Belli, Andrea; Cutolo, Carmen; Pradella, Silvia; Grazzini, Giulia; La Porta, Michelearcangelo; Brunese, Maria Chiara; De Muzio, Federica; Ottaiano, Alessandro; Avallone, Antonio; Izzo, Francesco; Petrillo, Antonella",Infect Agent Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287696/,199

It also allows for adaptation of UV systems to specific disinfection processes and for the disinfection of specific microorganisms. Disinfection is generally modeled in terms of the survival, or its converse the inactivation rate, and may be rendered as a fraction or a percentage. Disinfection is invariably a logarithmic process, as is microbial growth. The disinfection rate of the microorganisms varies widely and is subject to many complexities, including shoulder effects, second stage decay, relative humidity effects, and photoreactivation. Not all these processes need be considered for every design application, but a familiarity with these effects is essential for understanding UV disinfection. Furthermore, not all of these processes can be completely and accurately modeled at present, but enough is known to adequately design reliable UV disinfection systems. All of these processes can be modeled with basic exponential equations and by using computational methods if necessary. For more detailed background information on theoretical decay models for general disinfection purposes see Kowalski (2006), Chick et al.

Existing filter methods predominantly focus only on the input data and do not take advantage of the external sources of correlations within feature groups to improve the classification accuracy. We propose a framework which facilitates supervised filter feature selection methods to exploit feature group information from external sources of knowledge and use this framework to incorporate feature group information into minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm, resulting in GroupMRMR algorithm. We show that GroupMRMR achieves high accuracy gains over mRMR (up to [Formula: see text]35%) and other popular filter methods (up to [Formula: see text]50%). GroupMRMR has same computational complexity as that of mRMR, therefore, does not incur additional computational costs. Proposed method has many real world applications, particularly the ones that use genomic, text and image data whose features demonstrate strong group structures.","Perera, Kushani; Chan, Jeffrey; Karunasekera, Shanika",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206161/,199

We use this framework to incorporate feature group information into Laplace Score algorithm. Our method achieves high accuracy compared to other popular unsupervised feature selection methods ([Formula: see text]30% maximum improvement of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)) with low computational costs ([Formula: see text]50 times lower than embedded methods on average).

While the demand for lung transplantation has steadily risen over the last few decades, the availability of donor grafts is limited, which have resulted in progressively longer waiting lists. In the early years of lung transplantation, only the ‘ideal’ donor grafts are considered for transplantation. Due to the donor shortages, there is ongoing discussion about the safe use of ‘suboptimal’ grafts to expand the donor pool. In this review, we will discuss the considerations around donor selection, donor-recipient matching, graft preparation and graft optimisation.","Jin, Zhaosheng; Hana, Zac; Alam, Azeem; Rajalingam, Shamala; Abayalingam, Mayavan; Wang, Zhiping; Ma, Daqing",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261511/,199
33718,Educators Reflect on the COVID‐19 Crisis,2020-05-11,"We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk‐averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID‐19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non‐COVID‐19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non‐COVID‐19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top‐most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst‐case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. An important finding of this study is that a central agency (FEMA) can act as a coordinator for sharing critical resources that are in short supply over time to add efficiency in the system. Moreover, through properly managing risk‐aversion of different entities (states) additional efficiency can be gained. An additional implication is that ramping up production early in the planning cycle allows to reduce shortfall significantly. An optimal timing of this production ramp‐up consideration can be based on a cost‐benefit analysis.","Mehrotra, Sanjay; Rahimian, Hamed; Barah, Masoud; Luo, Fengqiao; Schantz, Karolina",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7267382/,199

Theory predicts a “one step” reservation value strategy, but many subjects instead choose to set a high reservation value in order to learn about the distribution before adjusting based on their observations.

In some cases, this may even lead to unresponsive systems and unfinished jobs. HPC monitoring systems can aid users and support staff to identify problematic behavior and support optimization of problematic applications. The key issue is how to identify relevant applications? A profile of an application doesn’t allow identifying problematic phases during the execution but tracing of each individual I/O is too invasive. In this work, we split the execution into segments, i.e., windows of fixed size and analyze profiles of them. We develop three I/O metrics to identify three relevant classes of inefficient I/O behaviors, and evaluate them on raw data of 1,000,000 jobs on the supercomputer Mistral. The advantages of our method is that temporal information about I/O activities during job runtime is preserved to some extent and can be used to identify phases of inefficient I/O. The main contribution of this work is the segmentation of time series and computation of metrics (Job-I/O-Utilization, Job-I/O-Problem-Time, and Job-I/O-Balance) that are effective to identify problematic I/O phases and jobs.","Betke, Eugen; Kunkel, Julian",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295356/,199

In light of the steadily increasing foreign travel these infections in returning travellers are of growing importance. Older travellers and those with underlying diseases constitute a special risk group. The knowledge of pathogens endemic to foreign countries and of the respective clinical picture is essential for determining a suspected diagnosis, especially in patients not responding to a first empirical antibacterial treatment. The documentation of a thorough travel history is crucial for taking a possible exposure to specific pathogens into account and thus for guiding the diagnostic pathway. In addition to pathogens which primarily lead to an infection of the lungs, non-pulmonary infections, which can cause pulmonary symptoms, e.g. schistosomiasis and malaria also have to be considered. Two examples of infectious diseases of the lungs, which can only be acquired abroad, are melioidosis and coccidioidomycosis. While a pulmonary manifestation of melioidosis can take an acute and fulminant course associated with a high mortality rate, coccidioidomycosis primarily presents mostly as oligosymptomatic, but with a substantial latent period can lead to pulmonary manifestations that in their diversity resemble tuberculosis or malignancies.","Menner, N.; Cronen, T.",Pneumologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7424555/,199

Recently, anesthesiologists have increasingly focused their attention on the type of spontaneous breathing made by non-intubated patients with pulmonary disease cared for in an intensive care unit, and also patients with chronic pain receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. Prior to our modern understanding of respiratory physiology, Zen meditators recognized that breathing has a significant impact on a person’s mental state and general physical well-being. Examples of this knowledge regarding respiration include the beneficial effects of deep inhalation and slow exhalation on anxiety and general wellness. The classical literature has noted many suggestions for breathing and its psycho-physical effects. In the present review, we examine the effect of classical breathing methods and find an analogy between typical Yoga/Zen breathing and modern clinical respiratory therapy. Evidence is increasing about historical breathing and related meditation techniques that may be effective in modern clinical practice, especially in the field of anesthesiology, such as in improving respiratory function and reducing chronic pain.

Transcriptomic analysis showed that RV-infected cells have a more blunted host response with fewer DEGs than IAV or IBV-infected cells. IFNL1 and CXCL10 were among the most upregulated DEGs during RV, IAV, and IBV infection. Other DEGs that were highly expressed for all 3 viruses were mainly genes related to type I or type III interferons (RSAD2, IDO1) and chemokines (CXCL11). Notably, ICAM5, a known receptor for enterovirus D68, was highly expressed during RV infection only. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed that pathways associated with interferon response, innate immunity, or regulation of inflammatory response, were most perturbed for all three viruses. Network analysis showed that steroid-related pathways were enriched. Taken together, our data using contemporary virus strains suggests that genes related to interferon and chemokine predominated the host response associated with RV, IAV, and IBV infection. Several highly expressed genes, especially ICAM5 which is preferentially-induced during RV infection, deserve further investigation.","Dissanayake, Thrimendra Kaushika; Schäuble, Sascha; Mirhakkak, Mohammad; Wu, Wai-Lan; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Yip, Cyril C.

It is exemplified in the election of American Presidents. This paper examines the American experience to suggest a typology of human branding that may apply in both presidential and other political systems. It examines examples of presidential human brands from George Washington on but, given significant changes to electoral procedures, concentrates on first-time successful presidential candidates since 1901. The fourfold typology offers an interrelated set of ideal types that will augment the analysis of human branding. It is applied to presidents when they take up office rather than after serving. The typology draws on the source of primary brand association and relation to the core political system of each politician.","Collins, Neil",Fudan J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477857/,199
39156,In This Issue: October 2020,2020-09-15,"Within weeks of the nation-wide COVID-19 shutdown, more than 200 regional and community newspapers across Australia announced they could no longer keep their presses running due to the unprecedented crisis. A drain in advertising spend, a broken business model and the refusal of digital behemoths to pay for content were blamed for their collapse, ironically as audiences’ demand for credible news and information soared across the globe. There is no doubt the COVID-19 crisis has widened existing, deep cracks in the news media industry. In response this article sets out to explore possible solutions and strategies for local newspapers in the post-pandemic media landscape. We take an analogical approach to argue some of the issues that emerged during COVID-19 and strategies used to fight the global health pandemic also present valuable lessons for the preservation of public interest journalism and news at the local level. We conceptualise five coronavirus-related themes that resonate with a much-needed innovations agenda for local newspapers in Australia: (1) support for essential services, (2) warnings of complacency against an evolving biological threat, (3) appreciating the power of the social (4) coordinated government/policy responses and (5) ‘we are all in this together’.","Hess, Kristy; Waller, Lisa Jane",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7481652/,199

40809,Home sweet home: Warum das Arbeiten von zu Hause viele Vorteile schafft,2020-10-15,"At the end of October 2018, a storm of unprecedented strength severely damaged the forests of the eastern sector of the Italian Alps. The affected forest area covers 42,500 ha. The president of one of the damaged regions asked for help from the University of Padua. After eight months of discussion, the authors of this article wrote a consensus text. The sometimes asper debate brought to light some crucial aspects: 1) even experienced specialists may have various opinions based on scientific knowledge that lead to conflicting proposals for action. For some of them there is evidence that to restore a destroyed natural environment it is more judicious to do nothing; 2) the soil corresponds to a living structure and every ecosystem’s management should be based on it; 3) faced with a catastrophe, people and politicians find themselves unarmed, also because they rarely have the scientific background to understand natural processes. Yet politicians are the only persons who make the key decisions that drive the economy in play and therefore determine the near future of our planet. This article is an attempt to respond directly to a governor with a degree in animal production science, who formally and prudently asked a university department called “Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry” for help before taking decisions; 4) the authors also propose an artistic interpretation of facts (uncontrolled storm) and conclusions (listen to the soil). Briefly, the authors identify the soil as an indispensable source for the renewal of the destroyed forest, give indications on how to prepare a map of the soils of the damaged region, and suggest to anchor on this soil map a series of silvicultural and soil management actions that will promote the soil conservation and the faster recovery of the natural dynamic stability and resilience.

42618,COVID-19: From Lockdown to Recovery,2020-12-01,"This study reports the development of a sensitive magnetic bead-based enzyme-linked immunoassay (MELISA) for the pan-reactive detection of the Influenza A virus. The assay combines immunomagnetic beads and biotin-nanoparticle-based detection to quantify a highly conserved viral nucleoprotein in virus lysates. At the capture step, monoclonal antibody-coated magnetic microbeads were used to bind and concentrate the nucleoprotein in samples. The colorimetric detection signal was amplified using biotinylated silica nanoparticles (NP). These nanoparticles were functionalized on the surface with short DNA spacers bearing biotin groups by an automated supported synthesis method performed on nano-on-micro assemblies with a DNA/RNA synthesizer. A biotin-nanoparticle and immunomagnetic bead-based assay was developed. We succeeded in detecting Influenza A viruses directly in the lysis buffer supplemented with 10% saliva to simulate the clinical context. The biotin-nanoparticle amplification step enabled detection limits as low as 3 × 10(3) PFU mL(−1) and 4 × 10(4) PFU mL(−1) to be achieved for the H1N1 and H3N2 strains respectively. In contrast, a classical ELISA test based on the same antibody sandwich showed detection limit of 1.2 × 10(7) PFU mL(−1) for H1N1. The new enhanced MELISA proved to be specific, as no cross-reactivity was found with a porcine respiratory virus (PRRSV).

43009,Theory and Practice of Aging during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-09,"Although a live attenuated vaccine is available for controlling mumps virus (MuV), mumps still outbreaks frequently worldwide. The attenuated MuV vaccine strain S79 is widely used in mumps vaccination in China, but still with many shortcomings, among which the most prominent are the side effects and decreased immunity. Therefore, there is a need to further improve the safety and efficacy of the current MuV vaccine. In the present study, we further attenuated MuV S79 vaccine strain by inhibiting viral mRNA methyltransferase (MTase). We generated a panel of eight recombinant MuVs (rMuVs) carrying mutations in the MTase catalytic site or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the large (L) polymerase protein. These rMuVs are genetically stable and seven rMuVs are more attenuated in replication in cell culture and five rMuVs are more attenuated in replication in lungs of cotton rats compared with the parental vaccine strain S79. Importantly, cotton rats vaccinated with these seven rMuV mutants produced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies and were completely protected against challenge with a wild-type MuV strain (genotype F). Therefore, our results demonstrate that alteration in the MTase catalytic site or SAM binding site in MuV L protein improves the safety or the immunogenicity of the MuV vaccine and thus mRNA cap MTase may be an effective target for the development of new vaccine candidates for MuV.

43138,Company-Level Family Policies: Who Has Access to It and What Are Some of Its Outcomes?,2020-07-16,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine has been available for more than 20 years and is playing an increasing role in clinical care. However, few studies have evaluated the value of telemedicine in neurosurgical consultations and in guiding neurosurgical care. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we examined our experience with emergency video telemedicine consultations for neurosurgical patients at a rural hospital system. Our system uses secure and HIPAA-compliant video conferencing to connect providers and patients to a remote neurosurgery consultant, and operates one out of two days. RESULTS: During a ten-month period, 229 neurosurgical telemedicine consultations were performed. Two-thirds of the patients had intracranial pathology, 28% had spinal pathology and 3% of the consults were for patients who returned after care at our institution or required clearance for another procedure. Five patients required transfer within the hospital system and 12 out of the hospital system for a higher level of care (total 7.4%). Patients that required transfer most frequently had intracranial pathology (70%). The number of patients transferred out was less than in the year before telemedicine was available. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine consultation for neurosurgery is feasible for a variety of neurosurgical pathologies, improves patient access to neurosurgery expertise, and facilitates appropriate transfers to a higher level of care when required. Our findings are especially relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of delivering quality medical care when physical patient contact is not possible.","Rahmani, Redi; Bhalla, Tarun; Susa, Stephen; Proper, Diana; Boulos, Alan S; Shannon, Larry R; Adamson, David C; Bidros, Dani S; Knoop, Henry; Winther, Mark; LeRoux, Peter D",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717399/,199

However, the relationship between NLR and the presence of sepsis in neonates is poorly studied. Here, we retrospectively recruited 1480 neonates and collected and analyzed relevant clinical and laboratory data. According to the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus, 737 neonates were diagnosed with sepsis, and 555 neonates were suspected for having infection. Neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (n = 188) served as controls. Neonates with sepsis had significantly elevated neutrophil counts and NLR (P < 0.001). The proportion of neonates with sepsis increased significantly from 41.6% when NLR < 0.91 to 66.2% when NLR > 1.88 group (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for the presence of neonatal sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value NLR for predicting the presence of neonatal sepsis was 1.62 (area under curve (AUC) = 0.63, 95% CI 0.60–0.66, P < 0.001). In conclusion, our data suggest that elevated NLR levels are associated with a higher neonatal sepsis risk.","Li, Tiewei; Dong, Geng; Zhang, Min; Xu, Zhe; Hu, Yidi; Xie, Bo; Wang, Yuewu; Xu, Bangli",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728472/,199

Rapid and sensitive assays for human norovirus detection are undoubtedly necessary for clinical diagnosis, especially in regions without more sophisticated equipment. METHOD: The rapid reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) is a fast, robust and isothermal nucleic acid detection method based on enzyme reaction. This method can complete the sample detection at 39 °C in 30 min. In this study, we successfully established a rapid reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for the detection of human norovirus GII.4 and applied this assay to clinical samples, as well as comparison with commercial reverse transcription real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: At 95% probability, the detection sensitivity of RT-RAA was 3.425 log10 genomic copies (LGC)/reaction. Moreover, no cross-reaction was observed with other norovirus genogroups and other common foodborne viruses. Stool samples were examined by RT-RAA and reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Compared of RT-qPCR, kappa values for human norovirus detection with RT-RAA were 0.894 (p < 0.001), indicating that both assays were in agreement. CONCLUSION: This RT-RAA assay provides a rapid, specific, and sensitive assay for human norovirus detection and is suitable for clinical testing.","Qin, Zhiwei; Xue, Liang; Cai, Weicheng; Gao, Junshan; Jiang, Yueting; Yang, Jiale; Liang, Yanhui; Wang, Linping; Zhang, Jumei; Hu, Yongdan; Wu, Qingping",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941963/,199

The Four Co’s Model distinguishes between four different modes of co-production—co-commissioning, co-design, co-delivery and co-assessment of public services and outcomes. Each of these can be an important way of achieving improved public value, as illustrated by many examples from around the world. However, each also has limitations and risks attached. Furthermore, digital technologies will impact on the way and the extent to which the Four Co’s are implemented, as digital co-production is becoming increasingly important.","Loeffler, Elke",Co-Production of Public Services and Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981074/,199

Never in history of education was a lecture delivered without the physical presence of lecturers, in an academic environment. Even in present wildest innovative decade, the idea of eliminating the academia was not an option. However, after the pandemic encounter, it happened. These are not mere changes, but it is a transformation. While this phenomenon is getting acceptable gradually by takers, the mammoth turnaround is happening in Ph.D. final viva voce defenses too. Practice of online defense is approved by leading Universities so as to avoid stagnation of researchers in final stage. Question is, will it be appropriate to accept final defenses in online stream? and has the institutions developed rubrics to assess the researches which are presented online?

In general, older family members were poorly suited to reinventing their companies to adapt to changing customer needs, upstart rivals, and new technologies. Moreover, often younger family members in the company lacked the interest or aptitude to lead the company into the future. If a nonfamily member had been groomed to take over, the succession might go smoothly – depending on whether the family members were comfortable with the succession plan. In the absence of such next-generation leadership, furniture industry CEOs faced three options: sell the company to another retailer, sell to a private equity firm, or recruit an outside CEO with the talent needed to reinvent the company.","Cohan, Peter S.",Goliath Strikes Back,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989863/,199

Instead of being bitter, Mandela, who had suffered grave injustices, at the hands of the apartheid system, preached reconciliation and racial tolerance and used them as keystones for nation-building. In the same vein, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu popularised the notion of the ‘Rainbow Nation’ with many South Africans subscribing to this idea. Due to such bold efforts that were aimed at reconciliation, by Mandela and others, the transition from apartheid to democracy was mostly peaceful. This led to many people around the world to describe it as a ‘miracle’ transition. However, after 26 years of democracy, there is an upsurge in racism across the country, with some incidences resulting in the maiming and deaths of mainly Africans by whites. This chapter examines rising racism in the country and argues that this trend can be reduced through social work interventions that foster and strengthen healthy human relationships.","Noyoo, Ndangwa",Promoting Healthy Human Relationships in Post-Apartheid South Africa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991110/,199

A cross-sectional study design was adopted to survey 220 perimenopausal Taiwanese women with a mean age of 51.8 ± 4.64 years and a mean body mass index of 23.07 ± 3.04 kg/m(2), 75.9% of whom were married, 52.3% had a college education or above, 80.4% had salaries, 81.3% had small families, and 96.4% were not using hormone therapy. The P-MFSMS consists of 25 questions based on six categories: (1) strive to maintain work energy and efficiency; (2) seek self-help from medical resources (doctor shopping); (3) strive to maintain the normal operation of the family (seeking help and support from family or significant other); (4) make time for activities or exercise in busy life; (5) slow down or adjust lifestyle; (6) frustration. For all of these six categories, the minimum loading of each question on the factor was calculated to be over 0.50, with a Cronbach’s α of 0.78 and a corrected total-item correlation of >0.50. The goodness of fit of the model was determined to be acceptable, with a chi-square/df value of <3.0 (χ(2) = 503.45 and df = 260), a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value of 0.065 (<0.08), as well as a Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value of 0.892. The Tucker–Lewis index (TLI = 0.91), Comparative Fit index (CFI = 0.92), and Incremental Fit index (IFI = 0.92) were all >0.90. There was no statistically significant difference in the difficulty between perimenopausal and postmenopausal women utilizing differential item function (DIF) analysis. Taken together, the 25-question P-MFSMS may be a potentially valid and reliable instrument for suitably evaluating perimenopausal Taiwanese women’s vulnerability to fatigue syndrome. Future studies will be conducted to test the effectiveness of the P-MFSMS for evaluating perimenopausal Taiwanese women’s vulnerability to fatigue syndrome in clinical practice.","Chiu, Hsiao-Hui; Tsao, Lee-Ing; Liu, Chieh-Yu; Lu, Yu-Ying; Shih, Whei-Mei; Wang, Peng-Hui",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8002518/,199
51101,Bottom‐up solutions in a time of crisis: the case of Covid‐19 in South Korea,2021-01-10,"There was a significant decline in air pollution in different parts of the world due to enforcement of lockdown by many countries to check the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, commercial and industrial activities had been limited globally with restricted air and surface traffic movements in response to social distancing and isolation. Both satellite remote sensing and ground-based monitoring were used to measure the change in the air quality. There was momentous decline in the averaged concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), methane (CH(4)) and aerosols. Many cities across India, China and several major cities in Europe observed strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels dropping by around 40–50% owing to lockdowns. Similarly, concentrations of SO(2) in polluted areas in India, especially around large coal-fired power plants and industrial areas decreased by around 40% as evidenced by the comparative satellite mapping during April 2019 and April 2020. Recent advances in sensors on board various satellites played a significant role in real-time monitoring of emission regimes over various parts of the world. The satellite data is relying upon single scene profusion for real-time air quality measurements, and also using averaged dataset over certain time-period. The daily global-scale remote sensing data of NO(2), as measured through the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5p/TROPOMI) of European Space Agency (ESA), indicated exceptional decreases in tropospheric NO(2) pollution in urban areas. Similarly, Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, with a repeat cycle of three days helped in assessing the sources and sinks of CO(2) and CH(4) on a sub-continental scale.

Current research in colorectal surgery focuses on searching for techniques which could minimize the risk of leakage. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of cumulative fluid balance on microcirculatory changes at the anastomotic site.This experimental study used 15 domestic pigs; all of the animals underwent rectal resection. Then the animals were divided into three groups and received IV crystalloids at various rates, i.e. 5 ml/kg/h; 10 ml/kg/h; and 20 ml/kg/h. Large bowel micro-perfusion was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry during and following the surgical procedure.The experiments were successfully performed in all 15 cases. No animal died during the procedure or during the follow-up. We found no differences in micro-perfusion of the bowel between the experimental groups during the surgical procedure and during the follow-up period after the surgery. A significant decrease in micro-perfusion was observed after the transection of the inferior mesenteric artery in all the groups; again, no differences between the groups were observed.We did not confirm the original hypothesis that excessive load of IV crystalloids during the surgery would have a negative effect on bowel micro-perfusion and thus a negative effect on the healing of the anastomosis. However, laser Doppler flowmetry was found to have high accuracy in measuring tissue microcirculation and has the potential to be used in clinical practice.","Örhalmi, Julius; Turek, Zdeněk; Dolejš, Josef; Páral, Jiří; Malý, Ondřej; Čečka, Filip",Indian J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8008214/,199

The present research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring the unique transition period from home, school or college into university in order to identify aspects of the university experience (teaching, curriculum, support services, accommodation) that could be adapted to better support student mental health and well-being. Eight focus groups were conducted across two higher education institutions in North West England. Focus group data were thematically analyzed. Four overarching themes were identified: “Tackling multiple challenges”; “The preparatory role of schools and colleges”; “University staff and services: Feeling supported/unsupported”; and “Friendships.” Although pressure to perform academically whilst fulfilling the stereotypical student life is keenly felt during the transition period, many students conceal their struggles from family and friends. Living beyond their familiar support structures often leaves students in need of compassionate humans to turn to for support or advice, especially as many keep their struggles hidden. Large-group teaching settings stifle social connection and leave students feeling lonely. Loneliness was also experienced within accommodation environments. Providing increased opportunities for connection within living and learning environments would enable young people to build and strengthen relationships with fellow students and staff. As supportive environments foster a sense of belonging and community, universities should ensure that students feel supported by staff and peers whilst they acclimatize to multiple new challenges.","Worsley, Joanne Deborah; Harrison, Paula; Corcoran, Rhiannon",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009977/,199
51183,Accelerating innovation: some lessons from the pandemic,2021-02-10,"RTS,S is the leading malaria vaccine in development, but has demonstrated only moderate protective efficacy in clinical trials. RTS,S is a virus-like particle (VLP) that uses the human hepatitis B virus as scaffold to display the malaria sporozoite antigen, circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Particle formation requires four-fold excess scaffold antigen, and as a result, CSP represents only a small portion of the final vaccine construct. Alternative VLP or nanoparticle platforms that reduce the amount of scaffold antigen and increase the amount of the target CSP antigen present in particles may enhance vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Here, we describe the production and characterization of a novel VLP that uses the small surface antigen (dS) of duck hepatitis B virus to display CSP. The CSP-dS fusion protein successfully formed VLPs without the need for excess scaffold antigen, and thus CSP represented a larger portion of the vaccine construct. CSP-dS formed large particles approximately 31-74 nm in size and were confirmed to display CSP on the surface. CSP-dS VLPs were highly immunogenic in mice and induced antibodies to multiple regions of CSP, even when administered at a lower vaccine dosage. Vaccine-induced antibodies demonstrated relevant functional activities, including Fc-dependent interactions with complement and Fcγ-receptors, previously identified as important in malaria immunity. Further, vaccine-induced antibodies had similar properties (epitope-specificity and avidity) to monoclonal antibodies that are protective in mouse models. Our novel platform to produce VLPs without excess scaffold protein has wide implications for the future development of vaccines for malaria and other infectious diseases.","Kurtovic, Liriye; Wetzel, David; Reiling, Linda; Drew, Damien R.; Palmer, Catherine; Kouskousis, Betty; Hanssen, Eric; Wines, Bruce D.; Hogarth, P.

A set of physico-chemical and immunological tests are employed for complete vaccine characterisation and to ensure their consistency, potency, safety and stability, following the relevant World Health Organization and Pharmacopoeia guidelines. Variable requirements for analytical methods are linked to conjugate structure, carrier protein nature and size and O-acetyl content of polysaccharide. We investigated a key stability-indicating method which measures the percent free saccharide of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi capsular polysaccharide, by detergent precipitation, depolymerisation and HPAEC-PAD quantitation. Together with modern computational approaches, a more precise design of glycoconjugates is possible, allowing for improvements in solubility, structural conformation and stability, and immunogenicity of antigens, which may be applicable to a broad spectrum of vaccines. More validation experiments are required to establish the most effective and suitable methods for glycoconjugate analysis to bring uniformity to the existing protocols, although the need for product-specific approaches will apply, especially for the more complex vaccines. An overview of current and emerging analytical approaches for the characterisation of vaccines against Salmonella Typhi and Shigella species is described in this paper.

However, vaccines composed of antigens alone can only stimulate weak immunogenicity to prevent infection in many cases. Adjuvant can enhance the immunogenicity of the antigens. Therefore, adjuvant is urgently needed to strengthen the immune response of the vaccines. An ideal adjuvant should be safe, cheap, biodegradable and biologically inert. In addition to having a long shelf life, it can also promote cellular and humoral immune responses. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has many different ingredients, such as glycosides, polysaccharides, acids, terpenes, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and so on. TCM polysaccharides are one of the main types of biologically active substances. They have a large range of pharmacological activities, especially immunomodulatory. TCM polysaccharides can regulate the immune system of animals by binding to multiple receptors on the surface of immune cells and activating different signal pathways. This review focuses on a comprehensive summary of the most recent developments in vaccine adjuvant effects of polysaccharides from many important TCM, such as Artemisia rupestris L., Cistanche deserticola, Pinus massoniana, Chuanminshen violaceum, Astragalus, Ganoderma lucidum, Codonopsis pilosula, Lycium barbarum, Angelica, Epimedium, and Achyranthes bidentata. Moreover, this review also introduces their immunomodulatory effects and the molecular mechanisms of action on animal bodies, which showed that TCM polysaccharides can activate macrophages, the signal pathway of T/B lymphocytes, regulate the signal pathway of natural killer cells, activate the complement system, and so on.","Wang, Danyang; Liu, Yonghui; Zhao, Wei",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047473/,199

52114,Guiding dental students through COVID-19,2021-04-28,": Point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable diagnostic tool in intensive care. Evaluation of POCUS images acquired in our intensive care unit (ICU) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had typically been performed solely at the point of care. Where further evaluation was required, cross-sectional thoracic imaging or departmental echocardiography would be requested. Clinicians also had access to ICU ultrasound machines for review of images, or to repeat studies for clarification of findings. However, the nature of the pandemic limited access to ICU to minimise contact with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop an online solution for review of POCUS images by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). METHODS: Microsoft Teams was utilised to create a dedicated channel for the MDT to review POCUS images. Images were exported from ultrasound machines used inside our ICU to portable USB drives in standard formats (DICOM or WMV). The portable USB drives were decontaminated prior to transfer outside of the ICU. Anonymised images were uploaded with relevant clinical details to the Teams platform for MDT review. RESULTS: The online platform provided rapid access to images for review by the MDT. POCUS images from ICU patients with and without COVID-19 were reviewed. MDT review frequently led to a change in patient management. Significant examples included identification of a missed inferior vena cava thrombus leading to initiation of anticoagulation therapy, and rapid expert input for a case of cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSION: The use of an online platform allowed our intensive care unit to establish a reliable method for images acquired from point-of-care-ultrasound to be remotely reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team, consequently improving patient care.","Shuker, B A; Perry, J; Shuker, Benjamin",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030230/,199

53279,771 Shaping the Virtual Learning Environment: Emojis As A Novel Feedback Modality for Content Delivery in Postgraduate Medical Education,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for patients with chronic rheumatological diseases. SpA - which includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and enteropathic arthritis - often affects young people who are otherwise fit and able. Many SpA patients take immunosuppressive medications and therefore were advised to shield. In view of this, we conducted a survey to better understand how shielding has affected the physical activity and symptoms of SpA patients during the pandemic. Methods An online anonymised survey was created and advertised via social media from 4th June to 4th July 2020. Patients with SpA were invited to complete the survey which included 18 questions exploring the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms, physical activity levels and medication use. Results There were 136 survey respondents, of whom 74.3% were female, with an age range from under 25 to over 75 years. The underlying diagnoses were PsA (60.5%), AS (28.4%), axSpA (10.5%) and enteropathic arthritis (0.8%). The majority (66.7%) of respondents were shielding; 44.1% were on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and 56.6% were on biologics (bDMARDs). Most (94.1%) had continued their DMARDs throughout the shielding period. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was reported to be increased in 18.6% of respondents, and unchanged in 69.0%. Compared to before the pandemic, 54.8% reported worsening joint stiffness and 45.6% reported worsening joint pain. Most respondents (67.6%) reported reduced levels of physical activity, the commonest reasons being: shielding (54.6%); increased fatigue (45.8%); concerns around social distancing (45.4%); poor sleep quality (38.6%); working from home (28.6%) and low mood (28.6%). Only 14.7% had attended a virtual exercise class. Conclusion Approximately 2 in 3 patients with SpA reported they were shielding during the first wave of the pandemic. Similar numbers of patients reported reduced physical activity levels and increased joint stiffness over this time. It is important to acknowledge that given the nature of the anonymised survey, we cannot be certain if the same patients who were shielding were the same as those who had reduced levels of physical activity or worsening symptoms. We have, however, shown that over half of the surveyed patients attributed their reduced physical activity levels to shielding. Taking into account that social restrictions (either self-imposed or government advised) are likely to be ongoing, we believe that a focus should be placed on supporting patients to maintain their activity levels, through initiatives such as specialist virtual exercise classes.

Although T2DM is a common cause for ESRD, it is uncommon for well controlled T2DM patients on dialysis to develop DKA. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted infections as a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and stresses the importance of optimal glycemic control. We report a case of a previously diet controlled patient with T2DM and ESRD admitted with DKA and acute COVID-19. 46-year-old male with diet controlled T2DM, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), ESRD secondary to HIV associated nephropathy was admitted from an outpatient dialysis unit with vomiting, chills and body aches. He was on metformin monotherapy prior to dialysis initiation. Regular self-monitored blood glucoses ranged 80-130mg/dl with HbA1C of 6% one month prior. Lab tests on admit revealed serum glucose 499mg/dl, elevated anion gap 21mmol/L, potassium 3.5mmol/L (3.5–5.0), HbA1C: 14.7%, elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate 5.6mmol/L(normal:<=0.4), CD4 count 500 (489–1457/µL) with an undetectable HIV viral load however COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction was detectable. He was managed with cautious fluid resuscitation requiring a total of one-liter normal saline, higher potassium dialysate (3K+), and continuous insulin infusion with resolution of abdominal symptoms and DKA. No other infections or precipitating factors were found and acute COVID-19 infection was managed symptomatically. He was discharged on basal bolus insulin regimen on day seven of admit. Up to a third of patients with diabetes on dialysis do not require anti-hyperglycemic therapy, such as our case. Potential factors leading to reduced insulin requirements include reduced renal insulin clearance,reduced renal gluconeogenesis, protein-energy wasting, reduced body weight and accumulation of uremic toxins (guanidino compounds postulated to act as biguanide agents). Our case highlights that acute COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in previously well controlled T2DM patients on hemodialysis while being aware of the need for cautious fluid and potassium administration due to lack of osmotic diuresis in anuric dialysis patients. Close self-monitoring of blood glucose should be emphasized in patients withT2DM with ESRD, including diet controlled T2DM patients, in order to reduce hyperglycemic emergencies and inpatient admissions especially during COVID-19 pandemic.","Shafique, Anum; Hamal, Savyata; Huq, Sabrina",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135610/,199
53781,COVID-19 internet vaccination information and vaccine administration: evidence from the United States,2021-06-03,"An increase in antifungal resistance has seen a surge in fungal wound infections in patients who are immunocompromised resulting from chemotherapy, disease, and burns. Human pathogenic fungi are increasingly becoming resistant to a sparse repertoire of existing antifungal drugs, which has given rise to the need to develop novel treatments for potentially lethal infections. Bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus has been shown to possess many properties that make it innately useful as a next-generation biopolymer to be utilised as a wound dressing. The current study demonstrates the creation of a pharmacologically active wound dressing by loading antifungal agents into a biopolymer hydrogel to produce a novel wound dressing. Amphotericin B is known to be highly hepatotoxic, which reduces its appeal as an antifungal drug, especially in patients who are immunocompromised. This, coupled with an increase in antifungal resistance, has seen a surge in fungal wound infections in patients who are immunodeficient due to chemotherapy, disease, or injury. Antifungal activity was conducted via Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27, M38, M44, and M51 against Candida auris, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger. This study showed that thymoquinone has a comparable antifungal activity to amphotericin B with mean zones of inhibition of 21.425 ± 0.925 mm and 22.53 ± 0.969 mm, respectively. However, the mean survival rate of HEp-2 cells when treated with 50 mg/L amphotericin B was 29.25 ± 0.854% compared to 71.25 ± 1.797% when treated with 50 mg/L thymoquinone. Following cytotoxicity assays against HEp-2 cells, thymoquinone showed a 71.25 ± 3.594% cell survival, whereas amphotericin B had a mean cell survival rate of 29.25 ± 1.708%. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of thymoquinone, ocimene, and miramistin against amphotericin B in the application of novel antifungal dressings.","Swingler, Sam; Gupta, Abhishek; Gibson, Hazel; Heaselgrave, Wayne; Kowalczuk, Marek; Adamus, Grazyna; Radecka, Iza",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8158721/,199

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This scoping review was part of the Iran Diabetes Research Roadmap (IDRR) study. A systematic search was used based on the Arksey and O'Malley method consisting of six steps. The descriptive analysis was done with SPSS software. Additionally, VOS veiwer software was used to draw the knowledge map of the included studies. RESULTS: There were 169 articles included from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2019 in Iran. Aerobic and resistance exercises were types of physical activity with more number of articles. Most of the included clinical studies were randomized clinical trials and had a level of evidence two. Also, there was more interest in outcomes such as glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome, metabolism, and cardiovascular health. The network of co-authorship was drawn, and ""controlled study"", ""male"", and ""rat"" were the most frequent keywords. CONCLUSIONS: The number of Iranian diabetes researchers on physical activity is increasing, and the majority of clinical studies had a high level of evidence. With maintaining previous interests and investigations, there should be more emphasis on research in elderly and children age groups as evidence gap in Iran. Also, longitudinal cohort studies should be highlighted and Iranian researchers should be encouraged to participate in new topics of research worldwide.","Sanjari, Mahnaz; Esmaeili, Shahnaz; Yarmohammadi, Hossein; Atlasi, Rasha; Aalaa, Maryam; Larijani, Bagher; Nasli-Esfahani, Ensieh",Int J Endocrinol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198613/,199

54942,Blood pressure level and laboratory indicators of disease severity in patients with arterial hypertension and COVID-19,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common helminthic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium. Accurate and early diagnosis of NCC remains challenging due to its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, neuroimaging deficits, variable sensitivity, and specificity of serological tests. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based pathogen analysis in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with NCC infection has recently been reported indicating its diagnostic efficacy. In this case study, we report the diagnosis of a NCC patient with a symptomatic history of over 20 years using NGS analysis and further confirmation of the pathology by immunological tests. CASE PRESENTATION: This study reports the clinical imaging and immunological features of a patient with a recurrent headache for more than 20 years, which worsened gradually with the symptom of fever for more than 7 years and paroxysmal amaurosis for more than 1 year. By utilizing NGS technique, the pathogen was detected in patient’s CSF, and the presence of Taenia solium-DNA was confirmed by a positive immunological reaction to cysticercus IgG antibody in CSF and serum samples. The symptoms of the patient were alleviated, and the CSF condition was improved substantially after the anti-helminthic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that combining CSF NGS with cysticercus IgG testing may be a highly promising approach for diagnosing the challenging cases of NCC. Further studies are needed to evaluate the parasitic DNA load in patients’ CSF for the diagnosis of disease severity, stage, and monitoring of therapeutic responses.","Chen, Bin; Chen, Zheng; Yang, Yi-shu; Cai, Gui-lan; Xu, Xiao-jiao; Guan, Hong-zhi; Ren, Hai-tao; Tuo, Hou-zhen",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222500/,199
55182,How Did Depositors Respond to COVID-19?,2021-05-21,"Research has shown that utilizing active learning techniques in the classroom increases student engagement and performance. With the increased attention focused on active learning, professors are striving to find better ways to engage students in the classroom. Indeed, numerous studies have focused on investigating many different approaches to this topic. COVID 19 has mandated a rapid transition to remote learning and with this forced change has come what some students describe as “Zoom Fatigue” [1]. Many students have reported feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and disengaged by the dramatic increase in mandated distance education required by the COVID pandemic. Video conferencing has become the “go to” panacea for education during this time and students are spending unprecedented amounts of time in front of a screen where normally they would be in a classroom. This heretofore singular and unique approach to education coupled with decreased peer‐to‐peer interaction has caused a problem with student engagement [2,3]. PROBLEM: Students engagement and performance have decreased during COVID 19 due to forced online learning and lack of peer interaction. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that creating a non‐graded, fun, and relaxing physiology‐focused trivia night will increase student engagement and performance on summative assessments. PROPOSAL: Using a master's level class progressing through the respiratory physiology module utilizing remote, synchronous lectures to deliver content, we will introduce a voluntary “pub trivia night” review session with teams randomly assigned to increase interaction amongst peers and review respiratory physiology material. Questions will be provided in rounds and at the end a “winning team” will be awarded a $100 gift card. EXPECTED RESULTS: We expect students who attend and participate in the “pub trivia night” will perform better than their peers on summative exams as well as report increased engagement with their classmates over the course of the unit. Analysis of test scores of those who competed and those who did not will be compared. All students in class will be surveyed concerning peer engagement and results compared. LITERATURE CITED: 1.

55208,Being resilient for society: evidence from companies that leveraged their resources and capabilities to fight the COVID‐19 crisis,2021-05-19,"INTRODUCTION: Emotional exhaustion, excessive depersonalization, and reduced personal achievement define the burnout syndrome. The academic workload on students can cause exhaustion, similar to that of a worker. The Maslach Burnout Inventory‐ Student Survey (MBI‐SS) was designed to reflect student burnout by evaluation of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. It has been reported that at least half of the students will suffer burnout at some point in their medical studies. Burnout evaluation has been focused on physicians or those working in hospitals attending coronavirus patients. The psychological burden and pressures on students due to the closure of facilities and schools around the world has not been thoroughly evaluated. The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout in medical students during the COVID‐19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross‐sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed. The MBI‐SS was applied during the spring semester to all anatomy students of one of the largest medical schools in Mexico. The study was previously reviewed and approved by the Ethics and Research Committees to be answered anonymously and voluntarily. Results were classified as low, moderate, or high in emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, with a mean age of 18.9 years, 60.4% (n = 93) were women. Based on the MBI‐SS definition, 14.9% (n = 23) were identified with symptoms of burnout. There was also a high prevalence of emotional exhaustion (53.9% n = 83), cynicism (16.9% n = 26), and low academic effectiveness (34.4% n = 53). Men were statistically more prevalent towards lower academic effectiveness (p = 0.037) and increased cynicism (p = 0.003), as well as a higher incidence of burnout (26.6% vs 7.5%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Burnout prevalence among medical students has been reported as high as 46% during the pandemic, however different types of surveys have been used. A previous study using the same survey reported a prevalence of 5.2% for moderate burnout syndrome, in a similar population which could indicate the COVID‐19 pandemic as an influencing factor. Universities need to consider the psychological effects of the pandemic on students, and provide guidance of support alternatives to improve mental health, due to the impact this syndrome may cause on the quality of life.","Jezzini‐Martinez, Sofía; Quiroga‐Garza, Alejandro; Jacobo‐Baca, Guillermo; Guzman‐Lopez, Santos; Salinas‐Alvarez, Yolanda; Martinez‐Garza, Javier; Zarate‐Garza, Pablo; Gutierrez‐De la O, Jorge; de la Fuente‐Villarreal, David; Elizondo‐Omaña, Rodrigo",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239600/,199

Viral enterotypes as a description of the gut virome, its characteristics have not been thoroughly studied. Here we investigated the human gut virome composition using previously published sequencing data of 2,690 metagenomes from seven countries with various phenotypes. We found that the virome was dominated by double-stranded DNA viruses in our data, and young children and adults showed different stages in their fecal enterovirus composition. Beta diversity showed there were significantly less homogeneous in individuals with severe disorders of bile acid secretion, such as cirrhosis. In contrast, there were no significant differences in distances to centroids or viral components between patients with phenotypes unrelated to bile acid, such as hypertension. Enterotypes determined independently from various projects showed similar specific viruses and enrichment direction. Confounding factors, such as different sequencing platforms and library construction, did not confuse enterotyping. The gut virome composition pattern could be described by two viral enterotypes, which supported a discrete, rather than a gradient, distribution. Three main components, enterotype 1 and 2 specific viruses and the other, comprise the total viral variation in these sets. Compared with enterotype 2, enterotype 1 had a higher viral count, Shannon index, and similarity between samples. The relative abundance of enterotype-specific viruses is a crucial determinant of enterotype assignment. Samples not matching any of the defined enterotypes in the database did not necessarily correlate to sickness. Therefore, the background context must be carefully considered when using a viral enterotype as a feature for disease prediction. Our results highlight important insights into the human gut virome composition by exploring two-main viral enterotypes in population and providing an alternate covariate for early disease screening.","Song, Li; Zhang, Lu; Fang, Xiaodong",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511818/,199
59527,"Covid-19: school closures and bans on mass gatherings will need to be considered, says England's CMO.",2020-02-28,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the predisposing factors of this infection. The aim of the current study was to explore an association between the serum vitamin D level, obesity and underlying health conditions, and the vulnerability to COVID-19 in the Iranian population. METHODS We conducted a case-control study of 201 patients with coronavirus infection and 201 controls. Cases and controls were matched for age and gender. The study was carried out for 2 months (February 2020 to April 2020) at Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Information containing age, gender, clinical symptoms, body mass index (BMI), CT scan findings, and underlying health conditions related to each participant were elicited from health records. RESULTS A significant negative correlation (p = 0.02) was observed between the serum vitamin D level and developing coronavirus infection. Also, the results showed that the COVID-19 cases were more likely to be overweight than the controls (p=0.023). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and respiratory infections were found in 20.89%, 9.65%, and 6.96 % of cases, respectively. These underlying health conditions were not significantly different between cases and controls (p= 0.8111). CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D deficiency and obesity are two main predisposing factors associated with the vulnerability to coronavirus infection in Iranian population.

60351,COVID-19 response.,2020-07-17,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting public health measures may have major impacts on mental health, including on self-harm. We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. METHOD Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to May 17, 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients' demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. RESULTS Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N = 107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N = 68/127 v 38.6%, N = 39/101, χ2 = 5.03, p = 0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. CONCLUSIONS COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone. The classification of COVID-related factors can be used as an aide-memoire for clinicians.","Hawton, Keith; Lascelles, Karen; Brand, Fiona; Casey, Deborah; Bale, Liz; Ness, Jennifer; Kelly, Samantha; Waters, Keith",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774538/,199

Its expression is known to be upregulated under heat shock. This protein interacts with different partners and can, therefore, be involved in various processes relevant to tissue integrity and functioning. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding Hspb8 can lead to the development of various diseases such as myopathies and neuropathies. In our study, we aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of zebrafish Hspb8 during zebrafish development. We applied techniques such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, LC-MS, and morpholino-mediated knockdown. We broadened the knowledge regarding zebrafish hspb8 expression during development under normal and heat shock conditions as well as its tissue- and subcellular-specific localization. A co-IP analysis allowed us to conclude that zebrafish Hspb8 can interact with proteins such as Bag3 and Hsc70, which are crucial for formation of an autophagy-inducing complex. We also demonstrated that hspb8 morpholino-mediated knockdown has an impact on zebrafish embryos' morphology, muscle ultrastructure, and motility behavior. Our research provides a valuable resource for the potential use of the zebrafish as a model for studying pathological conditions associated with hspb8 disorders.","Dubińska-Magiera, Magda; Niedbalska-Tarnowska, Joanna; Migocka-Patrzałek, Marta; Posyniak, Ewelina; Daczewska, Małgorzata",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604890/,199

Since that time, the 'suspicious suspects' in the endoscopy unit have grown in number in the eyes of both patients and endoscopists. RECENT FINDINGS This review summarizes the existing guidelines related to infection control in the endoscopy unit and emerging technologies to address gaps, identifies recommendations proposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reminds the reader that infection prevention has not changed since the emergence of COVID-19, only the importance of infection prevention has increased in visibility. SUMMARY Infection prevention has been and will always be necessary in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit. Although outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant organisms and infectious diseases like COVID-19 raise the profile of infection control, there have been no major changes to infection control practice recommendations because of the global pandemic. The history of lapses in infection control, persistent contamination of reprocessed endoscopes, and failure of many endoscopy units to identify certain endoscopic procedures as aerosol-generating procedures prior to the pandemic emphasize the need for better knowledge and implementation of infection control practices within endoscopy units.","Hutfless, Susan",Current opinion in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0000000000000669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739998/,199

METHODS The concept of a systematic evidence map (SEM) is defined and contrasted to the function and limitations of systematic review (SR) in the context of risk management decision-making. The potential for SEMs to facilitate evidence-based decision-making are explored using a hypothetical example in risk management priority-setting. The potential role of SEMs in reference to broader risk management workflows is characterised. RESULTS SEMs are databases of systematically gathered research which characterise broad features of the evidence base. Although not intended to substitute for the evidence synthesis element of systematic reviews, SEMs provide a comprehensive, queryable summary of a large body of policy relevant research. They provide an evidence-based approach to characterising the extent of available evidence and support forward looking predictions or trendspotting in the chemical risk sciences. In particular, SEMs facilitate the identification of related bodies of decision critical chemical risk information which could be further analysed using SR methods, and highlight gaps in the evidence which could be addressed with additional primary studies to reduce uncertainties in decision-making. CONCLUSIONS SEMs have strong and growing potential as a high value tool in resource efficient use of existing research in chemical risk management. They can be used as a critical precursor to efficient deployment of high quality SR methods for characterising chemical health risks. Furthermore, SEMs have potential, at a large scale, to support the sort of evidence summarisation and surveillance methods which would greatly increase the resource efficiency, transparency and effectiveness of regulatory initiatives such as EU REACH and US TSCA.","Wolffe, Taylor A M; Whaley, Paul; Halsall, Crispin; Rooney, Andrew A; Walker, Vickie R",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31254867/,199

We found that although NK cells did not express endogenous TYRO3 on the cell surface, activated NK cells rapidly acquired TYRO3 from tumor cells via trogocytosis in vitro and in vivo. NK cells that acquired TYRO3, which we termed TYRO3⁺ NK cells, had significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and IFNγ production as well as higher expression of some activated surface markers compared with TYRO3⁻ NK cells. Furthermore, the activation status of NK cells and TYRO3 expression levels on donor cells, either endogenous or ectopic, positively correlated with trogocytosis levels. When the antigen-presenting cell (APC) K562 leukemia cell line, a feeder cell line to expand NK cells, overexpressed TYRO3, TYRO3 was transferred to NK cells via trogocytosis, which improved NK-cell proliferation ex vivo. This provides a strategy to manufacture NK cells or their engineered counterparts such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells for the treatment of cancer or infectious diseases.","Lu, Ting; Ma, Rui; Li, Zhenlong; Mansour, Anthony G; Teng, Kun-Yu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Jianying; Barr, Tasha; Caligiuri, Michael A; Yu, Jianhua",Cancer immunology research,https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.cir-20-1014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326137/,199

Median age was 63 years, 58% were females, and 87% African-Americans. Hypertension (79.7%), obesity (66.5%), and diabetes mellitus (42.3%) were the most common comorbidities. Males had higher overall mortality compared to females (23% v 13.8%). Immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; (confidence interval {CI): 1.52-8.47, p = 0.003)], hypertension (OR 3.36; CI:1.3-8.6, p = 0.01), age ≥65 years (OR 3.1; CI:1.7-5.6, p < 0.001), and morbid obesity (OR 2.29; CI:1.11-4.69, p = 0.02), were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Female gender was an independent predictor of decreased in-hospital mortality. Mortality in intubated patients was 67%. Mortality was 8.9% in <50 years, compared to 20% in ≥50 years.Conclusions: Immunosuppression, hypertension, age ≥65 years, and morbid obesity were independent predictors of mortality, whereas female gender was protective for mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients in rural Southwest Georgia.

73396,"Covid-19: India is at centre of global vaccine manufacturing, but opacity threatens public trust.",2021-01-28,"Background: Maternal anaemia is a public health problem worldwide, and its aetiology is linked to iron deficiency. The high nutrient demand during pregnancy exacerbates the condition. To meet the increased nutritional demand, supplementation of iron and folic acid (IFA) is key. The supplements are provided freely to pregnant women during antenatal visits at public health facilities, however, their uptake and adherence in Kenya remain unacceptably low. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 241 postnatal mothers seeking maternal and child healthcare (MCH) care at Kakamega level 5 hospital was conducted. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data were collected from 241 eligible postnatal mothers, while qualitative data were obtained through key informant interviews with community health volunteers and healthcare providers. Results: There was a moderate adherence to IFA supplementation (60.6%) during pregnancy among postnatal mothers seeking MCH care at Kakamega level 5 hospital. Some of the reasons for non-adherence stated by the respondents included; IFA related side effects (41.3%), forgetfulness (37.3%) and bad smell of the IFA supplements (10.3%). Higher IFA adherence was noted among the primigravida participants (OR=2.704; 95% CI: 1.262, 5.793; p=0.010) compared to multigravida participants, and those with a higher knowledge level of anaemia (OR=3.215; 95% CI: 1.346, 7.68; p=0.009) compared to their counterparts with low anaemia knowledge. Other factors that showed correlation with IFA adherence were: IFA education, pregnancy counselling before conception and the number of antenatal care visits attained. Conclusion: There is a moderate adherence to IFA supplementation during pregnancy among mothers seeking MCH at Kakamega level 5 hospital. The greatest impediments of IFA compliance during pregnancy are IFA side effects, forgetfulness and the bad smell of the IFA tablets. Therefore, providing IFA education to pregnant mothers incorporated with probable ways of managing the IFA side effects would contribute to IFA supplementation adherence.","Bahati, Felix; Kairu-Wanyoike, Salome; Nzioki, Japheth Mativo",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16699.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405117/,199

This systematic review was performed to summarize and categorize the characteristics of sexual violence bystander intervention programs and analyze bystander intervention training approaches for the primary prevention of sexual violence and assault. METHOD From June to July 2017, the authors searched both published and unpublished American and Canadian studies from 2007 to 2017. The published sources included six major electronic databases and the unpublished sources were Google Scholar and the 40 program websites. From the 706 studies that resulted from this initial search, a total of 44 studies (that included a single bystander intervention program and assessments at both pretest and at least one posttest) were included. RESULTS Thirty-two percent of studies analyzed bystander behavior postintervention, and most found significant beneficial outcomes. The most frequently used training methods were presentation, discussion, and active learning exercises. Bringing in the Bystander and The Men's Program had the most replicated empirical support for effectiveness. DISCUSSION There has been a substantive increase in quasi-experimental and randomized controlled trial approaches to assessing the effectiveness of this type of intervention since 2014. The training methods shared between these efficacious programs may translate to bystander interventions for other victimization types, such as child abuse. CONCLUSION The use of in-person bystander training can make positive changes in attitudes and behaviors by increasing awareness of a problem and responsibility to solve it.","Mujal, Gabriela N; Taylor, Meghan E; Fry, Jessica L; Gochez-Kerr, Tatiana H; Weaver, Nancy L","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838019849587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204606/,199

We quantified the detection of laboratory-confirmed influenza among kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population in a nationwide cohort. All laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and hospitalizations due to influenza among all kidney transplant recipients in our country between 1995 and 2017 were captured with database linkage from statutory national registries. Data from the general population of Finland, population 5.5 million, were used for comparisons. Annual incidences of influenza and hospitalizations due to influenza, and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. Altogether 3904 kidney transplant recipients with a total follow-up of 37175 patient-years were included. Incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 9.0 per 1000 patient years in 2003-2019, and 18.0 per 1000 patient years during 2015-2019. The risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly higher among kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population (SIR 5.1, 95% CI 4.5-5.7). SIR for hospitalization due to influenza was 4.4 (95% CI 3.4-4.7). Mortality of the hospitalized patients was 9%, and 5% of the patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Detection of laboratory-confirmed influenza is increased five-fold and risk of hospitalization due to influenza more than four-fold among kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population.","Helanterä, Ilkka; Gissler, Mika; Rimhanen-Finne, Ruska; Ikonen, Niina; Kanerva, Mari; Lempinen, Marko; Finne, Patrik",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252189/,199

76904,Survey of Hospital Employees' Personal Preparedness and Willingness to Work Following a Disaster.,2017,"BACKGROUND Molecular diagnostic methods enhance the sensitivity and broaden the spectrum of detectable respiratory viruses in febrile infants ≤90 days of life. We describe the occurrence of respiratory viruses in this population as well as the rates of serious bacterial infection (SBI) and respiratory viral co-infection with regard to viral characteristics. METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study performed in the emergency department that included previously healthy febrile infants ≤90 days of life. Clinical and historical characteristics were documented and a respiratory nasal wash specimen was obtained from each patient. This sample was tested for 17 common respiratory pathogens and a chart review was conducted to ascertain if the infant was diagnosed with an SBI. RESULTS In a 12-month period, 67% of the 104 recruited febrile infants were positive for a respiratory virus. The most commonly detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus and influenza. The rate of respiratory viral and SBI co-infection was 9% overall and infants with either a systemic respiratory virus or negative viral testing were 3 times more likely to have an SBI than those with viruses typically restricted to the respiratory mucosa (95% CI: 1.1, 9.7). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses are readily detectable via nasopharyngeal wash in febrile infants ≤90 days of life. With the enhanced sensitivity of molecular respiratory diagnostics, rates of co-infection of respiratory viruses and SBI may be higher than previously thought. Further investigation utilizing molecular diagnostics is needed to guide usage in febrile infants ≤90 days.","Nicholson, Erin G; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Ferlic-Stark, Laura; Patel, Kirtida; Gincoo, Karen E; Piedra, Pedro A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30169487/,199

Thus, we measured the joint forces of first-generation articulating laparoscopic instruments. To compare these forces with those necessary in the surgical context, we evaluated the forces sufficient to produce secure surgical ties in an animal model. METHODS The articulating instruments tested were Laparo-Angle (Cambridge Endoscopic Devices Inc, Framingham, MA), RealHand (Novare Surgical Systems Inc, Cupertino, CA), and Roticulator (Covidien Inc, Mansfield, MA). For each, we measured the angle between the end-effector and the shaft in proportion to the articulating force using a push-pull gauge. Two fixed-position configurations of the instruments were predetermined: the neutral and the fully articulated positions. The forces required to secure surgical ties for the ureter, renal artery, and renal vein were evaluated using kidneys harvested from a female pig. RESULTS The bending forces required to bend from the neutral position to 30° were 5.6 ± 1.2 and 4.7 ± 1.0 N with the Laparo-Angle and RealHand, respectively. Furthermore, the slippage forces in the fully articulated state were 1.8 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.2, and 1.5 ± 0.2 N in the above order. In contrast, the mean forces to produce surgical ties of the ureter, renal artery, and renal vein were 14.5 ± 2.3, 11.5 ± 0.8, and 10.3 ± 2.3 N, respectively. CONCLUSION The joint forces of first-generation articulating instruments for laparoendoscopic single-site surgery are not sufficient to meet the usual operative needs. Improved articulating instruments with greater articulating forces should be developed.","Jeong, Chang Wook; Kim, Sung Hoon; Kim, Hyung Tae; Jeong, Seong Jin; Hong, Sung Kyu; Byun, Seok-Soo; Lee, Sang Eun",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350612468961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23242516/,199

METHODS An instrumental study was carried out to assess the psychometric properties, validity, and reliability of the BSQ. The analysis of the measurement invariance was performed using the Least Squares Estimation, and weighted by adjusted variance and polychoric correlations after assessing different measurement models for BSQ in each group. The scores of the final version were correlated with anthropometric indicators by the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS As regards the dimensional analysis, all of the previous models for BSQ have favourable adjustment rates, although those with a single factor show more robust evidence. The configural invariance was accepted; suggesting that the one-dimensional structure is common for both men and women. However, 16-item factorial loadings were statistically different between the groups. Hence, they were discarded and an 18-item version (BSQ-18) was obtained, which is considered invariant as regards gender. In addition, there is a direct relationship between the scores of the BSQ-18 version and the body mass index, waist circumference, and fat percentage. Satisfactory indicators were found as regards stability. CONCLUSIONS The BSQ-18 can be used with men and women, and has high reliability indicators to be conducted in clinical settings to assess eating disorders and obesity among university students.","Dominguez-Lara, Sergio; Aguirre-Pérez, Saret; Romo-González, Tania; Herrera-Meza, Socorro; Campos-Uscanga, Yolanda",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2018.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888658/,199

We aimed to determine the impact of mannitol on outcome among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). METHODS INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial of 2839 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure allocated to intensive (target systolic blood pressure, <140 mm Hg within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended (target systolic blood pressure, <180 mm Hg) blood pressure-lowering treatment. Propensity score and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between mannitol treatment (within 7 days) and poor outcome, defined by death or major disability on the modified Rankin Scale score (3-6) at 90 days. RESULTS There was no significant difference in poor outcome between mannitol (n=1533) and nonmannitol (n=993) groups: propensity score-matched odds ratio of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.09; P=0.30) and multivariable odds ratio of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.07; P=0.18). Although a better outcome was suggested in patients with larger (≥15 mL) than those with smaller (<15 mL) baseline hematomas who received mannitol (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.78] versus odds ratio, 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15]; P homogeneity<0.03 in propensity score analyses), the association was not consistent in analyses across other cutoff points (≥10 and ≥20 mL) and for differing grades of neurological severity. Mannitol was not associated with excess serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Mannitol seems safe but might not improve outcome in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

81963,Faculty-Created Competition to Enhance Scholarly Writing for Students in a Baccalaureate Nursing Program.,2020-06-09,"Heterogeneities within disease hosts suggest that not all individuals have the same probability of transmitting disease or becoming infected. This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host-pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as '20/80 Rule', i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest SNV transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.","Clay, Christine A; Lehmer, Erin M; Previtali, Andrea; St Jeor, Stephen; Dearing, M Denise",Proceedings.

However, benefits in terms of patient-related outcomes are still under debate. Both NIV adherence and heterogeneous responses in different COPD phenotypes may contribute to the difficulty of demonstrating NIV benefits. Our aim was to assess the impact of NIV adherence on the rate of hospitalization for acute exacerbation and death. METHODS This is a prospective multi-centre cohort study of COPD patients treated by long-term NIV. Comorbidities, anthropometrics, respiratory parameters were collected at inclusion in the study. Follow-up data included vital status, NIV adherence and hospitalizations. The influence of NIV adherence on prognosis was tested using an adjusted Cox model. Sensitivity analyses for obese and non-obese COPD subtypes were also conducted. RESULTS Two hundred thirteen patients (48% obese) were included with 45.5% died during 47.7 [interquartile range = 27.8; 73] months' follow-up. Survival was better in obese COPD than non-obese COPD. The use of NIV > 9 h/day was associated with an increased risk of death or hospitalization for acute exacerbation [HR = 1.6; 95CI: 1.1-2.4]. In obese COPD, this risk described a U-shaped curve from >1 to >9 h/day NIV usage with an improvement in prognosis when NIV adherence was > 5 h/day [HR = 0.5; 95CI: 0.2-0.9]. CONCLUSIONS Adherence to NIV was associated with better prognosis only in obese COPD. NIV use > 9 h/day predicted poor outcomes.","Borel, Jean-Christian; Pepin, Jean-Louis; Pison, Christophe; Vesin, Aurélien; Gonzalez-Bermejo, Jesus; Court-Fortune, Isabelle; Timsit, Jean-François",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912564/,199

In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg μL-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection. Owing to the high sensitivity of the in situ AuNPs, simplicity of portable device fabrication, and rapid colorimetric detection, we strongly believe that the fabricated portable device could serve as a kit for rapid POCT for instantaneous detection of infectious diseases, and could be readily usable at the bedside.","Sivakumar, Rajamanickam; Dinh, Vu Phong; Lee, Nae Yoon",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1lc00019e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554994/,199

In adult studies, lung ultrasound has performed better than chest x-ray in the diagnosis of pneumothorax. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of lung ultrasound (LUS) examination to detect pneumothorax using a preterm animal model. METHODS This was a prospective, observational study using newborn Border-Leicester lambs at gestational age = 126 days (equivalent to gestational age = 26 weeks in humans) receiving mechanical ventilation from birth to 2 h of life. At the conclusion of the experiment, LUS was performed, the lambs were then euthanised and a post-mortem exam was immediately performed. We used previously published ultrasound techniques to identify pneumothorax. Test characteristics of LUS to detect pneumothorax were calculated, using the post-mortem exam as the 'gold standard' test. RESULTS Nine lambs (18 lungs) were examined. Four lambs had a unilateral pneumothorax, all of which were identified by LUS with no false positives. CONCLUSIONS This was the first study to use post-mortem findings to test the efficacy of LUS to detect pneumothorax in a newborn animal model. Lung ultrasound accurately detected pneumothorax, verified by post-mortem exam, in premature, newborn lambs.","Blank, Douglas A; Hooper, Stuart B; Binder-Heschl, Corinna; Kluckow, Martin; Gill, Andrew W; LaRosa, Domenic A; Inocencio, Ishmael M; Moxham, Alison; Rodgers, Karyn; Zahra, Valerie A; Davis, Peter G; Polglase, Graeme R",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.13154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27088264/,199
94463,The Design and Preliminary Experience with a Virtual Diversity Visiting Student Acting Internship in Radiology for Underrepresented Minority Medical Students.,2021-03-24,"Background: Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Irish health system required the redeployment of public sector staff and the recruitment of dedicated contact tracing staff in the effort to contain the spread of the virus. Contact tracing is crucial for effective disease control and is normally carried out by public health teams. Contact tracing staff are provided with rapid intensive training but are operating in a dynamic environment where processes and advice are adapting continuously. Real-time data is essential to inform strategy, coordinate interconnected processes, and respond to needs . Given that many contact tracers have been newly recruited or redeployed, they may not have significant experience in healthcare and may experience difficulties in managing the anxieties and emotional distress of the public. Aim: (i) identify emerging needs and issues and feed this information back to the Health Service Executive for updates to the COVID-19 Contact Management Programme (CMP); (ii) understand the psychological impact on contact tracers and inform the development of appropriate supports. Methods: We will use a mixed-methods approach. A brief online survey will be administered at up to three time points during 2021 to measure emotional exhaustion, anxiety, general health, and stress of contact tracing staff, identify tracing systems or processes issues, as well as issues of concern and confusion among the public. Interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to achieve a more in-depth understanding of these experiences. Observations may be conducted in contact tracing centres to document processes, practices, and explore any local contextual issues. Impact: Regular briefs arising from this research with data, analysis, and recommendations will aim to support the work of the CMP to identify problems and implement solutions. We will deliver regular feedback on systems issues; challenges; and the psychological well-being of contact tracing staff.","O'Donovan, Róisín; Buckley, Claire; Crowley, Philip; Fulham-McQuillan, Hugh; Gilmore, Brynne; Martin, Jennifer; McAuliffe, Eilish; Moore, Gemma; Nicholson, Emma; Ní Shé, Éidín; O'Hara, Mary Clare; Segurado, Ricardo; Sweeney, Mary Rose; Wall, Patrick; De Brún, Aoife",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13236.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632267/,199
94686,Covid-19 risks and response in South Asia.,2020-03-25,"BACKGROUND Hypocapnia is a common alteration during anesthesia in neonates. AIM To investigate the effects of hypocapnia and hypocapnia combined with hypotension (HCT) on cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygenation in anesthetized piglets. METHOD Thirty anesthetized piglets were randomly allocated to groups: moderate hypocapnia (mHC), severe hypocapnia (sHC) and HCT. Cerebral monitoring comprised a tissue oxygen partial pressure and a laser Doppler probe inserted into the brain tissue as well as a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor placed on the skin, measuring regional oxygen saturation. Hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation (target PaCO2 mHC: 3.7 - 4; sHC: 3.1 - 3.3 kPa) and hypotension by blood withdrawal and nitroprusside infusion (mean blood pressure: 35 - 38 mmHg). Data were analyzed at baseline, during (Tr20, Tr40, Tr60) and after (Post20, Post40, Post60) treatment. RESULTS Compared to baseline, tissue oxygen partial pressure decreased significantly and equally during all treatments [mean(SD) at baseline: mHC 35.7(32.45); sHC: 28.1(20.24); HCT 25.4(10.3) and at Tr60: mHC: 29.9(27.36); sHC: 22.2(18.37); HCT: 18.4(9.5) mmHg]. Decreased laser Doppler flow was detected with all treatments at Tr20 [mHC: 0.9(0.18); sHC: 0.88(0.15); HCT: 0.97(0.13) proportion from baseline]. Independently of group, regional oxygen saturation varied only after reverting and not during treatment. Blood lactate, pH, HCO3 - and PaO2 increased during treatment with no differences between groups. CONCLUSION This animal model revealed reduced cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation during hypocapnia without detectable changes in regional oxygen saturation as measured by NIRS. Changes occurred as early as during moderate hypocapnia. This article is protected by copyright.

98293,"Hospital consultants deserve 5% pay rise, says BMA.",2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND Malnutrition among elderly surgical patients has been associated with poor postoperative outcomes and reduced functional status. Although previous studies have shown that nutrition contributes to patient outcomes, its long-term impact on functional status requires better characterization. This study examines the effect of nutrition on postoperative upper body function over time in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery. METHODS This is a 2-year prospective study of elderly patients (≥70 years) undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Preoperative nutrition status was determined with the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). The primary outcome was handgrip strength (HGS) at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks postsurgery. Repeated measures analysis was used to determine whether SGA status affects the trajectory of postoperative HGS. RESULTS The cohort included 144 patients with a mean age of 77.8 ± 5.0 years and a mean body mass index of 27.7 ± 5.1 kg/m2 . The median (interquartile range) Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3 (2-6). Participants were categorized as well-nourished (86%) and mildly to moderately malnourished (14%), with mean preoperative HGS of 25.8 ± 9.2 kg and 19.6 ± 7.0 kg, respectively. At 24 weeks, 64% of well-nourished patients had recovered to baseline HGS, compared with 44% of mildly to moderately malnourished patients. Controlling for relevant covariates, SGA did not significantly affect the trajectory of postoperative HGS. CONCLUSION While HGS values over the 24 weeks were consistently higher in the well-nourished SGA group than the mildly to moderately malnourished SGA group, no difference in the trajectories of HGS was detected between the groups.","Sikder, Tarifin; Maimon, Geva; Sourial, Nadia; Tahiri, Mehdi; Teasdale, Debby; Bernier, Paule; Fraser, Shannon A; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Bergman, Simon",JPEN.

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an RNA virus-specific enzyme highly conserved among various viral families, has been known as the broad-range antiviral drug target. Here, we developed an RNA-based graphene biosensor system [RNA nano-graphene oxide system (RANGO)] to enable the fluorescence-based quantitative analysis of the RdRp enzyme activity. We used the RANGO system to a high-throughput chemical screening to identify novel direct-acting antiviral drug candidates targeting DV RdRp from the FDA-approved small-molecule library. RANGO accelerated the massive selection of drug candidates. We found that one of the selected hit compounds, montelukast, showed antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo by directly inhibiting replication of DV and thus relieved related symptoms.","Park, Se-Jin; Kim, Jungho; Kang, Seounghun; Cha, Hyung Jin; Shin, Hojeong; Park, Jisang; Jang, Yong-Suk; Woo, Jae-Sung; Won, Cheolhee; Min, Dal-Hee",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz8201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523995/,199

Results showed 95% of the 20 funerals exceeding SG limits with greater, and highly variable crowd sizes in rural than urban communities. Additionally, 75% of the 20 funerals did not adhere to the 2-m SD requirement of which 80% were in rural areas. Higher SG and SD compliance in urban funerals could be partially explained by the presence of a recognized authority who enforced crowd size limits, and the heterogeneous urban community who were more likely to flag breaches than their collectivistic, homogeneous, close-knit, rural counterparts. Ultimately, health authorities need to utilize a social lens that incorporates etic and emic differences in culture to ensure maximum compliance.","Vave, Ron",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211005921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853384/,199

However, the insertion of a feeding jejunostomy can cause significant postoperative morbidity. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing placement of feeding jejunostomy by conventional laparotomy with an alternative laparoscopic approach. METHODS A retrospective review of data prospectively collected at the Oxford Oesophagogastric Centre between August 2017 and July 2019 was performed including consecutive patients undergoing feeding jejunostomy insertion. RESULTS In the study period, 157 patients underwent jejunostomy insertion in the context of oesophageal cancer therapy, 126 (80%) by open technique and 31 (20%) laparoscopic. Pre-operative demographic and nutritional characteristics were broadly similar between groups. In the early postoperative period jejunostomy-associated complications were noted in 54 cases (34.4%) and were significantly more common among those undergoing open as compared with laparoscopic insertion (38.1% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.049). Furthermore, major complications were more common among those undergoing open insertion, whether as a stand-alone or at the time of staging laparoscopy (n = 11/71), as compared with insertion at the time of oesophagectomy (n = 3/86, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS This report represents the largest to our knowledge single-centre comparison of open vs. laparoscopic jejunostomy insertion in patients undergoing oesophagectomy in the treatment of gastroesophageal malignancy. We conclude that the laparoscopic jejunostomy insertion technique described represents a safe and effective approach to enteral access which may offer superior outcomes to conventional open procedures.","Mastoridis, Sotiris; Bracalente, Giada; Hanganu, Christine-Bianca; Neccia, Michela; Giuliani, Antonio; Gillies, Richard; Marshall, Robert; Maynard, Nicholas; Sgromo, Bruno",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-021-01318-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645433/,199

In particular, surgical therapy is often only considered after long-term conservative treatment. The aim of this study was the bi-national analysis of patients who underwent pancreatic resection for suspected chronic pancreatitis at an Austrian and a German high-volume center with regard to overall postoperative outcome and incidental carcinoma sequence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Overall, 252 consecutive pancreatic resections for suspected chronic pancreatitis were performed at the two institutions between 2005 and 2015. In a bi-national retrospective analysis, postoperative results as well as histopathological findings were analyzed. RESULTS Pancreatic resections were performed in 193 male (76.6%) and 59 female patients (23.4%), with a median age of 53.2 years. A total of 175 resections of the pancreatic head (69.4%), 37 distal pancreatectomies (14.7%), 23 total pancreatectomies (9.1%) and 18 other pancreatic resections (7.1%) were performed within our study period. Postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo grade II or greater occurred in 94 patients (37.3%). Twenty-one patients (8.3%) developed clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B and C), while postoperative mortality occurred in four patients (1.6%). Final histological examination of the operative specimen revealed incidental pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 18 out of the 252 patients (7.1%). CONCLUSION The results of our study demonstrate that pancreatic resections for chronic pancreatitis may nowadays be considered technically feasible and safe. The high incidence of incidental pancreatic adenocarcinoma especially underlines the necessity for an early surgical therapeutic approach for these patients.","Malinka, Thomas; Klein, Fritz; LE Thu, Trang; Rösch, Christina S; Wundsam, Helwig; Biebl, Matthias; Pratschke, Johann; Bahra, Marcus; Függer, Reinhold",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.12812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061274/,199

In recent years, the role of glycans and lectins in pathogen-host interactions has become an increasingly relevant issue. This review focuses on the interactions between a specific lectin family, galectins, and the broad range of viral infections in which they play a role. Discussed are the diverse activities that galectins play in interacting directly with virions or the cells they infect, to promote or inhibit viral infection. In addition we describe how galectin expression is regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by viral infections. We also compare the contribution of known galectin-mediated immune modulation, across a range of innate and adaptive immune anti-viral responses, to the outcome of viral infections.","Machala, Emily A; McSharry, Brian P; Rouse, Barry T; Abendroth, Allison; Slobedman, Barry",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30648945/,199

METHODS Fifty children who were 1-10 years of age and who received general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation for adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. In all participants, the transverse diameter of the subglottic airway was measured with USG at the cricoid level without ventilation. The outer diameter (OD) of the maximum allowable ETT was chosen according to the measured subglottic airway diameter. In the presence of resistance to passage of the tube into the trachea or in the absence of an audible leak at airway pressure of >25 cm H2O, the ETT was replaced with a tube whose internal diameter (ID) was 0.5 mm smaller. If a leak was audible at airway pressures of <10 cm H2O, if a seal could not be achieved with a cuff pressure of >25 cm H2O or if a peak airway pressure of >25 cm H2O was observed during ventilation, the tube was changed to a tube one size larger. The OD of the best-fit ETT was converted to the ID. The best-fit ID, the requirement for ETT replacement, the duration of airway diameter measurement by USG and the peak airway pressure were recorded. RESULTS The success rate of the first attempt with USG was 86%; the ETT was replaced in five patients with a tube one size larger and in two patients with a tube one size smaller.

126206,Unequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientists.,2020-07-15,"OBJECTIVE To systematically search the literature and construct a meta-synthesis of how choice and control are perceived by people with spinal cord injury (SCI). DATA SOURCES Medline, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, HealthSource, ProQuest, PsychInfo, SAGE, and SCOPUS were searched from 1980 until September 2018 including all languages. Reference lists of selected studies were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION Eligible qualitative studies included perspectives about choice of control as reported by people with an SCI. Studies were excluded if they included perspectives from other stakeholder groups. A total of 6706 studies were screened for title and abstract and full text of 127 studies were reviewed resulting in a final selection of 29. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the studies were extracted along with any data (author interpretations and quotes) relating to perspectives on choice and control. DATA SYNTHESIS First-order analysis involved coding the data in each study and second-order analysis involved translating each segment of coded data into broader categories with third-order analysis condensing categories to 2 broad overarching themes. These themes were experiencing vulnerability or security and adapting to bounded abilities. CONCLUSIONS Perspectives of choice and control are influenced by interrelated environmental, interpersonal, and personal contexts. From a personal perspective, participants reported a readiness for adaptation that included turning points where emotional and cognitive capacity to make choices and take control changed. Health professionals need to be responsive to this readiness, promote empowerment and foster, rather than remove, hope.","Murray, Carolyn M; Van Kessel, Gisela; Guerin, Michelle; Hillier, Susan; Stanley, Mandy",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2019.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30794768/,199

127451,Mindfulness in the Time of Pandemic.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE The technique for fixation of mesh has been attributed to adverse patient and surgical outcomes. Although this has been the subject of vigorous debate in laparoscopic hernia repair, the several methods of fixation in open, anterior inguinal hernia repair have seldom been reviewed. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether there is any difference in patient-based (recurrence, post-operative pain, SSI, quality of life) or surgical outcomes (operative time, length of operative stay) with different fixation methods in open anterior inguinal hernioplasty. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases. Randomised clinical trials assessing more than one method of mesh fixation (or fixation versus no fixation) of mesh in adults (>18 years) in open, anterior inguinal hernia repair, with a minimum of 6-month follow-up and including at least one of the primary outcome measures (recurrence, chronic pain, surgical site infection) were included in the review. Secondary outcomes analysed included post-operative pain (within the first week), quality of life, operative time and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Twelve randomised clinical trials, which included 1,992 primary inguinal hernia repairs, were eligible for inclusion. Four studies compared n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (NB2C) glues to sutures, two compared self-fixing meshes to sutures, four compared fibrin sealant to sutures, one compared tacks to sutures, and one compared absorbable sutures to non-absorbable sutures. The majority of the trials were rated as low or very low-quality studies. There was no significant difference in recurrence or surgical site infection rates between fixation methods. There was significant heterogeneity in the measurement of chronic pain. Three trials reported significantly lower rates of chronic pain with fibrin sealant or glue fixation compared to sutures. A further three studies reported lower pain rates within the first week with non-suture fixation techniques compared to suture fixation. A significant reduction in operative time, ranging form 6 to 17.9 min with non-suture fixation, was reported in five of the studies. Although infrequently measured, there were no significant differences in length of hospital stay or quality of life between fixation methods. CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to promote fibrin sealant, self-fixing meshes or NB2C glues ahead of suture fixation. However, these products have been shown to be at least substantially equivalent, and moderate-quality RCTs have suggested that both fibrin sealant and NB2C glues may have a beneficial effect on reducing immediate post-operative pain and chronic pain in at-risk populations, such as younger active patients. It will ultimately be up to surgeons and health-care policy makers to decide whether based on the limited evidence these products represent a worthwhile cost for their patients.","Sanders, D L; Waydia, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1093-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23649403/,199

In December 2019, COVID-19, promoted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first reported in Wuhan (China) as a new coronavirus disease. This outbreak quickly reached a pandemic status, affecting at least 185 countries and territories to date on all continents. The first case of COVID-19 reported in São Paulo city (Brazil) occurred in February 26th. Days later, 182 suspected cases in 16 states were being monitored. In May 30th, 514,849 cases and 29,314 deaths were confirmed in Brazil comprising all 26 states and Federal District. The primary measure in order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 involved social isolation. At that time there were not enough diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals and data were strongly associated with sub notifications. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this measure largely depends on the individual's social responsibility. This measure has a severe economic and social impact, as in other countries. In this review, we present an overview and scientific perspectives of the evolution of COVID-19 from Brazilian databases in which climate and economic situations differ from China, European countries, and the USA.","Melo, Cristiane M L DE; Silva, Guilherme A S; Melo, Alanne R S; Freitas, AntÔnio C DE",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,https://doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202020200709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844985/,199

METHODS We reviewed the medical records and clinical photographs of 26 patients seen at 5 centers in Turkey and Belgium between March 16, 2006, and July 6, 2010. Observation procedures included clinical examination, anterior segment color photography, gonioscopy, laser flare photometry, and pupillometry. RESULTS All 26 patients (20 women and 6 men; mean [SD] age, 43.2 [10.5] years) had bilateral involvement. Twenty-three patients (88%) had acute-onset disease with severe photophobia and red eyes. Nineteen patients (73%) had a preceding flulike illness and used systemic antibiotics, including moxifloxacin. Diagnostic laboratory workup was unremarkable. There was pigment discharge into the anterior chamber, and flare was elevated in the absence of inflammatory cells. Most patients had severe diffuse transillumination of the iris and mydriatic distorted pupils. Pupillometry revealed a compromised reaction to light. The most serious complication was an intractable early rise in intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy revealed heavy pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork. Although symptoms were relieved promptly by application of topical corticosteroid, the median duration of pigment dispersion was 5.25 months. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral acute iris transillumination with pigment dispersion and persistent mydriasis is a new clinical entity that is not an ocular adverse effect of oral moxifloxacin treatment, as previously suggested. The etiopathogenesis of this entity remains to be elucidated.","Tugal-Tutkun, Ilknur; Onal, Sumru; Garip, Aylin; Taskapili, Muhittin; Kazokoglu, Haluk; Kadayifcilar, Sibel; Kestelyn, Philippe",Archives of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21987674/,199

134876,Incorporating SPACES recommendations to the COVID-19 ward care approach at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital.,2020-10-16,"IMPORTANCE Optimizing the nature and sequence of diagnostic imaging when managing lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage may reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES To determine if preceding visceral arteriography with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage increases hemorrhage identification and localization and to determine if CTA was superior to nuclear scintigraphy when used as a pre-angiogram test. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis was conducted of prospectively acquired data from an interventional radiology database and of individual electronic medical records from an academic tertiary medical center. On January 1, 2009, a new, evidence-based, institutional protocol that formally incorporated CTA to manage acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage was launched after multidisciplinary consultation. All records of patients who underwent visceral angiography (VA) for acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012, were evaluated. EXPOSURES Imaging, procedural, and operative details were abstracted from the medical records of all patients who underwent VA for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visceral angiography results and efficacy were compared in patients before and after protocol implementation and compared based on which imaging method was used prior to angiography. RESULTS A total of 161 angiographic procedures were performed during the study period (78 before and 83 after protocol implementation). Use of CTA increased from 3.8% to 56.6%, and use of nuclear scintigraphy decreased from 83.3% to 50.6% following protocol implementation (P < .001). Preceding angiography with CTA resulted in similar angiography contrast administration (mean [SD] amount for CTA prior to VA, 135 [63] vs 160 [77] mL; P = .18) and fluoroscopy time (mean [SD], 26.3 [16.8] vs 32.2 [34.9] minutes; P = .34). Although nuclear scintigraphy and CTA had similar sensitivity and specificity, localization of hemorrhage site by CTA was more precise and consistent with angiography findings. As a pre-angiography test, compared with nuclear scintigraphy, CTA reduced overall the number of imaging studies required (mean [SD] number per patient admission, 2.1 [0.3] vs 2.5 [0.8]; P = .005) and resulted in administration of more overall contrast (mean [SD], 220 [80] vs 130 [70] mL; P < .001) without worsening renal function. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Preceding VA with a diagnostic study improves positive localization of the site of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage compared with VA alone. Increasing the use of CTA for pre-angiography imaging may reduce overall imaging studies while appearing to increase positive yield at VA. Computed tomographic angiography can be used as part of a lower intestinal hemorrhage management algorithm and does not appear to worsen renal function despite the additional contrast load.","Jacovides, Christina L; Nadolski, Gregory; Allen, Steven R; Martin, Niels D; Holena, Daniel N; Reilly, Patrick M; Trerotola, Scott; Braslow, Benjamin M; Kaplan, Lewis J; Pascual, Jose L",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2015.97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992504/,199
135716,COVID-19 and Paediatric Dentistry after the lockdown.,2020-06-01,"UNLABELLED Cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is essential for the infectivity of influenza viruses. Here, we analyzed the role of the serine protease TMPRSS2, which activates HA in the human respiratory tract, in pathogenesis in a mouse model. Replication of the human H7N9 isolate A/Anhui/1/13 and of human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses was compared in TMPRSS2 knockout (TMPRSS2(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice. Knockout of TMPRSS2 expression inhibited H7N9 influenza virus replication in explants of murine tracheas, bronchi, and lungs. H1N1 virus replication was also strongly suppressed in airway explants of TMPRSS2(-/-) mice, while H3N2 virus replication was only marginally affected. H7N9 and H1N1 viruses were apathogenic in TMPRSS2(-/-) mice, whereas WT mice developed severe disease with mortality rates of 100% and 20%, respectively. In contrast, all H3N2 infected TMPRSS2(-/-) and WT mice succumbed to lethal infection. Cleavage analysis showed that H7 and H1 are efficiently activated by TMPRSS2, whereas H3 is less susceptible to the protease. Our data demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is a host factor that is essential for pneumotropism and pathogenicity of H7N9 and H1N1 influenza virus in mice. In contrast, replication of H3N2 virus appears to depend on another, not yet identified protease, supporting the concept that human influenza viruses differ in protease specificity. IMPORTANCE Cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is essential for the infectivity of influenza virus, but little is known about its relevance for pathogenesis in mammals. Here, we show that knockout mice that do not express the HA-activating protease TMPRSS2 are resistant to pulmonary disease with lethal outcome when infected with influenza A viruses of subtypes H7N9 and H1N1, whereas they are not protected from lethal H3N2 virus infection. These findings demonstrate that human influenza viruses differ in protease specificity, and that expression of the appropriate protease in respiratory tissues is essential for pneumotropism and pathogenicity. Our observations also demonstrate that HA-activating proteases and in particular TMPRSS2 are promising targets for influenza therapy.","Tarnow, Carolin; Engels, Géraldine; Arendt, Annika; Schwalm, Folker; Sediri, Hanna; Preuss, Annette; Nelson, Peter S; Garten, Wolfgang; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Gabriel, Gülsah; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03799-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522916/,199
136275,Covid-19: South Korea relaxes social distancing after the number of new cases drops below 10 a day.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND The incidence of clinically apparent stroke in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) exceeds that of any other procedure performed by interventional cardiologists and, in the index admission, occurs more than twice as frequently with TAVI than with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, this represents only a small component of the vast burden of neurological injury that occurs during TAVI, with recent evidence suggesting that many strokes are clinically silent or only subtly apparent. Additionally, insult may manifest as slight neurocognitive dysfunction rather than overt neurological deficits. Characterisation of the incidence and underlying aetiology of these neurological events may lead to identification of currently unrecognised neuroprotective strategies. METHODS The Silent and Apparent Neurological Injury in TAVI (SANITY) Study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study comparing the incidence of neurological injury after TAVI versus SAVR. It introduces an intensive, standardised, formal neurologic and neurocognitive disease assessment for all aortic valve recipients, regardless of intervention (SAVR, TAVI), valve-type (bioprosthetic, Edwards SAPIEN-XT) or access route (sternotomy, transfemoral, transapical or transaortic). Comprehensive monitoring of neurological insult will also be recorded to more fully define and compare the neurological burden of the procedures and identify targets for harm minimisation strategies. DISCUSSION The SANITY study undertakes the most rigorous assessment of neurological injury reported in the literature to date. It attempts to accurately characterise the insult and sustained injury associated with both TAVI and SAVR in an attempt to advance understanding of this complication and associations thus allowing for improved patient selection and procedural modification.","Fanning, Jonathon P; Wesley, Allan J; Platts, David G; Walters, Darren L; Eeles, Eamonn M; Seco, Michael; Tronstad, Oystein; Strugnell, Wendy; Barnett, Adrian G; Clarke, Andrew J; Bellapart, Judith; Vallely, Michael P; Tesar, Peter J; Fraser, John F",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2261-14-45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708720/,199

We aimed at determining reflux patterns on 24-h pH-impedance monitoring performed on PPI and correlating impedance patterns and symptom occurrence in PPI non-responders. METHODS Seventy-eight PPI non-responder patients underwent 24-h pH-impedance monitoring on PPI. Reflux impedance characterization included gastric and supragastric belches and proximal extent of reflux. Symptoms were considered associated with reflux if occurring within 5 min after a reflux event. Patients were classified into three groups: persistent acid reflux (acid esophageal exposure [AET] >5% of time), reflux sensitivity (AET <5%, symptom index [SI] ≥50%), and functional symptoms (AET <5%, SI <50%). Dominant impedance pattern was determined for each patient. KEY RESULTS Seven patients (9%) had persistent acid reflux, 28 (36%) reflux sensitivity, and 43 (55%) functional symptoms. A total of 4296 reflux events were identified (median per patient 45 [range 4-221]). Although liquid reflux was the most common pattern in all groups, patients with reflux sensitivity and functional symptoms had much more variability in their pattern profile with a large proportion being associated with gastric and supragastric belching. Only 417 reflux events (9.7%) were associated with symptoms. Reflux with a supragastric component and proximal extent were more likely to be associated with symptoms. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES The impedance reflux profile in PPI non-responders was heterogeneous and the majority of reflux events were not associated with symptoms. Thus, the treatment of PPI non-responders should focus on mechanisms beyond reflux, such as visceral hypersensitivity and hypervigilance.","Roman, S; Keefer, L; Imam, H; Korrapati, P; Mogni, B; Eident, K; Friesen, L; Kahrilas, P J; Martinovich, Z; Pandolfino, J E",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26337396/,199

MEASURES Rates of primary care record access and re-presentation to the emergency department (ED) within 30 days and hospital admission. DESIGN A retrospective observational study of 77 181 ED presentations over 4 years and 9 months, analysing 8184 index presentations in which patients' primary care records were accessed from the ED. Data were compared with 17 449 randomly selected index control presentations. Analysis included propensity score matching for age and triage categories. RESULTS 6.3% of overall ED presentations triggered a lookup (rising to 8.3% in year 5); 83.1% of patients were only looked up once and 16.9% of patients looked up on multiple occasions. Lookup patients were on average 25 years older (z=-9.180, p<0.001, r=0.43). Patients with more urgent triage classifications had their records accessed more frequently (z=-36.47, p<0.001, r=0.23). Record access was associated with a significant but negligible increase in hospital admission (χ2 (1, n=13 120)=98.385, p<0.001, phi=0.087) and readmission within 30 days (χ2 (1, n=13 120)=86.288, p<0.001, phi=0.081). DISCUSSION Emergency care clinicians access primary care records more frequently for older patients or those in higher triage categories.

Global medical systems have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the majority of patients with intracranial disease require time-sensitive surgery, how to conduct neurosurgery and prevent and control nosocomial infection during a pandemic is challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients undergoing neurosurgical and neurointerventional procedures at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic between January 21 and July 31, 2020. A 3-level system of COVID-19 risk was established based on medical conditions, epidemiologic, and symptom inquiry and the results of triage. A transitional unit was established for patients in whom COVID-19 had not been ruled out on admission to hospital. RESULTS A total of 4025 patients underwent neurosurgery during the study period, including 768 emergent and 3257 nonemergent procedures. Of these patients, 3722 were low-risk for COVID-19, 303 were moderate-risk, and none were high-risk. In addition, 1419 patients underwent neurointerventional procedures, including 114 emergent and 1305 nonemergent interventions, of which 1339 were low-risk patients, 80 were moderate-risk and none were high-risk. A total of 895 patients (neurosurgical and neurointerventional) were admitted to the transitional unit. Forty-five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred to the COVID-19 designated hospital. There were no cases of COVID-19 nosocomial infections among surgical patients or health care workers. CONCLUSION On the basis of our single-center experience, developing a full screening protocol for COVID-19, establishing a risk level, and using a transitional unit for those with unknown COVID-19 status are effective measures to provide a safe environment for patients and health care workers.","Jian, Minyu; Liang, Fa; Liu, Haiyang; Zeng, Hengyu; Peng, Yuming; Han, Ruquan",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976309/,199

We calibrate the proposed model to fit the four data sets, viz. data for the states of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and overall India, and estimate the rate of infection of susceptible with symptomatic population and recovery rate of quarantined individuals. We also estimate basic reproduction number to illustrate the epidemiological status of the regions under study. Our simulations infer that the infective population will be on increasing curve for Maharashtra and India, and settling for Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected individuals. Our results reveal that to curtail the disease burden in India, specific control strategies should be implemented effectively so that the basic reproduction number is decreased below unity. The three control strategies are shown to be important preventive measures to lower disease transmission rate. The model is further extended to its stochastic counterpart to encapsulate the variation or uncertainty observed in the disease transmissibility. We observe the variability in the infective population and found their distribution at certain fixed time, which shows that for small populations, the stochasticity will play an important role.","Srivastav, Akhil Kumar; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Srivastava, Prashant K; Ghosh, Mini; Kang, Yun",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525087/,199
142337,Covid-19: South Africa pauses use of Oxford vaccine after study casts doubt on efficacy against variant.,2021-02-08,"Recent measurements of spin-polarized electron collisions with halocamphor molecules have observed intriguing trends in their dissociative electron attachment (DEA) chiral asymmetries. While the differences between the DEA asymmetries of 3-bromocamphor (3BrC) and 3-iodocamphor (3IC) were consistent with the larger atomic number of iodine, the even higher chiral asymmetry reported for 10-iodocamphor (10IC) was unexpected. In fact, the helicity densities and the distances from the iodine atoms to the closest chiral centers would suggest smaller asymmetries for 10IC compared to 3IC. To better understand the observed trends, we performed electron scattering and bound state calculations, as well as Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations for the three halocamphors. Our results indicate that the DEA signals stem exclusively from halide ions produced by the fast dissociation of low-lying σ* anion states. While we also found dipole bound states and higher-lying shape resonances, we do not expect those states to significantly contribute to the observed yields. Despite the fact that we do not account for the spin-orbit interactions or reaction dynamics, the energies and autoionization lifetimes of the σ* resonances strongly support larger DEA yields for 10IC than 3BrC. The more efficient dissociation could explain the fourfold difference between the maximum DEA chiral asymmetries, since the difference in the atomic numbers of iodine and bromine only accounts for a factor of two. Additionally, our calculations suggest that the twofold difference between the DEA asymmetries of the iodocamphor isomers could be related to the partial suppression of the cross section for electron attachment to 3IC, compared to 10IC.","Ruivo, Julio Cesar; Kossoski, Fábris; Varella, Márcio T do N",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp02316k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369948/,199

Here, using anonymized mobile geolocation data in China, we devise a mobility-associated social contact index to quantify the impact of both physical distancing and vaccination measures in a unified way. Building on this index, our epidemiological model reveals that vaccination combined with physical distancing can contain resurgences without relying on stay-at-home restrictions, whereas a gradual vaccination process alone cannot achieve this. Further, for cities with medium population density, vaccination can reduce the duration of physical distancing by 36% to 78%, whereas for cities with high population density, infection numbers can be well-controlled through moderate physical distancing. These findings improve our understanding of the joint effects of vaccination and physical distancing with respect to a city's population density and social contact patterns.","Huang, Bo; Wang, Jionghua; Cai, Jixuan; Yao, Shiqi; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung; Tam, Tony Hong-Wing; Hong, Ying-Yi; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Carioli, Alessandra; Floyd, Jessica R; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Yang, Weizhong; Li, Zhongjie; Tatem, Andrew J; Lai, Shengjie",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01063-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603201/,199

This study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of the integrated ultrasonic/bipolar Thunderbeat™ for this procedure. METHODS This retrospective non-inferiority study compared the Thunderbeat™ and the ultrasonic Harmonic Focus® devices in 761 consecutive patients receiving a partial or total open thyroidectomy (with or without neck dissection). The main outcomes were duration of surgery, blood loss, and length of hospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were occurrence of hypocalcaemia, recurrent nerve paralysis, or other post-operative complications. A non-inferiority logistic regression approach was used to evaluate primary outcomes, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, type of surgery, anaesthesiology score, and indication (benign or malign). RESULTS The data demonstrated that the Thunderbeat was non-inferior to the Focus in terms of duration of surgery, blood loss, and length of hospital stay. Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed non-inferiority of the Thunderbeat for partial thyroidectomy (all three outcomes), total thyroidectomy (duration of surgery and length of hospitalisation), and total thyroidectomy with neck dissection (length of hospitalisation). In terms of recurrent nerve paralysis and post-operative complications, the Thunderbeat performed at least as well as the Focus; however, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the occurrence of post-operative hypocalcaemia. CONCLUSION In a cohort of patients that underwent partial or total thyroidectomy, the Thunderbeat appeared to be at least as good as the Harmonic Focus.","Van Slycke, Sam; Gillardin, Jean-Pierre; Van Den Heede, Klaas; Minguet, Joan; Vermeersch, Hubert; Brusselaers, Nele",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-016-1448-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222244/,199

149351,Digital Technology for AMD Management in the Post-COVID-19 New Normal.,2021,"Context While the data generated by medical students at schools that require electronic patient encounter logs is primarily used to monitor their training progress, it can also be a great source of public health data. Specifically, it can be used for syndromic surveillance, a method used to analyze instantaneous health data for early detection of disease outbreaks. Objective To analyze how the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes input by medical students at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine into the Clinical Rotation Evaluation and Documentation Organizer (CREDO) patient encounter logging system could act as a new syndromic surveillance tool. Methods A CREDO database query was conducted for ICD-10 codes entered between November 1, 2019 and March 13, 2020 using the World Health Organization's 2011 revised case definitions for Influenza Like Illness (ILI). During that period, medical students had an approximated mean of 3,000 patient encounters per day from over 1,500 clinical sites. A cumulative sum technique was applied to the data to generate alert thresholds. Breast cancer, a disease with a stable incidence during the specified timeframe, was used as a control. Results Total ILI daily ICD-10 counts that exceeded alert thresholds represented unusual levels of disease occurred 11 times from November 20, 2020 through February 28, 2020. This analysis is consistent with the COVID-19 pandemic timeline. The first statistically significant ILI increase occurred nine days prior to the first laboratory confirmed case in the country. Conclusion Syndromic surveillance can be timelier than traditional surveillance methods, which require laboratory testing to confirm disease. As a result of this study, we are installing a real-time alert for ILI into CREDO, so rates can be monitored continuously as an indicator of possible future new infectious disease outbreaks.","Bruzda, Gabrielle; Rawlins, Fred; Sumpter, Cameron; Garner, Harold R",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567082/,199

151273,The place of cadaveric dissection in post-COVID-19 anatomy education.,2020-12-15,"BACKGROUND Although controversial, failing to consider the gravitational effects of head elevation on cerebral perfusion is speculated to increase susceptibility to rare, but devastating, neurologic complications after shoulder surgery in the beach chair position (BCP). We hypothesized that patients in the BCP have diminished cerebral blood flow autoregulation than those who undergo surgery in the lateral decubitus position (LDP). A secondary aim was to examine whether there is a relationship between patient positioning during surgery and postoperative cognition or serum brain injury biomarker levels. METHODS Patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP (n = 109) or LDP (n = 109) had mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy. A continuous, moving Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between MAP and rScO2, generating the variable cerebral oximetry index (COx). When MAP is in the autoregulated range, COx approaches zero because there is no correlation between cerebral blood flow and arterial blood pressure. In contrast, when MAP is below the limit of autoregulation, COx is higher because there is a direct relationship between lower arterial blood pressure and lower cerebral blood flow. Thus, diminished autoregulation would be manifest as higher COx. Psychometric testing was performed before surgery and then 7 to 10 days and 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. A composite cognitive outcome was determined as the Z-score. Serum S100β, neuron-specific enolase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were measured at baseline, after surgery, and on postoperative day 1. RESULTS After adjusting for age and history of hypertension, COx (P = 0.035) was higher and rScO2 lower (P < 0.0001) in the BCP group than in the LDP group. After adjusting for baseline composite cognitive outcome, there was no difference in Z-score 7 to 10 days (P = 0.530) or 4 to 6 weeks (P = 0.202) after surgery between the BCP and the LDP groups. There was no difference in serum biomarker levels between the 2 position groups CONCLUSIONS : Compared with patients in the LDP, patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP are more likely to have higher COx indicating diminished cerebral autoregulation and lower rScO2. There were no differences in the composite cognitive outcome between the BCP and the LDP groups after surgery after accounting for baseline Z-score.","Laflam, Andrew; Joshi, Brijen; Brady, Kenneth; Yenokyan, Gayane; Brown, Charles; Everett, Allen; Selnes, Ola; McFarland, Edward; Hogue, Charles W",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25268397/,199

It can cause a number of serious problems of the intestine, such as chronic ulcers, bleeding, intestinal stenosis, intestinal fistula, and perforation. At present, there is no standard treatment guideline for the RE. PATIENT CONCERNS A 54-year-old male patient received surgery and chemotherapy for rectal cancer and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for a single metastatic carcinoma of the liver. Three years later, he was diagnosed with recurrent lesion in the rectal anastomotic stoma and was treated with radiotherapy with a total dose of 70 Gy. Following this, he had persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 1 year. DIAGNOSES Colonoscopy confirmed a diagnosis of RE. INTERVENTIONS Since intestinal probiotics, intestinal mucosal protectants, antidiarrheal drugs, and other treatments were not effective; the patient was treated by RFA. OUTCOMES Clinical symptoms of the patient were gradually decreased after the RFA. Colonoscopy examination was performed 3 months later and intestinal mucosa was found to have healed well.

This study was carried out to assess the function of artificial reefs as alternative habitats for two common reef-associated predatory fishes in the north of Yellow Sea, China, Fat Greenling Hexagrammos otakii and Korean rockfish Sebastes schlegelii. According to the catch per unit effort (CPUE), the biomass of predatory fishes at the artificial reef was comparable (H. otakii) to or higher (S. schlegelii) than the natural reef, highlighting the environmental fitness of the artificial reef. Gut content analysis (GCA) showed that H. otakii preyed primarily on Decapod and Amphipoda, while S. schlegelii exhibited higher dependence on fish (Blinniidae and Gobiidae) and Decapod. Collectively, prey richness and diversity were greater at the natural reef relative to the artificial reef, and prey availability may be different between the two reef types. Stable isotopic analysis (SIA) in conjunction with the Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) revealed spatial and interspecific difference on the diet composition of H. otakii and S. schlegelii as well. Based on GCA and MixSIAR result, the habitat-specific effect on the prey availability was confirmed. Additionally, comparisons on trophic niche breadth and niche overlap indicated higher trophic diversity but relatively lower food resources partitioning degree for both species at the natural reef than at the artificial reef. Our results suggest that artificial reefs may harbor a different prey assemblage comparing to natural reef but can support large populations of predatory reef-associated fishes and accommodate their coexistence.","Zhang, Rongliang; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Qianqian; Zhang, Hua; Zhao, Jianmin",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118674/,199

In this contribution, we have studied the growth of PDA using various surface-sensitive techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We supplemented grazing angle attenuated total reflection FTIR spectroscopy with multivariate statistical analysis to further gain analytical power. We have particularly focused on the effects of polymerization time and substrate on the PDA structure.

Increasing numbers are reaching older age. We describe psychological and socioeconomic factors among women with HIV in England aged 45-60 and explore associations with ethnicity. METHODS Analysis of cross-sectional data on 724 women recruited to the PRIME Study. Psychological symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 4 and social isolation with a modified Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Scale. RESULTS Black African (BA) women were more likely than Black Caribbean or White British (WB) women to have a university education (48.3%, 27.0%, 25.7%, respectively, p<0.001), but were not more likely to be employed (68.4%, 61.4%, 65.2%, p=0.56) and were less likely to have enough money to meet their basic needs (56.4%, 63.0%, 82.9%, p<0.001). BA women were less likely to report being diagnosed with depression than WB women (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.40, p<0.001) but more likely to report current psychological distress (aOR 3.34, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS We report high levels of poverty, psychological distress and social isolation in this ethnically diverse group of midlife women with HIV, especially among those who were BA. Despite being more likely to experience psychological distress, BA women were less likely to have been diagnosed with depression suggesting a possible inequity in access to mental health services.

Herein, we review the use of NIV in unusual conditions. Evidence supports the use of NIV during fibreoptic bronchoscopy, especially with high risks of endotracheal intubation (ETI), such as in immunocompromised patients. During transoesophageal echocardiography as well as in interventional cardiology and pulmonology, NIV can reduce the need for deep sedation or general anaesthesia and prevent respiratory depression induced by deep sedation. NIV may be useful after surgery, including cardiac surgery, and, with a lower level of evidence, in patients with pulmonary contusion. NIV should not be considered as an alternative to ETI in severe communicable airborne infections likely to progress to ARDS. NIV is being used increasingly as an alternative to ETI in end-stage symptomatic patients, especially to relieve dyspnoea. The role of assisted ventilation during exercise training in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients is still controversial. NIV should be applied under close monitoring and ETI should be promptly available in the case of failure. A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices, can optimise outcome of NIV.","Ambrosino, N; Guarracino, F",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00192810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21349915/,199

Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.","Faria, N.

162847,Effect of government subsidies on supply chain decision-making and coordination in the context of COVID-19,2021,"Chloroquine (CLQ) is required to manufacture on a larger scale to combat COVID-19. The wastewater containing CLQ will be discharged into the natural water, which was resistant to environmental degradation. Herein, the degradation of CLQ by ferrate (Fe(VI)) was investigated, and the biodegradability of the oxidation products was examined to evaluate the potential application in natural water treatment. The reaction between CLQ and Fe(VI) was pH-dependent and followed second-order kinetics. The species-specific rate constant of protonated Fe(VI) species (HFeO4−) was higher than that of the FeO42− species. Moreover, increasing the reaction temperature could increase the degradation rate of CLQ. Besides, HCO3− had positive effect on CLQ removal, while HA had negative effect on CLQ removal. But the experiments shows Fe(VI) could be used as an efficient technique to degrade co-existing CLQ in natural waters. During the oxidation, Fe(VI) attack could lead to aromatic ring dealkylation and chloride ion substitution to form seven intermediate products by liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) determination. Finally, a pure culture test showed that the oxidation of CLQ by Fe(VI) could slightly increase the antimicrobial effect towards Escherichia coli (E.coli) and reduce the toxicity risk of intermediates. These findings might provide helpful information for the environmental elimination of CLQ.","Dong, Feilong Li Jinzhe Lin Qiufeng Wang Da Li Cong Shen Yi Zeng Tao Song Shuang",Chemical Engineering Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.131408,199

It is a pyrazine carboxamide derivative with activity against RNA viruses which targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes which are necessary for the transcription and replication of viral genomes. The lack of research work and no compendial methods available for the estimation of this drug influenced the current research investigation to give a simple, sensitive, rapid, precise, accurate and robust isocratic high performance liquid chromatographic and UV Spectroscopic method for the determination and quantification of Favipiravir. The elution was done by using SHIMADZU Prominence-i, LC-2030 C system equipped with Shim-Pack GIST C18 (250X 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) column with a mobile phase mixture of 10 mM potassium dihydrogen ortho phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 90:10 v/v at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The ultraviolet detection was done at the wavelength of 315 nm by maintaining column temperature at 30 degrees. The total run time was 8.0 min. Calibration plot showed best regression over the concentration range of 10-60 mu g/ml of Favipiravir standard solutions. The LOD and LOQ was found to be 0.18 mu g/ml and 0.53 mu g/ml, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was determined by performing recovery studies and was found to be between 99.47-100.80%. The repeatability testing for both sample and standard solutions was found as %RSD<2.0% which is within the acceptable limits showing that the method is precise as well. The proposed method was successfully applied for the marketed formulations of Favipiravir tablets.

163262,Effects of COVID-19 on school enrollment,2021,"This essay introduces three works of post-Fukushima Japanese literature, by Hayashi Kyoko (1930–2017), Kimura Yusuke (1970–) and Kobayashi Erika (1978–), to offer an environmental humanities alternative to Giorgio Agamben’s response to COVID-19. Politically, Hayashi is probably closest to Agamben in that her work has been embraced by antinuclear activists in Japan and upheld as evidence of the injustice of the state of exception into which victims of both Fukushima and Hiroshima/Nagasaki were thrust. The author focuses instead on how these three authors acknowledge the cruelties of biopolitics but nevertheless celebrate the fact that “life” is never bare. For them, ionizing radiation acts like the COVID cough did for many of us: not as an invitation to critique the state but as a material intrusion that forces an awareness of what Rocco Ronchi, in his response to Agamben, called “the destiny of the community of man with nature.” What are the material forces immanent to that destiny? What does it do to our mental health to engage them directly? The three works analyzed answer these questions in creative, powerful ways. © 2021 Lingnan University","Long, M.",Prism,https://doi.org/10.1215/25783491-8922281,199

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.","Sun, Kaiyuan; Chen, Jenny; Viboud, Cecile",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935,199

This study discusses the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the Balochistan province. STUDY DESIGN: Situation report Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in Balochistan province of Pakistan. The completion date for the study was April 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY: The data was retrieved from the daily situation report from the Health Department, Government of Balochistan. Descriptive statistics (proportions, mean ± SD) were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1136 patients were confirmed to have COVID-19. The highest rate was found in cases with ages >60 years. About 78% of COVID-19 cases were males and majority of the cases (78.56%)were asymptomatic. Out of these, 183 recovered and 16 died. The case fatality rate was 1.3%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases and case fatality ratio is low in Balochistan. Whether this is due to inability to carry out more tests is still to be ascertained. Males and elderly are more affected and fatalities were higher in cases with co-morbid conditions. Balochistan having a weak healthcare system and with the majority of cases being asymptomatic, needs more stringent actions to practice social distancing to avoid further spread of COVID-19.","Badini, Abida Munir; Badini, Aurangzeb; Mengal, Naeem M; Nanji, Kashmira",J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,https://doi.org/10.29271/jcpsp.2021.supp2.s104,199

Methods: From July to August in 2020, 10 mothers parenting elementary school students under the COVID-19 were interviewed in depth. For data analysis, a phenomenological research methodology suggested by Colaizzi was used. Results: According to the analysis, the experiences of mothers consisted of four categories: the ‘pain from the uncontrollable COVID-19‘, ‘the problem of family relations due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation’, ‘standing firm against the drastic changes', and ‘accepting the world changed by the COVID-19'. Conclusion: The findings in this study vividly represent the parenting experiences of mothers of elementary school students after the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic persists, mothers parenting elementary school students feel complex emotions and experience exhaustion, but in the process, they found family members growing positively and trying to adjust to each other to overcome the crisis. To support positive adaptation to catastrophic situations, an institutional and political foundation is needed to develop a systematic crisis management program customized for mothers and families of elementary school students. The results of this study can be used as basic data when establishing national policies and support systems so that mothers parenting elementary school students can better adapt to and overcome crisis situations. © 2021 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing.

This provides grounds to uncover the degree of integration between cryptocurrencies and African stock markets, which has been completely untouched using wavelet-based methods and frequency domain spillover index. Such knowledge is critical since shocks to the cryptocurrency market may have rippling effects on African stock markets. Findings suggest low degrees of integration between the markets at higher frequencies, which grows stronger at medium frequencies and perfectly integrates at lower frequencies. The implication is that stock markets in Africa are highly exposed to cryptocurrency market disruptions from the medium-term, and international investors seeking to hedge their price risk in African stock markets using cryptocurrencies may have to look at the short term. We find cryptocurrencies as significant spillover transmitters across frequencies. The lead (lag) effects are time-varying and heterogeneous, showing no particular market as a leader, suggesting arbitrage opportunities for investors.","Kumah, Seyram Pearl Odei-Mensah Jones",The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.qref.2021.06.022,199

We did this by carrying out sequence alignments and 3D modelling of related bacteriocins which have been studied in greater detail: Microcin E492, Eneterocin AB heterodimer and Divercin V41. Microcin E492 interacts with Toll-Like Receptor 4 in order to activate an apoptosis reaction, sequence alignment showed a high homology between Pediocin PA-1 and Microcin E492 and 3D modelling showed Pediocin PA-1 interacting with TLR-4 in a way reminiscent of Microcin E492. Furthermore, Pediocin PA-1 had the highest homology with the Enterocin heterodimer, particularly chain A; Enterocin has also shown to cause an apoptotic response in cancer cells. Based on this we are led to strongly believe Pediocin PA-1 interacts with TLRs in order to cause cell death. If this is the case it would explain the difference in cytotoxicity towards HeLa over HT29 cells, due to difference in expression of particular TLRs. Overall, we believe Pediocin PA-1 exhibits a dual effect which is dose dependant, like that of Microcin. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that we were unable to carry out experiments in the lab, and the unavailability of important data meant we were unable to make solid conclusions but rather suggestions. However despite this we have still been able to highlight interesting findings and how these could be translated into future research and therapeutics in order to improve the quality of treatment and life of cancer patients.","Buss, George P.; Wilson, Cornelia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443071,199

The factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in the human respiratory tract remain poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored the evolution of two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines and in parallel, in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures. We identify a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near-fixation with 2 passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with Vero-derived cells facilitating more profound genetic changes. However, most mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike while the strain with mutations in NSP12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of ORF7a remained viable in WD-PNECs.

Transnational private regulatory programs, such as sustainability certification and eco-labeling schemes that set standards for responsible production practices in global markets, have had to react. Private regulation's market credibility is partially built on audits, which include field visits used to assess whether participating operators conform with a program's standard. But COVID-19-related health and business restrictions have forced adjustments to field-audit policies. Literature on private governance has identified several barriers to participation of Global South operators, including the costs of certification, the availability of qualified auditors, and uncertain socio-economic benefits. Are audit policy changes made because of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these barriers? We examine this question through a dataset constructed between April and November 2020 that contains information on COVID-19-related audit policy responses of 98 transnational private sustainability regulators. We describe the mixed transparency of these adjustments to date and five ways in which the adjustments create explicit and implicit barriers to operators from Global South countries. The changes create barriers through (1) the conditions set on when and how adjustments to audits are permitted, (2) the limited flexibility of substantive standards, (3) the potential costs of shifting to remote audits, (4) the focus on accommodating existing participants over new applicants, and (5) the potential challenges of accessing auditors to conduct assessments.

In preclinical studies, combination of radiation and dual checkpoint blockade appears to activate non-redundant immune mechanisms, potentiating antitumor activity. The purpose of the present study is to explore feasibility, toxicity and activity of this approach in MIBC. Methods: Pts with localized MIBC in clinical stages T2-4a N0 M0, ECOG 0-1, without contraindications to immunotherapy, who either wished for bladder preservation or were ineligible for cystectomy, were included in this phase II study. Treatment consisted of initial transurethral resection (TUR) of the tumor, followed by durvalumab 1,500 mg i.v. plus tremelimumab 75 mg i.v., every 4 weeks for 3 doses. Normofractionated external-beam RT was started 2 weeks later, at doses of 46 Gy to minor pelvis and 64-66 Gy to bladder. Pts with either residual or relapsed MIBC were offered salvage cystectomy. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) defined as absence of MIBC at post-treatment tumor site biopsy. A 2- stage sequential design was used (CR rate P0=5, P1=0.7, α=0.10, β=0.20) requiring at least 6 CR in the first 12 pts to expand to a second cohort of 20 pts. Results: From 1/2019 to 8/2020, 32 pts were enrolled at 6 centers. Median age was 71 years (49-91). PS was 0 in 24 pts,1 in 8. 25 were males. Clinical stage was T2 in 28 pts, T3 in 3 and T4a in 1. All pts received at least two immunotherapy cycles. The median dose of RT administered was 64 Gy (60-65). CR at posttreatment biopsy was documented in 26 (81%) pts, 2 pts had residual MIBC and 4 pts were not evaluated due to rejection (1), clinical impairment (1), death from COVID 19 (1) and a suspected treatment-related death from peritonitis (1). After a median follow up of 6.1 months (2.5 - 20.1), 2 pts underwent salvage cystectomy because of MIBC and T1 relapses, respectively. The estimated 6-months rates for disease-free survival (DFS) with bladder intact, DFS and overall survival were 76% (95%CI, 61%-95%), 80% (95%CI, 66%-98%) and 93% (95%CI, 85%-100%), respectively. A total of 31 (97%) pts experienced adverse events related to RT and/or immunotherapy, with diarrhea (41%) and urinary disorders (37.5%) as the most frequent. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy were reported in 31% pts, being the most frequent gastrointestinal toxicity (12.5%), acute kidney failure (6%) and hepatitis (6%). Conclusions: A combined-modality approach including durvalumab + tremelimumab with concurrent RT is feasible and safe, showing high efficacy in terms of response and eliciting bladder preservation in a large number of pts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been completely novel in its unprecedented impact on the modern globalized economy. This in-depth analysis of this coffeehouse provides recommendations that were carefully considered within the context of the current public health crisis. The objective of this study was to systematically analyze the strategic marketing approach of Starbucks Coffee to generate recommendations that can not only be applied to Starbucks but marketing endeavors more broadly. A comprehensive review approach was adopted beginning with a thorough situational analysis. Problems and opportunities related to the marketing of Starbucks Coffee were investigated and recommendations were generated. All stages of the study were robustly supported with relevant citations. Starbucks has matrixed a complex corporate structure that supports not only its survival but its continued development even in an increasingly dense and competitive marketplace. While Starbucks must continue to intermittently reevaluate its key problems and key opportunities, especially in the approaching few financial years, the company is operating with impressive effectiveness through the adversities of 2020 thus far. After a careful analysis, Starbucks Coffee should increase the distribution of products that are more likely to succeed during the COVID-19 pandemic, expand pick-up and delivery services, implement additional store locations in underdeveloped geographic market segments, and utilize its vast array of promotional mediums to optimize brand positioning as they approach a reopening world. © Conner V.

166333,Zakat administration in times of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: a knowledge discovery via text mining,2021,"Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) cell culture devices are often fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) because it is biocompatible, transparent, elastomeric, and oxygen permeable; however, hydrophobic small molecules can absorb to PDMS, which makes it challenging to predict drug responses. Here, we describe a combined simulation and experimental approach to predict the spatial and temporal concentration profile of a drug under continuous dosing in a PDMS Organ Chip containing two parallel channels separated by a porous membrane that is lined with cultured cells, without prior knowledge of its log P value. First, a three-dimensional finite element simulation of drug loss into the chip was developed that incorporates absorption, adsorption, convection, and diffusion, which predicts changes in drug levels over time and space as a function of potential PDMS diffusion coefficients and log P values. By then experimentally measuring the diffusivity of the compound in PDMS and determining its partition coefficient through mass spectrometric analysis of the drug concentration in the channel outflow, it is possible to estimate the effective log P range of the compound. The diffusion and partition coefficients were experimentally derived for the antimalarial drug and potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, amodiaquine, and incorporated into the model to quantitatively predict the drug-specific concentration profile over time measured in human Lung Airway Chips lined with bronchial epithelium interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium. The same strategy can be applied to any device geometry, surface treatment, or in vitro microfluidic model to predict the spatial and temporal gradient of a drug in 3D without prior knowledge of the partition coefficient or the rate of diffusion in PDMS. Thus, this approach may expand the use of PDMS Organ Chip devices for various forms of drug testing.","Grant, Jennifer; Özkan, Alican; Oh, Crystal; Mahajan, Gautam; Prantil-Baun, Rachelle; Ingber, Donald E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442248,199

Una ricerca in Lombardia,2021,"Objective: To identify the key individual-level (demographics, attitudes, mobility) and contextual (Covid-19 case numbers, tiers of mobility restrictions, urban districts) determinants of adopting the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app and continued use over-time. Design and setting: A three-wave panel survey conducted in England in July 2020 (background survey), November 2020 (first measure of mobile app adoption), and March 2021 (continued use of app and new adopters) linked with official data. Primary outcome: Repeated measures of self-reported app usage. Participants: N = 2,500 adults living in England, representative of England's population in terms of regional distribution, age, and gender (2011 census). Results: We observe initial app uptake at 41%, 95% CI [0.39,0.43], in November 2020 with a 12% dropout rate by March 2021, 95% CI [0.10,0.14]. We also found that 7% of nonusers as of wave 2 became new adopters by wave 3, 95% CI [0.05,0.08]. Initial uptake (or failure to use) of the app associated with social norms, privacy concerns, and misinformation about third-party data access, with those living in postal districts with restrictions on mobility less likely to use the app. Perceived lack of transparent evidence of effectiveness was associated with drop out of use. In addition, those who trusted the government were more likely to adopt in wave 3 as new adopters. Conclusions: Successful uptake of the contact tracing app should be evaluated within the wider context of the UK Government's response to the crisis. Trust in government is key to adoption of the app in wave 3 while continued use is linked to perceptions of transparent evidence. Providing clear information to address privacy concerns could increase uptake, however, the disparities in continued use among ethnic minority participants needs further investigation as differences are not fully explained via attitudinal measures.","Horvath, L.; Banducci, S.; Blamire, J.; Degnen, C.; James, O.; Jones, A.; Stevens, D.; Tyler, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.13.21260444v1?rss=1,199
166610,Visualising the Pandemic Pivot: Using Evidence-based Practice to Capture and Communicate an Academic Library’s COVID-19 Response,2021,"The introduction of an unfamiliar disease has added uncertainty to many aspects of the practice of medicine. Evidence-based-guidelines on the recognition, investigation, and treatment of COVID-19 and its sequelae are in early stages. Clinicians are often left making critical diagnostic and treatment decisions in the absence of clear evidence. Operating in the face of uncertainty has brought to light fallibilities in clinical decision-making processes in healthcare systems around the world. A growing body of literature on COVID-19 and its associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome has revealed self-perpetuating cycles of cognitive biases with far-reaching implications on patients, populations, and healthcare systems. We describe the implications of cognitive biases on decision making processes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an era when even the most experienced of clinicians find themselves navigating unchartered territory, we must rely on tried-and-true diagnostic decision-making processes to mitigate cognitive biases. To address a challenge of such complexity, we incorporate a problem spaces perspective to clinical decision making, encompasses the broader context in which decisions are made, including workplace environment, team dynamics, patient wishes, practitioner perspectives, framing of the problem, and sociocultural factors. By applying evidence from relevant disciplines, we highlight strategies to mitigate cognitive biases during emerging infectious disease pandemics, including optimizing multidisciplinary decision-making, building redundancies, and strengthening decision making processes. Continuous feedback, recalibration, and reflection will provide a better understanding of the art of diagnostic decision making and improve healthcare quality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Seitzinger, P.; Rafid-Hamed, Z.; Kalra, J.

As previously reported, in June 2020, after the first peak of infections, we determined that 8.5% and 9.0% of the participants in Weissenkirchen and surrounding communities in the Wachau region were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, respectively. Here, we present novel data obtained eight months later (February 2021) from Weissenkirchen, after the second peak of infection, with 25.0% (138/552) and 23.6% (130/552) of participants that are positive for IgG and IgA, respectively. In participants with previous IgG/IgA positivity (June 2020), we observed a 24% reduction in IgG levels, whereas the IgA levels remained stable in February 2021. This subgroup was further analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-induced T cell activities. Although 76% (34/45) and 76% (34/45) of IgG positive and IgA positive participants, respectively, showed specific T cell activities, those were not significantly correlated with the levels of IgG or IgA. Thus, the analyses of antibodies cannot surrogate the measurement of T cell activities. For a comprehensive view on SARS-CoV-2-triggered immune responses, the measurement of different classes of antibodies should be complemented with the determination of T cell activities.","Rebholz, H.; Braun, R.

In 2018 Kettering General Hospital (KGH) was awarded £60,800 of government funds to create high-quality rest facilities and improve junior doctor wellbeing.MethodsThrough auditing doctors working at KGH, alongside consulting senior management, a project initiation document was constructed to spend this money. From November 2019 to June 2020 £46,275 was spent on creating new rest facilities, including separate sleeping and working areas. Furthermore, the purchase of modern furniture and equipment met the functional needs of busy junior doctors. One month after the completion of the project, the team conducted a post-action review by re-auditing how the changes impacted morale, wellbeing and quality of patient care.ResultsNow, the majority of doctors are happy with the current rest areas on offer at KGH (60%), and a majority feel that they will use the on-call room area (63%). Overall, the feedback from both interviews and the JDF was positive and, the renovation improved morale and wellbeing. There was an increased ability to take breaks. However, the majority of doctors are still not exception-reporting missing breaks: 79% (2019), 74% (2020).Lessons LearntWhilst improved rest facilities were welcomed, this report recommends the maintenance of increased staffing levels and fatigue facilities during the recovery phase of COVID-19. The remaining £14,524.38 should be directed at creating shower facilities, upgrading computer hardware and sustaining the quality of KGH fatigue facilities. Lastly, the rate of exception-reporting must be increased through improving awareness, exploring alternative methods and supporting the action when necessary. The continual investment into rest facilities not only ensure workforce wellbeing but undoubtedly translates into the safety of our patients.","Silva, Geeth Aiken Yam Court Jessica Imtiaz Rabia",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.57,199

Several lines of evidence suggest that glioblastoma multiforme has a genetic basis. A genetic test that could identify people who are at high risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme could improve our understanding of this form of brain cancer. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found common germ line DNA copy number variations in the TCGA population. We tested whether different sets of these germ line DNA copy number variations could effectively distinguish patients with glioblastoma multiforme from others in the TCGA dataset. We used a gradient boosting machine, a machine learning classification algorithm, to classify TCGA patients solely based on a set of germline DNA copy number variations. We found that this machine learning algorithm could classify TCGA glioblastoma multiforme patients from the other TCGA patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC=0.875). Grouped into quintiles, the highest ranked quintile by the machine learning algorithm had an odds ratio of 3.78 (95% CI 3.25-4.40) higher than the average odds ratio and about 40 (95% CI 20-70) times higher than the lowest quintile. The identification of an effective germ line genetic test to stratify risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme should lead to a better understanding of how this cancer forms. This result might ultimately lead to better treatments of glioblastoma multiforme.","Ko, C. S.; Brody, J. P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250319v1?rss=1,199

Although of potential benefit, such emerging markers, which are often costly or not yet commercially available, are unlikely to enable the scalable risk assessment needed for population health strategies. In contrast, the ideal inputs for population approaches would be those already widely available for most patients. We hypothesized that simple hematologic markers, available in an outpatient complete blood count without differential, would be useful to develop risk models for cardiovascular events. Methods: Using routine laboratory measurements as predictors and neural network-based automated event adjudication of 1,072,348 discharge summaries, we developed and validated models for prediction of heart attack, ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, revascularization, and all-cause mortality. Results: Models with hematology indices alone showed Harrell's concordance index ranging from 0.60-0.80 on an external validation set. Hematology indices added significantly in terms of discrimination and calibration performance compared to models using only demographic data and diagnostic codes for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and ischemic stroke, with the concordance index of resulting models in the range 0.75-0.85 on an external validation set. Predictive features varied by outcome, and included red blood cell, leukocyte, and platelet indices. Conclusion: We conclude that low-cost ubiquitous inputs, if biologically informative, can provide population-level readouts of risk.","Truslow, J.

Here, we thus studied the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D)-exchange behavior of unfolded ubiquitin in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride at pH 2.6 and 20°C. We employed a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-quenched H/D-exchange NMR technique with the use of spin desalting columns, which allowed us to make a quick medium exchange from 6.0 M guanidinium chloride to a quenching DMSO solution. The technique is particularly effective for studies of the H/D-exchange kinetics of unfolded proteins in concentrated denaturant. By the backbone resonance assignment of the hetero-nuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of 15N-labeled ubiquitin in the DMSO solution, we successfully investigated the H/D-exchange kinetics of 27 identified peptide amide groups in the ubiquitin sequence. Although most of these amide groups were not protected, the four amide groups of Ile3, Val5, Ile13 and Leu73 were weakly but significantly protected with a protection factor of 2.5–3.0, indicating that there were residual structures in unfolded ubiquitin and that these amide groups were 60–67% hydrogen-bonded by the residual structures. We show that the first native β-hairpin, composed of residues 2–16 in the native ubiquitin structure, is partially structured even in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride and that the amide group of Leu73 is protected by a nonnative hydrogen-bonding interaction. From comparison with the previous folding studies of ubiquitin, it is concluded that the residual native β-hairpin in unfolded ubiquitin forms a folding initiation site and guides the subsequent folding reactions of the protein.","Chandak, M.

However, most of the research on the use of Ecofonts focuses on Latin alphabets. Moreover, texts printed with Ecofonts can be perceived as being less legible than those printed with the original typefaces. This study (a) assesses toner use reductions in documents printed with English and Thai Ecofonts, and (b) studies the observers’ perception of texts printed either with Ecofonts or with original typefaces. To achieve this, black pixels were removed from 10 English and 13 Thai typefaces widely used in academia and other media. Visibility and legibility tests, as well as mass analyses tests, were then performed on texts printed with some such typefaces. Results from instrumental measurements and digital image analyses show that the use of Ecofonts reduces toner use of an inkjet printer by up to 28%. The study also proposes a new Ecofont typeface for the Thai language. Visual tests showed that the visual experience of text printed using this Thai Ecofont is satisfactory. Awareness of the benefits of using Ecofonts changes the users’ attitudes towards the printing quality of Ecofont. The removal of black pixels can lead to more sustainable printing, and this simple solution can be extended to other non-Latin languages as part of the global Green Information Technology efforts in South-East Asia.","Imjai, Thanongsak Wattanapanich Chirawat Madardam Uhamard Garcia Reyes",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13074070,199

It is well acknowledged that the first diseased individuals appeared in China as early as in December 2019, and possibly even earlier in November. It has also been well established that the virus stroke Italy later in January or in February 2020, distinctly after the outbreak in China. Paper by Apolone et al. published in a local Italian medical journal in November 2020 however exposed this chronology to doubt. By fitting early part of the epidemic curve with the exponential model and extrapolating it backwards in time, we could estimate the day-zero of the epidemic and calculated its confidence intervals in Italy and China. We also calculated how probable it is that Italy encountered the virus prior 1 January 2020. We determined an early portion of the epidemic curve representing unhindered exponential growth which fit the exponential model with high determination >0.97 in both countries. We suggest that the day-zero in China and Italy was 8 December (95% CI: 3 Dec., 20 Dec.) and 22 January (95% CI: 16 Jan., 29 Jan.), respectively. We could with high confidence reject that Italy encountered the virus earlier than China (p <0.01).

168234,Positive and negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine in Portugal,2021,"Over half of the world’s population lives in urban areas with, according to the United Nations (UN), nearly 70% expected to live in cities by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of other living species. The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the city’s microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that our health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms—bacteria or fungi—with which they live in continual exchange and symbiosis. While the processing and sequencing of samples can be high-throughput, gathering samples is still very expensive, labor intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city, such as City Sampling Day (metasub.org). Here we postulate that honeybees may be effective collaborators in the sampling process, as they daily forage within a 2-mile radius of their hive. We describe the results of a pilot study conducted with 3 rooftop beehives in Brooklyn, NY, where we evaluated the potential of various hive materials (beeswax, honey, debris, pollen, propolis) to reveal information as to the surrounding metagenomic landscape, and where we conclude that the bee debris are the richest substrate. Based on these results, we profiled 4 additional cities in this manner: Sydney, Melbourne, Venice and Tokyo. While the molecular and computational methods used here were based on DNA analysis, it is possible they could be used to monitor RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2.

Evolving case reports are correlating CRAO with COVID-19 patients. Our case series aims to reveal the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among CRAO patients under the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Medical records of all CRAO patients who attended our tertiary referral hospital, during COVID-19 local outbreak (March to November 2020), were reviewed. Respiratory tract samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the validated Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. If patients were able to cooperate, oropharyngeal saliva samples were obtained. Otherwise, nasopharyngeal and deep throat swabs were taken by registered nurses. Results: A total of 15 CRAO patients (7 males, 8 females) were identified during the 9-month study period. The mean age was 72.1-years (range 45-88 year). None of the patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2 before their CRAO disease episodes. Three patients had a history of CRAO over the contralateral eye. No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 up to their last follow-up (mean 255.4 days, range 152-341 days). Without any COVID-19 positive case, correlation statistical tests on SARS-CoV-2 infection and CRAO were not established. Conclusions: Some of the presumed COVID-19 related CRAO cases may be just coincident with at-risk patients, as COVID-19 is prevalent across the world. More in-depth research, with adjustment to known confounding risk factors, is needed to establish a genuine correlation.","Sunny, C. L. A.; Callie, K. L.

While the prevalence and predictors of burnout in the oncology workforce have been studied in detail previously, less is known about factors associated with burnout in the hematology or combined hematology/oncology workforce–or whether these differ across academic and community practice settings. This study seeks to examine factors associated with severe burnout for hematology/oncology physicians in academic and community practice settings using data from a large-scale, comprehensive survey of hematology/oncology physicians. Methods We collected survey data via mail and online survey (using Qualtrics, an online survey tool) in April through June 2019. The survey included questions about hematology/oncology physicians' work hours, practice activities, compensation, job satisfaction and burnout. This analysis uses data from a single validated question examining respondents’ level of burnout: “Overall, based on your definition of burnout, how would you rate your level of burnout?” The question asks respondents to rank their burnout on a 5-point Likert scale. We collapsed responses into a dichotomous variable indicating severe burnout (=4 or 5 on the Likert scale). We used two weighted multiple logistic regression models to examine associations between severe burnout and work hours, practice characteristics and activities, and type of compensation for respondents in academic and community practice in Stata 15, controlling for demographics and type of practice (p<0.05=statistically significant). Results A total of 675 hematologists/oncologists completed the survey (27% response rate). Of these, 427 respondents reported working in academic or community practice and had complete data to be included in the analysis: 162 (38%) in academic practice settings and 265 (62%) in community practice settings. Respondents in academic practice settings were slightly less likely to report experiencing severe burnout than those in community practice settings (9% [15/162] vs. 12% [34/265], p=0.26). In the logistic regression models, we found statistically significant and positive association between severe burnout and Relative Value Unit or RVU-based compensation (vs. salaried or other compensation models) for both academic (OR=18.42, p<0.01) and community practice respondents (OR=3.05, p<0.01). We also found a significant and positive association between severe burnout and being female for respondents in academic practice only (OR=6.07, p<0.01). We found a significant and negative association between severe burnout and often working with advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and/or physician assistants) for respondents in community practice only (OR=0.32, p<0.01). Conclusions Study findings suggest that severe burnout rates are similar for hematology/oncology physicians in academic and community practice settings. Severe burnout appears to be related to use of RVU-based compensation systems in both academic and community practices, suggesting that these models may require major revision to reduce burnout and support the health and longevity in practice of hematology/oncology physicians. Improving access to advanced practice providers may mitigate severe burnout, especially in community practice settings. Higher levels of burnout among women in academic hematology/oncology practices suggest an area for further research into possible explanations and solutions.

168851,The impact of COVID-19 on economic growth: evidence from a Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressive (BPVAR) model,2021,"Serology is a core component of the surveillance and management of viral zoonoses. Virus neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic, but requirements for large volumes of serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use. Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein–tagged murine leukemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical analysis to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93), and for a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 μL of serum, estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","Meza, Diana K.; Broos, Alice; Becker, Daniel J.; Behdenna, Abdelkader; Willett, Brian J.; Viana, Mafalda; Streicker, Daniel G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.060095,199

This study used a national online survey to understand how SSWs (N = 1,275) adapted their school practice during the initial 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Findings from this study indicate that SSWs made swift and (relatively) smooth adaptations of their traditional practice role to the new context, though not without reporting considerable professional stress and personal challenges doing so. SSWs reported significant concerns about their ability to deliver effective virtual school social work services given their students? low motivation and lack of engagement with online learning, as well as significant worries about how their students were faring during the first months of the pandemic. Implications for school social work practice, policy, and research are discussed.","Kelly, Michael S.; Benbenishty, Rami Capp Gordon Watson Kate Astor Ron",Families in Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/10443894211009863,199

A Survey with Parents on Early Childhood Education Services and Families, in Covid-19",2021,"Objectives: Estimates of influenza vaccine use are not available at the county level for U.S. nursing home (NH) residents but are critically necessary to guide implementation of quality improvement programs aimed at increasing vaccination rates. Furthermore, estimates that account for differences in resident characteristics between counties are unavailable. We estimated risk-standardized vaccination rates among short- and long-stay NH residents by U.S. county and identified drivers of geographic variation. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing 100% of 2013-2015 fee-for-service Medicare claims, Minimum Data Set assessments, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports, and LTCFocUS. We separately evaluated short-stay (<100 days) and long-stay ([≥]100 days) residents aged [≥]65 years old across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. We estimated county-level risk-standardized vaccination rates (RSVRs) via hierarchical logistic regression adjusting for 32 resident-level covariates. We then used multivariable linear regression models to assess associations between county-level NHs predictors and RSVRs. Results: The overall study cohort consisted of 2,817,217 residents in 14,658 NHs across 2,798 counties. Short-stay residents had lower RSVRs than long-stay residents (2013-2014: median [IQR], 69.6% [62.8-74.5] vs 84.0% [80.8-86.4]). Counties with the highest vaccination rates were concentrated in the Midwestern, Southern, and Northeast US. Several modifiable facility-level characteristics were associated with increased RSVRs, including higher registered nurse to total nurse ratio and higher total staffing for licensed practical nurses, speech language pathologists, and social workers. Characteristics associated with lower RSVRs included higher percentage of residents restrained, with a pressure ulcer, and NH-level hospitalizations per resident-year. Conclusions: Substantial county-level variation in influenza vaccine use exists among short- and long-stay NH residents. Quality improvement interventions to improve vaccination rates can leverage these results to target NHs located in counties with lower risk-standardized vaccine use.","Silva, J. B.

(Special Issue: Covid-19 and climate change.),2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has had drastic impacts on urban economies and activities, with transit systems around the world witnessing an unprecedented decline in ridership. This paper attempts to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on the daily ridership of urban rail transit (URT) using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM). Six variables are selected as the predictors, among which four variables unaffected by the pandemic are employed. A total of 22 cities from Asia, Europe, and the US with varying timelines of the pandemic outbreak are selected in this study. The effect of COVID-19 on the URT ridership in 11 cities in Asia is investigated using the difference between their observed ridership reduction and the potential ridership generated by the other 11 cities. Additionally, the effect of the system closure in Wuhan on ridership recovery is analyzed. A series of placebo tests are rolled out to confirm the significance of these analyses. Two traditional methods (causal impact analysis and straightforward analysis) are employed to illustrate the usefulness of the SCM. Most Chinese cities experienced about a 90% reduction in ridership with some variation among different cities. Seoul and Singapore experienced a minor decrease compared to Chinese cities. The results suggest that URT ridership reductions are associated with the severity and duration of restrictions and lockdowns. Full system closure can have severe impacts on the speed of ridership recovery following resumption of service, as demonstrated in the case of Wuhan with about 22% slower recovery. The results of this study can provide support for policymakers to monitor the URT ridership during the recovery period and understand the likely effects of system closure if considered in future emergency events.","Xin, Mengwei Shalaby Amer Feng Shumin Zhao Hu",Transport Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.07.006,199

We find exposure to high-fat diets confers a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic LPS and enhanced mortality, independent of microbiome. Ketogenic diet (KD) does not alter homeostatic inflammation, but enhances the response of immune cells to LPS challenge ex vivo. Lipidomics identified dietary palmitic acid (C16:0; PA) may be acting as a primary inflammatory stimulus in our model. Here we show PA induces a hyper-inflammatory response to LPS challenge in cultured macrophages and in vivo, correlating with increased endotoxemia mortality and enhanced resistance to C. albicans infection in RAG-/- mice. Our study identifies PA is an inducer of trained immunity that leads to a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary heterologous stimuli, and is deleterious during systemic inflammation, but enhances resistance to infection.","Seufert, AL; Traxler, SK; Hickman, JW; Peterson, RM; Lashley, SJ; Shulzhenko, N; Napier, RJ; Napier, BA",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.448579,199

Reflections over the need for global congruence,2021,"IntroductionMore than in other conditions, fear is associated with infectious diseases, and is directly associated with its transmission rate, morbidity and mortality. High levels of fear can affect the individual’s ability to think clearly, react proportionately and make rational decisions in the context of COVID-19. Recently, Mertens et al. (2020) developed the Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to measure this construct.ObjectivesTo analyse the psychometric properties of the FCV-19S Portuguese version, namely construct validity, internal consistency and convergent validity.MethodsA community sample of 234 adults (75.6% women;mean age= 29.53±12.51;range:16-71) completed an on-line survey with the Portuguese versions of the FCV-19S, the Covid-19 Perceived Risk Scale (CPRS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21).The total sample was randomly divided in two sub-samples: sample A (n=117) was used to perform an exploratory factor analysis/EFA;sample B (n=117) to make a confirmatory factor analysis/CFA.ResultsEFA resulted in one component. CFA revealed that the unifactorial model presented acceptable fit indexes (X2/df=3.291;CFI=.977;GFI=.932;TLI=.919;p[RMSEA≤.01]=.091). Cronbach alpha was α=.855.

170126,Forum: A first look at the economic impacts of the covid-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma (MM) face sudden exacerbations of anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms within the initial weeks following ASCT. Even as these symptoms abate in subsequent months, long-term consequences include post-traumatic stress disorder (Griffith 2020), quality of life (QOL) impairments (El-Jawahri 2016), and chronic reliance on higher-risk medications such as benzodiazepines (Banerjee 2020). These findings are particularly relevant to MM patients given their older age at diagnosis, longer expected post-ASCT survival, and poorer QOL at baseline compared with other cancer patients (Kent 2015). Compared to other integrative interventions in the peri-ASCT setting, life coaching transcends a symptomatic focus while directly addressing the root determinants of impaired QOL. Life coaches work with patients using structured frameworks (Figure 1A) to provide longitudinal support, education, and accountability to meet patient-identified wellness goals. Digital life coaching (DLC) combines the strengths of life coaching with the capabilities of digital health by channeling patient-coach communication through patients' personal phones. Compared to in-person coaching, DLC is location-agnostic and allows patients to work their coaches more conveniently and frequently. DLC is feasible among ASCT survivors (Chen 2016) but has not yet been studied in the active peri-ASCT setting. We are conducting a pilot study of a 16-week DLC subscription to assess its feasibility and effects on QOL during an intensive period spanning from pre-ASCT hospitalization through Day +100 after ASCT. If successful, we plan to then pursue a randomized Phase II study comparing DLC versus usual care in the peri-ASCT setting. METHODS: Our study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04432818. We plan to enroll 27 adult patients with MM undergoing first ASCT at our institution. Inclusion criteria include English language proficiency and ownership of a personal cellphone. Notably, neither ownership of a smartphone nor installation of a specific mobile app is required for patient enrollment. Enrolled patients will receive unlimited access to a certified life coach beginning at Day -5 before ASCT;bidirectional communication is encouraged via phone, text, or email. The life coaches will reach out at least once per week to help patients accomplish self-identified goals such as symptom management, stress reduction, and physical activity. Our study's primary endpoint is ongoing patient engagement, defined as least one patient-initiated outreach to their coach during each of four 4-week study subperiods. Our study's secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments of QOL, distress, and sleep disturbances (to be collected using electronic surveys every 1-2 weeks as shown in Figure 1B). Exploratory endpoints include benzodiazepine usage and rates of electronic/phone communication with patients’ treatment teams. We will analyze endpoints using descriptive methods, including stratification of secondary & exploratory endpoints by DLC usage and specific 4-week study subperiod. PROGRESS TO DATE: Of 18 approached patients as of the data cutoff (8/1/20), 15 (83%) have expressed interest. Reasons for non-enrollment include skepticism about the value of interactions with coaches who do not themselves have MM. Of the 15 patients who have expressed interest in the study, the median age is 65 (range: 50-81) and all but one patient report owning a personal smartphone. All 6 patients with finalized ASCT hospitalization dates have been enrolled and paired with life coaches. Adherence to weekly electronic PRO assessments has been 100% (n = 9 timepoints) to date, consistent with previous studies (Wood 2013). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study is ongoing. Our findings to date suggest that certain MM patients are phone-savvy and would be interested in digital health tools, which will continue to gain prominence in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Strengths of DLC include it scalability across institutional lines and its ability to reach patients at home in an integrative manner. Results of this study will inform innovative approaches to support the wellbeing of patients with hematologic malignancies, both in the peri-transplantation setting and beyond.

170269,Does simulation training in answering a bleep improve confidence and performance in on-call situations for FiY1s during COVID-19 response?,2020,"Surgery, and especially cardiac surgery, is common, costly, and entails considerable risk. Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve quality, promote patient safety, and increase value and cost-effectiveness in surgical care. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) initiatives are increasing in popularity, improving outcomes, and enriching patient satisfaction. First developed for abdominal surgical cases, ERAS has increasingly established itself across all surgical subspecialities, including cardiac surgery. ERAS focuses on evidence-based initiatives in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care to promote patient well-being and efficient care. The deliberate, judicious incorporation of technology into surgery and the periprocedural home has tremendous, revolutionary potential in all phases of care and is consistent with ERAS principles. This technology can be harnessed by physicians and the care provider team, the healthcare system, and perhaps most importantly, by patients themselves to lead to a higher level of engagement. We will explore technology's transformational capability by concentrating on cardiac surgery because of its prevalence, costs, risks, and contribution to the healthcare system's bottom line. In addition, the role that ERAS combined with technology can play in a constructive manner will be important. We discuss the disruptive effect that the COVID-19 pandemic offers to accelerate these developments. While the human cost of the pandemic has been staggering, in the post-COVID world, the lessons learned can be vital. Finally, we seek to show that the opportunities technology provides are closely related to what both patients and the physician and provider teams want. As technology inevitably becomes more integrated into healthcare, the ability to harness technology to maximize patient outcomes and well-being while promoting more efficient healthcare delivery will be critical. © Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

170322,COVID-19 in International Media: Global Pandemic Perspectives,2021,"In light of COVID-19 infection control measures, which establish a minimum distance of 6 feet between bodies, many have emphasised the need to maintain social closeness despite physical distance. This Position Piece considers the flip side of this concern: in key spaces that structure social interactions in the US today, physical closeness does not equal social closeness. 'This country is like a prison,' one of my interlocutors told me, pointing to carceral histories of social distancing that predate COVID-19. Moreover, in the co-constituted spaces of criminalisation and justice, punishment and care, distance and proximity, and carceral freedom, the physical closeness of people that could have registered as social closeness is precluded, culminating in deadly disregard. Drawing on my medical training and on fieldwork documentation of medical harms in the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention apparatus, I consider how non-responsiveness spreads within and beyond institutions of immigration enforcement. I suggest that medical providers are implicated in what I call 'contagious containment' -that is, the impulse to distance oneself from harmful realities in which one's clinical practice is complicit. This distancing reinforces the idea of humanity being a scarce resource, especially when the racialised stratification of economic and political resources is preserved in and through institutions like ICE detention. Contagious containment offers the fantasy of separating one's clinical work from the apparatus of harming and, so long as such reservoirs of life-threatening disregard remain, such contagion can (and does) spread.","Rendell, S.",Medicine Anthropology Theory,https://doi.org/10.17157/mat.8.1.5260,199
170609,Exploring Malaysian Academics' Perception on Working from Home (wfh) as a Flexible Working Arrangement during Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a 3.2KB DNA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV infection is a world health problem, with 350 million chronically infected people at increased risk of developing liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methylation of HBV DNA in a CpG context (5mCpG) can alter the expression patterns of viral genes related to infection and cellular transformation. Moreover, it may also provide clues to why certain infections are cleared, or persist with or without progression to cancer. The detection of 5mCpG often requires techniques that damage DNA or introduce bias through a myriad of limitations. Therefore, we developed a method for the detection of 5mCpG on the HBV genome that does not rely on bisulfite conversion or PCR. With cas9 guided RNPs to specifically target the HBV genome, we enriched in HBV DNA from Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHH) infected with different HBV genotypes, as well as enriching in HBV from infected patient liver tissue; followed by sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. Detection of 5mCpG by Nanopore sequencing was benchmarked with Bisulfite-quantitative Methyl Specific PCR (BS-qMSP). 5mCpG levels in HBV determined by BS-qMSP and Nanopore sequencing were highly correlated. Our Nanopore sequencing approach achieved a coverage of ∼2000x of HBV depending on infection efficacy, sufficient coverage to perform a de novo assembly and detect small fluctuations in HBV methylation, providing the first de novo assembly of native HBV DNA, as well as the first landscape of 5mCpG from native HBV sequences. Moreover, by capturing entire HBV genomes, we explored the epigenetic heterogeneity of HBV in infected patients and identified 4 epigenetically distinct clusters based on methylation profiles. This method is a novel approach that enables the enrichment of viral DNA in a mixture of nucleic acid material from different species and will serve as a valuable tool for infectious disease monitoring.","Goldsmith, Chloe; Cohen, Damien; Dubois, Anaëlle; Martinez, Maria-Guadalupe; Petitjean, Kilian; Corlu, Anne; Testoni, Barbara; Hernandez-Vargas, Hector; Chemin, Isabelle",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.122259,199

In a country like India, the railway network is ideal for long-distance travel and movement of bulk commodities, apart from being an energy efficient and economic mode of conveyance and transport. Although beneficial in a multitude of ways, railway fatalities are known to cause tremendous loss, in terms of human lives as well as economic forfeiture. Methods and results: A 7-month prospective and descriptive type of autopsy study was conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital attached to Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore. Out of 98 cases of railway fatalities, maximum number of deaths belonged to 21-30 years age group i.e., 33 cases (33.67%) with male preponderance (88 cases – 89.79%). The Hindu community contributed to 54 cases (55.10%). Maximum cases occurred in the monsoon season (34 cases-34.69%) and majority of victims were found dead at the scene (90 cases-91.83%). The predominant manner of death was suicidal (49 cases-50%) and the most common cause for death was shock and hemorrhage (53 cases-54.08%). Conclusion: Studies such as this, can help in better understanding of railway fatalities which can help policy makers in implementing counteractive measures to prevent accidental deaths, discourage suicidal deaths and to improve railway safety in general.","Vijay, V.; Venkata Raghava, S.",Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.37506/ijfmt.v15i3.15367,199

How Covid-19 Influenced Public Revenues in Poland and Czechia,2021,"Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Near real-time data on the food insecurity situation collected by international organizations such as the World Food Programme can be crucial to monitor and forecast time trends of insufficient food consumption levels in countries at risk. Here, using food consumption observations in combination with secondary data on conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks, we build a forecasting model based on gradient boosted regression trees to create predictions on the evolution of insufficient food consumption trends up to 30 days in to the future in 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen). Results show that the number of available historical observations is a key element for the forecasting model performance. Among the 6 countries studied in this work, for those with the longest food insecurity time series, the proposed forecasting model makes it possible to forecast the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption up to 30 days into the future with higher accuracy than a naive approach based on the last measured prevalence only. The framework developed in this work could provide decision makers with a tool to assess how the food insecurity situation will evolve in the near future in countries at risk.

170764,The Rise of Transparent Manipulators and Countless Trumps in the Age of Deep Manipulation: What Have They Done to Manipulation?,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the extent to which Covid-19 has challenged work habits and outcomes. The authors argue that after the lockdown period workers have been experiencing a new work mode called “Covid-working”. The aim is to provide a first interpretation of this phaenomenon and elaborate on future real estate strategies and workplace policies based on this experience. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data, this research analyses Covid-working in a large-sized company in Italy. The survey was answered by 90 employees and addresses three domains: locations of work;a comparison between work-from-home (WFH) and work from the office;and outcomes of Covid-working vs office-working. Findings: With Covid-working, the workers of the case company drastically changed their traditional work from the office approach to pure WFH. While this abrupt switch might generate difficulties in adaptation, this working practice was generally appreciated by this company’s workers. Positive and negative outcomes of Covid-working confirm previous studies on remote working. Recommendations on multi-location of work, new value for the headquarters and diversity empowerment open up avenues for future real estate strategies. Originality/value: Observations on Covid-working are still limited and mainly appear on grey literature, due to the newness of this phaenomenon. Empirical studies such as the proposed one can increase companies’ awareness of the positive and negative outcomes of this experience and support their future workplace strategies. © 2021, Chiara Tagliaro and Alessandra Migliore.","Tagliaro, C.; Migliore, A.",Journal of Corporate Real Estate,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcre-10-2020-0053,199
170793,Virtual support group for family caregivers of elderly people with dementia in the COVID-19 scenery/ Grupo virtual de apoio aos cuidadores familiares de idosos com demência no contexto da COVID-19,2021,"ABSTRACT Over the last decades, there has been a proliferation of cash transfer programmes across the global South. Digital technologies have given this seeming countermovement a boost by promising to instantaneously transfer cash from the coffers of development agencies and national governments to the pockets of the poor, sidestepping the neo‐patrimonial state. With the COVID‐19 crisis, tech billionaires have teamed up with development institutions to fast‐track ‘digital payment ecosystems’ under the guise of financial inclusion and fiscal savings. Much has been written about how such initiatives accelerate the financialization of social welfare and collateralization of the poor by trapping cash transfer recipients in relations of credit and debt. Less has been written about grassroots strategies to claw back power from digital control. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Mozambique, this article explores three sites of contention at the interface of digital technologies and cash transfer administration: the development of an information management system, the application of a proxy means test and the outsourcing of cash transfer payments to private providers.

171106,Effect of COVID-19 on Education in Saudi Arabia and E-Learning Strategies,2021,"BackgroundNovel approaches to monitoring sexually transmitted infections (STI) may contribute to understanding of STI rates and associated behaviors, especially during the coronavirus (COVID)-19 pandemic, when healthcare and surveillance systems are likely affected. Therefore, we explored public interest in STI-related internet search terms from 2019–2020.MethodsWe downloaded Google Trends data for the United States (US) to capture number of searches including at least one of 64 search terms within four STI-related categories (STIs, symptoms, testing, and treatment) from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. We expressed search interest across weeks as the unit of analysis, with scores normalized from 0–100;100 represents the week with the most search interest for each variable.ResultsFor many STI-related search terms, interest dropped in March 2020 (when most states deployed COVID mitigation measures), increased later in the year, but did not increase to pre-pandemic interest. For example, ‘chlamydia’ ranged from 73–100 from January 2019-February 2020, dropped to a low of 55 in mid-April before increasing to values between 59–79 through December. Only a few search terms did not change during the pandemic. For example, besides one peak week of 100, ‘syphilis’ ranged from 21–35. Although the COVID-19 pandemic shifted interest away from STIs for spring and summer of 2020, most search terms remained used throughout July to December 2020 (ranges for chlamydia: 60–79, gonorrhea: 32–44, herpes: 44–55, HPV: 38–57, STD: 60–92, and STI: 58–80).ConclusionsIn the US, internet searches for STI-related terms prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic dropped from March through fall 2020. Concerns over STI symptoms, testing, and treatment increased by fall and winter 2020, which may indicate a need for access to STI services. Google Trends is a novel way to understand public interest in health topics, especially during a global pandemic.","Haderxhanaj, L.; Renfro, K.; Hogben, M.; Aral, S.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.214,199
171255,The Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Growth-Oriented SMEs: Building Entrepreneurial Resilience,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on healthcare services all over the world. With the rising range of healthcare providers diagnosed with COVID globally and with the second wave in India, the crisis has gained global attention and assistance. The healthcare system in India is under strain, putting frontline healthcare staff on edge. Long and exhausting work hours, quickly depleting supplies of personal protective equipment, day-to-night news reports of COVID-19 statistics, inadequate availability of particular drugs, and insufficient societal assistance may all lead to the additional emotional strain of these HCWs. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress are very prevalent among HCWs. Employed in the high-risk division like infectious disorder and pulmonology, and to see a family member that has been diagnosed, deficient or inadequate hand hygiene before and after interaction with patients, insufficient PPE, direct patient interaction (12 times a day), long daily contact hours (15 hrs), and uncontrolled exposure were all linked to COVID-19 risk among Health Care Workers. Working with COVID-19 has demonstrated the interdependence of various components of the work system, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, monitoring equipment, staffing, work setting, and so on. Healthcare workers should also implement a detailed ‘infectious disease preparedness and recovery strategy' to train and protect staff before and after a pandemic. Workers must be closely watched, supported, and, when possible, supplied with evidence-based practice after the crisis has passed. © 2021 MEDIC SCIENTIFIC.

171395,"Indian Labour Market in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic: Issues, Experience and Policy",2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the wellbeing of patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMDs). Objectives: The aim is to assess emotional well-being and its associated factors in patients with RMDs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 1,800 participants were recruited by patient organisations. Data was collected between April and July 2020. Participants were divided into two groups: 1) Participants with poor wellbeing (World Health Organization-Five Wellbeing Index (WHO-5) ≤ 50), 2) Participants with good wellbeing (WHO-5 ≥50). The Mann-Whitney and χ2 tests were used to analyse possible relations between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and outdoor contact with wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the impact of the independent variables associated with poor wellbeing. Results: 1,777 patients with 15 different RMDs were included. The mean age was 52.7, 80.2% female, 48.7% had a university degree, and 69.7% were married or in a relationship. The most frequent diagnoses were inflammatory arthritis (75.4%). 49.0% reported poor wellbeing. 57.7% of patients who belonged to a patient organisation reported good wellbeing (vs 46.3% who did not, p<0.001). Those who reported poor wellbeing had higher disease activity (51.4% vs 41.3%, p<0.001), a higher risk of anxiety (54.3% vs 41.7%, p<0.001) and depression (57.0% vs 42.1%, p<0.001), and poorer self-perceived health (53.0% vs 41.8%, p<0.001), compared to those who did not. A higher proportion of those who engaged in physical activity presented good wellbeing (54.0% vs 46.5%, p=0.012). 57.4% of the patients who were unable to attend their appointment with their rheumatologist reported poor wellbeing, compared to 48.2% who did attend (p=0.027). Patients who did not walk outside (56.2%) or who lacked elements in their home to facilitate outside contact (63.3%) experienced poor wellbeing (p<0.001). The factors associated with poor wellbeing were lack of elements in the home enabling contact with the outside world (OR=2.10), not belonging to a patient organisation (OR=1.51), risk of depression (OR=1.49), and not walking outside (OR=1.36) during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1). Conclusion: Almost half of the patients with RMDs reported poor emotional wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of elements in the home that facilitate outdoor contact, not belonging to a patient organisation, the presence of anxiety, and not walking outside during the pandemic increase the probability of poor emotional well-being. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and the role of patient organisations in addressing the effects of the pandemic and its containment measures.","Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Marzo-Ortega, H.; Christen, L.; Carmona, L.; Correa-Fernández, J.; Sanz-Gómez, S.; Plazuelo-Ramos, P.; Grange, L.; Webb, D.; Irwin, S.; Jacklin, C.; Makri, S.; Mateus, E.; Mingolla, S.; Antonopoulou, K.; Navarro-Compán, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2396,199

This survey-based study explored the experiences and perceptions of parents of children and adolescents with visual impairment (n = 11) who engaged in online music therapy. Video playlists were accessed regularly and almost all parents reported positive (2/11) or very positive (8/11) responses and perceived them as beneficial in engaging with their child. Ninety-five percent (10/11) of parents perceived the teleheath programme to be a positive experience for their child, 73% (8/11) observed positive behaviours directly after the sessions, and 82% (9/11) indicated that the programme was a valuable family resource that supported bonding and interaction. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis generated four themes from the qualitative data: (a) positive impacts, (b) interactive family resource, (c) connection to school, and (d) challenges.

171918,Government support for SMEs in response to COVID-19: theoretical model using Wang transform,2021,"China and the United States (US) have established respective cultural institutions in each other, namely the Confucius Institute and the American Cultural Centre. While they differ in the establishment background and management model, in their counterpart countries' view, both Confucius Institutes and American Cultural Centres serve the function of public diplomacy as a 'quasi-diplomatic agency', attracting extensive political attention. When comparing the history of their developments in the US and China, a similar trend of 'rise-to-fall' and 'positivity-to-negativity' can be observed. The stagnation of American Cultural Centres in China and the crisis of Confucius Institutes in the US both originate from the same source - political pressure. The development paths of both institutions are closely related to the development and transformation of Sino-US political relations. In this process, China's attitude is relatively moderate in an attempt to maintain the continuous development of a friendly bilateral relation, while the US is anxious about China's rising status as its economic and strategic competitor, thereby adjusting its China policy and imposing rigid political controls over Confucius Institutes. Affected by the Sino-US trade dispute and the COVID-19 pandemic, Sino-US relations deteriorate further;accordingly, the future outlook of Confucius Institutes in the US is worrying. However, with abundant uncertainties, the future of the Confucius Institute remains to be further studied.","Lien, D.; Tang, P.

We show how an ethics of proxemics and its operationalization as distance highlight everyday inequalities and limit the provision of care. Constraints on physical distancing in line with public health measures intended to limit the spread of the coronavirus echo the controls enforced under apartheid, showing how inequality is both embodied and legally entrenched.","Levine, Susan Manderson Lenore",Cultural Anthropology,https://doi.org/10.14506/ca36.3.06,199

As of July 2021, the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the outbreak remain a mystery. This work analyzes the prevalence in news media articles of two popular hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 virus origins: the natural emergence and the lab-leak hypotheses. Our results show that for most of 2020, the natural emergence hypothesis was favored in news media content while the lab-leak hypothesis was largely absent. However, something changed around May 2021 that caused the prevalence of the lab-leak hypothesis to substantially increase in news media discourse. This shift has not been uniformed across media organizations but instead has manifested itself more acutely in some outlets than others. Our structural break analysis of daily news media usage of terms related to the laboratory escape hypothesis provides hints about potential sources for this sudden shift in the prevalence of the lab-leak hypothesis in prestigious news media.","Rozado, David",Social Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10090320,199
172311,Bridging the Gap Between UK Government Strategic Narratives and Public Opinion/Behavior: Lessons From COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 necessitates developing reliable tools to derive safety measures, including safe social distance and minimum exposure time under different circum-stances. Transient Eulerian–Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have emerged as a viably fast and economical option. Nonetheless, these CFD models resolve the instantaneous distribution of droplets inside a computational domain, making them incapable of directly being used to assess the risk of infection as it depends on the total accumulated dosage of infecting viruses received by a new host within an exposure time. This study proposes a novel risk assessment model (RAM) to predict the temporal and spatial accumulative concentration of infectious exhaled droplets based on the bio-source’s exhalation profile and droplet distribution using the CFD results of respiratory events in various environmental conditions. Unlike the traditional approach in the bulk movement assessment of droplets’ outreach in a domain, every single droplet is traced inside the domain at each time step, and the total number of droplets passing through any arbitrary position of the domain is determined using a computational code. The performance of RAM is investigated for a series of case studies against various respiratory events where the horizontal and the lateral spread of risky zones are shown to temporarily vary rather than being fixed in space. The sensitivity of risky zones to ambient temperature and relative humidity was also addressed for sample cough and sneeze cases. This implies that the RAM provides crucial information required for defining safety measures such as safety distances or minimum exposure times in different environments. © 2021 by the authors.

172336,Optimization strategies of human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic: A review,2021,"ABSTRACT This article asks whether personal ventilators should be redistributed to maximize lives saved in emergency condition, like the COVID‐19 pandemic. It begins by examining extant claims that items like ventilators are literally parts of their user's bodies. Arguments in favor of incorporation for ventilators fail to show that they meet valid sufficient conditions to be body parts, but arguments against incorporation also fail to show that they fail to meet clearly valid necessary conditions. Further progress on this issue awaits clarification of difficult normative, conceptual, and metaphysical questions about the possible boundaries of a person's body. Rather than relying solely on incorporation arguments, we propose an argument against reallocation from widely accepted anti‐discrimination principles. Possession of a personal ventilator is an obvious marker of disability identity;thus, reallocating ventilators from those that already possess them discriminates on the basis of a stigmatized trait – a paradigm case of presumptively wrongful discrimination. This discrimination claim, taken together with uncertainty about the bodily status of ventilators, yields a strong presumption against personal ventilator reallocation.

One of the designs explored for OSVs utilizes a bag-valve-mask as a source for mechanical ventilation. Despite its availability for use and being medically accepted, proper calibration must be observed in measuring ventilator scalars such as inspiratory pressure, inspiratory flow, and tidal volume to promote the safe use of the OSV and prevent OSV users to do more harm to the patient. This study discusses different calibration techniques to properly acquire ventilator scalar measurements using an integrated ventilator scalar measurement module. All in all, different calibration setups and bag-valve-mask-based mechanisms were tested and documented to determine an effective means to acquire accurate and precise ventilator scalar measurements.","Espanola, J.; Calilung, E.; Dadios, E.; Culaba, A.; Sybingco, E.; Bandala, A.; Vicerra, R.

172426,Olfactory Dysfunction as a Key Symptom of Covid-19: a Review Based on Current Research,2021,"Although the concept of ‘social capital’ is not a new concept, its rise coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. This concept of sociology, left in a controversial and secondary position, was reborn both in the social, political and economic fields and in the scientific world, with the increase of the COVID-19 outbreak cases. Social capital is a form of socialisation and a way of performing social relationships. The COVID-19 outbreak led to the understanding that physical capital and human capital would not be sufficient to sustain social life, and, therefore, social capital started to rise. The expected private earning from social capital is not individual profit, but collective welfare and mutual benefit. In short, social capital is the capital spent on society and is for common good. On the other hand, social capital has a volume in proportion to the density of the capitals in the society. Social capital, with its intensity, has attracted the attention of different disciplines on Corona days and has exceeded the limits of sociology. Another issue to be emphasised in this study is the relationship between social capital and democracy. In societies where tutelary democracy is dominant, civil society cannot become functional enough. In this difficult environment, social capital is shaped as paternal (tutelary) and a healthy social network cannot be functionalised in society. On the one hand, the horrors of the pandemic are experienced, and, on the other hand, a social capital model that is ineffective in healing social wounds emerges. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Yerdelen, B.

The fear of catching a new coronavirus infection has led to a number of restrictions that negatively affect the practice of providing medical care to underage patients. For this reason, it is important to provide dental care to young patients, since the loss of teeth at an early age causes significant problems at an older age. The purpose of the work is to consider the features of the organization of dental care for underage patients in the tense epidemiological conditions associated with the spread of coronavirus infection on a global scale. In the conclusions of the study, it was noted that taking into account the complex epidemiological conditions, approaches to providing dental care will change. Traditional approaches used to address oral health problems in children before the COVID-19 pandemic will need to be adapted to the new era. Minimal intervention methods that minimize or eliminate aerosol formation should be practiced, as well as comprehensive oral health prevention measures to ensure the safety of dental offices at this unprecedented time, to control disease and maintain oral health in the population.","Komildzhonovich, S.

In this paper, a new fractional-order Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Hospitalized–Recovered (SEIHR) model is formulated for COVID-19, where the population is infected due to human transmission. The fractional-order discrete version of the model is obtained by the process of discretization and the basic reproductive number is calculated with the next-generation matrix approach. All equilibrium points related to the disease transmission model are then computed. Further, sufficient conditions to investigate all possible equilibria of the model are established in terms of the basic reproduction number (local stability) and are supported with time series, phase portraits and bifurcation diagrams.

The school climate activist movement was initiated in 2018 in Sweden by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg. It has actively been gaining momentum during the two years of its existence. Thanks to the attention of the media and leading international organizations, it has acquired worldwide fame. But in 2020, due to the spread of coronavirus infection, the FFF was forced to pass the first serious test of strength. In the context of quarantine, it has lost two of its most important components. First, the increased interest of the media, which focused on covering a new burning topic, has dried up. Secondly, street demonstrations, which were the main method of the activists' struggle, were banned. The author of the article explores actions and new ways of activity that the members of the ""Fridays For Future"" have adapted to their goals. As a source base for this research, the Internet resources of the movement are investigated which have been developed quite well during its existence. In addition to this network of information, the materials of the mass media that continued to monitor the activities of young climate fighters were also reviewed. In addition, the works of other researchers studying the FFF movement are involved, unfortunately, not many, since the topic is relatively new. The article concludes about the ability of such type of associations as the ""Fridays For Future"" to maintain stability in crisis situations. This is facilitated by the features of their network device, as well as the generational identity of their participants. The main core of the movement is young students, whose representatives have mastered the new information technologies perfectly. Thanks to this fact, they are able to quickly adjust their methods and software settings, while generally maintaining a common commitment to their goals.","Korotkova, A.

Here, we investigate how the switch to distance learning affected study activity and performance in an online retrieval practice tool used for language learning in Dutch secondary education. We report insights from a rich data set consisting of over 115 million retrieval practice trials completed by more than 133 thousand students over the course of two consecutive school years. Our findings show that usage of the tool increased substantially at the start of lockdown, with the bulk of study activity occurring on weekday mornings. In general, students’ progress through the material was largely unaffected by lockdown, although students from the highest educational track were somewhat more likely to be on or ahead of schedule than students from lower tracks, compared to the previous year. Performance on individual study trials was generally stable, but accuracy and response time on open answer questions went up, perhaps as a result of students being more focused at home. These encouraging findings contribute to a growing literature on the educational ramifications of distance learning during lockdown. © Copyright © 2021 van der Velde, Sense, Spijkers, Meeter and van Rijn.","van der Velde, M.; Sense, F.; Spijkers, R.; Meeter, M.; van Rijn, H.",Frontiers in Education,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.712987,199

This article compares the pathogenesis, distribution, clinical characteristics, and treatment of the three highly pathogenic coronaviruses that caused epidemics, namely, ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"" (SARS), ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"" (MERS), and SARS-CoV-2. This narrative review is prepared using the data compiled from literature search using relevant MeSH terms. The clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is mild with relatively low fatality rate than the other two coronaviruses;however, its overall capability to cause explosive spread of the disease and reach a pandemic level is greater. Unlike SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has no accepted treatment protocols at present. Extensive studies and analyses on COVID-19 are necessary before making strong recommendations for or against any particular treatment, although some recent medications have shown great potential.

Methods With the approval of NHS England we conducted a cohort study, using OpenSAFELY, analysing routinely-collected primary care data linked to hospital admission, death and previously unavailable hospital prescription data. We used Cox regression (adjusting for confounders) to estimate hazard ratios (HR) comparing risk of COVID-19-death, death/critical care admission, and hospitalisation (March to September 2020) in: 1) people with IMIDs compared to the general population; and 2) people with IMIDs on targeted immune modifying drugs (e.g., biologics) compared to standard systemic treatment (e.g., methotrexate). Findings We identified 17,672,065 adults; of 1,163,438 (7%) with IMIDs, 19,119 people received targeted immune modifying drugs, and 200,813 received standard systemics. We saw evidence of increased COVID-19-death (HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.20, 1.27), and COVID-19 hospitalisation (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.29, 1.35) in individuals with IMIDs overall compared to individuals without IMIDs of the same age, sex, deprivation and smoking status. We saw no evidence of increased COVID-19 deaths with targeted compared to standard systemic treatments (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.80, 1.33). There was no evidence of increased COVID-19-related death in those prescribed TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23, IL7, IL-6 or JAK inhibitors compared to standard systemics. Rituximab was associated with increased COVID-19 death (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.11, 2.56); however, this finding may relate to confounding. Interpretation COVID-19 death and hospitalisation was higher in people with IMIDs. We saw no increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in those on most targeted immune modifying drugs for IMIDs compared to standard systemics.","MacKenna, B.; Kennedy, N.

These include (a) almost constant and low daily case rates over extended periods of time, (b) sudden waves emerging from the above solution despite no or minimal change in the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and (c) reduction or flattening of case counts following relaxation of NPI. To explain these phenomena, we add contact tracing to our recently developed cluster seeding and transmission (CST) model. We find no fewer than four effects which make prediction of epidemic trajectories uncertain. These are (a) cryptogenic instability, where a small increase in population-averaged contact rate causes a large increase in cases, (b) critical mass effect, where a wave manifests after weeks of quiescence with no change in parameter values, (c) knife-edge effect, where a small change in parameter across a critical value causes a huge change in the response of the system, and (d) hysteresis effect, where the timing and not just the strength of a particular NPI determines the subsequent behaviour. Despite these effects however, some non-obvious conclusions regarding NPI appear to be robust. In particular, (a) narrowing the circle of one's social interactions can be as effective a measure as reducing interactions altogether, and (b) a good contact tracing program can effectively substitute for much more invasive measures. Finally, we propose the contact tracing capacity ratio - a metric of the load to which the tracers are subject - as a reliable early warning indicator of an imminent epidemic wave.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

175030,Improving awareness of myalgic encephalomyelitis among healthcare professionals,2021,"The COVID 19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world highlighting its high transmissibility. In previous studies we could demonstrate that RIG-I activation induces an effective protective innate immunity against H1N1 influenza infection in vitro and in vivo. Here we analyzed the effect of prophylactic activation of RIG-I by its specific ligand 5'-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA) or of typeI/III interferons on SARS-CoV-2 infection in air-liquid interface cultivated primary nasal epithelial cells (PNEC) and Caco cells. MAVS-/- (downstream of RIG-I) deficient Caco-cells were used as a control. Viral replication was analyzed by plaque assay and qPCR. Furthermore, interferon-stimulated genes and ACE2/TMPRSS2 were determined on the transcriptional level and IP-10 protein was quantified in supernatants by ELISA. Upon transfection with 3pRNA at 6h prior to infection, Caco WT cells produced more than 8000 pg/ml IP-10. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 significantly decreased the average of 3pRNA-induced IP-10 production to 5000 pg/ml, whereas type I/III interferon and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone did not lead to relevant IP-10 production. 3pRNA pretreatment of Caco WT cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced virus replication at 48 h by an average of 91,4% . Pretreatment with type I and III interferon had little effect on virus replication. Analysis of viral RNA in RIG-I-pretreated cells revealed an average reduction of SARS-CoV-2- RNA by 40-fold. Results were also achieved in PNEC showing similar levels in reduction of viral replication and high levels of IP-10 production. Thus, our findings support the concept that RIG-mediated protection of epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 replication is a promising strategy to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Hartmann, E.; Kümmerer, B.; Wieland, A.; Ludwig, J.; Zillinger, T.; Hartmann, G.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1727763,199
175038,COVID-19 data reporting systems in Africa reveal insights for pandemic preparedness,2021-10-04,"Time-dependent physiological data, such as electromyogram (EMG) recordings from multiple muscles, is often difficult to interpret objectively. Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes. New & Noteworthy Despite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchi’s fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches.","Santuz, Alessandro; Akay, Turgay",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059618,199
175149,Navigating the new normal: Which firms have adapted better to the covid-19 disruption?,2021,"Pregnancies with cardiovascular (CV) complications are more likely to involve additional complications, poorer short and long-term health, and worse fetal outcomes. Additionally, CV complications are associated with poorer mental health, lower socioeconomic status, and non-White race/ethnicity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on mental well-being and disproportionately affects people of lower socioeconomic status and non-White race/ethnicity. Thus, we hypothesized that the pandemic would differentially affect pregnant people with and without CV complications. We performed a cross-sectional survey of 465 pregnant people in California from June 6 through July 29, 2020. Twenty-three participants reported CV complications (e.g., hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes) and 29 participants reported non-CV complications. The CV group was 56.5% (13 of 23) Latinx and 43.5% (10 of 23) White versus the uncomplicated pregnancy group, which was 33.7% (137 of 407) Latinx and 66.3% (270 of 407) White (chi-square, p=0.03;6 respondents did not answer). The CV complications group was 9.5% (2 of 21) African American and the uncomplicated pregnancy group was 4.9% (19 of 392) African American (Fisher's Exact, p=0.053;23 respondents did not answer). We assessed 64 health behaviors reported on a Likert scale with the Wilcoxon 2-Sample Test and found the CV group reported more healthpromoting behaviors, including: less likely to eat sweets (p=0.004), more likely to sanitize frequently used areas in their homes and their groceries (p=0.049 and 0.069, respectively). However, they were also more likely to smoke cigarettes (p=0.02). While the two groups did not differ significantlyon stress, depression, or anxiety, the CV group was more likely to worry that their babies may behospitalized after birth (p=0.01) and their provider may be unavailable during delivery (p=0.047).Concerns for self and baby trended towards significance for the CV group, which reported beingmore likely to worry about getting sick (p=0.077) and their babies being born early (p=0.079) orgetting sick (p=0.098). While preliminary, these data suggest that COVID-19 disproportionatelyaffects pregnant people with prenatal CV complications. Given limited research on pregnancy duringCOVID-19 and the primary focus on biological outcomes, these findings indicate a clear need toaddress the pandemic's influence on behavioral and emotional health during pregnancy-especiallyfor those with CV complications who are at higher risk of poor maternal and fetal outcomes.","Phipps, J.

Therefore, in this review of 108 papers, we delineate the landscape of virtual technologies for food testing and present their practical implications. From our analysis, VR emerged as a promising tool, yet it was not being used by practitioners. Other technologies (e.g. flavor simulators) were too preliminary to be adopted in industry.

175355,“Who says I am coping”: The emotional affect of New Jersey academic librarians during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"States have adopted a range of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Some, mainly democracies like New Zealand and South Korea, took quick health measures without curbing citizen rights. Others, especially those led by populists like Bolsonaro and Erdogan, denied the seriousness of the health crisis even as they curbed political and civil rights. El Salvador is virtually unique in its COVID-19 response, combining a strong rhetorical commitment to health measures with clear efforts to undermine democratic controls and rights. President Nayib Bukele adopted an early travel ban and publicly vilified those who broke curfew by sending them and all who tested positive to quarantine centers for 30 days. He derided and defied Constitutional Chamber decisions against such practices, ordered militarized actions, and crowded gang-affiliated prisoners together in humiliating ways that risked exposure to COVID-19. We examine how Bukele’s policies conform to, and seemingly exemplify, Michel Foucault’s theoretical concepts of biopolitics and disciplinary power. However, the Salvadoran case also challenges key features of Foucault’s theory, suggesting the need to modify his Western assumptions about highly institutionalized states. Our analysis suggests that strong leaders can undercut citizen rights and agency, visible at the intersection of biopolitical social theory and democratic backsliding.

We previously demonstrated that three fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and difloxacin, suppress replication of six flaviviruses. To investigate the barrier to resistance and mechanism(s) of action of these drugs, DENV-4 was passaged in triplicate in HEK-293 cells in the presence or absence of each drug. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected by the seventh passage and to difloxacin by the tenth, whereas resistance to enoxacin did not occur within ten passages. Two putative resistance-conferring mutations were detected in the envelope gene of ciprofloxacin and difloxacin-resistant DENV-4. In the absence of ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin-resistant viruses sustained a significantly higher viral titer than control viruses in HEK-293 and HuH-7 cells and resistant viruses were more stable than control viruses at 37°C. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin and difloxacin involves interference with virus binding or entry.","Scroggs, Stacey L.

176498,"Statistical properties of the aftershocks of stock market crashes revisited: Analysis based on the 1987 crash, financial-crisis-2008 and COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"Our study suggests that methylation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is essential for its optimal replication in the target cells. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein) was shown to mediate deposition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The levels of hNRNPA1 expression and extent of methylation varied, depending on the course of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The recruitment of eIF4E (translational initiation factor) facilitated viral RNA translation at 1 hour post infection (1 hpi). However, at 2 hpi, methylation of internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA recruited hNRNPA1 which facilitated viral RNA transcription but resulted in translational repression, a phenomenon contributing in understanding the early translation to replication switch in the viral life cycle. Besides, the abrogation of methylation also produced a defective 5’ cap of viral RNA which failed to interact with eIF4E, thereby resulting in a decreased synthesis of viral proteins. To conclude, methylation of the internal and 5’ cap of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was shown to regulate transcription and translation of SARS-CoV-2 in a time dependent manner. IMPORTANCE RNA modifications are found in all life forms and have been linked to development, health and diseases. Our study reveals that internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA methylation (m6A) is essential for interaction with hNRNPA1 to effectively synthesize viral genome. Besides, m6A-marked RNA and hRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Blocking SARS-CoV-2 RNA methylation resulted in reduced virus yield, suggesting epitranscriptomic machinery (methylation) facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication and might represent potential target for new antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Kumar, Ram; Chander, Yogesh; Khandelwal, Nitin; Nagori, Himanshu; Verma, Assim; Pal, Yash; Gulati, Baldev R.; Tripathi, Bhupendra N.; Barua, Sanjay; Kumar, Naveen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452288,199

Since many of the same considerations apply to any basic income proposal, whether implemented across Canada or in a single province, we offer a set of questions that we believe must be considered in deciding whether and how to implement a basic income or any alternative social support policy.","Green, David Kesselman Rhys Tedds Lindsay",The School of Public Policy Publications (SPPP),https://doi.org/10.11575/sppp.v13i0.70353,199
176780,"Democratic Accountability in Times of Crisis: Executive Power, Fiscal Policy and COVID-19",2021,"Background Disclosure of an HIV-positive status has significant implications for public health outcomes, social relationships, and individual psychological and emotional well-being. The response to the disclosure is critical for future treatment adherence, feelings of stigma, future disclosure, and overall health behaviours. There is paucity of data on the impact of the reaction of the person disclosed to on men's willingness to disclose. We report on men's perception of HIV-positive status disclosure in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods Following informed consent and COVID-19 regulations, 12 telephonic in-depth interviews and 3 face-to-face group discussions (October-November 2020) were conducted with a purposive sample of men aged 23-65 years from rural KwaZulu-Natal. Themes were identified from the interview transcripts, manually coded, and analysed thematically. The study was approved by the University of KwaZulu-Natal, University of Johannesburg, and Africa Health Research Institute research ethics committee. Results Personal characteristics, gender, HIV knowledge and HIV identity were key factors for study participants to disclose their HIV-positive status to another person. Participants reported that if that person is popular, friendly, and talkative, they will be reluctant to disclose to them fearing that they might tell others. Some were wary of disclosing to female nurses from their community. It is also difficult for men to reveal their HIV-positive status to their partners fearing that they will be viewed as a cheater or someone with a promiscuous past. Knowing that the person disclosed to is also HIV positive makes it easier for the men in our study to disclose their HIV status. Conclusion Our findings show that men often weigh up the costs and benefits of disclosing their HIV-positive status depending on who they are disclosing to. Further research is needed to understand different ways in which men can disclose their HIV-positive status without fear of stigmatization.","Adeagbo, O.; Luthuli, M.; Gumede, D.; Seeley, J.; Shahmanesh, M.; Li, X.; Naidoo, K.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.253,199

176836,Effect of workplace infection control practices on workers' psychological distress: a large-scale cohort study during the COVID-19 second state of emergency in Japan,2021-10-07,"Objectives: Although high altitude training has been increasingly popular in endurance athletes, the molecular and cellular bases of this adaptation remain poorly understood. We aimed to define the underlying physiological changes and screen for potential biomarkers of adaptation using transcriptional profiling of whole blood. More generally, we aimed to evaluate the utility of blood RNA sequencing as a modern and sensitive method of athlete's health monitoring. Methods: Seven elite female speed skaters were profiled before and after 1h intense exercise, on the 18th day of Live High, Train High (LHTH) training programme. Whole blood RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with globin depletion was used to measure gene expression changes associated with high intensity exercise at high altitude. Eight public microarray datasets were used to identify genes uniquely regulated at high altitude. Gene markers derived from single cell RNA-seq data were used to evaluate the changes of individual cell types in the whole blood. Results: Using individual cell type signatures, we were able to deconvolute the changes of finely defined cell populations from the whole blood RNA-seq. We have detected the increase in neutrophils, platelets, erythrocytes, and CD14 monocytes, and the decrease in natural killers, CD8 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, B cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The levels of naive CD4 T cells, CD16 monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells were unchanged. Leveraging the previously published transcriptomic data allowed us to define the expression signature unique to high-altitude adaptation. Among the identified genes we highlight PHOSPHO1, which has a known role in erythropoiesis, and MARC1 with a proposed role in endogenic NO metabolism. Finally, we find that platelets and, to a lesser extent, erythrocytes are the two major cell types that uniquely respond to altitude exercise, while neutrophils represent a more generic marker of intense exercise. Conclusions: Using publicly available data from both single-cell RNA-seq atlases and exercise-related blood profiling dramatically increases the value of whole blood RNA-seq for dynamic evaluation of physiological changes in an athlete's body. In addition to the measurement of individual gene expression changes, our approach allowed us to estimate changes of blood cell type counts from a small peripheral blood sample, without sorting or other expensive and unfeasible equipment. We also discuss a surprising parallel of hypoxia and increased thrombosis, and hypothesize about the role exercise can play in COVID-19 outcomes.","Glotov, A. S.; Zelenkova, I. E.; Vashukova, E.

A correlational cross-sectional investigation was developed, with 164 obstetric students. The information was collected through a questionnaire applied online between November and December 2020, having determined its validity and reliability. The Chi squared statistical test (p <0.05) was used, while the information processing was carried out using the SPSS program. It was determined that 61.6% of obstetric students perceived a high risk in the protection of their privacy in mobile web during the development of their activities in the academic cycle 2020-I. Likewise, it was evidenced that the majority of students stated that they had not developed the topics consulted with regard to information security education during their virtual studies in obstetric, especially with regard to the recommendations for the use of passwords (83.5%), privacy protection strategies (81.1%) and data management through the creation of backups (79.9%), showing a statistically significant relationship with the self-perception of privacy protection risk in mobile web (p <0.05).

This can be achieved with simplified testing approaches and affordable access to core resources. While RT-qPCR-based tests remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection due to their high sensitivity, implementation of testing requires high upfront costs to obtain the necessary instrumentation. This is particularly restrictive in low-resource settings. The Ubiquitome Liberty16 system was developed as an inexpensive, portable, battery-operated single-channel RT-qPCR device with an associated iPhone app to simplify assay set-up and data reporting. When coupled with the SalivaDirect protocol for testing saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2, the Liberty16 device yielded a limit of detection (LOD) of 12 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/uL results, comparable to the upper end of the LOD range for the standard SalivaDirect protocol when performed on larger RT-qPCR instruments. While further optimization may deliver even greater sensitivity and assay speed, findings from this study indicates that small portable devices such as the Liberty16 can deliver reliable results and provide the opportunity to further increase access to gold standard SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Yolda-Carr, D.; Thammavongsa, D.

While exponential growth in the availability of private hospitals has been recorded in the past few years, many hospitals are not able to attract enough patients due to poor quality of services, unavailability of skilled healthcare workers, and unethical medical practices. These issues were painfully exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients rely on recommendations from friends and relatives to select a physician or hospital. This study undertakes a customer-oriented view of patients to explore patients? perceptions of physicians? communication and how it influences the recommendation of a physician. For the study, data are collected from 626 patients spread across three cities of North India. We find that physician communication leads to favourable recommendations, and the patient?s perceived influence and satisfaction play an important role in this process. The physician should display empathy and compassion while communicating to patients, which helps build a favourable perception of the physician. This leads to a higher level of satisfaction with the healthcare provider. Furthermore, the study also examines the effects of socio-demographic variables, such as patient?s income, patient?s gender, and physician?s gender. People with high (vs low) income are more satisfied with physician communication, whereas people with low (vs high) income are more likely to recommend a physician. Interestingly, female patients are more satisfied with a physician?s communication skills than males. Aligned with the patriarchal society, patients show more acceptance of male (vs female) doctors, but in contrast, patients are more likely to recommend a female (vs male) doctor. So, we recommend that healthcare providers ensure that patients get sufficient time to spend with their physicians to discuss problems and not ?rush? the patients to improve revenues.","Mehra, Payal Mishra Anubhav",Vikalpa,https://doi.org/10.1177/02560909211027090,199

Our results demonstrate that the content-based methods of counter conspiracy theory can partly mitigate conspiratorial belief. Specifically, the science- and fact-focused corrections were able to effectively mitigate conspiracy beliefs, whereas media literacy and inoculation strategies did not produce significant change. More crucially, our findings illustrate that both audience-focused methods, which involve decoding the myth of conspiracy theory and re-imagining intergroup relationships, were effective in reducing the cognitive acceptance of conspiracy theory.

Mapping Threats to Press Freedom during the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis,2021,"Introduction: Proxalutamide, a second generation non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), primarily developed for castration-resistant prostate cancer, demonstrated reduction in 28-day mortality rate of 77.7% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT), through intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. However, the intriguingly high 28-day mortality rate of patients that did not complete the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide, compared non-completers of the placebo arm and overall placebo arm, raised the hypotheses of the existence of non-neglectable differences between ITT and on-treatment (OT) analysis in terms of drug efficacy. Despite the inherent limitations of OT analysis, we aimed to respond to unanswered questions regarding the drug efficacy when the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide was complete, and secondarily understand the causality relationship between treatment interruption and mortality rate. Methods: This is a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicentric, two-arm RCT of 300mg-daily 14-day proxalutamide therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, using OT population, i.e., excluding patients that did not complete treatment or interrupted at least 24 hours before death. Patients above 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19 not presenting kidney, liver, or heart failure were eligible. The primary outcome was 8-point COVD-19 ordinal scale at day 14. Secondary outcomes included 28-day 8-point COVID-19 ordinary scale, 14-day and 28-day all-cause mortality rate, and median hospital length. Results: In total, 580 patients completed the 14-day treatment or died during treatment, including 288 patients in the proxalutamide arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm, with similar baseline characteristics between groups. The 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 4.2% in the proxalutamide group and 49.0% in the placebo group. The mortality risk ratio (RR) was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.15), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.2 to prevent death. The median hospital length stay after randomization was 05 days (interquartile range - IQR = 3 to 7.2 days) in the proxalutamide group and 09 days (IQR = 6 to 15 days) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate of patients that received proxalutamide but interrupted treatment before 14 days was 79.3%, while those that received placebo and interrupted before 14 days was 52.8% (p = 0.054 between groups). Conclusion: The reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality rate with 14-day proxalutamide treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was more significant treatment completers (92%), compared to the reduction when all patients enrolled in the proxalutamide arm were considered (77.7%). However, the magnitude of statistical significance of the reduction in all-cause mortality and the NNT were similar between the OT and ITT analysis. The apparent high mortality risk rate with early interruption of proxalutamide treatments suggests that strategies for treatment compliance should be reinforced for future RCTs with proxalutamide.

In the context of cancer therapeutics, plasticity refers to transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells, driving the formation of rare cells primed to survive drug treatment and ultimately reprogram into a stably resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing this cellular plasticity remain unknown. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to reveal genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity across a range of functional categories. We found that cellular plasticity and cell fate decision making can be decoupled in that factors can affect cell fate decisions in both plasticity-dependent and independent manners. We discovered a novel mode of altering resistance based on cellular plasticity that, contrary to known mechanisms, pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. We further confirmed our prediction that manipulating cellular plasticity before the addition of the main therapy would result in changes in therapy resistance more than concurrent administration. Together, our results indicate that identifying pathways modulating cellular plasticity has the potential to alter cell fate decisions and may provide a new avenue for treating drug resistance.","Torre, Eduardo A.; Arai, Eri; Bayatpour, Sareh; Beck, Lauren E.; Emert, Benjamin L.; Shaffer, Sydney M.; Mellis, Ian A.; Fane, Mitchell; Alicea, Gretchen; Budinich, Krista A.; Weeraratna, Ashani; Shi, Junwei; Raj, Arjun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/638809,199

Vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are attenuated in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), and breakthrough infections are more common. Additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses may increase anti-spike antibody titers in some SOTRs, but whether this results in enhanced neutralizing capability, especially versus novel variants of concern (VOCs) that exhibit immune escape and higher infectivity (e.g., the Delta variant), is unclear. Here, we report that a third dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine increases anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD IgG levels as well as plasma neutralizing capability versus VOCs, including Delta, in some SOTRs. However, anti-spike IgG and neutralizing capability remained significantly reduced compared to fully vaccinated healthy controls. These findings highlight the need for continued study of strategies to improve protection from COVID-19 in immunosuppressed populations as more SARS-CoV-2 VOCs emerge.","Karaba, A.

It covers the historic period from early 2020 to early 2021 and also makes an assessment on future prospects. Although evidence is collected from all around the world, the focus is primarily on developing countries. The methods used are a review of the announced actions and preliminary findings in the academic and grey literature as well as on reliable websites from global and international institutions. By October 2020, governments around the world had invested about $12 trillion to counteract the economic effects of COVID-19. This investment could contribute to progress on the SDGs and global climate targets insofar as it was invested within a framework that supports both socio-economic recovery and sustainability. Initial analysis indicates that investments for economic recovery did not sufficiently address food security and sustainability, concentrating instead on immediate economic risk management. The global sustainable development agenda must promote the resilience and sustainability of food systems through policies and measures that: i) account for environmental thresholds and trade-offs;ii) promote food security and healthy diets;iii) enhance and protect rural livelihoods;and iv) address the inequalities and injustices that have emerged and will prevail during a post-COVID transition. National stimulus programs and the actions of international agencies must be assessed and monitored to deliver multiple benefits simultaneously and guide building back better.","Markandya, A.; Salcone, J.; Hussain, S.; Muller, A.; Thambi, S.",Frontiers in Environmental Science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.674432,199

The paper also gives updates on the musculoskeletal health of office-based computer users from 2018 to 2019 and 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. In Schedule 2 of the Employees’ Compensation Ordinance, compensable occupational disease concerning musculoskeletal issues caused by prolonged use of computers only include injuries to the hand or forearm (including elbow). If office employees suffer from lower back or shoulder pain, any application for compensation may not be practicable and feasible. Statistics indicate that 96% of office employees in Hong Kong spent at least six hours a day on computer work in the years 2018 and 2019. A total of 78% of office employees reported musculoskeletal discomfort and among all cases, Shoulder, Neck and Lower Back were the three highest reported body regions to have discomfort in past research from 2011 till 2020. In terms of the musculoskeletal health of computer-based users during COVID-19 in 2020, 80% of respondents self-reported musculoskeletal discomfort during the pandemic season of COVID-19.

The integration of top-down and bottom-up processes during complex multi-modal human activities, however, is yet to be fully understood. Music provides an excellent model for understanding this since music listening leads to the urge to move, and music making entails both playing and listening at the same time (i.e. audio-motor coupling). Here, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of 130 neuroimaging studies of music perception, production and imagery, with 2660 foci, 139 experiments, and 2516 participants. We found that music perception and production rely on auditory cortices and sensorimotor cortices, while music imagery recruits distinct parietal regions. This indicates that the brain requires different structures to process similar information which is made available either by an interaction with the environment (i.e. bottom-up) or by internally generated content (i.e. top-down).","Pando-Naude, Victor; Patyczek, Agata; Bonetti, Leonardo; Vuust, Peter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.441417,199
181022,Vaccine-mediated exit strategies from England’s covid-19 lockdown,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 - a novel and highly infectious coronavirus, has been spreading around the world for over a year, and poses a serious threat to the public health. Numerous studies have revealed the genome, structure and replication cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the immune response to infection. Data from these studies provide a firm basis for the development of strategies to prevent the further spread of COVID-19, as well as to synthesize effective and safe vaccines and drugs. First and foremost, vaccines are needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data released by WHO, at the beginning of 2021 there were 63 potential vaccines under clinical examinations, and over 172 in preclinical trials. The most promising vaccines are mRNA-based: Comirnaty (Pfizer- BioNTech), COVID-19 Vaccine (Moderna/NIAID) and CVnCoV (CureVac);vector vaccines: COVID-19 Vaccine (AstraZeneca/Oxford University), Gam-COVIDVac (Gamaleja Institute, Russia) and JNJ-78436735/Ad.26.COV2.S. (Johnson & Johnson), and NVX-CoV2373 recombinant subunit vaccine (Novavax). The following groups of drugs potentially may be used in the COVID-19 therapy: Antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action - blocking the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its specific receptor on cell membrane (angiotensin coverting enzyme 2;ACE2) and inhibiting viral entry into host cells (umifenovir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, camostat mesylate and nafamostat);drugs that inhibit viral replication (inhibitors of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, e.g. remdesivir, favipiravir, ribovirin and molnupiravir;protease inhibitors, e.g. Kaletra);immunomodulating drugs (humanized monoclonal anticytokine antibodies, e.g. adalimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab and anakinra;JAK kinase inhibitors - ruxolitinib and baricitinib), anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticosteroids), and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S).

Purposive sampling method was used to recruit prospective participants. Semi-structured interviews were used as the primary data collection method. The data gathered were then analysed using thematic data analysis. The results indicate that despite having the compulsory implementation of ODL within a short notice, the participants disclosed that their sense of self-efficacy beliefs varied depending on context-specific nature based on several domains including self-assurance, technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK), teaching preparation, intrinsic motivation and administration support. The present study also reveals that participants utilised emotion-driven self-efficacy beliefs to overcome ODL challenges and eventually developed social-emotional rewards for staying positive in ODL practices. It was also found that self-efficacy beliefs contributed to students' positive performance, and this has become a factor in heightening participants' self-efficacy beliefs. The results have provided enlightenment on participants' self-efficacy beliefs in ODL practices and offer recommendations for improvement in tertiary educational practices to bring positive impacts on teaching and learning. © 2021 Author(s).","Aziz, A.

Many epidemiological studies have established associations between urban nature, cognitive development and mental health, but why specifically we receive these health benefits remains unclear, especially in children. Here, we used longitudinal data in a cohort of 3,568 children aged 9 to 15 years at 31 schools across London to develop a model and examine the associations between natural habitat type, and children's cognitive development and mental health. We show that, after adjusting for other environmental, demographic and socioeconomic variables, higher daily exposure rates to natural habitat and particularly woodland were associated with enhanced cognitive development and mental health from late childhood to early adolescence. Our results suggest that optimising ecosystem services linked to cognitive development and mental health benefits should prioritise the type of natural habitat for sustainable urban planning decisions.","Maes, M.

GS help to maintain the physical and mental health of citizens, facilitating communication, sport and physical activities and the contact with Nature. Moreover, they are primary reserve for biodiversity in cities and support several regulating (e.g. water cycle, climate mitigation) and cultural ecosystem services. Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the beneficial role of GS for citizens. A key aspect for GS effectiveness is its accessibility for city residents. Full accessible GS are public spaces available for all to use free of charge and without time restrictions. Anyway, the accessibility varies for different GS (e.g. private or public) and for different people movement capabilities (e.g. elderly or young). Thus, planning the spatial distribution of different GS is more and more fundamental for the definition of sustainable, resilient, safe and fair urban systems. In this work, a GIS-based accessibility assessment of GS is presented for the city of Viterbo, central Italy. A score of accessibility by different users of GS (total residents, children, elderly people) is calculated on the road network and some planning considerations are presented.

On the other hand, reports of choir-rehearsals infecting most members seemed to refute this, and the topic remained inconclusive. We provide a mathematical theory in which both observations are true; on a population level, pre-immunity exists, on an individual level, it doesn't. This theory demonstrates that established formulas relating e.g. R0 and the herdimmunity threshold are wrong. We derive new mathematical formulas, which applies to any virus whose transmission dynamics is associated with large individual variability in susceptibility to the infection. Contrary to great variability in infectivity, which we show has no bearing on the mathematical modeling, variability in susceptibility actually manifests itself as pre-immunity on a macroscopic scale, thus making pre-immunity a necessity for accurate mathematical modeling.","Carlsson, M.; Wittsten, J.; Soderberg-Naucler, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.08.21260175v1?rss=1,199

However, it is unknown whether exogenous attention improves perception by facilitating processing of attended information, suppressing processing of unattended information, or both. To test this question, we measured behavioral performance and cue-elicited neural changes in the electroencephalogram as participants (N = 19) performed a task in which a spatially non-predictive auditory cue preceded a visual target. Critically, this cue was either presented at a peripheral target location or from the center of the screen, allowing us to isolate spatially specific attentional activity. We find that both behavior and attention-mediated changes in visual-cortical activity are enhanced at the location of a cue prior to the onset of a target, but that behavior and neural activity at an unattended target location are equivalent to that following a central cue that does not direct attention (i.e., baseline). These results suggest that exogenous attention operates solely via facilitation of information at an attended location.","Keefe, Jonathan M.; Pokta, Emilia; Störmer, Viola S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.338210,199

The relevant literature was reviewed, followed by a survey study on the provision of religious facilities and services. Aspects considered are: the religions influences in and on Taiwanese society; the religious needs of patients and their families; strategies that patients use to enable them to cope with their health care problems; professional motives for attuning to patients' religious needs; and hospital provision for meeting the religious and spiritual needs of patients.

The annual incidence rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome was 1.35 cases per 100,000 population. The age-adjusted incidence rates were 1.49 cases per 100,000 men and 1.20 cases per 100,000 women. A minor peak in the sex-adjusted incidence rate was present in young adult life with a larger peak in later life. Twenty-two (20%) patients presented in the five-month period from July 1984 to November 1984 (P less than 0.05) but a common infectious agent or geographical area of residence was not discovered during this period. Immune function had been affected potentially before the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome in 12 (11%) patients, which raises further speculation as to the role of immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In order to enhance our understanding of this disorder, it is recommended that an assessment of immune function be considered in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and also chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.","Hankey, G J",The Medical journal of Australia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3574191/,199

196235,Models for COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Analysis.,2020-09-21,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the process of SARS transmission and to evaluate infectivity of SARS patients in different periods of disease development. METHODS A case of SARS outbreak beginning from a male, 74-year-old patient in Beijing. Two hundred and seventy five primary, secondary and tertiary contacts, including family members relatives, colleagues, and others exposed to him, were traced by field investigation and telephone interview using a standardized questionnaire. The transmission process and infectivity of disease were analyzed with transmission chain diagram and contact history diagram. RESULTS Among the 275 contacts of the index case, 41 fell ill of SARS with an attack rate of 14.9% and 5 deaths with a fatality rate of 12.2%. The transmission chain of this outbreak could be clearly delineated, and all the 41 cases had close contacts with their infectors, SARS cases of the previous generation within the symptomatic period thereof. All of the 114 contacts that contacted their infectors, SARS cases of the previous generation during the incubation period thereof remained healthy. The incubation period of 27 cases that had contacted their infectors only once was 1 - 10 days with a median of 3 days. The highest risk of being infected was caring the patients unprotectedly, followed by living together with patient, visiting patient, and handling patient without protection. CONCLUSION All the secondary cases have the history of close contact with their symptomatic infectors of previous generation. It cannot be proved at all that SARS is infective during the incubation period. The infectivity of SARS is related to the degree of closeness of contact with the patient.","Li, Qin; Zeng, Guang; Ou, Jian-ming; Guo, Gui-ping",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12899788/,199

The virus caused late-onset respiratory disease and increased airsacculitis condemnation in affected flocks despite the use of an established infectious bronchitis virus vaccination program. An experimental study compared Holland/Arkansas and Massachusetts/Arkansas vaccination protocols to determine the efficacy of commercial infectious bronchitis virus vaccines in reducing respiratory disease and airsacculitis lesions found at processing that were associated with a CA99 field isolate. All vaccination groups were given Massachusetts/Connecticut strains of infectious bronchitis virus vaccines at age 1 day followed by vaccination with either Holland/ Arkansas or Massachusetts/Arkansas vaccine strains at 18 days of age. Birds were challenged at age 31 days with a CA99 field isolate. Gross pathology, histopathology, and virus isolation were evaluated.

197050,The Human Rights Challenges of Digital COVID-19 Surveillance.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the recent severity of COVID-19 in various countries. METHODS Data were ollected on the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in various countries as of January 16, 2021, and the scale and overall trend of the epidemic were retrospectively described; combined with the recent trend of newly confirmed cases, from January 10 to 16 (the 54th week) and the newly confirmed cases indexes, such as the number and incidence density the severity of the epidemic was classified. Feasible suggestions were put forward based on the variation of the virus, actual data of vaccine research and development and possible existence in many countries. RESULTS Up to January 16, 2021, there were 92 510 419 confirmed cases worldwide; 4 849 301 new confirmed cases were confirmed in the 54th week, and they were still growing. Among all the continents, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Europe, North America, and Asia has exceeded 21 million, and the number of new confirmed cases in a single week in North America, South America and Asia were all increasing. Among the countries, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in 18 countries including the United States, India, and Brazil was more than 1 million, accounting for 77.04% of the total number of cumulative confirmed cases in the world. Eleven countries including the United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia, The United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, South Africa, Italy, and India are at higher risk of the epidemic; The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, and Colombia were still experiencing new confirmed cases and increasing status, the risk of the epidemic was greater. Novel coronavirus mutates frequently, up to February 2021, there had been 3 931 mutant genotypes in the world. At the same time, a total of 11 vaccines were successfully launched, however we were still facing some troubles, such as the global shortage of vaccines, the public's willingness to vaccinate needed to be improved, and equity in the distribution of vaccines. CONCLUSION The global epidemic situation is still getting worse, with repeated epidemics in all the continents and countries, and has not been fundamentally controlled. At the continent level, North America, South America, and Europe have the most severe epidemics; at the national level, The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia and other countries have higher epidemic risks. Focusing on the severely affected countries will help bring the global epidemic under control as soon as possible. Under the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, it is a key and feasible direction to improve the yield and vaccination rate of the vaccines, shorten the onset time of the vaccines and prolong the immune persistence.","Huang, B; Wang, H Y",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We questioned whether a similar effect would be observed during variable work rate exercise at a specific rating of perceived exertion (RPE), as is commonly prescribed for aerobic training sessions. Using a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover design, ten females (25 ± 3 years; VO2peak 37.1 ± 5.3 ml/kg/min) performed two 20-min cycle ergometer trials at a constant RPE of 13 (somewhat hard) 2.5 hours following ingestion of 140 ml of concentrated beetroot juice (12.9 mmol nitrate), or nitrate-depleted placebo. Performance was measured in terms of total VO2 (L) consumed and total mechanical work (kJ) accomplished across each trial. Following each experimental trial, subjects rode at 75W for an additional 5 min to determine the effect of beetroot juice on fixed work rate exercise. Coefficients of variation in total VO2 (L) and work performed (kJ) during the RPE 13 clamp trials were 8.2 and 9.5%, respectively. Consumption of beetroot juice did not affect total VO2 or work performed during RPE 13 exercise, but lowered resting systolic blood pressure by ~5 mmHg (P=0.041) and oxygen consumption at 75W by ~4% (P=0.048), relative to placebo. Since the effect of beetroot juice on oxygen consumption is small and may be masked by daily variability during self-regulated exercise, it is unlikely to have a notable effect on daily training.","Rienks, Jordyn N; Vanderwoude, Andrea A; Maas, Elizabeth; Blea, Zachary M; Subudhi, Andrew W",International journal of exercise science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27182417/,199

The selection of components during virus assembly must therefore be flexible enough to allow the incorporation of unrelated viral membrane proteins, yet specific enough to exclude the bulk of host proteins. This apparent contradiction has been termed the pseudotypic paradox. There is mounting evidence that lipid rafts play a role in the assembly pathway of non-icosahedral, enveloped viruses. Viral components are concentrated initially in localized regions of the plasma membrane via their interaction with lipid raft domains. Lateral interactions of viral structural proteins amplify the changes in local lipid composition which in turn enhance the concentration of viral proteins in the rafts. An affinity for lipid rafts may be the common feature of enveloped virus proteins that leads to the formation of pseudotypes.","Briggs, John A G; Wilk, Thomas; Fuller, Stephen D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12655075/,199

Using qualitative interview data, perspectives from both health administrators and service providers working at all levels of China's health care system were examined. Service providers admitted selective adherence and non-adherence to universal precautions in their daily medical practice, and gave their explanations for such behaviors. Lack of time to put on protective gear, gear's interference with medical procedures, lack of administrative support, heavy workload in hospitals, inaccurate risk assessment, and beliefs that compliance with universal precautions is unnecessary, time consuming and costly were mentioned as reasons behind noncompliance. Effective universal precaution interventions need to target both administrators and providers, and address both structural barriers and individual attitudinal and behavioral factors.","Wu, Sheng; Li, Li; Wu, Zunyou; Cao, Haijun; Lin, Chunqing; Yan, Zhihua; Jia, Manhong; Cui, Haixia",AIDS and behavior,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17641967/,199

This study seeks to determine the histological changes after bronchoscopic, endoscopic and open SCT on tissues in the thoracic cavity. METHODS Yorkshire pigs underwent flexible bronchoscopy, endoscopy and thoracotomy for SCT of the airway, oesophagus and other intrathoracic structures, respectively. Variations in the duration and number of spray cycles for the same dosimetry were compared. RESULTS Bronchoscopic SCT of the airway resulted in cellular death up to the cartilage layer. Endoscopic SCT of the oesophagus led to cell death up to the adventitial layer. Tissue necrosis was severe in the lung, of full thickness in the pleura, but very superficial in the great vessels. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of treated tissues remained well-preserved. Having shorter but more cycles of SCT decreased the depth of the cellular necrosis. One pig developed ventricular fibrillation during the surgery and expired. CONCLUSIONS SCT causes reproducible tissue injury with the preserved ECM of most tissues within the thoracic cavity, making it enticing for ablation around vital structures like the great vessels with a decreased long-term risk. Further study is warranted to investigate the adverse events during SCT.","Au, Joyce T; Carson, Joshua; Monette, Sebastien; Finley, David J",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811511/,199

The most prevalent symptoms are of the anxious or anxious-depressive type. The response to chronic stress, including that of low profile and intensity but maintained over time, has significant repercussions for childhood and adolescence. Few percentage that present prominent mental disorders, but we must recognize that when projected to the whole the child-adolescent population, there could be a significant number that could be subsidiary of a more specific help.

The ""cortical spread"" of grey matter loss in schizophrenia and the mid-pericallosal ""congestion"" in fMRI of periodic catatonia - treatable electromagnetically along arteries - are interpreted in terms of the fastest interstitial outflow through the Cerebral IntraMural Reverse Arterial Flow-engine (CIMURAF, Treviranus 2018-19) draining ""waste"" via arterio-adventitial lymphatics to the neck. Such repetitively sliding segments of CIMURAF are wrung downstream by muscles likely steered by the neurovascular pterygopalatine ganglion. At the pericallosal artery, along its ideal long straight segment, this likely happens diverging from the mid-callosum towards the front and the back. In the case of a convergent inversion a mid-callosal clash will result, which is observable in psychoses as a mid-callosal high-flow-spot simultaneously with hyper-perfusions of branches and ""backwatering"" of pial vessels with reactive waste - till date interpreted psycho-mathematically. CIMURAF might also accelerate the perivascular intrusion of MCs by flushing autocrine signals (of which electro-magnetism moves the dipoles) through a putative periadventitial counter-current. Psychoses plausible occur through tryptase-mediated attacks operated by mast cells against oligodendrocytes' cytoskeleton (Medic 2009) and probably via complement-4 (Schizophrenia WG, 2014) against neurons. Usually MCs are essential long-lived ""orchestrators"" of homeostases and immune or barrier defences interacting with nerves, immunocytes, organs, and routes. MCs after somatic programming as to ""destination & destiny"" (Treviranus 2017a, 6.2., 2018) rapidly intrude also into the brain's parenchyma, first within the lymphatics and then putatively by crossing-over to extraluminal arterial routes. MCs transverse the BBBs, while macrophages only trespass in ""disease"" (Faraco et al. 2017). Both can be ""subverted"" by a list of microbes (and putatively blown up by COVID-19 within walls).

201228,The passage of time during the UK Covid-19 lockdown,2020,"Background: In recent years, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has gained increasing clinical interest as a non-invasive method for local therapy of liver malignancies. HIFU treatment of tumours and metastases in the liver dome is limited due to the adjacent ultrasound blocking lung. One-lung flooding (OLF) enables complete sonography of lung and adjoining organs including liver. HIFU liver ablation passing through the flooded lung could enable a direct intercostal beam path and thus improve dose deposition in liver. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of an ultrasound guided transthoracic, transpulmonary HIFU ablation of liver using OLF. Methods: After right-side lung flooding, ultrasound guided HIFU was applied transthoracic- transpulmonary into liver to create thermal lesions in three pigs. The HIFU beam was targeted five times into liver, two times at the liver surface and three times deeper into the tissue. During autopsy examinations of lung, diaphragm and liver located in the HIFU path were performed. The focal liver lesions and lung tissue out of the beam path were examined histologically. Results: Fifteen thermal liver lesions were generated by transpulmonary HIFU sonication in all targeted regions. The lesions appeared well-demarcated in grey color with a cigar-shaped configuration. The mean length and width of the superficial and deeper lesions were 15.8 mm (range: 13-18 mm) and 5.8 mm (range: 5-7 mm), and 10.9 mm (range: 9-13 mm) and 3.3 mm (range: 2-5 mm), respectively. Histopathological, all liver lesions revealed a homogeneous thermal necrosis lacking vitality. There were no signs of damage of the overlying diaphragm and lung tissue. Conclusions: Flooded lung is a suitable pathway for applying HIFU to the liver, thus enabling a transthoracic, transpulmonary approach. The enlarged acoustic window could enhance the ablation speed for targets in the hepatic dome.","Lesser, Thomas Günther; Boltze, Carsten; Schubert, Harald; Wolfram, Frank",International journal of medical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766022/,199

METHODS: The study included 162 children, aged between 3 and 13 years, waiting for adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, eventually combined with tympanocentesis or tube insertion. Parents have been called to answer a telephone interview aimed at detecting how the symptoms related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy were changing during lockdown. RESULTS: There was an improvement in the overall symptomatology of children during the lockdown period. The value attributed by parents to the children's general assessment during the lockdown period decreased significatively during the quarantine (p = 0,0000). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that lockdown can have a positive impact on those specific diseases derived from precocious socialization and that it results to be particularly effective for the most vulnerable children. Indeed, lockdown has resulted to be so efficient that it has caused a modification in a medical and surgical therapeutic indication.","Gelardi, M; Giancaspro, R; Fiore, V; Fortunato, F; Cassano, M",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,199

According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p < .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents' whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, Maryam Yvonne; Nicholson, Emma; Ogrodnik, Michelle; Fenesi, Barbara; Heisz, Jennifer J",PLoS One,,199

206827,Non-pharmaceutical Interventions and the Infodemic on Twitter: Lessons Learned from Italy during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Most states enacted shelter-in-place orders when mitigating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Emerging evidence indicates that these orders have reduced COVID-19 cases. Using data starting at different dates in March and going through May 15, 2020, we examined the effects of shelter-in-place orders on daily growth rates of both COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations, using event study models. We found that shelter-in-place orders reduced both the daily mortality growth rate nearly three weeks after their enactment and the daily growth rate of hospitalizations two weeks after their enactment. After forty-two days from enactment, the daily mortality growth rate declined by up to 6.1 percentage points. Projections suggest that as many as 250,000-370,000 deaths were possibly averted by May 15 in the forty-two states plus Washington, D.C., that had statewide shelter-in-place orders. The daily hospitalization growth rate examined in nineteen states with shelter-in-place orders and three states without them that had data on hospitalizations declined by up to 8.4 percentage points after forty-two days. This evidence suggests that shelter-in-place orders have been effective in reducing the daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations.","Lyu, Wei; Wehby, George L",Health Aff (Millwood),,199

207876,Simple mathematical models for controlling COVID-19 transmission through social distancing and community awareness,2021,"In the current study we used transthoracic echocardiography to measure stroke volume (SV), heart rate (f H), and cardiac output (CO) in adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), a male beluga calf (Delphinapterus leucas, body mass [M b] range: 151-175 kg), and an adult female false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens, estimated M b: 500-550 kg) housed in managed care. We also recorded continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) in the beluga, bottlenose dolphin, false killer whale, killer whale (Orcinus orca), and pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) to evaluate cardiorespiratory coupling while breathing spontaneously under voluntary control. The results show that cetaceans have a strong Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia (RSA), during which both f H and SV vary within the interbreath interval, making average values dependent on the breathing frequency (f R). The RSA-corrected f H was lower for all cetaceans compared to similarly sized terrestrial mammals breathing continuously. As compared with terrestrial mammals, the RSA-corrected SV and CO were either lower or the same for the dolphin and false killer whale, while both were elevated in the beluga. When plotting f R against f H for an inactive mammal, cetaceans had a greater cardiac response to changes in f R as compared with terrestrial mammals. We propose that these data indicate an important coupling between respiration and cardiac function that enhances gas exchange, and that this RSA is important to maximize gas exchange during surface intervals, similar to that reported in the elephant seal.","Fahlman, A; Miedler, S; Marti-Bonmati, L; Fernandez, D Ferrero; Caballero, P Muñoz; Arenarez, J; Rocho-Levine, J; Robeck, T; Blawas, A",J. exp. biol,,199

SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with epithelial cell and respiratory system proclivity. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening disease. Due to wide geographic impact affecting an extremely high proportion of the world population it was defined by the World Health Organization as a global public health pandemic. The infection is known to readily spread from person-to-person. This occurs through liquid droplets by cough, sneeze, hand-to-mouth-to-eye contact and through contaminated hard surfaces. Close human proximity accelerates SARS-CoV-2 spread. COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can move beyond the lungs by blood-based dissemination to affect multiple organs. These organs include the kidney, liver, muscles, nervous system, and spleen. The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 mortality is acute respiratory distress syndrome initiated by epithelial infection and alveolar macrophage activation in the lungs. The early cell-based portal for viral entry is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Viral origins are zoonotic with genomic linkages to the bat coronaviruses but without an identifiable intermediate animal reservoir. There are currently few therapeutic options, and while many are being tested, although none are effective in curtailing the death rates. There is no available vaccine yet. Intense global efforts have targeted research into a better understanding of the epidemiology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2. These fields of study will provide the insights directed to curtailing this disease outbreak with intense international impact.

209582,The compounded burden of being a black and disabled student during the age of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. METHODS: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1; 980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2; 685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). RESULTS: Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook); subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal); facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class); sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr); active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect); and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers. Adolescents' MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.","Parker, Kate; Uddin, Riaz; Ridgers, Nicola D; Brown, Helen; Veitch, Jenny; Salmon, Jo; Timperio, Anna; Sahlqvist, Shannon; Cassar, Samuel; Toffoletti, Kim; Maddison, Ralph; Arundell, Lauren",J Med Internet Res,,199

Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances relative reduction (RR) 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.","Ball, Simon; Banerjee, Amitava; Berry, Colin; Boyle, Jonathan R; Bray, Benjamin; Bradlow, William; Chaudhry, Afzal; Crawley, Rikki; Danesh, John; Denniston, Alastair; Falter, Florian; Figueroa, Jonine D; Hall, Christopher; Hemingway, Harry; Jefferson, Emily; Johnson, Tom; King, Graham; Lee, Kuan Ken; McKean, Paul; Mason, Suzanne; Mills, Nicholas L; Pearson, Ewen; Pirmohamed, Munir; Poon, Michael T C; Priedon, Rouven; Shah, Anoop; Sofat, Reecha; Sterne, Jonathan A C; Strachan, Fiona E; Sudlow, Cathie L M; Szarka, Zsolt; Whiteley, William; Wyatt, Michael",Heart,,199
209717,Human mobility restrictions and inter-provincial migration during the COVID-19 crisis in China,2020,"ABSTRACT Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and severity of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 treated at Sabará Hospital Infantil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, retrospective, and observational study. All cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-qPCR of patients seen at the hospital (emergency room, first-aid room, and ICU) were analyzed. The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus. Results: Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys (57%) was verified, and the median age was two years. A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU. Of the total, 26% had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma (13%). Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58% of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34%. Three children were asymptomatic, 81 (70%) had upper airway symptoms, 15 (13%) had mild pneumonia, and 16 (14%) had severe pneumonia. Hospitalized children were younger than non-hospitalized children (7 months vs. 36 months). In hospitalized patients, a higher frequency of irritability, dyspnea, drowsiness, respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and hepatomegaly was observed. Chest radiography was performed in 69 children with 45% of abnormal exams. No child required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths. Conclusions: Most of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 had mild upper airway symptoms. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were more severe among younger children who exhibited gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms more frequently.","Rabha, Anna Clara; Oliveira Junior, Francisco Ivanildo de; Oliveira, Thales Araújo de; Cesar, Regina Grigolli; Fongaro, Giuliana; Mariano, Roberta Ferreira; Camargo, Clarice Neves; Fernandes, Fátima Rodrigues; Wandalsen, Gustavo Falbo","Rev.

This accelerates inferring algorithmic structure in data for discovering causal generative models. The computation model is restricted in time and space resources to make it computable in approximating the target metrics. The quantum circuit design based on our earlier work that allows executing a superposition of automata is presented. As a use-case, an application framework for protein-protein interaction ontology based on algorithmic complexity is proposed. Using small-scale quantum computers, this has the potential to enhance the results of classical block decomposition method towards bridging the causal gap in entropy based methods.","Sarkar, Aritra; Bertels, Koen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08866v1.pdf,199

210912,A Brand Storytelling Approach to COVID-19â€™s Terrorealization: Cartographing the Emergent Hyperspace of a Global Pandemic,2020,"Background: To assess and limit the SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk from symptomless individuals in the hospital setting, molecular and serological screening of staff and patients attending a tertiary hospital in China was conducted. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested by quantitative RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were screened initially with two lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) and further confirmed with three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs). The assay performance was assessed using archived samples from 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 80 healthy individuals. Results: Between April 24 and May 8, 2020, 16,043 subjects (7,392 medical staff, 4,714 inpatients, 1,209 chaperones, 1,705 outpatients, and 1,023 fever clinic patients) were screened. No subject tested positive for viral RNA. Seventy-three (0.46%) tested positive for IgM or IgG on the initial LFI screening, of whom 63 were investigated with CLIAs: 2 (0.01%) were confirmed as seroreactive and 18 (0.11%) were indeterminate. Unconfirmed seroreactivity was significantly more frequent in fever clinic patients. The CLIAs showed similar (95.0-100%) IgM or IgG specificity but higher IgG sensitivity (93.75-96.88% vs. 31.25-81.25%) than the LFIs. The confirmed seropositive cases included a previously discharged COVID-19 patient and an undiagnosed symptomless patient showing detectable IgM and IgG over 35 days of follow-up. No transmission was evidenced within the corresponding family cluster. Conclusions: Low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and limited exposure risk were observed. Seroprevalence varied between 0.012% and 0.12% according to the testing algorithm and the confirmation criteria used, indicating that quality standards for serological tests are needed. Protective immunity in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who recovered needs to be investigated further, but the associated risk of transmission appeared limited.","Huang, J.; Zhang, L.; Wu, S.; Lu, J.; Li, F.; Cheng, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Li, G.; Yu, H.; Le, Z.; He, X.; Ding, Y.; Candotti, D.; Xie, X.; Zhang, J.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,199
210949,Covid-19 and net zero for health,2020,"T cells play a vital role in combatting SARS-CoV-2 and in forming long-term memory responses. Whereas extensive structural information is available on neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, such information on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) bound to their peptide-MHC targets is lacking. We determined structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ). The structures revealed the basis for selection of particular TRAV and TRBV germline genes by the public but not the private TCR, and for the ability of both TCRs to recognize natural variants of YLQ and RLQ but not homologous epitopes from human seasonal coronaviruses. By elucidating the mechanism for TCR recognition of an immunodominant yet variable epitope (YLQ) and a conserved but less commonly targeted epitope (RLQ), this study can inform prospective efforts to design vaccines to elicit pan-coronavirus immunity.","Wu, Daichao; Kolesnikov, Alexander; Yin, Rui; Guest, Johnathan D; Gowthaman, Ragul; Shmelev, Anton; Serdyuk, Yana; Efimov, Grigory A; Pierce, Brian G; Mariuzza, Roy A",,,199

The 10-week period of government-imposed social isolation (23 March–31 May 2020) was compared with the same period in 2018, 2019 and a 10-week period prior to social isolation (6 January–15 March 2020). Incidence rate ratios were calculated. Symptom to balloon time was also compared for those requiring catheterisation laboratory activation for STEMI.ResultsThe incidence of COVID-19 in the health district was 0.14 per 100 000 per day during the isolation period. There was a significant reduction in cardiology hospitalisations, NSTEMI and STEMI presentations without changes in OOHCA or symptom to balloon time for STEMI.ConclusionsWe observed a significant decline in cardiology presentations during social isolation without widespread COVID-19 disease.

Current treatments are palliative, and treatments improving lymphedema are lacking. Preclinical studies have suggested that adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) can alleviate lymphedema. We, therefore, aimed to assess whether ADRCs can alleviate lymphedema in clinical reality with long-term follow-up. We treated 10 patients with BCRL using ADRCs and a scar-releasing lipotransfer to the axillary region, and all patients were followed 1, 3, 6, 12, and 48 months after treatment. The primary endpoint was change in arm volume. Secondary endpoints were safety, change in lymphedema symptoms, quality of life, lymphedema-associated cellulitis, and conservative treatment use. There was no significant decrease in BCRL volume after treatment. However, self-reported upper extremity disability and arm heaviness and tension improved. Six patients reduced their use of conservative BCRL treatment. Five patients felt that their BCRL had improved substantially, and four of these would redo the treatment. We did not observe any cases of locoregional breast cancer recurrence. In this phase I study with 4 years of follow-up, axillary delivered ADRCs and lipotransfer were safe and feasible and improved BCRL symptoms and upper extremity function. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this study.","Jørgensen, Mads Gustaf; Toyserkani, Navid Mohamadpour; Jensen, Charlotte Harken; Andersen, Ditte Caroline; Sheikh, Søren Paludan; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",Stem cells transl. med.

214053,Can a COVID-19 vaccine live up to Americans' expectations? A conjoint analysis of how vaccine characteristics influence vaccination intentions,2021,"Resolving conformational heterogeneity of multiple protein states that coexist in solution remains one of the main obstacles in the characterization of protein therapeutics and the determination of the conformational transition pathways critical for biological functions, ranging from molecular recognition to enzymatic catalysis. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) reaction coupled with top-down mass spectrometric (MS) analysis provides a means to characterize protein higher-order structures and dynamics in a conformer-specific manner. The conformational resolving power of this technique is highly dependent on the efficiencies of separating protein states at the intact protein level and minimizing the residual non-deuterated protic content during the HDX reactions. Here we describe a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based variant of the HDX MS approach that aims to improve the conformational resolution. In this approach, proteins undergo HDX reactions while migrating through a deuterated background electrolyte solution (BGE) during the capillary electrophoretic separation. Different protein states or proteoforms that coexist in solution can be efficiently separated based on their differing charge-to-size ratios. The difference in electrophoretic mobility between proteins and protic solvent molecules minimizes the residual non-deuterated solvent, resulting in a nearly complete deuterating environment during the HDX process. The flow-through microvial CE-MS interface allows efficient electrospray ionization of the eluted protein species following a rapid mixing with the quenching and denaturing modifier solution at the outlet of the sprayer. The online top-down MS analysis measures the global deuteration level of the eluted intact protein species, and subsequently, the deuteration of their gas-phase fragments. This paper demonstrates this approach in differential HDX for systems, including the natural protein variants coexisting in milk.","Chaihu, Lingxiao; Yao, Xiaopeng; Xu, Xiang; Zhu, Zhongqin; Chen, David D Y; Wang, Guanbo",J. vis. exp,,199

Methods: Based on refined management theory, we professionally developed the standards for prevention and control of COVID-19 in non-isolated areas, systematically implemented various prevention and control measures, performed gridding audit, effectively communicated among teams and between doctors and patients assisted by information techniques, and reported results for quality improvement. Results: There was no hospital acquired COVID-19 infections among staff in the hospital. The rates of mask wearing, epidemiological history screening and the medical supplies disinfection were all 100% in the hospital. The accuracy rate of mask wearing of patients and their families was 73.79% and the compliance of their hand hygiene was 40.78%. Conclusion: Refined management strategies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in non-isolated areas of the general hospital are effective. The accuracy rate of mask wearing and hand hygiene compliance of patients and their families need to be further improved.","Xu, Caijuan; Jin, Jingfen; Song, Jianping; Yang, Yan; Yao, Meiqi; Zhang, Yuping; Zao, Ruiyi; Chen, Zhimei",,,199
214970,Analyzing the Cost Effectiveness of Policy Responses for COVID-19: The Importance of Capturing Social Consequences,2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has substantial morbidity and mortality. We studied whether hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases experienced worse outcomes compared to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without chronic inflammatory diseases. METHODS: Danish nationwide registers were used to establish a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy (SpA), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (exposed), and a control cohort without these diseases (unexposed) between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. We compared median length of hospital stay, used median regression models to estimate crude and adjusted differences. When estimating crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death, 14-day and 30-day mortality, we used logistic regression models. RESULTS: We identified 132 patients with COVID-19 and IBD, RA, SpA, or PsA, and 2811 unexposed admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There were no differences between exposed and unexposed regarding length of hospital stay (6.8 days vs. 5.5 days), need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs. 9.4%), or CPAP (11.4% vs. 8.8%). Adjusted OR for in-hospital death was 0.71 (95% CI 0.42-1.22), death after 14-days 0.70 (95% CI 0.42-1.16), and death after 30-days 0.68 (95% CI 0.41-1.13). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases did not have statistically significant increased length of hospital stay, had same need for mechanical ventilation, and CPAP. Mortality was similar in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases, compared to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and no chronic inflammatory diseases.","Kjeldsen, Jens; Nielsen, Jan; Ellingsen, Torkell; Knudsen, Torben; Nielsen, Rasmus Gaardskær; Larsen, Michael Due; Lund, Ken; Nørgård, Bente Mertz",J Autoimmun,,199

215522,An age and space structured SIR model describing the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China and other overseas areas, which has aroused widespread concern. The sharp increase in the number of patients has led to great psychological pressure on health care workers. The purpose of this study was to understand their mental health status and needs, so as to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the psychological pressure of health care workers. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 540 health care workers were randomly selected from two designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Anhui Province. The basic situation, perceived social support, depression level, loneliness and COVID-19 related knowledge were collected and analyzed by questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 511 valid questionnaires were finally retrieved. There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: People in isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were at the level of mild to moderate depression. Female was higher than male; nurse was higher than doctor; middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles; junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above; isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions (p < 0.05). Loneliness scores: Doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of other medical departments (p < 0.05). Social support: Doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of other departments (p < 0.05). The score of social support was negatively correlated with depression and loneliness (p < 0.001), while depression was positively correlated with loneliness (p < 0.001). Health care workers most want to receive one-to-one psychological counseling (29.75%), and provide crisis management (24.07%). The awareness rate of health care workers on COVID-19's knowledge was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological problems of health care workers, especially women, nurses with low educational background, low professional title, and staff in the epidemic prevention and control positions are relatively serious.","Fang, Xue-Hui; Wu, Li; Lu, Lun-Shan; Kan, Xiao-Hong; Wang, Hua; Xiong, Yan-Jun; Ma, Dong-Chun; Wu, Guo-Cui",BMC Psychiatry,,199

Based on biosynthetic considerations 148 derivatives are grouped together into three skeletal types representing 77 cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, 61 cyclopenta[bc]benzopyrans, and 10 benzo[b]oxepines. Apart from different hydroxy, methoxy, and methylenedioxy groups of the aromatic rings, important structural variation is created by different substitutions and stereochemistries of the central cyclopentane ring. Putrescine-derived bisamides constitute important building blocks occurring as cyclic 2-aminopyrrolidines or in an open-chained form, and are involved in the formation of pyrimidinone flavaglines. Regarding the central role of cinnamic acid in the formation of the basic skeleton, rocagloic acid represents a biosynthetic precursor from which aglafoline- and rocaglamide-type cyclopentabenzofurans can be derived, while those of the rocaglaol-type are the result of decarboxylation. Broad-based comparison revealed characteristic substitution trends which contribute as chemical markers to natural delimitation and grouping of taxonomically problematic Aglaia species. A wide variety of biological activities ranges from insecticidal, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and anti-inflammatory properties, especially to pronounced anticancer and antiviral activities. The high insecticidal activity of flavaglines is comparable with that of the well-known natural insecticide azadirachtin. Comparative feeding experiments informed about structure-activity relationships and exhibited different substitutions of the cyclopentane ring essential for insecticidal activity. Parallel studies on the antiproliferative activity of flavaglines in various tumor cell lines revealed similar structural prerequisites that let expect corresponding molecular mechanisms. An important structural modification with very high cytotoxic potency was found in the benzofuran silvestrol characterized by an unusual dioxanyloxy subunit. It possessed comparable cytotoxicity to that of the natural anticancer compounds paclitaxel (Taxol®) and camptothecin without effecting normal cells. The primary effect was the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4A, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase. Flavaglines were also shown to bind to prohibitins (PHB) responsible for regulation of important signaling pathways, and to inhibit the transcriptional factor HSF1 deeply involved in metabolic programming, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells. Flavaglines were shown to be not only promising anticancer agents but gained now also high expectations as agents against emerging RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the helicase eIF4A with flavaglines was recently described as pan-viral strategy for minimizing the impact of future RNA virus pandemics.","Greger, Harald",Phytochem Rev,,199

Wherever possible, primary data collection, active surveillance, and linkage with existing population-based cohorts should be leveraged to supplement secondary data sources and passive surveillance systems.

216778,[Theory and practice of aging upon COVID-19 pandemic.],2020,"BACKGROUND: Automated segmentation of anatomical structures is a crucial step in image analysis. For lung segmentation in computed tomography, a variety of approaches exists, involving sophisticated pipelines trained and validated on different datasets. However, the clinical applicability of these approaches across diseases remains limited. METHODS: We compared four generic deep learning approaches trained on various datasets and two readily available lung segmentation algorithms. We performed evaluation on routine imaging data with more than six different disease patterns and three published data sets. RESULTS: Using different deep learning approaches, mean Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) on test datasets varied not over 0.02. When trained on a diverse routine dataset (n = 36), a standard approach (U-net) yields a higher DSC (0.97 ± 0.05) compared to training on public datasets such as the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (0.94 ± 0.13, p = 0.024) or Anatomy 3 (0.92 ± 0.15, p = 0.001). Trained on routine data (n = 231) covering multiple diseases, U-net compared to reference methods yields a DSC of 0.98 ± 0.03 versus 0.94 ± 0.12 (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy and reliability of lung segmentation algorithms on demanding cases primarily relies on the diversity of the training data, highlighting the importance of data diversity compared to model choice. Efforts in developing new datasets and providing trained models to the public are critical. By releasing the trained model under General Public License 3.0, we aim to foster research on lung diseases by providing a readily available tool for segmentation of pathological lungs.","Hofmanninger, Johannes; Prayer, Forian; Pan, Jeanny; Röhrich, Sebastian; Prosch, Helmut; Langs, Georg",Eur Radiol Exp,,199

The nationwide lockdown measures in 2020 were performed to against the COVID-19 outbreak, which could provide an important opportunity to understand their variations on light absorption, concentrations, sources and formation mechanism of carbonaceous aerosols. The BC concentration in Wuhan megacity (WH) was 1.9 μg m-3 during lockdown, which was 24% lower than those in the medium-sized cities and 26% higher than those in small city;in addition, 39% and 16-23% reductions occurred compared with the same periods in 2019 in WH and other cities, respectively. Fossil fuels from vehicles and industries were the major contributors to BC;and compared with other periods, minimum contribution (64-86%) mainly from fossil fuel to BC occurred during the lockdown in all cities. Secondary BrC (BrCsec) played a major role in the BrC light absorption, accounting for 65-77% in WH during different periods. BrCsec was promoted under high humidity, and decreased through the photobleaching of chromophores under higher Ox. Generally, the lockdown measures reduced the BC concentrations significantly;however, the variation of BrCsec was slight.","Wang, Qinglu Wang Lili Tao Minghui Chen Nan Lei Yali Sun Yang Xin Jinyuan Li Tingting Zhou Jingxiang Liu Jingda Ji Dongsheng Wang Yuesi",Science of The Total Environment,,199

Fortification of food staples with vitamin D provides a solution to alleviate this problem. This research explored the use of pea protein nanoemulsion (PPN) to improve the stability of vitamin D in various food products. PPN was created using a pH-shifting and ultrasonication combined method. The physicochemical properties were studied, including particle size, foaming ability, water holding capacity, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic contents. The fortification of several food formulations (non-fat cow milk, canned orange juice, orange juice powder, banana milk, and infant formula) with vitamin D-PPN was investigated and compared to raw untreated pea protein (UPP) regarding their color, viscosity, moisture content, chemical composition, vitamin D stability, antioxidant activity, and morphology. Finally, a sensory evaluation (quantitative descriptive analysis, and consumer testing) was conducted. The results show that PPN with a size of 21.8 nm protected the vitamin D in all tested products. PPN may serve as a potential carrier and stabilizer of vitamin D in food products with minimum effects on the taste and color. Hence, PPN may serve as a green and safe method for food fortification during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akkam, Yazan; Rababah, Taha; Costa, Rui; Almajwal, Ali; Feng, Hao; Laborde, Juan E Andrade; Abulmeaty, Mahmoud M; Razak, Suhail",,,199
217670,Leveraging GIS and spatial analysis for informed decision-making in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Early assessments of the growth rate of COVID-19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but as cases were recorded in multiple countries, more robust inferences could be made. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we estimated that, when unconstrained, European COVID-19 confirmed cases doubled on average every 3 days (range 2.2-4.3 days) and Italian hospital and intensive care unit admissions every 2-3 days; values that are significantly lower than the 5-7 days dominating the early published literature. Furthermore, we showed that the impact of physical distancing interventions was typically not seen until at least 9 days after implementation, during which time confirmed cases could grow eightfold. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0 for initiating interventions, and that the combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' outbreak response better than large values of R0 alone. One year on from first reporting these results, reproduction numbers continue to dominate the media and public discourse, but robust estimates of unconstrained growth remain essential for planning worst-case scenarios, and detection delays are still key in informing the relaxation and re-implementation of interventions.

218126,Nurse Staffing and Coronavirus Infections in California Nursing Homes,2020,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with activation of coagulation that mainly presents as thrombosis. Sepsis is also associated with activation of coagulation that mainly presents as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Many studies have reported increased levels of plasma D-dimer in patients with COVID-19 that is associated with severity, thrombosis, and mortality. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare levels of circulating extracellular vesicle tissue factor (EVTF) activity and active plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in plasma from patients with COVID-19 or sepsis. Methods We measured levels of D-dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI-1 in plasma samples from patients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], N = 15;and non-ICU, N = 20) and patients with sepsis (N = 35). Results Patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of D-dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI-1 compared with healthy controls. Patients with sepsis had significantly higher levels of D-dimer and EVTF activity compared with healthy controls. Levels of D-dimer were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Levels of EVTF activity were significantly higher in ICU patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Levels of active PAI-1 were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Conclusions High levels of both EVTF activity and active PAI-1 may promote thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 due to simultaneous activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis. The high levels of active PAI-1 in patients with COVID-19 may limit plasmin degradation of crosslinked fibrin and the release of D-dimer. This may explain the lower levels of D-dimer in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis.","Campbell, Robert A.; Hisada, Yohei Denorme Frederik Grover Steven P.; Bouck, Emma G.; Middleton, Elizabeth A.; Wolberg, Alisa S.; Rondina, Matthew T.; Mackman, Nigel",Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,,199

Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.","Atehortua, Nelson A; Patino, Stella",Health promot. internation,,199

While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD).

A meta-analysis to evaluate mortality in patients with PPFs managed during the current COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies were conducted with a search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases using appropriate keywords from January 01, 2020 to January 29, 2021. Results: 35 relevant studies reporting 3979 patients with hip fracture in the current ongoing pandemic, out of which 692 patients were COVID -19 positive. Twenty studies reported mortality and other relevant statistics on hip fracture patients with and without COVID 19 (4123 hip fracture patients in the year 2020-21, out of which 560 had or were suspected of having COVID -19). A meta-analysis of mortality statistics in patients with and without COVID revealed increased odds of mortality among COVID patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.09, 7.83] and meta-analysis on the subgroup of surgically treated patients also showed markedly increased mortality risk among those with COVID-19 (OR) 5.99, 95% CI [3.88,9.24]. Conclusion: The mortality risk is markedly increased in hip fracture with concomitant COVID -19 compared to those without it. This increased risk persisted in those managed surgically. It could be due to the inflammation induced by the fracture or surgery for fracture fixation, further exacerbating inflammation, leading to cytokine storm. It is imperative that such patients are informed regarding increased mortality risk during the consent and shared decision-making process.","Patralekh, Mohit Kumar; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Iyengar, Karthikeyan P; Upadhyaya, Gaurav Kumar; Vaishya, Raju",,,199

DESIGN: A prospective cohort (N = 1,044) of people recruited online, purposively targeting vulnerable populations. METHODS: After a baseline survey (April 2020), participants completed 3 months of daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Dietary, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vaping and substance use behaviours collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with daily EMA surveys over the first 30 days during early lockdown. Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, participants ate almost one portion of fruit and vegetables less per day (vegetables mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.40, -0.25; fruit -0.57, 95% CI -0.64, -0.50), but showed no change in high sugar portions per day (-0.03, 95% CI -0.12, 0.06). Participants spent half a day less per week doing &#8805;30 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (-0.57, 95% CI -0.73, -0.40) but slightly increased days of strength training (0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.34), increased alcohol intake (AUDIT-C score change 0.25, 95% CI 0.13, 0.37), though did not change smoking, vaping or substance use behaviour. Worsening health behaviour change was associated with being younger, female and higher body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The cohort reported worsening health behaviours during early lockdown. Longer term changes will be investigated using further waves of data collection.","Naughton, Felix; Ward, Emma; Khondoker, Mizanur; Belderson, Pippa; Marie Minihane, Anne; Dainty, Jack; Hanson, Sarah; Holland, Richard; Brown, Tracey; Notley, Caitlin",Br. j. health psychol,,199

The study used a six-step approach to determine health risk estimates. For this, consumption of pharmaceuticals under normal circumstances and in Covid-19 infection was compiled to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in river water and in fishes. Risk estimates of pharmaceutical drugs were evaluated for adults as they are most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. Acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) are estimated using the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) or no observable effect level (NOEL) values in rats. The estimated ADI values are then used to calculate predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for three different exposure routes (i) through the accidental ingestion of contaminated surface water during recreational activities only, (ii) through fish consumption only, and (iii) through combined accidental ingestion of contaminated surface water during recreational activities and fish consumption. Higher risk values (hazard quotient, HQ: 337.68, maximum; 11.83, minimum) were obtained for the combined ingestion of contaminated water during recreational activities and fish consumption exposure under the assumptions used in this study indicating possible effects to human health. Amongst the pharmaceutical drugs, ritonavir emerged as main drug, and is expected to pose adverse effects on r human health through fish consumption. Mixture toxicity analysis showed major risk effects of exposure of pharmaceutical drugs (interaction-based hazard index, HIint: from 295.42 (for lopinavir + ritonavir) to 1.20 for chloroquine + rapamycin) demonstrating possible risks due to the co-existence of pharmaceutical in water. The presence of background contaminants in contaminated water does not show any influence on the observed risk estimates as indicated by low HQadd values (<1). Regular monitoring of pharmaceutical drugs in aquatic environment needs to be carried out to reduce the adverse effects of pharmaceutical drugs on human health.","Kumari, Minashree; Kumar, Arun",Sci Total Environ,,199

223571,Who's First Wins? International Crisis Response to Covid-19,2020,"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 as pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 present mainly with respiratory symptoms. Prone position has been traditionally used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve oxygenation and prevent barotrauma in ventilated patients. Awake proning is being used as an investigational therapy in COVID to defer invasive ventilation, improve oxygenation, and outcomes. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case study to look for benefits of awake proning with oxygen therapy in non-intubated COVID patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective case study of 15 COVID patients admitted from June 15 to July 1, 2020 to HDU in our hospital was conducted. Cooperative patients who were hemodynamically stable and SpO2 < 90% on presentation were included. Oxygen was administered through facemask, non-rebreathing mask and noninvasive ventilation to patients as per requirement. Patients were encouraged to maintain prone position and target time was 10-12 hours/day. SpO2 and P/f ratio in supine and prone position was observed till discharge. Primary target was SpO2 > 95% and P/f > 200 mm Hg. Other COVID therapies were used according to institutional protocol. Results: The mean SpO2 on room air on admission was 80%. In day 1 to 3, the mean P/f ratio in supine position was 98.8 ± 29.7 mm Hg which improved to 136.6 ± 38.8 mm Hg after proning (p = 0.005). The difference was significant from day 1 to 10. Two patients were intubated. The mean duration of stay was 11 days. Conclusion: Awake prone positioning showed marked improvement in P/f ratio and SpO2 in COVID-19 patients with improvement in clinical symptoms with reduced rate of intubation. Highlights: Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation by reducing V/Q mismatch.Awake prone positioning has been used along with high-flow oxygen therapy in recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus for management of mild to moderate cases.

223686,Experienced Nurses in North Carolina Recruited to Combat COVID-19,2021,"We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of manual contact tracing compared to bulletin board contact tracing. Classical contact tracing relies on reaching individuals who have been in proximity to an infectious person. A bulletin board approach focuses on identifying locations visited by an infectious person, and then contacting those who were at those locations. We present results comparing their effects on the overall reproductive number as well as the incidence and prevalence of disease. We evaluate them by building a new agent based simulation (ABS) model using the Susceptible Exposed Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) framework for disease spread. We conduct simulation experiments to quantify the effectiveness of these two models of contact tracing by calibrating the model to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2. We find that bulletin board contact tracing gives comparable results in terms of the reproductive number, duration, prevalence and incidence but is less resource intensive, easier to implement and offers a wider range of privacy options. Our experiments show that location-based bulletin board contact tracing can improve manual contact tracing.","Pokharel, Atul; Soulé, Robert; Silberschatz, Avi",Health Care Manag Sci,,199

However, before implementation further clinical evaluation of test sensitivity is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To examine the performance of Abbott's Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a low to medium prevalence setting in Norway. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study comparing the results of the Panbio RAT with PCR in 4857 parallel samples collected at a SARS-CoV-2 test station in Oslo, and from COVID-19 outbreaks in six Norwegian municipalities. RESULTS: A total of 4857 cases were included in the study; 3991 and 866 cases from the test station and the outbreak municipalities, respectively. The prevalence at the test station in Oslo was 6.3 %, and the overall sensitivity of the RAT was 74 %. Increased sensitivity was observed in patients who experienced symptoms (79 %) and when considering samples with viral loads above estimated level of infectivity (84 %), while it was lower in asymptomatic persons (55 %). In the outbreak municipalities, the overall prevalence was 6.9 %, and the total sensitivity of the RAT was 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the test correctly identified most infectious individuals. Nevertheless, the sensitivity is considerably lower than for PCR, and it is important that the limitations of the test are kept in mind in the follow-up of tested individuals.","Landaas, Elisabeth Toverud; Storm, Margrethe Larsdatter; Tollånes, Mette Christophersen; Barlinn, Regine; Kran, Anne-Marte Bakken; Bragstad, Karoline; Christensen, Andreas; Andreassen, Trude",J Clin Virol,,199
226017,Not yet time for a public inquiry into UK's response to covid-19,2020,"Data sources Experimental investigation.Study design A retrospective review to evaluate the use of a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce cross-infection through aerosol. The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team.Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.","Ali, Kamran; Raja, Mahwish",Evid Based Dent,,199

Cardiac dysfunction is commonly seen in these patients, often presenting as clinical heart failure. Accordingly, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on COVID-19 myocarditis and its long-term heart failure sequelae. RECENT FINDINGS: Several suspected cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported. It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies.

229357,The Social Media “Magic”: Virtually Engaging Visitors during COVID-19 Temporary Closures,2021,"The aim of this study was to analyze the association between physical activity and eating habits during the COVID-19 pandemic among Brazilian adults. A sample of 1,929 participants answered an online survey, however 1,874 were included in the analysis. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits was assessed inquiring about participants' intake of fruits, vegetables, fried foods, and sweets during the pandemic. Physical activity was assessed by asking participants about their weekly frequency, intensity and number of minutes/hours engaging in structured physical activities per week. Participants were then stratified into categories based on moderate-to-vigorous intensity (0-30;31-90;91-150;151-300;and &gt;300 min/week) and into active (&gt;=150 min) or inactive (&lt;150 min). Increased sweets consumption was the most commonly reported change to eating habits (42.5%), followed by an increase in the consumption of vegetables (26.6%), fruits (25.9%), and fried foods (17.9%). Physical activity practice was related to lower consumption of fried foods (OR = 0.60;p &lt; 0.001) and sweets (OR = 0.53;p &lt; 0.001). A cluster analysis revealed subjects with higher the level of physical activity was more likely to follow a healthy diet (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, physical activity was positively associated with healthier eating habits.

229437,New climate change activism: before and after the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The present Italian multicenter study aimed at investigating whether the course of primary headache disorders in children and adolescents was changed during the lockdown necessary to contain the COVID-19 emergency in Italy. METHODS: During the lockdown, we submitted an online questionnaire to patients already diagnosed with primary headache disorders. Questions explored the course of headache, daily habits, psychological factors related to COVID-19, general mood and school stress. Answers were transformed into data for statistical analysis. Through a bivariate analysis, the main variables affecting the subjective trend of headache, and intensity and frequency of the attacks were selected. The significant variables were then used for the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We collected the answers of 707 patients. In the multivariate analysis, we found that reduction of school effort and anxiety was the main factor explaining the improvement in the subjective trend of headache and the intensity and frequency of the attacks (p < 0.001). The greater the severity of headache, the larger was the clinical improvement (p < 0.001). Disease duration was negatively associated with the improvement (p < 0.001). It is noteworthy that clinical improvement was independent of prophylaxis (p > 0.05), presence of chronic headache disorders (p > 0.05) and geographical area (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that lifestyle modification represents the main factor impacting the course of primary headache disorders in children and adolescents. In particular, reduction in school-related stress during the lockdown was the main factor explaining the general headache improvement in our population.","Papetti, Laura; Loro, Pierfrancesco Alaimo Di; Tarantino, Samuela; Grazzi, Licia; Guidetti, Vincenzo; Parisi, Pasquale; Raieli, Vincenzo; Sciruicchio, Vittorio; Termine, Cristiano; Toldo, Irene; Tozzi, Elisabetta; Verdecchia, Paola; Carotenuto, Marco; Battisti, Matteo; Celi, Angela; D039,; Agnano, Daniela; Faedda, Noemi; Ferilli, Michela An; Grillo, Giovanni; Natalucci, Giulia; Onofri, Agnese; Pelizza, Maria Federica; Ursitti, Fabiana; Vasta, Michelangelo; Velardi, Margherita; Balestri, Martina; Moavero, Romina; Vigevano, Federico; Valeriani, Massimiliano",Cephalalgia,,199

229995,Risk Communication Should be Explicit About Values. A Perspective on Early Communication During COVID-19,2020,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and outcome of ethanol sclerotherapy for uterine myomata. This is a series of 20 patients (aged 20 to 40 years) with symptomatic uterine myomata submitted to ethanol sclerotherapy. The procedure was performed under sedation and guided by transvaginal ultrasound. The patients were followed clinically and ultrasonically (transvaginal sonography and color Doppler evaluation) one month and six months after treatment. The frequency of symptoms, intratumoral color flow mapping and tumoral size were analyzed. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used at a 5% level of significance. Postprocedure complications were not observed. A significant relief of dysmenorrhea was observed with one and six months and the frequency of pelvic pain and menorrhagia was significantly reduced with six months. A significant reduction of tumoral size was observed, from 89,4 cm3 (inicial volume) to 73,5 cm3 e 69,9 cm3 (one and six months, respectively). The frequency of intratumoral high blood flow was 80% before and 15% and 20% one and six months after the procedure (p=0,0001). It can be concluded that these preliminary results indicate that transvaginal ultrasound-guided ethanol sclerotherapy can be an effective treatment for uterine myomas when conservative management is preferable. Patient satisfaction was high and the procedure might become an accepted option for the treatment of uterine myomata.","Ávila, Lucilo; Ávila, Mirela; Gurgel, Fernando; Amorim, Melania",Acta cir. bras.,,199

231849,The pandemic that widens inequalities: Covid-19 and the education system in Quebec/Canada,2020,"Background: Infant and child feeding practices are a prevalent challenge in Haryana. Objectives: The present study aimed to determine factors associated with non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and no continued breastfeeding in Haryana. Methods: National Family Health Survey-4 data for the state of Haryana was used for analysis. The outcomes were non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no EBF, and no continued breastfeeding. Independent variables were categorized as sociodemographic, maternal, and child level factors. Each category of factors was added step-by-step to the logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. Results: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was higher among poorer wealth quintiles. Home deliveries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.27-2.84), cesarean section (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI-1.46-3.40), body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI-1.13-2.33), and not receiving postnatal check-up (AOR 1.36, 95% CI-1.40-1.78) increases likelihood of delayed initiation of breastfeeding beyond 1 h of birth. Increased risk of non-EBF was associated with no postnatal check-ups and BMI >25 kg/m2. Risk of discontinuation of breastfeeding was significantly high with birth interval of <2 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI-1.08-2.14) and if babies did not receive postnatal check-up (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI-1.04-2.27). Conclusion: The study highlighted need for focused approach to counsel overweight/obese mothers, cesarean section, and home delivered mothers. Community awareness, adequate birth spacing, and postnatal visits are vital for improving exclusive and continued breastfeeding practices. Communities and health-care providers should provide adequate support to mothers for breastfeeding during the antenatal and postnatal periods.","Sharma, Jyoti; Pandey, Shivam; Negandhi, Preeti",Indian J Public Health,,199

After its inception, the virus proliferated rapidly, which led to the cause of millions of deaths, and having a detrimental effect on physical health, social lives, economic uncertainty, and mental health of people. The World Health Organization has reported that there are 111 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.45 million deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide. Indisputably, the present pandemic has contributed to the extensive psychological and environmental distress together with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), domestic violence, and unemployment. Due to the ambiguous nature of the pandemic, educational organizations, and outdoor activities are closed, thus burdening the mental health of younger populations. Children as well as youths are more glued to the Internet for their studies, online gaming, shopping, watching movies, and searching health-related information. Despite the advantages of using the Internet, it has some severe consequences too. Some people are repeatedly searching for physical and mental well-being related information without verifying credible sources, which, in turn, causes distress and anxiety. In such situations, individuals may end up contributing to an illness known as cyberchondria. In this paper, we have tried to highlight the problematic use of Internet for health-related searches and have outlined the management of such illness. We suggest two strategies: firstly, to reduce repeated online searches of health information and, secondly, to manage anxiety-augmenting thoughts that are triggered due to the maladaptive thoughts caused by the abstruse information.","Varma, R.; Das, S.; Singh, T.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,199

To reduce large-scale infection and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, a simple, rapid, and sensitive serological diagnostic method is urgently needed. Herein, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) nanoparticle (AIE&lt;sub&gt;810&lt;/sub&gt;NP, lambda&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; = 810 nm)-labeled lateral flow immunoassay was designed for early detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical serum samples. Using a near-infrared (NIR) AIE nanoparticle as the fluorescent reporter (lambda = 145 nm), the autofluorescence from the nitrocellulose membrane and biosample and the excitation background noise were effectively eliminated. After optimization, the limit of detection of IgM and IgG is 0.236 and 0.125 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, commensurate with that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (0.040 and 0.039 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). The sensitivity of the proposed AIE&lt;sub&gt;810&lt;/sub&gt;NP-based test strip for detecting IgM and IgG is 78 and 95% (172 serum samples), commensurate with that of ELISA (85 and 95%) and better than that of a commercial colloidal gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based test strip (41 and 85%). Importantly, the time of detecting IgM or IgG with an AIE&lt;sub&gt;810&lt;/sub&gt;NP-based test strip in sequential clinical samples is 1-7 days after symptom onset, which is significantly earlier than that with a AuNP-based test strip (8-15 days). Therefore, the NIR-emissive AIE nanoparticle-labeled lateral flow immunoassay holds great potential for early detection of IgM and IgG in a seroconversion window period.","Chen, R.; Ren, C.; Liu, M.; Ge, X.; Qu, M.; Zhou, X.; Liang, M.; Liu, Y.; Li, F.",Acs Nano,,199

234219,Analysis coronavirus disease (COVID-19) model using numerical approaches and logistic model,2020,"In 2020, the world's food crisis and health industry ushered into a real outbreak. On one side, there were natural disasters such as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), desert locusts, floods, and droughts exacerbating the world food crisis, while on the other side, the social development and changes in lifestyles prompted the health industry to gradually shift from a traditional medical model to a new pattern of prevention, treatment, and nourishment. Therefore, this article reviews animal by-products collagen and derived peptide, as important components of innovative sustainable food systems. The review also considered the preparation, identification, and characterization of animal by-product collagen and collagen peptides as well as their impacts on the food system (including food processing, packaging, preservation, and functional foods). Finally, the application and research progress of animal by-product collagen and peptide in the food system along with the future development trend were discussed. This knowledge would be of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of animal by-product collagen and collagen peptides and would encourage the use of collagen in food processing, preservation, and functional foods.","Cao, Changwei; Xiao, Zhichao; Ge, Changrong; Wu, Yinglong",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,,199
234276,COVID-19 And ST3 National Selection in Surgery: What Happens to Core Surgical Trainees When We Remove the Face-to-Face Interview?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at an increased risk for CDI. A recent study showed an overall improvement in mortality amongst hospitalized individuals with CDI, but it is unclear if this benefit extends to SOT recipients. METHODS: We scrutinized the 2015 and 2016 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States for CDI data in patients with SOT. SOT was defined as any recipient who had received a heart, lung, liver, intestinal, kidney, pancreas, or combined thoracic and/or abdominal organ transplantation. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection were adjusted for in our analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay and total hospital charges. RESULTS: A total of 105,780 hospital discharges of SOT recipients were included. The incidence of CDI was 3,554 (3.36%) among SOTs. CDI was associated with a higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.56-2.20, p<0.01), longer length of hospital stay (mean difference 5.07 days, 95%CI 4.43-5.71, p<0.01) and higher total hospital charges (mean difference 43,958 US dollars, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study found that CDI is associated with poorer overall outcomes among hospitalized SOT recipients. However, there was a possible improving trend of the outcomes when compare to previous studies.","Mahatanan, Rattanaporn; Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Charoenpong, Prangthip; Ferrey, Antoney",Transpl Infect Dis,,199

This study investigated the variations in chemical compositions, source contributions, and regional transport of fine particles (PM2.5) during January 23-February 22 of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 72.9 µg m-3 (2019) to 45.9 µg m-3 (2020), by 27.0 µg m-3. It was predominantly contributed by the emission reduction (92.0%), retrieved from a random forest tree approach. The main chemical species of PM2.5 all decreased with the reductions ranging from 0.85 µg m-3 (chloride) to 9.86 µg m-3 (nitrate) (p < 0.01). Positive matrix factorization model indicated that the mass contributions of seven PM2.5 sources all decreased. However, their contribution percentages varied from -11.0% (industrial processes) to 8.70% (secondary inorganic aerosol). Source contributions of PM2.5 transported from potential geographical regions showed reductions with mean values ranging from 0.22 to 4.36 µg m-3. However, increased contributions of firework burning, secondary inorganic aerosol, road dust, and vehicle emissions from transboundary transport were observed. This study highlighted the complex and nonlinear response of chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 to air pollution control measures, suggesting the importance of regional-joint control.","Zheng, Huang; Kong, Shaofei; Chen, Nan; Yan, Yingying; Liu, Dantong; Zhu, Bo; Xu, Ke; Cao, Wenxiang; Ding, Qingqing; Lan, Bo; Zhang, Zhouxiang; Zheng, Mingming; Fan, Zewei; Cheng, Yi; Zheng, Shurui; Yao, Liquan; Bai, Yongqing; Zhao, Tianliang; Qi, Shihua",Sci Total Environ,,199

Due to pre­analytical and technical limitations, samples with low viral load are often misdiagnosed as false­negative samples. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other strategies able to overcome the limits of RT­qPCR. Blinded swab samples from two individuals diagnosed positive and negative for COVID­19 were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT­qPCR in order to assess the sensitivity of both methods. Intercalation chemistries and a World Health Organization (WHO)/Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)­approved probe for the SARS­CoV­2 N gene were used. SYBR­Green RT­qPCR is not able to diagnose as positive samples with low viral load, while, TaqMan Probe RT­qPCR gave positive signals at very late Ct values. On the contrary, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity rate compared to RT­qPCR and both EvaGreen and probe ddPCR were able to recognize the sample with low viral load as positive even at 10­fold diluted concentration. In conclusion, ddPCR shows higher sensitivity and specificity compared to RT­qPCR for the diagnosis of COVID­19 infection in false­negative samples with low viral load. Therefore, ddPCR is strongly recommended in clinical practice for the diagnosis of COVID­19 and the follow­up of positive patients until complete remission.","Falzone, Luca; Musso, Nicolò; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Bongiorno, Dafne; Palermo, Concetta Ilenia; Scalia, Guido; Libra, Massimo; Stefani, Stefania",Int J Mol Med,,199

Although this disease primarily targets lungs, damages in other organs, such as heart, kidney, liver, and testis, may occur. Testis is the cornerstone of male reproduction, while reproductive health is the most valuable resource for continuity of the human race. Given the unique nature of SARS-CoV-2, the mechanisms of its impact on the testes have yet to be fully explored. Notably, coronaviruses have been found to invade target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which can be found in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary tract, and reproductive organs, such as testes. Coronavirus studies have suggested that testes might be a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first etiopathogenic concept proposed by current hypotheses indicates that the virus can invade testes through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Next, the activated inflammatory response in the testes, disease-associated fever, and COVID-19 medications might be implicated in testicular alterations. Although evidence regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in semen remains controversial, this emphasizes the need for researchers to pay closer attention to sexually transmitted diseases and male fertility after recovering from COVID-19. In this review the latest updates regarding COVID-19-associated testicular dysfunction are summarized and possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.","Abdel-Moneim, Adel",Biochemistry (Mosc),,199

241039,The Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Marginal Migrant Populations in Italy,2021,"Background Mortality in acute respiratory failure remains high despite the use of lung-protective ventilation. Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: In this registry-based, prospective cohort study, we obtained data from the Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry, which includes all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 4 h or more in nine ICUs that are affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada). We included all adult (&#8805;18 years) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation between April 11, 2014, and June 5, 2019. Patients were excluded if they received treatment with extracorporeal life support. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Bayesian joint models were used to estimate the strength of associations, accounting for informative censoring due to death during follow-up. FINDINGS: Of 13â939 patients recorded in the registry, 13â408 (96·2%) were eligible for descriptive analysis. The primary analysis comprised 7876 (58·7%) patients with complete baseline characteristics, and a secondary analysis included all 13â408 patients after multiple imputation in the joint model analysis. 2409 (18·0%) of 13â408 patients died in the ICU. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including age and severity of illness, a significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each daily increment in driving pressure (hazard ratio 1·064, 95% credible interval 1·057-1·071) or mechanical power (hazard ratio 1·060, 95% credible interval 1·053-1·066). These associations persisted over the duration of mechanical ventilation. INTERPRETATION: Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of mechanical ventilation was harmful, even for short durations. Limiting exposure to driving pressure or mechanical power should be evaluated in further studies as promising ventilation strategies to reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

Our results define the period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 as the plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China. By characterizing the likely dynamics of the virus before it was discovered, we show that more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-like zoonotic events would be self-limited, dying out without igniting a pandemic.

The participants included in the study consisted of the following two groups: Group 1-a convenience sample of 150 first-line managers working at three different hospitals; and Group 2-a panel of experts for the Delphi technique, selected using the Snowball sampling technique. Tools for data collection included the following: Tool 1-questionnaire about nursing staff's problems; Tool 2-Delphi technique to develop strategies for managing nursing staff's problems; and Tool 3-opinionnaire format. RESULTS: The recruited first nurse managers were of the opinion that job stress, work overload, conflict, workplace violence, poor performance, staff turnover, demotivation, lack of empowerment, and staff absenteeism were among the common problems faced by staff nurses at work. CONCLUSION: From the expert panelists' perspectives, the newly developed strategy in this study was considered valid; the researchers recommend the strategy developed in this study to be universalized in different health care settings and used as a guide for nurse managers.","Gab Allah, Amal Refaat; Elshrief, Hayam Ahmed; Ageiz, Marwa Hassan",Asian Nurs Res (Korean Soc Nurs Sci),,199

How this novel beta-coronavirus virus, and coronaviruses more generally, alter cellular metabolism to support massive production of ~30 kB viral genomes and subgenomic viral RNAs remains largely unknown. To gain insights, transcriptional and metabolomic analyses are performed 8 hours after SARS-CoV-2 infection, an early timepoint where the viral lifecycle is completed but prior to overt effects on host cell growth or survival. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 remodels host folate and one-carbon metabolism at the post-transcriptional level to support de novo purine synthesis, bypassing viral shutoff of host translation. Intracellular glucose and folate are depleted in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and viral replication is exquisitely sensitive to inhibitors of folate and one-carbon metabolism, notably methotrexate. Host metabolism targeted therapy could add to the armamentarium against future coronavirus outbreaks.","Zhang, Yuchen; Guo, Rui; Kim, Sharon H; Shah, Hardik; Zhang, Shuting; Liang, Jin Hua; Fang, Ying; Gentili, Matteo; Leary, Colin N O039; Elledge, Steven J; Hung, Deborah T; Mootha, Vamsi K; Gewurz, Benjamin E",Nat Commun,,199

245690,Coronavirus (COVID-19) - An epidemic or pandemic for financial markets,2020,"Introduction In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) probably occurred in Wuhan, China. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a pandemic. Containment measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene were recommended. In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures. Objective To investigate to what extent two personality traits, extroversion and conscientiousness, are associated with engagement with two containment measures (social distancing and handwashing). Methods The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). Results Higher scores for extroversion were associated with lower means for social distancing (p < 0.001) and higher scores for conscientiousness were associated with higher means for social distancing and handwashing (p < 0.05). Conclusion The findings indicate the importance of acknowledging extroversion and conscientiousness traits as relevant to people's engagement with the measures recommended for COVID-19 containment.","Carvalho, Lucas de F; Pianowski, Giselle; Gonçalves, André P",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,,199

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to know the psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the nursing professionals working for the Rioja Health Service. METHODS: We conducted an observational and descriptive cross-sectional study. The nursing staff at the Rioja Health Service were invited to respond to a self-administered questionnaire between June and August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 605 health professionals participated in the questionnaire; 91.9% were women, 63.14% were registered nurses, and 36.28% were auxiliary nurses. Risk factors for mental health professionals were identified in more than 90% of nurses (p = 0.009), affecting their psychological state with feelings of exhaustion, emotional overload (p = 0.002), and less use of coping strategies among women. Younger professionals with less experience had higher levels of stress compared to those with more than five years of experience, who showed a progressive reduction in the impact of stressors (p < 0.001). Professionals with dependent family members presented higher levels of emotional overload and coping problems (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant psychological impact on health professionals in terms of stress, emotional well-being, and the use of coping strategies. Female health professionals with dependents, a temporary contract, and less work experience have been more psychologically affected.","Del Pozo-Herce, Pablo; Garrido-García, Rebeca; Santolalla-Arnedo, Iván; Gea-Caballero, Vicente; García-Molina, Pablo; Ruiz de Viñaspre-Hernández, Regina; Rodríguez-Velasco, Francisco José; Juárez-Vela, Raúl",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

This paper presents a prospective service evaluation during establishment of urgent dental care in the North East of England over a six-week period.Aim To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North East urgent dental care centre and confirm appropriate care pathways.Main outcome methods Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23 March to 3 May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics.Results There were 1,746 patient triages (1,595 telephone and 151 face-to-face), resulting in 1,322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. Sixty-five percent of clinical consultations resulted in extractions and 0.8% in an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25 km on average to access care; however, this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and, to our knowledge, no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure.Conclusion The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the six-week period. Dental preparedness for future pandemic crises could be improved and informed by this data.","Carter, Emily; Currie, Charlotte C; Asuni, Abisola; Goldsmith, Rachel; Toon, Grace; Horridge, Catherine; Simpson, Sarah; Donnell, Christopher; Greenwood, Mark; Walton, Graham; Cole, Ben; Durham, Justin; Holliday, Richard",Br Dent J,,199

Drawing from life-history theory, affective and developmental science, and social-psychological frameworks, we examined the idea that perceptions of uncertainty--perceiving the world as random and unpredictable-enhance subsequent savoring. In a large experience-sampling study (Study 1, N = 6,680), we found that individuals who perceived more uncertainty showed increases in subsequent savoring in their daily lives. In a preregistered experiment (Study 2, N = 397), individuals who watched a film that induced uncertainty (vs. order or a control condition) subsequently reported higher savoring intentions. Finally, in a field experiment on a busy urban street (Study 3, N = 201), we found that passersby who received fliers that induced uncertainty (vs. order) subsequently engaged in more savoring behavior by stopping to smell a bouquet of roses. These findings from three studies with diverse samples and methodologies underscore an upside to the specter of uncertainty: it can cause people to savor the positives of the present.

Using tximeta, we import RNA-seq transcript quantifications into an analysis-ready data structure, called the SummarizedExperiment, that contains the ranges of the reference transcripts and metadata on their provenance. Using SummarizedExperiments to represent the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, we model differentially accessible (DA) chromatin peaks and differentially expressed (DE) genes with existing Bioconductor packages. Using plyranges we then integrate the results to see if there is an enrichment of DA peaks near DE genes by finding overlaps and aggregating over log-fold change thresholds. The combination of these packages and their integration with the Bioconductor ecosystem provide a coherent framework for analysts to iteratively and reproducibly explore their biological data.","Lee, Stuart; Lawrence, Michael; Love, Michael I",F1000Res,,199

Our laboratory initially used a two-step molecular assay, first reported by Corman et al., for SARS-CoV-2 identification (the T-CDC method). As rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is required to control the spread of this infectious disease, the current study evaluated three commercially available assays, including the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit, the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit, to establish diagnostic algorithms for clinical laboratories. METHODS: A total of 790 clinical specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, saliva, stool, endotracheal aspirate and serum were obtained from patients who were suspected or already confirmed to have COVID-19 at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital from February to May 2020. These specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the different assays and the performance variance between the assays was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the assays we evaluated, the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit require lots of hands-on practical lab work, while the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit are fully automated detection systems. The T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit showed similar detection sensitivity, however, the T-CDC method frequently delivered false positive signals for E and/or RdRP gene detection, thus increasing the risk of reporting false positive results. A manual test-based testing strategy combining the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit was developed, which demonstrated excellent concordance rates (>99%) with the cobas and Rendu automatic systems. There were a few cases showing discrepant results, which may be due to the varied detection sensitivities as well as targets among the different platforms. Moreover, the concordance rate between the cobas and Rendu assays was 100%. CONCLUSION: Based on our evaluation, two SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic algorithms, one focusing on the manual assays and the other on the automatic platforms, were proposed. Our results provide valuable information that allow clinical laboratories to implement optimal diagnostic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing based on their clinical needs, such as test volume, turn-around time, and staff/resource limitations.","Ho, Hsiang-Ling; Lin, Yen-Yu; Wang, Fang-Yu; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Lee, Chia-Lin; Chou, Teh-Ying",J.

Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002). Conclusion: About half of our physicians had different levels of anxiety during the pandemic, and this anxiety seemed to be more related to infecting their relatives. Participants thought that providing health care services with telemedicine during the pandemic period would be beneficial and reduce the spread of hospital-acquired COVID-19. However, there was no consensus among the participants regarding the use of telemedicine in the postpandemic period.","Demirgan, Serdar; Kargi Gemici, Ezgi; Çagatay, Melike; Altinel, Yüksel; Demirgan, Ebru Burcu; Güneyli, Hasan Cem; Sevdi, Mehmet Salih; Selcan, Aysin",Telemed. j. e. health,,199

Moreover, the contribution of neuroticism and conscientiousness was assessed over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, and the unique contribution of personal belief in a just world was evaluated beyond all the other study variables. Samples were collected in three different countries-Israel (N = 917), Germany (N = 213), and India (N = 160). Online self-report questionnaires were utilized to measure age, gender, COVID-19 perceptions (probability, severity, and self-efficacy), neuroticism, conscientiousness, personal belief in a just world, and depression. The findings indicated that, across the three countries, neuroticism was positively associated with depression (correlations ranging from .24 to .44), and conscientiousness and personal belief in a just world were negatively associated with depression (correlations ranging from - .31 to - .21, and from - .35 to - .23, respectively). Moreover, neuroticism and conscientiousness explained unique variance over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions (except conscientiousness in India), and the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression was significant beyond the effects of all other study variables. These findings support the role of personality in explaining depression regardless of situational characteristics and stress the role of just world beliefs as protective factors against negative emotions.","Nudelman, Gabriel; Kamble, Shanmukh Vasant; Otto, Kathleen",Soc Justice Res,,199

255096,The Discourse of Fear around Health and Economy in Pakistani English Newspaper Articles on COVID-19 (preprint),2020,"We examined stress as a predictor of behaviours related to Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) through its effects on delay discounting. Adults (N = 3686) completed an online survey with a behavioural measure of delay discounting and questions regarding stress, physical distancing, and stockpiling of food and supplies. Stress was weakly, but positively, correlated with delay discounting (p < 0.01). Delay discounting was positively correlated with stockpiling (p < 0.01); and discounting was negatively correlated with physical distancing (p < 0.01). Mediation models indicated that discounting was a significant mediator of the relationship between stress and physical distancing (-0.003) and stockpiling (0.003); bootstrap 95% CIs (-0.006, -0.001) and (0.001, 0.005), respectively. After accounting for its indirect effects through discounting, stress continued to have a direct effect on these outcomes. This study indicates that delay discounting partially mediates the link between stress and behaviours related to COVID-19. Results suggest that interventions reducing stress and/or delay discounting may be profitable for increasing infection prevention and reducing stockpiling.","DeAngelis, Briana N; Ben Salah, Arwa; al039,; Absi, Mustafa",Stress health (Online),,199

In the first step, we select features to represent the surface and predict them over time. In the second step, we use the predicted features to construct the implied volatility surface using a deep neural network (DNN) model by incorporating constraints that prevent static arbitrage. We consider three methods to extract features from the implied volatility data: principal component analysis, variational autoencoder and sampling the surface, and we predict these features using LSTM. Using a long time series of implied volatility data for S\&P500 index options to train our models, we find that sampling the surface with DNN for surface construction achieves the smallest error in out-of-sample prediction. Furthermore, the DNN model for surface construction not only removes static arbitrage, but also significantly reduces the prediction error compared with a standard interpolation method. Our framework can also be used to simulate the dynamics of the implied volatility surface without static arbitrage.","Zhang, Wenyong; Li, Lingfei; Zhang, Gongqiu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07177v1.pdf,199

Ideally, such foreign bodies should be removed using a hysteroscope under direct vision. In the absence of a hysteroscope, retrieval may be attempted using retrieving forceps either under ultrasonographic guidance or blindly. A 26-year-old female patient presented as a case of missed abortion at 6 weeks of gestation and underwent suction and evacuation. The tip of the cannula broke during the procedure. Multiple attempts were made to retrieve the cannula tip using forceps under ultrasound guidance without success. The patient was planned to be shifted to a higher centre as the hysteroscope was not available at this centre. However, owing to travel restrictions and lockdown imposed for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 2019) pandemic, the patient could not be transferred. An innovative method using the fibre optic bronchoscope was devised by the otorhinolaryngologist and gynaecologist, and the retained impacted cannula was safely removed from the left uterine cornu under vision.","Singh, Kamalpreet; Mitra, Binay; Singh, Kanwarjit; Kumar Mishra, Awadhesh; Singhal, Ravi",,,199

Enforced lockdowns and social distancing initiatives have been met with various media channels replaying famous sport matches, classic films and memorable concerts from the past. Furthermore, social media is full of families interacting more; playing traditional board games and numerous other leisure-related activities such as baking bread and making fresh pasta. Nostalgia may well end up being one of the primary coping mechanisms (for all generations) of enduring isolation, fear - and a general loss of freedom.

It is well-established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulated immune responses. Arginase-1 (Arg1), which has a pivotal role in immune cells, can be expressed in most of the myeloid cells, e.g., neutrophils and macrophages. Arg1 has been associated with the suppression of antiviral immune responses. METHODS: Whole blood was taken from 21 COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy individuals, and after RNA extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, gene expression of Arg1 was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The qPCR results showed that the expression of Arg1 was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.01). The relative expression analysis demonstrated there were approximately 2.3 times increased Arg1 expression in the whole blood of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a considerable diagnostic value for Arg1 expression in COVID-19 (p = 0.0002 and AUC = 0.8401). CONCLUSION: Arg1 might be a promising marker in the pathogenesis of the disease, and it could be a valuable diagnostic tool.","Derakhshani, Afshin; Hemmat, Nima; Asadzadeh, Zahra; Ghaseminia, Moslem; Shadbad, Mahdi Abdoli; Jadideslam, Golamreza; Silvestris, Nicola; Racanelli, Vito; Baradaran, Behzad",,,199
259850,Emergent Change in a Mexican Midwifery Center Organization Amidst the COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) poses a tremendous challenge to healthcare systems across the globe. Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.","Khan, Muhammad Salim; Haq, Inaamul; Qurieshi, Mariya Amin; Majid, Sabhiya; Bhat, Arif Akbar; Qazi, Tanzeela Bashir; Chowdri, Iqra Nisar; Sabah, Iram; Kawoosa, Misbah Ferooz; Lone, Abdul Aziz; Nabi, Shahroz; Sumji, Ishtiyaq Ahmad; Obaid, Muhammad; Kousar, Rafiya",J Hosp Med,,199

A structured questionnaire containing 10 questions was used, and each question had 2 or 3 possible answers. The parents of children (aged 0-14 years) who visited the dental department of our hospital last year were eligible to participate in this study. A total of 148 parents were interviewed by telephone in February 2020 by research staff. A total of 94.59% of the parents said they paid high attention to COVID-19 and explained it to their children; 66.22% thought the dental department environment was more dangerous than other public places; 91.89% believed the dental department had a higher risk of virus infection; and 83.78% said they would take their children to a dental department if the children had a severe toothache. Approximately 81.08% of the parents expressed confidence after we informed them about the preventive measures taken in the dental department to ensure safe treatment for their children. In conclusion, all parents were concerned about COVID-19, and most of them had talked about it with their children often. In addition, a considerable percentage of them would not take their children to the dental department even if they had severe dental pain and thought that the dental environment could be more dangerous than other environments.

The study investigated how government actions, the public’s trust in government, risk perception, and negative emotions influenced the public evaluation of government performance based on a primary survey. The findings showed that: (1) government actions and public evaluation of government performance in crisis are significantly and positively associated;(2) trust in government can positively lead to the public evaluation of government performance in crisis;(3) risk perception and negative emotions can negatively moderate and attenuate the previous positive relationship. The research revealed that the public evaluation of government performance is formed by the government actions through mediation effect of trust in government and also moderation effect of risk perception and emotional factors.

With regulations for telemedicine loosened, new possibilities for the practice of otolaryngology have opened. To address the uncertain duration of this pandemic, a review was conducted of current literature on use of telemedicine services in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in previous national emergencies to reveal the role telemedicine can play for otolaryngology practices. Data sources: Pubmed articles with an independent search query were utilized. Methods: Literature review performed by one author searched for all published English-language literature on telehealth in the SARS-CoV-2 era. Articles were considered for discussion if they provided relevant developments for telemedicine in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results: Telemedicine can be up-scaled in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where exposure containment is of the utmost priority. With patient interaction possible through virtual communication, telemedicine allows continued patient care while minimizing the risk of viral spread. In the realm of otolaryngology, telemedicine has been used in the past during disasters with other studies demonstrating high diagnostic concordance with inpatient visits. Many institutions have recognized the potential for such care as they begin utilize both virtual visits and in-person care during this pandemic. Conclusion: To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we support the AAO-HNS recommendation for the adoption of novel ways to employ telemedicine in this era. Many emergency departments and health care systems have the infrastructure necessary for synchronous video telemedicine visits that can be leveraged to provide quality care with patients. With the continued need to socially distance, telemedicine can protect both physicians and patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.","Huang, Victoria W; Imam, Sarah A; Nguyen, Shaun A",,,199
260994,Limits of Stress-Test Based Bank Regulation: Cues from the COVID-19 Crisis (preprint),2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has been a subject of extensive study. However, it is still unclear why it was restricted to higher latitudes during the initial days and later cascaded in the tropics. Here, we analyzed 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across different climate zones and Koppen's climate that provided insights about within-species virus evolution and its relation to abiotic factors. Two genetically variant groups, named G1 and G2, were identified, well defined by four mutations. The G1 group (ancestor) is mainly restricted to warm and moist, temperate climate (Koppen's C climate) while its descendent G2 group surpasses the climatic restrictions of G1, initially cascading into neighboring cold climate (D) of higher latitudes and later into the hot climate of the tropics (A). It appears that the gradation of temperate climate (Cfa-Cfb) to cold climate (Dfa-Dfb) drives the evolution of G1 into the G2 variant group, which later adapted to tropical climate (A) as well. It seems this virus followed an inverse latitudinal gradient in the beginning due to its preference towards temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our work elucidates virus evolutionary studies combined with climatic studies can provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways in such outbreaks, which is hard to achieve through individual studies. Mutational insights gained may help design an efficacious vaccine.","Bajaj, Priyanka Arya Prakash Chandra",Climate Change Ecology,,199

METHODS: We used data on mobility and number of COVID-19 cases to longitudinally estimate associations between public compliance, as measured by human mobility, and the daily reproduction number and daily growth rate during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. RESULTS: The 5 states mandated social distancing directives during March 19-24, 2020, and public compliance with mandates started to decrease in mid-April 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the daily reproduction number decreased from 2.41-5.21 to 0.72-1.19, and the daily growth rate decreased from 0.22-0.77 to -0.04 to 0.05 in the 5 states. The level of public compliance, as measured by the social distancing index (SDI) and daily encounter-density change, was high at the early stage of implementation but decreased in the 5 states. The SDI was negatively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, -0.04 to -0.01) and the daily growth rate (from -0.009 to -0.01). The daily encounter-density change was positively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, 0.24 to 1.02) and the daily growth rate (from 0.05 to 0.26).

METHODS: Altogether 105 PM subjects were recruited with fifty-eight eyes categorized as group LC + SH and sixty eyes as group LC + mCNV. LCs were categorized into stellate and linear subtypes. Eye fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were performed. Clinical demographic data, PM maculopathy, peripapillary atrophy, and macular choroidal thickness (mCT) were documented. RESULTS: Significant differences in age, gender, BCVA, and PM atrophies were observed between LC + SH and LC + mCNV groups. The stellate LC was more common in elder subjects with more severe chorioretinal atrophy and thinner mCT compared with linear LCs (P < 0.05). The mCT in group LC + SH was significantly larger than group LC + CNV (P < 0.001), especially in temporal, inferior, and superior locations of macula. The mCT showed correlation with age (P < 0.001)with a decreasing rate of 0.696 µm/year. CONCLUSIONS: SH tended to initially occur in younger subjects with linear LCs. mCNV was more common in elder subjects with severe chorioretinal atrophy.

In patients with tracheostomy, coronavirus hypothetically coexists with well-known bacterial agents. A 61-year-old male patient with tracheostomy was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, fever and increased tracheal secretions. Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels. Chest computed tomography showed consolidation areas and ground-glass opacities more prominent in subpleural areas. Although; two consecutive RT-PCR analyses of combined nasopharengeal/oropharengeal swabs were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, positivity was reported for endotracheal aspirate (ETA) sample. Significant growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the bacterial culture of ETA sample. In conclusion, clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 should be obtained through the lower respiratory tract, if possible and if upper airway samples are negative.

The cocrystal includes the anionic [Ad-(HThy)] base pair which is a stable formation in the solid state that has previously not even been suggested. It exhibits Watson-Crick connectivity as found in DNA but which is unusual for the free neutral base pairs. The stability of the observed anionic bases and their supramolecular formations and hydrates has also been examined by electronic structure calculations, contributing to more insight into how base pairs can bind when a proton is removed and highlighting mechanisms of stabilization or chemical transformation in the DNA chains.","Mishra, Manish Kumar; Kelley, Steven P; Smetana, Volodymyr; Dixon, David A; McNeill, Ashley S; Mudring, Anja-Verena; Rogers, Robin D",Proc.

Focusing on modeling the biological and sociological mechanisms which influence the disease spread, the basic reference example is the SIR model. However, it is too simple to be able to model those mechanisms (including the three main types of control measures: social distancing, contact tracing and health system measures) to fit real data and to simulate possible future scenarios. A question, then, arises: how much and how do we need to complexify a SIR model? We develop a Î¸ -SEIHQRD model, which may be the simplest one satisfying the mentioned requirements for arbitrary territories and can be simplified in particular cases.

264482,The Human Rights to Water and Sanitation in Policy Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Brazilian States,2021,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the cause of the third pneumonia-like outbreak of coronaviruses in humans during the 21st century. The status of the host immune system is a critical factor that affects the severity and outcomes of COVID-19. In particular, antibody responses are an indicator of the anti-viral defense; so, a delayed or inappropriate induction of these responses would correlate with a defect in the viral clearance. METHODS: This is a rapid synthesis of literature investigating antibody responses in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. RESULTS: Lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), along with the direct evidence of antibody responses in COVID-19, pose the potentials of dynamic antibody responses for screening and prognostic purposes in COVID-19. Also, neutralizing antibodies extracted from recovered patients and monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines offer therapeutic support for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the dynamics of antibody responses help to determine the effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19. Of note, it might be helpful for the evaluation of the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccination - the dreams for the future of COVID-19. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility and efficacy of antibody extraction from animal subjects. Finally, numerous factors affect antibody response such as race, nutrition status, and virus mutations in viral infections, which need to be considered in the context of COVID-19.","Mohammadi, Tooba; Nasab, Mahsa G; Mohebalizadeh, Mehdi; Kheirandish, Ali; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Clin. lab,,199
264577,Sharpening the global focus on ethnicity and race in the time of COVID-19,2020,"Measures of lung function are heritable, and thus, we sought to utilise genetics to propose drug-repurposing candidates that could improve respiratory outcomes. Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with seven druggable biochemical traits, with further evidence of a causal relationship between increased fasting glucose and diminished lung function. Moreover, we developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with known drug targets and investigated their relationship with pulmonary phenotypes and gene expression in independent cohorts to prioritise individuals who may benefit from particular drug-repurposing opportunities. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of lung function was then performed which identified several drug-gene interactions with predicted lung function increasing modes of action. Drugs that regulate blood glucose were uncovered through both polygenic scoring and TWAS methodologies. In summary, we provided genetic justification for a number of novel drug-repurposing opportunities that could improve lung function.","Reay, William R; El Shair, Sahar I; Geaghan, Michael P; Riveros, Carlos; Holliday, Elizabeth G; McEvoy, Mark A; Hancock, Stephen; Peel, Roseanne; Scott, Rodney J; Attia, John R; Cairns, Murray J",eLife (Cambridge),,199

Rates were best in line with the model Rs = 148 mL/d, with a standard deviation of 0.17 log units (factor 1.5). POCIS canisters reduced mass transfer coefficients of the water boundary layer by a factor of 2 as measured by alabaster dissolution rates. A mechanistic model that accounts for flow and temperature effects yielded a fair estimate of the effective exchange surface area (12.5 ± 0.8 cm2 ). This model could only be tested for higher flow velocities because of uncertainties associated with the measurement of flow velocities < 1 cm/s. Pictures of sorbent distributions in POCIS showed that the effective exchange surface area varied with time during the exposures. Error analysis indicated that sorbent distributions and chemical analysis were minor error sources. The main conclusion of this study is that an atrazine sampling rate of 148 mL/d yields consistent results for all three years across nine headwater streams. This article is protected by copyright.

265800,Community-oriented policing during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Available COVID-19 data shows higher shares of cases and deaths occur among Black Americans, but reporting of data by race is poor. This paper investigates disparities in county-level mortality rates across counties with higher and lower than national average Black population shares using nonlinear regression decomposition and estimates potential differential impact of social distancing measures. I find counties with Black population shares above the national share have mortality rates 2 to 3 times higher than in other counties. Observable differences in living conditions, health, and work characteristics reduce the disparity to approximately 1.25 to 1.65 overall, and explain 100% of the disparity at 21 days after the first case. Though higher rates of comorbidities in counties with higher Black population shares are an important predictor, living situation factors like single parenthood and population density are just as important. Higher rates of co-residence with grandchildren explain 11% of the 21 day disparity but do not appear important by 42 days, suggesting families may have been better able to protect vulnerable family members later in the epidemic. To analyze differential effects of social distancing measures use two approaches. First, I exploit the timing of interventions relative to the first case among counties that began their epidemic at the same time. Second, I use event study analysis to analyze within-county changes in mortality. Findings for social distancing measures are not always consistent across approaches. Overall, I find no evidence that school closures were less effective in counties with larger Black population shares, and some estimates suggest closures may have disproportionately helped more diverse counties and counties with high rates of grandparent and grandchild co-residence. Conversely, stay at home orders are less clearly associated with mortality in any counties, reaching peak unemployment did not reduce mortality in any models, and some estimates indicate reaching peak unemployment before the first case was associated with higher mortality rates, especially in more diverse counties.","Hamman, Mary K",Econ Hum Biol,,199
266248,"Death Anxiety, Loss, and Grief in the Time of COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: We report a high-risk case of a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive patient with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease (CKD), treated successfully using an integrative therapy plan based on Ayurveda and Yoga, along with government-mandated compulsory modern western medicine (MWM) treatment. Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities, along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi, India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN, hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough, body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based on the patient's symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula: see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days, and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in symptoms, the patient's real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern medicine) was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for COVID-19 patients. A case series or a suitably designed randomized controlled trial is needed to assess its efficacy.","Mishra, Alka; Bentur, Sumitra A; Thakral, Sonika; Garg, Rahul; Duggal, Bhanu",J Med Case Rep,,199

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the perception, knowledge, and application of the preventive measures taken by physiotherapists in managing issues with confirmed or suspected patients suffering from COVID-19. METHODS: A self-administered survey comprising 15 questions was divided into four sections related to precautions when interacting with patients with COVID-19: (1) knowledge of the physiotherapy role, (2) knowledge of preventive measures to limit transmission of the virus, (3) practicing these measures, and (4) managing patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 456 physiotherapists from 139 countries participated in the study. Most physiotherapists were knowledgeable regarding their role in the management of COVID-19 patients (Mâ=â94.3%; SDâ=â15.4) and the management of potential COVID-19 patients (Mâ=â84.5%; SDâ=â20.1). The rating of knowledge and practices of preventive measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 were lower (Mâ=â74.3%; SDâ=â25.7, and Mâ=â62.5%; SDâ=â31.3, respectively).

268148,The world must learn from COVID before diving into a pandemic treaty,2021,"Voluntary contributions by citizen scientists can gather large datasets covering wide geographical areas, and are increasingly utilized by researchers for multiple applications, including arthropod vector surveillance. Online platforms such as iNaturalist accumulate crowdsourced biological observations from around the world and these data could also be useful for monitoring vectors. The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019-2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe (Hyalomma spp.) and the USA (Haemaphysalis longicornis), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion. Despite known limitations associated with crowdsourced data, this study shows that iNaturalist can be a valuable source of information on vector distribution and seasonality that could be used to supplement existing vector surveillance data, especially at a time when many surveillance programs may have been interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions.","Cull, Benjamin",PLoS One,,199

269181,Retrofitting Meetings for Psychological Safety,2021-09-27,"Background and objective Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly used for the treatment of patients with heart disease, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) In the aftermath of the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initial data raised concerns that ACE/ARB use can increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, leading to the worsening of COVID-19 However, recent studies have suggested that their use might be safe in a select subgroup of patients We conducted a single-center retrospective study to evaluate the association of in-patient use of ACE/ARB with outcomes among a predominantly ethnic minority patient population of the inner New York City (NYC) Methods This was a retrospective analysis of all hospital admissions with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020 Results Of the 469 patients included in the study, 91 patients (19 4%) used ACE/ARB therapy during their hospital stay and were labeled as ACE/ARB group Patients in the ACE/ARB therapy group were older and had a higher incidence of HTN, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, DM, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Admission D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were similar between the two groups, but absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was lower in the non-ACE/ARB group (0 971 k/ul vs 1 135 k/ul, p=0 0144) The incidence of hyperkalemia and the rise in creatinine were similar between the two groups Univariate analysis by treatment group using the log-rank test produced significant results (p=0 0062), indicating a higher survival rate for the ACE/ARB group Conclusion The use of ACE/ARB appears to be safe in all patients in whom their use is medically indicated","Adrish, M.; Chilimuri, S.; Sun, H.; Mantri, N.; Yugay, A.; Zahid, M.",Cureus,,199
270690,Power and Social Control of Youth during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background Despite its high sensitivity in diagnosing COVID-19 in a screening population, chest CT appearances of COVID 19 pneumonia are thought to be non-specific. Purpose To assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. Methods A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively. The seven radiologists had sensitivities of 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73% and 70% and specificities of 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, 100%. Compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs. 57%, p<0.001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs. 68%, p<0.001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs. 22%, p<0.001), and vascular thickening (59% vs. 22%, p<0.001), but less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14.% vs. 35%, p<0.001), pleural effusion (4.1 vs. 39%, p<0.001) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs. 10.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion Radiologists in China and the United States distinguished COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.

271772,"Capital Markets Volatility and COVID-19: Background and Policy Responses [June 19, 2020]",2020,"From bustling business districts to vibrant cultural life, many of the things that make life in cities advantageous can be attributed to their ability to bring people together. Diverse social networks, which promote productivity and innovation, can, however, act as a vector for disease transmission during a pandemic. The social distancing and lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have brought fast-paced city life to a standstill, giving citizens pause to recognise the necessity of adequate living conditions, the value of access to healthcare and the privilege of digital technology. Many of these response efforts have left the most socioeconomically disadvantaged at greater risk of catching and dying from COVID-19. They have exacerbated existing health inequalities and given rise to new ones. Many are calling for a socially just recovery, including 5 million health professionals representing over 50 countries in their open letter to the United Nations calling for ethical global leadership.1 The need for action on health inequalities was evident before the pandemic but this crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity for change and cities can be a focal point for this. While each city will require a unique recovery strategy from the pandemic, this commentary calls for a health equity approach to be universally adopted. Grounded in the Social Determinants of Health framework, this commentary suggests three ways cities could change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the housing, healthcare and technology sectors. Public and urban health professionals could engage multi-level stakeholders from civil society to governments at local and national levels to improve daily living conditions, promote access to healthcare and harness the power of digital technologies to address urban health inequalities.","Hoernke, K.",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,,199
271825,Inequalities in Children's Experiences of Home Learning during the COVID‐19 Lockdown in England,2020,"BACKGROUND: Caregivers of people with dementia (pwD) are at risk of depression, anxiety, and burden. COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed lockdown as a preventive measure might increase psychological symptoms in caregivers. The authors performed a study to measure the change of psychological symptoms during quarantine or self-isolation for COVID-19 in a sample of Italian caregivers of pwD, and to investigate if the resilience is associated with psychological changes in the sample. METHODS: Eighty-four caregivers of pwD completed an online survey including questionnaires assessing depressive symptomatology and anxiety before and during the lockdown, caregiver burden and levels of resilience. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis of variance revealed an effect of time (before and during the lockdown) in the whole group on depression scores; a significant interaction between time and resilience was found on anxiety scores, revealing that caregivers with high resilience showed a more significant increase of anxiety levels during lockdown than caregivers with low resilience. Moreover, the regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden was associated negatively with resilience scores, and positively with higher functional dependence. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown produced psychological consequences in caregivers of pwD, with an increase of levels of depression. Moreover, high resilience had a negative effect on anxiety levels and no effect on depressive symptomatology during the lockdown; moreover, it was associated with lower levels of caregiver burden. All caregivers, even those with high resilience levels, should be addressed to psychological interventions to reduce levels of depression, anxiety and caregiver burden.","Altieri, Manuela; Santangelo, Gabriella",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,199

The BCG vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2.","Covián, Camila; Retamal-Díaz, Angello; Bueno, Susan M; Kalergis, Alexis M",Front Immunol,,199

The objective of this study was to raise awareness of the risks of disinformation and infodemics and to identify the main social competencies and skills related to fact-checking that students should acquire. Based on thematic-experiential classes and through the project-based learning methodology, this teaching experience consisted of lecturing a fake class in the communication degree programme, in which the professor gave a speech to 150 students about coronavirus that contained both hoaxes and true information, thus challenging students to identify false information. The results obtained in this qualitative study are divided into three parts to answer each research question. The first part is focused on identifying the most influential hoaxes about the coronavirus that young people have embraced as reliable information during the 2020 pandemic (RQ1). The second part is dedicated to explaining students’ reactions when they are involved in infodemic contexts. We also point out the main challenge that arose in a period of infodemics (RQ2). In the third part, we propose the main fact-checking skills that students should acquire to tackle disinformation in a period of infodemics (RQ3). Training in these skills appeared to improve job performance and undoubtedly contributed to the personal development of our future graduates.","Pérez-Escolar, Marta Olmedo Eva Ordóñez Pulido Purificación Alcaide",Thinking Skills and Creativity,,199

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.","Hopkins, C; Surda, P; Kumar, N",Rhinology,,199

275643,Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 in the Sustainability of Airbnb Business Model,2021-01-01,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emerged as one of the most dramatic health crises of recent decades. This paper treats mainstream news about the current pandemic as a valuable entry point for analyzing the relationship between science and politics in the public sphere, where the outbreak must be both understood and confronted through appropriate public-health policy decisions. In doing so, the paper aims to examine which actors, institutions, and experts dominate the SARS-CoV-2 media narratives, with particular attention to the roles of political, medical, and scientific actors and institutions within the pandemic crisis. The study relies on a large dataset consisting of all SARS-CoV-2 articles published by eight major Italian national newspapers between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. These articles underwent a quantitative analysis based on a topic modeling technique. The topic modeling outputs were further analyzed by innovatively combining ad-hoc metrics and a classifier based on the stacking ensemble method (combining regularized logistic regression and linear stochastic gradient descent) for quantifying scientific salience. This enabled the identification of relevant topics and the analysis of the roles that different actors and institutions engaged in making sense of the pandemic. The results show how the health emergency has been addressed primarily in terms of political regulation and concerns and only marginally as a scientific matter. Hence, science has been overwhelmed by politics, which, in media narratives, exerts a moral as well as regulatory authority. Media narratives exclude neither scientific issues nor scientific experts; rather, they configure them as a subsidiary body of knowledge and expertise to be mobilized as an ancillary, impersonal institution useful for legitimizing the expansion of political jurisdiction over the governance of the emergency.","Crabu, Stefano; Giardullo, Paolo; Sciandra, Andrea; Neresini, Federico",PLoS One,,199

The mortality rate for patients with ESRD in the United States has been declining since 2001 (2). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients are at high risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, which is due, in part, to weakened immune systems and presence of multiple comorbidities (3-5). The ESRD National Coordinating Center (ESRD NCC) supports the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the ESRD Networks,§ through analysis of data, dissemination of best practices, and creation of educational materials. ESRD NCC analyzed deaths reported to the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb), a system that facilitates the collection of data and maintenance of information about ESRD patients on chronic dialysis or receiving a kidney transplant who are treated in Medicare-certified dialysis facilities and kidney transplant centers in the United States. Excess death estimates were obtained by comparing observed and predicted monthly numbers of deaths during February 1-August 31, 2020; predicted deaths were modeled based on data from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. The analysis estimated 8.7-12.9 excess deaths per 1,000 ESRD patients, or a total of 6,953-10,316 excess deaths in a population of 798,611 ESRD patients during February 1-August 31, 2020. These findings suggest that deaths among ESRD patients during the early phase of the pandemic exceeded those that would have been expected based on previous years' data. Geographic and temporal patterns of excess mortality, including those among persons with ESRD, should be considered during planning and implementation of interventions, such as COVID-19 vaccination, infection control guidance, and patient education. These findings underscore the importance of data-driven technical assistance and further analyses of the causes and patterns of excess deaths in ESRD patients.","Ziemba, Robert; Campbell, Kyle N; Yang, Tsu-Hsuan; Schaeffer, Sara Eve; Mayo, Kelly M; McGann, Paul; Quinn, Shalon; Roach, Jesse; Huff, Edwin D",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,199

This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) ""How is your child doing since the lockdown?"" 2) ""How is life at home since the lockdown?"" 3) ""If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us"" 4) ""Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation"". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being.

277256,Current situation of COVID-19 in South America,2020,"There is a marked variation in mortality risk associated with COVID-19 infection in the general population. Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes. This suggests that individuals with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to excess oxidative stress and at a higher risk for inadequacy or deficiency of 25(OH)VD, leaving the body unable to protect its 'oxidative immune-metabolic' physiological functions from the insults of COVID-19. An association between subclinical interstitial lung disease with 25(OH)VD deficiencies and GSH deficiencies has been previously reported. We hypothesize that the overproduction of ROS and excess oxidative damage is responsible for the impaired immunity, secretion of the cytokine storm, and onset of pulmonary dysfunction in response to the COVID-19 infection. The co-optimization of impaired glutathione redox status and excess 25(OH)VD deficiencies has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, boost immunity, and reduce the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the AA population.","Jain, Sushil K; Parsanathan, Rajesh; Levine, Steve N; Bocchini, Joseph A; Holick, Michael F; Vanchiere, John A",Free Radic Biol Med,,199

SARS-CoV-2 has unique properties that place GPs at particular risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss the nose-related features of SARS-CoV-2 that place GPs at risk, and to make recommendations pertinent to the safety and protection of primary healthcare physicians. DISCUSSION: The highest viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is in the nose and nasopharynx. It is often highest early in the illness, before the development of symptoms. Further, SARS-CoV-2 replicates and continues to shed in the nasopharynx long after the virus is no longer detectable in the lower respiratory tract. This places any physician performing examinations on, or procedures involving, the upper respiratory tract at risk for contracting COVID-19. New-onset hyposmia and dysgeusia are indicators for COVID-19 and should be included in screening protocols.","Campbell, Raewyn G",Aust J Gen Pract,,199

278823,Creation of a COVID-19 business and life lesson: the impact on students’ learning and behavior,2021,"ABSTRACT: At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been shown to be transmitted through food. Even so, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how consumers view food and food safety. This study assessed consumer food safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic using (i) surveys and (ii) online focus group discussions. From April to August 2020, five waves of surveys were distributed to an online U.S. consumer panel and screened to include only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups were conducted via WebEx from May to July 2020. Focus group participants were recruited from the first wave of survey respondents. Both survey respondents and focus group participants reported higher levels of hand washing in response to the pandemic. However, survey participants' anticipated levels of hand washing after the pandemic decreased; some focus group participants noted that human nature ""kicking in"" could lead to lower levels of hand hygiene practice. For each of the 5 months, the surveys reported increased produce washing, both with water only and with water plus soap. Most focus group participants mentioned using water to wash their produce, but some reported using soap and even vinegar to ""kill"" the virus. Since consumers were worried that SARS-CoV-2 could survive on food, they started to mishandle food to address these concerns. However, this study also reported an increase in food thermometer use during the pandemic. Social determinants like gender, income, education, and age may have also influenced changes in levels of practice throughout the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers to practice proper and improper food safety practices, which may or may not continue after the pandemic. This study's findings provide timely information to guide future food safety education and communication during health crises and pandemics.","Thomas, Merlyn S; Feng, Yaohua",J Food Prot,,199

A number of candidates are in Phase III human clinical trials, including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine candidate. In preclinical trials, the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against SARS-CoV-2 challenge was evaluated in a ferret model of infection. Groups of ferrets received either prime-only or prime-boost administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 via the intramuscular or intranasal route. All ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administration combinations resulted in significant reductions in viral loads in nasal-wash and oral swab samples. No vaccine-associated adverse events were observed associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 candidate, with the data from this study suggesting it could be an effective and safe vaccine against COVID-19. Our study also indicates the potential for intranasal administration as a way to further improve the efficacy of this leading vaccine candidate.","Marsh, G. A.; McAuley, A. J.; Au, G.

Nearly all evacuees had taken preventive measures to limit potential exposure while in Wuhan, and none had detectable SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens, suggesting the absence of asymptomatic respiratory shedding among this group at the time of testing. Evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 1 evacuee, who reported experiencing no symptoms or high-risk exposures in the previous 2 months.

Two authors independently searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Ovid, EBSCO for case-control, longitudinal and cohort studies that determined the diagnostic accuracy of serology tests in comparison with NAATs in COVID-19 cases and used QUADAS-2 for quality assessment. Pooled accuracy was analysed using INLA method. A total of 27 studies were included in this meta-analysis, with 4 cohort, 16 case-control and 7 longitudinal studies and 4565 participants. Serology tests had the lowest sensitivity at 0-7 days after symptom onset and the highest at >14 days. TAB had a better sensitivity than IgG or IgM only. Using combined nucleocapsid (N) and spike(S) protein had a better sensitivity compared to N or S protein only. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) had a lower sensitivity than enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Serology tests will play an important role in the clinical diagnosis for later stage COVID-19 patients.

281428,New insights into crisis communication from an “inside” emic perspective during COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Cranial nerves (CNs), particularly CN IV and VI are difficult to visualize with conventional MRI techniques, particularly within the cavernous sinus region. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of high-resolution contrast enhanced 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography using new generation 3 T imaging technology to provide detailed visualization of CN VI anatomy, particularly within the cavernous sinus and petroclival regions. METHODS: Two neuroradiologists conducted bilateral evaluation of CN VI visibility in 23 patients for nerve segments located in the petroclival segment (dural cave and Dorello's canal), and three divisions of the cavernous sinus. All images were collected using contrast enhanced TOF MR angiography using a new generation 3 T machine. RESULTS: Of the CN VI segments assessed, average visibility of CN VI was best achieved in Dorello's canal. Overall visibility of CN VI within the regions inspected was best achieved in the axial view, with the exception of the dural cave, which was best assessed using the coronal view. We also identified strong agreement in assessment of nerve visibility between the two reviewers. We also identified a putative CN6 duplication and a small schwannoma, highlighting the fidelity of our approach. CONCLUSION: Contrast enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography can visualize CN VI anatomy, particularly within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus with simultaneous visualization of arterial and venous structures. This cannot be easily achieved using traditional MRI techniques. This imaging technique might be used with new generation machines to evaluate CN VI anatomy and pathologies within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus, especially relating to vascular pathologies.","Smith, Garrett; Tuna, Ibrahim Sacit; Massini, Tara C; Tufan, Fatih; Albayram, Mehmet Sait",Clin Imaging,,199

However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelor's degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.","Khubchandani, Jagdish; Sharma, Sushil; Price, James H; Wiblishauser, Michael J; Sharma, Manoj; Webb, Fern J",J. community health,,199

282796,Harnessing SmartPhones to Personalize Nutrition in a Time of Global Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has plagued the globe, with multiple SARS-CoV-2 clusters hinting at its evolving epidemiology. Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by doing the following: (1) estimating the containment delays, serial intervals, effective reproductive number (Rt), and proportion of asymptomatic cases; (2) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the containment delays and serial intervals; and (3) depicting COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings. METHODS: We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong from January-August 2020. The empirical containment delays and serial intervals were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (the percentage change in the predicted outcome from multivariable regression models relative to a predefined comparator). Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for serial intervals. RESULTS: The two epidemic waves were characterized by imported cases and clusters of local cases, respectively. Rt peaked at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 34.9% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (&#8805;80 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 containment delays (mean 5.18 [SD 3.04] days) and the 558 serial intervals (17 negative; mean 4.74 [SD 4.24] days). Containment delays decreased with involvement in a cluster (percentage contribution: 10.08%-20.73%) and case detection in the public health care sector (percentage contribution: 27.56%, 95% CI 22.52%-32.33%). Serial intervals decreased over time (6.70 days in wave 1 versus 4.35 days in wave 2) and with tertiary transmission or beyond (percentage contribution: -50.75% to -17.31%), but were lengthened by mobility (percentage contribution: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%). Households (69.9%) and social settings (20.3%) were where transmission commonly occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, the factors associated with reduced containment delays suggested government-enacted interventions were useful for achieving outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, the shorter serial intervals associated with the composite mobility index calls for empirical surveys to disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases underscore the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory. Fifth, the high proportion of transmission events occurring within the same age group supports the ban on gatherings outside of households, and underscores the need for residence-centered preventive measures.","Kwok, Kin On; Wei, Wan In; Huang, Ying; Kam, Kai Man; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Riley, Steven; Chan, Ho Hin Henry; Hui, David Shu Cheong; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong",J Med Internet Res,,199
282801,An Examination of COVID-19 Outbreaks in Prisons and Jails Throughout Asia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been described in more than 33 case reports. The incidence is closely related to the increased of use of dexamethasone after publication of the RECOVERY trial. Diagnosis of CAPA remains challenging in critically ill patients due to absence of typical radiological features such as halo sign. Schauwvlieghe et al. developed modified AspICU criteria for influenza associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) which can be used for CAPA. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old male with hypertension and diabetes was admitted to ICU with hypoxia requiring 100% oxygen on BiPAP. Upon presentation, he was tachycardic and hypertensive with respiratory distress. Laboratory findings were significant for leukocytosis and acute kidney injury with hyperkalemia necessitating renal replacement therapy. A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities (Image 1). SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive. He received dexamethasone and broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was intubated on day four of hospitalization due to worsening of hypoxia and was proned multiple times for severe ARDS. After initial improvement in hypoxia, the patient developed fevers and new leukocytosis with worsening infiltrates on chest imaging (Image 2). Multiple cultures from tracheal aspirate grew Aspergillus Spp. The serum beta-D glucan was elevated at 197 pg/mL and aspergillus galactomannan index was 3.39. Intravenous voriconazole was promptly initiated for presumptive diagnosis of CAPA based on AspICU criteria. Unfortunately, the patient developed worsening of hypoxia and increasing vasopressor requirement, ultimately leading to withdrawal of care. DISCUSSION: Dexamethasone use in COVID-19 ARDS may be associated with increased incidence of CAPA. Diagnosis of CAPA can be made using AspICU criteria which are based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings;one of each criteria necessary for diagnosis. Clinical criteria include: Fever refractory to at least 3 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy;recrudescent fever after a period of defervescence of at least 48 hours while on antibiotics;pleuritic chest pain;pleuritic rub;dyspnea;hemoptysis;or worsening respiratory insufficiency in spite of appropriate antibiotic therapy and ventilatory support. Radiological criteria include: Abnormal opacification on portable chest radiography or CT scan of the lungs. Mycological criteria include: Histopathology or direct microscopic evidence of dichotomous septate hyphae with positive culture for Aspergillus from tissue;a positive Aspergillus culture from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL);a galactomannan optical index on BAL of ≥1;or a galactomannan optical index on serum of ≥0.5. Initiation of prompt antifungal therapy is essential in these cases considering high mortality associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.","Halani, V.; Krvavac, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,199
283067,Online incivility in times of COVID‐19: Social disunity and misperceptions of tourism industry in Poland,2020,"Introduction In 2020, as classroom environments shifted abruptly from in-person offerings to largely Zoom-mediated learning spaces in response to COVID-19 restrictions, educators were challenged to engage students behind the box. Moreover, the unplanned and sustained lack of physical classroom interaction disrupted the learning community, a factor that contributes to higher student satisfaction and achievement. Our objective was to engage students with their peers and class material in the virtual learning environment. Methods: Zoom was used to deliver two distinct classroom events: a virtual showcase in an undergraduate systems-based anatomy course and a student symposium on sociocultural influences on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and conditions in a second-year integrated medical GI & Nutrition course. The undergraduate virtual showcase featured abstract art of neurodegenerative diseases that correlated with topics in nervous system anatomy. Students used a variety of media, such as canvas paintings, sketches, and clay molds, to communicate the anatomy relevant to their disease topic and their interpretation of the effects of this disease on the patient and their families. During the virtual showcase, students viewed a rotating slide-show of the work of their peers and completed a reflection assignment. For the second project, students were organized into small groups of 5 or 6 and asked to interview multiple stakeholders involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of a disease of their choosing within predetermined categories, such as oral/pharyngeal health or chronic liver disease. Each student interviewed a person with a unique narrative related to the disease and the group creatively synthesized their findings. For example, one group role-played the experience of the patient from initial diagnosis of colon cancer with their doctor to the follow-up with the healthcare team and support groups. They presented perspectives from a patient, physician, family caretaker, support therapist, dietician, and colon cancer researcher. Results: The top 30 (of 135) art submissions were featured in an undergraduate anatomy showcase on Zoom. Student feedback was mostly positive, with 64% (n=135) indicating strongly agree (39%) or agree (25%) when asked if they enjoyed opportunities to be creative in the anatomy classroom. Additional artforms were requested by students. The student symposium was designed as a two-hour mini-conference with 206 medical students organized into 36 groups. Six groups presented concurrently every 20 minutes among six different Zoom accounts. Additionally, students signed up to attend five peer presentations. Preliminary feedback revealed several themes including a deeper appreciation of GI anatomy and the lived experience of the patient, the importance of supportive healthcare roles in patient treatment (e.g. dieticians, caregivers, community support), and pride in their peers' creative presentations.Conclusions: These projects highlight ways to foster a thriving learning community in a virtual environment. During a particularly difficult period for student engagement these activities provided students with connections to the lecture content, to each other as peers, and to their wider communities.","Hatcher, April Salmeron Katie Craig Lauren",The FASEB Journal,,199

Although radiation therapy has become a major therapeutic choice for canine osteosarcoma, the high costs and unexpected side effects prevent some patients from considering this treatment. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is an ionized gas with high energy at low temperatures, and it produces reactive oxygen species that mediate many signaling pathways. Although many researchers have used CAP as an anticancer therapeutic approach in humans, its importance has been neglected in veterinary medicine. In this study, D-17 and DSN canine osteosarcoma cell lines were treated with CAP to observe its anticancer activity. By high-content screening and flow cytometry, CAP-treated cells showed growth arrest and apoptosis induction. Moreover, the osteosarcoma cells exhibited reduced migration and invasion activity when treated with CAP. Overall, CAP exerted an anticancer effect on canine osteosarcoma cell lines. CAP may have the potential to be used as a novel modality for treating cancer in veterinary medicine.","Lee, Jaehak; Moon, Hyunjin; Ku, Bonghye; Lee, Keunho; Hwang, Cheol-Yong; Baek, Seung Joon",,,199

284275,The TRIPS Intellectual Property Waiver Proposal: Creating the Right Incentives in Patent Law and Politics to end the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint),2021,"PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a systemic infection. Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS: We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P = .894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION: We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.","Brar, Gagandeep; Pinheiro, Laura C; Shusterman, Michael; Swed, Brandon; Reshetnyak, Evgeniya; Soroka, Orysya; Chen, Frank; Yamshon, Samuel; Vaughn, John; Martin, Peter; Paul, Doru; Hidalgo, Manuel; Shah, Manish A",J Clin Oncol,,199

Vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight; this paper describes how despite grandiose public statements, the current vaccine development, testing, and production methods may prove to be ethically dubious, medically dangerous, and socially volatile. The basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity. As this paper asserts, the public must be better informed to assess promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty.","Iserson, Kenneth V",Camb Q Healthc Ethics,,199

Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care - with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in IBD. In this Viewpoint, we share our experiences from a clinical and academic perspective in the United Kingdom, highlighting the early challenges encountered and consider implications for patients and staff at research sites, sponsors, research ethics committees, funders and regulators.

284933,Mangling the COVID Crisis: India’s Response to the Pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease that has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, mainly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. In addition to the widely described respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 may cause life-treating complications directly or indirectly related to this infection. Among these, thrombotic complications have emerged as an important issue in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients in intensive care units. Thrombotic complications due to COVID-19 are likely to occur due to a pro-coagulant pattern encountered in some of these patients or to a progressive endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome causing microvascular disease. In the present authors' experience, from five different hospitals in Italy and the UK, imaging has proved its utility in identifying these COVID-19-related thrombotic complications, with translational clinical relevance. The aim of this review is to illustrate thromboembolic complications directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, this review will show complications related to thromboembolism due to a pro-coagulant pattern from those likely related to an endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome.","Vernuccio, F; Lombardo, F P; Cannella, R; Panzuto, F; Giambelluca, D; Arzanauskaite, M; Midiri, M; Cabassa, P",Clin Radiol,,199

METHODS: We enrolled 2433 COVID-19 patients and used LASSO regression and multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models to identify the risk factors for disease progression and fatality. RESULTS: The median time for progression from mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, severe-to-critical, and critical-to-death were 3.0 (interquartile range: 1.8-5.5), 3.0 (1.0-7.0), 3.0 (1.0-8.0), and 6.5 (4.0-16.3) days, respectively. Among 1,758 mild or moderate patients at admission, 474 (27.0%) progressed to a severe or critical stage. Age above 60 years, elevated levels of blood glucose, respiratory rate, fever, chest tightness, c-reaction protein, lactate dehydrogenase, direct bilirubin, and low albumin and lymphocyte count were significant risk factors for progression. Of 675 severe or critical patients at admission, 41 (6.1%) died. Age above 74 years, elevated levels of blood glucose, fibrinogen and creatine kinase-MB, and low plateleta count were significant risk factors for fatality. Patients with elevated blood glucose level were 58% more likely to progress and 3.22 times more likely to die of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, elevated glucose level, and clinical indicators related to systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ failures, predict both the disease progression and the fatality of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Wenjun; Shen, Mingwang; Tao, Yusha; Fairley, Christopher K; Zhong, Qin; Li, Zongren; Chen, Hui; Ong, Jason J; Zhang, Dawei; Zhang, Kai; Xing, Ning; Guo, Huayuan; Qin, Enqiang; Guan, Xizhou; Yang, Feifei; Zhang, Sibing; Zhang, Lei; He, Kunlun",BMC Pulm Med,,199
285917,Appraisal of seismic noise scenario at national seismological network of India in COVID-19 lockdown situation,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents clinicians a unique set of challenges in managing breast cancer (BC) patients. As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over. In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties. Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios. Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment. Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over. Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country. Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic). Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.","Dietz, Jill R; Moran, Meena S; Isakoff, Steven J; Kurtzman, Scott H; Willey, Shawna C; Burstein, Harold J; Bleicher, Richard J; Lyons, Janice A; Sarantou, Terry; Baron, Paul L; Stevens, Randy E; Boolbol, Susan K; Anderson, Benjamin O; Shulman, Lawrence N; Gradishar, William J; Monticciolo, Debra L; Plecha, Donna M; Nelson, Heidi; Yao, Katharine A",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,199

286943,Analysis of Youths' Perspective in India On and During the Pandemic of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The constellation of the initial hyperglycemia, proinflammatory cytokines and severity of injury among trauma patients is understudied. We aimed to evaluate the patterns and effects of on-admission hyperglycemia and inflammatory response in a level 1 trauma center. We hypothesized that higher initial readings of blood glucose and cytokines are associated with severe injuries and worse in-hospital outcomes in trauma patients. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted for adult trauma patients who were admitted and tested for on-admission blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and hs-CRP. Patients were categorized into four groups [non-diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic hyperglycemic (DH) and stress-induced hyperglycemic (SIH)]. The inflammatory markers were measured on three time points (admission, 24 h and 48 h). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for the correlation for the inflammatory markers. Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression analysis were also performed. RESULTS: During the study period, 250 adult trauma patients were enrolled. Almost 13% of patients presented with hyperglycemia (50% had SIH and 50% had DH). Patients with SIH were younger, had significantly higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher IL-6 readings, prolonged hospital length of stay and higher mortality. The SIH group had lower Revised Trauma Score (p = 0.005), lower Trauma Injury Severity Score (p = 0.01) and lower GCS (p = 0.001). Patients with hyperglycemia had higher in-hospital mortality than the normoglycemia group (12.5% vs 3.7%; p = 0.02). A significant correlation was identified between the initial blood glucose level and serum lactate, IL-6, ISS and hospital length of stay. Overall rate of change in slope 88.54 (95% CI:-143.39-33.68) points was found more in hyperglycemia than normoglycemia group (p = 0.002) for IL-6 values, whereas there was no statistical significant change in slopes of age, gender and their interaction. The initial IL-6 levels correlated with ISS (r = 0.40, p = 0.001). On-admission hyperglycemia had an adjusted odds ratio 2.42 (95% CI: 1.076-5.447, p = 0.03) for severe injury (ISS > 12) after adjusting for age, shock index and blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: In trauma patients, on-admission hyperglycemia correlates well with the initial serum IL-6 level and is associated with more severe injuries. Therefore, it could be a simple marker of injury severity and useful tool for patient triage and risk assessment.

In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending. This includes the need to reimpose the same strategy as further waves unfold. Finally, we look ahead and address the lessons we can incorporate into post-COVID-19 rheumatology.","Romão, Vasco C; Cordeiro, Inês; Macieira, Carla; Oliveira-Ramos, Filipa; Romeu, José Carlos; Rosa, Carlos Miranda; Saavedra, Maria João; Saraiva, Fernando; Vieira-Sousa, Elsa; Fonseca, João Eurico",,,199

In our study, we characterize the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 in inpatients and healthcare workers (HCWs) at the University Hospital Münster (UHM) in northwest Germany. We identified 27 cases of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections (4 inpatients and 23 HCWs) who had contact with patients and/or HCWs without the use of adequate PPE. The contacts of these index cases were followed up for SARS-CoV-2 infection after unprotected exposure and a quantitative measure of probability of becoming infected, the attack rate, was calculated. In addition, transmission was evaluated in the context of infection control measures established during the pandemic and we compared the epidemiological data of all index cases, including symptoms and C tvalues of virology test results. The overall attack rate in the hospital setting was 1.3% (inpatients 0.9%, HCWs 1.6%). However, during an outbreak, the attack rate was 25.5% (inpatients 20.0%, HCWs 29.6%). For both scenarios, HCWs had a higher attack rate illustrating their role in healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Taken together, our experiences demonstrate how infection control measures can minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the healthcare setting.","Correa-Martínez, Carlos L.; Schwierzeck, Vera; Mellmann, Alexander; Hennies, Marc; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Microorg.,,199

All treatment measures and protocols were considered to be supportive only and not curative. During this current coronavirus pandemic, searching for pharmaceutical or traditional complementary and integrative medicine to assist with prevention, treatment, and recovery has been advantageous. These phytopharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals can be more economic, available, safe and lower side effects. This is in silico comparison study of ten phenolic antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2, as well as isolation of the most active metabolite from natural sources. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were also then prepared using these metabolite as a reducing agent. All tested compounds showed predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Hesperidin showed the highest docking score, this leads us to isolate it from the orange peels and we confirmed its structure by conventenional spectroscopic analysis. In addition, synthesis of hesperidin zinc oxide nanoparticles was characterized by UV, IR, XRD and TEM. In vitro antiviral activity of hesperidin and ZnO NPs was evaluated against hepatitis A virus as an example of RNA viruses. However, ZnO NPs and hesperidin showed antiviral activity against HAV but ZnO NPs showed higher activity than hesperidin. Thus, hesperidin and its mediated ZnO nanoparticles are willing antiviral agents and further studies against SARS-CoV-2 are required to be used as a potential treatment.","Attia, Gouda H; Moemen, Yasmine S; Youns, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Ammar M; Abdou, Randa; El Raey, Mohamed A",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,199

Objective: This was a prospective randomized, controlled open-label, blinded end point (PROBE) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed ayurvedic regimen (FAR) as an add-on to conventional treatment/standard of care (SOC) in the management of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection. Methodology: A total of 68 patients were recruited who consumed either FAR + SOC (n = 35) or SOC only (n = 33) for 28 days. Primary outcomes assessed were mean time required for clinical recovery and proportion of patients showing clinical recovery between the groups. Secondary outcomes assessed included mean time required for testing SARS-CoV-2 negative, change in clinical status on World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, number of days of hospitalization, change in disease progression and requirement of oxygen/intensive care unit admission/ventilator support/rescue medication, health status on WHO quality of life (QOL) BREF, and safety on the basis of occurrence of adverse event/serious adverse event (AE/SAE) and changes in laboratory parameters. Results: Patients consuming FAR as an add-on SOC showed faster clinical recovery from the day of onset of symptoms by 51.34% (P &lt; 0.05) as compared to SOC group. A higher proportion of patients taking FAR recovered within the first 2 weeks compared to those taking only SOC. It was observed that 5 times more patients recovered within 7 days in FAR group when compared to SOC (P &lt; 0.05) group. An earlier clinical recovery was observed in clinical symptoms such as sore throat, cough, loss of taste, and myalgia (P &lt; 0.05). Improvement in postclinical symptoms such as appetite, digestion, stress and anxiety was also observed to be better with the use of FAR. Requirement of rescue medications such as antipyretics, analgesics, and antibiotics was also found to be reduced in the FAR group (P &lt; 0.05). FAR showed a significant improvement in all the assessed domains of QOL. None of the AEs/SAE reported in the study were assessed to be related to the study drugs. Further, FAR did not produce any significant change in the laboratory safety parameters and was assessed to be safe. Conclusion: FAR could be an effective and safe add-on ayurvedic regimen to standard of care in the management of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.

296091,The Impact of the Covid-19 on the Perception of DMOs About the Sustainability Within Destinations: A European Empirical Approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: Traditional radiology fellowships are usually one or two year clinical trainings in a specific area after completion of a four-year residency. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format, using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: The great majority of the applicants (99%) answered positively (agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms have superior quality than printed in paper. Eighty-two percent of the applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of the cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Also, most of the candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms (65%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of audiovisual content as part of the selection process for radiology fellowships is a new approach to evaluate the potential to enhance the applicant's experience during this process. This technology also allows for the evaluation of candidates without the necessity of in-person interactions. Further studies could streamline these methods in order to minimize work redundancy with traditional text tests or even evaluate the acceptance of using only audiovisual content using smartphones.","Godoy, Ivan Rodrigues Barros; Neto, Luís Pecci; Skaf, Abdalla; Leão-Filho, Hilton Muniz; Freddi, Tomás De Andrade Lourenço; Jasinowodolinski, Dany; Yamada, André Fukunishi",,,199

Healthcare providers, community activists, politicians, members of faith-based organizations, professional athletes, and Black families are asking crucial questions about why Black and Brown people are disproportionately infected by, and dying from, the COVID-19. Evidence in healthcare and social sciences literature demonstrates that historically, systemic racism and injustices play a large role in the health and well-being of Blacks living in the USA. For decades, the National Black Nurses Association has been on the forefront, engaging our people using a collaborative community-based practice model. The healthcare goal in the USA should center on health protection, promotion, and prevention, moving toward a wellness model and away from treatment of illnesses that contribute to healthcare waste. Finally, awareness of social determinants of health has taken center stage, demonstrating how laws, policies, and practice affect health outcomes and the well-being of Black and Brown communities. In order to address social determinants of health and healthcare inequity, the National Black Nurses Association has called for an increase in the number of Black registered nurses and licensed vocational and practical nurses.

From February 1st to April 21st, 2020, 2115 COVID-19 patients were treated at Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón (Madrid, Spain), and 1419 were eventually admitted. Patient characteristics and outcomes were collected by reviewing their electronic medical records. Fourteen patients had a systemic arterial thrombotic event, which represents a 1% incidence in relation to the total number of hospitalized patients. Three patients suffered an acute coronary syndrome, two with persistent ST-segment elevation, one of whom was treated invasively, and one with transient ST-segment elevation. Eight patients had a cerebrovascular event. Six suffered an acute ischemic stroke and two a transient ischemic attack, 50% of them had a Rankin score &#8805; 3 at discharge. Three additional patients had a limb thrombotic event, all of them infrapopliteal, and were managed conservatively. All three cases developed necrosis of the toes, two of them with bilateral involvement. The hospitalization death rate of patients with an arterial event was 28.6%. Although COVID-19 may favor the occurrence of thrombotic events, the destabilization and thrombosis of arterial atherosclerotic plaques do not seem to be a frequent mechanism which warrants the need for specific systematic preventive measures.","Cantador, Estefanía; Núñez, Alberto; Sobrino, Pilar; Espejo, Victoria; Fabia, Lucía; Vela, Lydia; de Benito, Luis; Botas, Javier",J Thromb Thrombolysis,,199

At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, our PTB prevention clinic manages the care of approximately 1000 women/year. Women referred to the clinic are seen from 12 weeks of pregnancy with subsequent appointments every 2-4 weeks to measure cervical length (CL) using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Women with a history of cervical weakness or short cervix on TVUS are offered a cervical cerclage. LOCAL PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women were strongly advised to avoid social mixing and public transport. The National Health Service had to rapidly adopt remote consultation and redesign clinical pathways in order to reduce transmission, exposure and spread among women at high risk of PTB. METHODS: We focused on Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound aims and used a driver diagram to visualise our changes. We used a series of Plan Do Study Act cycles to evaluate and adapt change ideas through the UK's national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic between 23 March and 29 May 2020. RESULTS: We reduced the number of face-to-face appointments by 54%. This was achieved by increasing remote telephone consultations from 0% to 64%, and by reducing the intensity of surveillance. The rate of regional anaesthetic was increased from 53% to 95% for cerclage placement in order to minimise the number of aerosol-generating procedures. Patient and staff satisfaction responses to these changes were used to tailor practices. No women tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: By using quality improvement methodology, we were able to safely and rapidly implement a new care pathway for women at high risk of PTB which was acceptable to patients and staff, and effective in reducing exposure of COVID-19.","Zarasvand, Sara; Bayar, Erna; Adan, Malko; Mountain, Katherine; Lewis, Holly; Joash, Karen; Teoh, T G; Bennett, Phillip R; Das, Sabrina; Sykes, Lynne",,,199

297495,"COVID-19, mobility and self-isolation. Experiences of the Serbia’s citizens in the times of global pandemic",2020,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical information for monitoring the pandemic. The actual number of infections potentially exceeds the number of confirmed cases. DEVELOPMENT: We develop a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections, based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19-related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack IFR estimates, we scale them from a reference country based on remaining lifetime to better match the context in a target population with respect to age structure, health conditions and medical services. We introduce formulas to account for bias in input data and provide a heuristic to assess whether local seroprevalence estimates are representative for the total population. APPLICATION: Across 10 countries with most reported COVID-19 deaths as of 23 July 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be three [95% prediction interval: 2-8] times the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 5.3 million for the USA, 1.8 million for the UK, 1.4 million for France, and 0.4 million for Peru, or more than one, six, seven and more than one times the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Our central prevalence estimates for entire countries are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies. CONCLUSIONS: The national infection estimates indicate that the pandemic is far more widespread than the numbers of confirmed cases suggest. Some local seroprevalence estimates largely deviate from their corresponding national mean and are unlikely to be representative for the total population.","Bohk-Ewald, Christina; Dudel, Christian; Myrskylä, Mikko",Int J Epidemiol,,199

Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail adults with delirium.","Zazzara, Maria Beatrice; Penfold, Rose S; Roberts, Amy L; Lee, Karla A; Dooley, Hannah; Sudre, Carole H; Welch, Carly; Bowyer, Ruth C E; Visconti, Alessia; Mangino, Massimo; Freydin, Maxim B; El-Sayed Moustafa, Julia S; Small, Kerrin; Murray, Benjamin; Modat, Marc; Wolf, Jonathan; Ourselin, Sebastien; Graham, Mark S; Martin, Finbarr C; Steves, Claire J; Lochlainn, Mary Ni",Age ageing,,199

Objective: To assess whether helmet noninvasive ventilation can increase the days free of respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 compared with high-flow nasal oxygen alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;200). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, -2 to 6]; P = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, -21% [95% CI, -38% to -3%]; P = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; P = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -17% to 15%]; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.

Information about the SARS-CoV2 virus is evolving rapidly. At this time there are no interventions proven to be effective for cases infected with SARS-CoV2. Current knowledge about the clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 infection is reviewed and combined with knowledge about the immunopathogenic mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) to formulate theories and suggest possible therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV2 immunopathogenic mechanisms vary from immunosuppression that initially enables viral escape to a hyperinflammatory immune response.

Recent studies suggest that RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent organ damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug primidone (Liskantin®) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in a murine model of TNF&#945;-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state of cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1 activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to investigate the frequency and the impact on clinical outcome of PE elevation and acute pancreatitis in such patients. METHODS: Clinical data, laboratory tests, and cross-sectional images were analyzed from COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (>3 times of the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation. Multivariate analysis showed that mild and severe PE elevations were significantly associated with ICU admission (odds ratios, 5.51 [95% confidence interval, 2.36-12.89; P < 0.0001] and 26.2 [95% confidence interval, 4.82-142.39; P < 0.0001]).

The present study sought to understand parents' hesitancy and concerns around accessing healthcare during the pandemic using a cross-sectional survey of parents of children under the age of 16 (N = 1044) in Ireland. Multinomial and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors that influenced avoidance and hesitancy. In total, 34% of participants stated that their child required healthcare during the pandemic, of whom 22% decided against seeking healthcare. Parents who reported being much more hesitant about accessing healthcare were more likely to report mild-moderate (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 2.31, CI: 1.54-3.47) and severe-extremely severe stress (RRR: 3.37, CI: 1.81-6.27). Parents who understood government advice to mean avoiding health services were more likely to be hesitant to attend (RRR: 1.71, CI; 1.10-2.67). These effects held when restrictions were beginning to be lifted. Higher levels of stress were associated with a parent believing that the government advice meant that they should not attend health services (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.14-2.41).

Using this approach, we identify 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b.

METHODS: NtAbs were titrated as dose inhibiting 50% virus replication (ID50) by live virus microneutralization. Forty-one HCW recovering from mild or asymptomatic infection were evaluated on the day of first-dose vaccination (T1_inf) and 21 days later (T2_inf). Sixteen uninfected HCW were evaluated 20 days after the first dose (T2_uninf) and 20 days after the second dose of vaccine (T3_inf). RESULTS: At T2_inf, but not at T1_inf, there was a significant correlation between days from diagnosis (median [IQR] 313 [285-322]) and NtAb levels (p = 0.011). NtAb titres increased at T2_inf with respect to T1_inf (1544 [732-2232] vs. 26 [10-88]; p < 0.001).

We investigated the relationship between altitude and the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. Epidemiological data included the number of positive cases, deaths, and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. In particular, we analyzed data from 70 cities with altitudes between 1 and 3,180 m. Correlations and linear regression models adjusted to population density were performed to examine the relationship and contribution of altitude to epidemiological variables. The case fatality rate was negatively correlated with the altitude of the cities. The incidence of cases and deaths from COVID-19 had an apparent correlation with altitude; however, these variables were better explained by population density. In general, these findings suggest that living at high altitude can reduce the impact of COVID-19, especially the case fatality rate.","Cano-Pérez, Eder; Torres-Pacheco, Jaison; Fragozo-Ramos, María Carolina; García-Díaz, Génesis; Montalvo-Varela, Eduardo; Pozo-Palacios, Juan Carlos",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,199
305730,Memories of War and the COVID-19 Crisis in Spain,2020,"Aiming at improving the air quality and protecting public health, policies such as restricting factories, motor vehicles, and fireworks have been widely implemented. However, fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis of these policies' effectiveness is lacking. This paper collected the hourly meteorological and PM2.5 data for three typical emission scenarios in Hubei, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Then, this study simulated the PM2.5 concentration under the same meteorological conditions and different emission scenarios based on a reliable hourly spatiotemporal random forest model (R2 exceeded 0.84). Finally, we investigated the fine-grained spatiotemporal impact of restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks on PM2.5 concentrations from the perspective of hours, days, regions, and land uses, excluding meteorological interference. On average, restricting factories and vehicles reduced the PM2.5 concentration at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00 by 18.57, 16.22, 25.00, and 19.07 µg/m3, respectively. Spatially, it had the highest and quickest impact on Hubei, with a 27.05 µg/m3 decrease of PM2.5 concentration and 17 day lag to begin to show significant decline. This was followed by YRD, which experienced a 23.52 µg/m3 decrease on average and a 23 day lag. BTH was the least susceptible; the PM2.5 concentration decreased by only 8.2 µg/m3. In addition, influenced by intensive human activities, the cultivated, urban, and rural lands experienced a larger decrease in PM2.5 concentration. These empirical results revealed that restricting factories, vehicles, and fireworks is effective in alleviating air pollution and the effect showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The policymakers should further investigate influential factors of hourly PM2.5 concentrations, combining with local geographical and social environment, and implement more effective and targeted policies to improve local air quality, especially for BTH and the air quality at morning and night.","Yang, Mei; Fan, Hong; Zhao, Kang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199
305755,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Academic Plans and Career Intentions of Future STEM Professionals,2020,"Remote digital pathology allows healthcare systems to maintain pathology operations during public health emergencies. Existing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations require pathologists to electronically verify patient reports from a certified facility. During the 2019 pandemic of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SAR-CoV-2 virus, this requirement potentially exposes pathologists, their colleagues, and household members to the risk of becoming infected. Relaxation of government enforcement of this regulation allows pathologists to review and report pathology specimens from a remote, non-CLIA certified facility. The availability of digital pathology systems can facilitate remote microscopic diagnosis, although formal comprehensive (case-based) validation of remote digital diagnosis has not been reported. All glass slides representing routine clinical signout workload in surgical pathology subspecialties at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were scanned on an Aperio GT450 at ×40 equivalent resolution (0.26 µm/pixel). Twelve pathologists from nine surgical pathology subspecialties remotely reviewed and reported complete pathology cases using a digital pathology system from a non-CLIA certified facility through a secure connection. Whole slide images were integrated to and launched within the laboratory information system to a custom vendor-agnostic, whole slide image viewer. Remote signouts utilized consumer-grade computers and monitors (monitor size, 13.3-42 in.; resolution, 1280 × 800-3840 × 2160 pixels) connecting to an institution clinical workstation via secure virtual private network. Pathologists subsequently reviewed all corresponding glass slides using a light microscope within the CLIA-certified department. Intraobserver concordance metrics included reporting elements of top-line diagnosis, margin status, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, pathology stage, and ancillary testing. The median whole slide image file size was 1.3 GB; scan time/slide averaged 90 s; and scanned tissue area averaged 612 mm2. Signout sessions included a total of 108 cases, comprised of 254 individual parts and 1196 slides. Major diagnostic equivalency was 100% between digital and glass slide diagnoses; and overall concordance was 98.8% (251/254). This study reports validation of primary diagnostic review and reporting of complete pathology cases from a remote site during a public health emergency. Our experience shows high (100%) intraobserver digital to glass slide major diagnostic concordance when reporting from a remote site. This randomized, prospective study successfully validated remote use of a digital pathology system including operational feasibility supporting remote review and reporting of pathology specimens, and evaluation of remote access performance and usability for remote signout.","Hanna, Matthew G; Reuter, Victor E; Ardon, Orly; Kim, David; Sirintrapun, Sahussapont Joseph; Schüffler, Peter J; Busam, Klaus J; Sauter, Jennifer L; Brogi, Edi; Tan, Lee K; Xu, Bin; Bale, Tejus; Agaram, Narasimhan P; Tang, Laura H; Ellenson, Lora H; Philip, John; Corsale, Lorraine; Stamelos, Evangelos; Friedlander, Maria A; Ntiamoah, Peter; Labasin, Marc; England, Christine; Klimstra, David S; Hameed, Meera",Mod Pathol,,199

Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminaemia may serve as severity marker of epithelial-endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19. There are clues that pulmonary capillary leak syndrome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and might be a potential therapeutic target.","Wu, M A; Fossali, T; Pandolfi, L; Carsana, L; Ottolina, D; Frangipane, V; Rech, R; Tosoni, A; Lopez, G; Agarossi, A; Cogliati, C; Meloni, F; Marchini, B; Nebuloni, M; Catena, E; Colombo, R",J. intern. med,,199

Compared to patients with influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited largely equivalent lymphocyte counts, fewer monocytes, and lower surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class II expression on selected monocyte populations. Furthermore, decreased HLA-DR on intermediate monocytes predicted severe COVID-19 disease. In contrast to prevailing assumptions, very few (7 of 168) patients with COVID-19 exhibited cytokine profiles indicative of cytokine storm syndrome. After controlling for multiple factors including age and sample time point, patients with COVID-19 exhibited lower cytokine levels than patients with influenza. Up-regulation of IL-6, G-CSF, IL-1RA, and MCP1 predicted death in patients with COVID-19 but were not statistically higher than patients with influenza. Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed profound suppression of interferon signaling among patients with COVID-19.

The present study focused on larval development after the exposure of two F. enigmaticus populations (Mediterranean and Atlantic, collected in Italy and Portugal, respectively) to different trace elements (copper, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) at different concentrations. Results of larval development assays were presented as the percentage of abnormal developed larvae. The effect, measured in terms of EC50 for all toxicants tested, showed that mercury was the most toxic metal for larvae of both populations. Specifically, the tested trace elements may be racked in the following order from the highest to the lowest toxicity: Mediterranean: mercury > copper > lead > arsenic > cadmium; Atlantic: mercury > copper > cadmium > arsenic > lead. Responses of both populations were similar for arsenic. Lead was the least toxic element for the Atlantic population, while cadmium showed the least toxicity for the Mediterranean population. These preliminary results demonstrate the sensitivity and suitability of the organisms to be used in ecotoxicological bioassays and monitoring protocols. Moreover, chemical analyses on soft tissues and calcareous tubes of collected test organisms and their sampling site water were performed, to identify and quantify the concentration of the tested trace elements in these 3 matrices. Populations exhibited less sensitivity to a certain element together with a relevantly higher concentration of the same element in soft tissues. This may indicate a certain resistance to particular contaminant toxic effects by organisms that tend to accumulate the same toxicant. This highlights the potential correlation between wild-caught test organisms' responses and a deep characterization of the sampling site to identify putative abnormalities or differences in model organism response during bioassay execution.","Sanches, Matilde Vieira; Oliva, Matteo; Pires, Adília; De Marchi, Lucia; Cuccaro, Alessia; Freitas, Rosa; Baratti, Mariella; Pretti, Carlo",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,199

In this study, we examined long-term trends in groundwater levels across the DMR from 1996 to 2018. Station level data collected by the Central Groundwater Board for 258 stations at the seasonal scale were visualized and interpreted using geospatial analysis. The spatial patterns of the trends in groundwater levels revealed increasing depths of groundwater levels, except the Yamuna River floodplains. The main cause for the decline is related to the rapid growth in population accompanied with high-density impervious urban land uses, leading to lower levels of recharge vs unlimited withdrawal of groundwater for daily needs. In addition, the local geology in the form of clayey soils in northwest DMR also contributed to the lower levels of recharge. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the trend and delineate the zones of differential recharge. Furthermore, the level of contaminants were analyzed at the district level for fluorides and nitrates. The presence of fluoride contamination was mostly concentrated in the northwestern district, while the nitrate exceedance was more widespread. These findings will help in achieving the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of United Nations by 2030 as well as goals identified in Delhi's master plan of 2041.","Roy, Shouraseni Sen; Rahman, Atiqur; Ahmed, Shakeel; Ahmad, Ishita Afreen",Environ Monit Assess,,199

310543,Claiming Health as a Public Good in the Post-COVID-19 Era,2020,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is a plausible risk factor for COVID-19 progression and complications. Smoking cessation digital platforms transcend pandemic-driven social distancing and lockdown measures in terms of assisting smokers in their quit attempts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine trends in the number of visitors, followers, and subscribers on smoking cessation digital platforms from January to April 2020 and to compare these traffic data to those observed during the same 4-month period in 2019. The examination of prepandemic and postpandemic trends in smoking cessation digital platform traffic can reveal whether interest in smoking cessation among smokers is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained cross-sectional data from daily visitors on the SmokeFree website; the followers of six SmokeFree social media accounts; and subscribers to the SmokeFree SMS text messaging and mobile app interventions of the National Cancer Institute's SmokeFree.gov initiative platforms, which are publicly available to US smokers. Average daily percentage changes (ADPCs) were used to measure trends for the entire 2020 and 2019 study periods, whereas daily percentage changes (DPCs) were used to measure trends for each time segment of change within each 4-month period. Data analysis was conducted in May and June 2020. RESULTS: The number of new daily visitors on the SmokeFree website (between days 39 and 44: DPC=18.79%; 95% CI 5.16% to 34.19%) and subscribers to the adult-focused interventions QuitGuide (between days 11 and 62: DPC=1.11%; 95% CI 0.80% to 1.43%) and SmokeFreeTXT (between days 11 and 89: DPC=0.23%; 95% CI 0.004% to 0.47%) increased, but this was followed by declines in traffic. No comparable peaks were observed in 2019. The number of new daily subscribers to quitSTART (ie, the teen-focused intervention) trended downward in 2020 (ADPC=-1.02%; 95% CI -1.88% to -0.15%), whereas the overall trend in the number of subscribers in 2019 was insignificant (P=.07). The number of SmokeFree social media account followers steadily increased by <0.1% over the 4-month study periods in 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Peaks in traffic on the SmokeFree website and adult-focused intervention platforms in 2020 could be attributed to an increased interest in smoking cessation among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coordinated campaigns, especially those for adolescents, should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise awareness of digital smoking cessation platforms to capitalize on smokers' heightened interest during the pandemic.","El-Toukhy, Sherine",J Med Internet Res,,199

Encouraging uptake for cervical screening was always a priority before the pandemic, but it is even more important now, considering that the fears and barriers to screening that women may have are now exacerbated by COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This article explores the impact of the pandemic on the uptake of cervical screening within NHS Ayrshire & Arran and evaluates potential strategies to improve uptake now and in future such as self-sampling and telemedicine. METHODS: This article presents evidence-based literature and local health board data relating to cervical screening during the pandemic. RESULTS: Human papilloma virus self-sampling carried out by the woman in her home has been shown to improve uptake, especially in non-attenders, whilst maintaining a high sensitivity and, crucially, reducing the need for face-to-face contact. Increased education is key to overcoming barriers women have to screening and telemedicine can strengthen engagement with women during this time. CONCLUSION: There are lessons to be learned from the pandemic, and we must use this opportunity to improve cervical screening uptake for the future.","Masson, Hannah",Womens Health (Lond),,199

Apart from affecting respiratory system, current evidence has demonstrated multiorgan manifestations that SARS-Cov-2 infection may actually have. However, one of the medical hypotheses not yet thoroughly tested is the impact on female reproductive system and more specifically cervix. No large observational studies have been performed to test presence of SARS-Cov-2 in cervical samples, while potential correlation and impact on HPV infection has not yet been examined. In this context, our research team has already planned to begin a prospective observational study regarding detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in cervical cytology. The collected specimen will be analyzed for the presence of COVID-19 genetic material and in case of positive results, HPV typing will be performed as well in order to detect potential correlations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HPV-infection. We would therefore like to launch our idea to control for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cervical specimen as well as examine potential correlation with HPV infection. Potential scientific proof of such hypothesis would change much regarding follow-up of HPV-positive patients while also triggering further research regarding aitiopathogenetic pathways of COVID. Communication of such a medical hypothesis could potentially motivate colleagues worldwide to expand their interest also on the research of SARS-CoV-2 cervical infection, in an effort to optimize our level of knowledge towards this new threatening and unknown reality of SARS-CoV-2.","Vavoulidis, Eleftherios; Margioula-Siarkou, Chrysoula; Petousis, Stamatios; Dinas, Konstantinos",Med Hypotheses,,199

The study included 50 patients who were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone group or control group. Dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 20 mg/day from day 1-5 and then at 10 mg/day from day 6-10. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation, death rate, duration of clinical improvement, length of hospital stay, and radiological changes in the computed tomography scan were assessed. The results revealed that 92% and 96% of patients in the dexamethasone and control groups, respectively, required noninvasive ventilation (P = 0.500). Among them, 52% and 44% of patients in the dexamethasone and control groups, respectively, required invasive mechanical ventilation (P = 0.389). At the end of the study, 64% of patients in the dexamethasone group and 60% of patients in the control group died (P = 0.500); the remaining patients were discharged from the hospital during the 28-day follow-up period. The median length of hospital stay was 11 days in the dexamethasone group and 6 days in the control group (P = 0.036) and the median length of hospital stay was 7 days in the dexamethasone group and 3 days in the control group (P < 0.001).

Lower limb point-of-care clinical ultrasound (POCUS) could detect occult clots, helping decide whom to treat with anticoagulation. OBJECTIVES: To determine proximal DVT prevalence with POCUS screening among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Lower limb POCUS was performed in all patients admitted either to the ward or intensive care unit (ICU) between April 22nd and 30th 2020. Clinical and laboratory features, prescriptions, thrombotic complications and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 87 patients were screened, of which 26 (29.8%) either had been discharged from ICU (19.5%) or were still in critical condition (10.3%). DVT was found in 4 patients (3 femoral, 1 popliteal), of which 1 had not received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis. 21 CT pulmonary angiograms were performed, being positive for PE in 5 cases (23.8%); only 2 of these patients suffered DVT. CONCLUSIONS: Screening lower extremities with POCUS did not find a high rate of DVT among patients receiving LMWH-prophylaxis.

Our current study aimed to identify specific COVID-19 18F-FDG-PET signs in patients that were (i) suspected to have a lung infection based on 18F-FDG-PET/CT recorded during the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) whose COVID-19 diagnosis was definitely established or excluded by appropriate viral testing. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients referred for routine 18F-FDG-PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 outbreak (March 25th to May 15th 2020) and for whom CT slices were evocative of a lung infection were included in the study. All patients had undergone a SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19 infection (positivity was based on molecular and/or serological tests) or exclude it (negativity of at least the serological test). RESULTS: Eleven patients were confirmed to be affected by COVID-19 (COVID+), whereas the other eleven patients were not (COVID-) and were predominantly suspected of having bacterial pneumonia. CT abnormalities were not significantly different between COVID+ and COVID- groups, although trends toward larger CT abnormalities (p = 0.16) and lower rates of consolidation patterns (0.09) were observed in the COVID+ group. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of lung areas with CT abnormalities were however significantly lower in the COVID+ than the COVID- group (3.7 ± 1.9 vs. 6.9 ± 4.1, p = 0.03), with the highest SUVmax consistently not associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Among CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection, those related to COVID-19 are associated with a more limited 18F-FDG uptake. This observation may help improve our ability to detect COVID-19 patients.","Bahloul, Achraf; Boursier, Caroline; Jeulin, Hélène; Imbert, Laëtitia; Mandry, Damien; Karcher, Gilles; Marie, Pierre-Yves; Verger, Antoine",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,199

BACKGROUND: The correct use of face masks and consensus among health professionals across the globe is essential for containing pandemics, and nurses need to act according to policy to protect themselves, educate the public and preserve resources for frontline health workers. Paper masks are worn by health professionals and the general public to avoid the transmission of respiratory infections, such as COVID-19, but there appear to be differences in health beliefs of nurses within and between countries regarding these. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study used content analysis with a framework approach. FINDINGS: There were major differences in nurse participants' beliefs between and within countries, including how nurses use paper masks and their understanding of their efficacy. In addition, there were cultural differences in the way that nurses use masks in their daily lives and nursing practice contexts. CONCLUSION: Nurses from different working environments, countries and areas of practice hold a variety of health beliefs about mask wearing at the personal and professional level. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked much discussion about the critical importance of masks for the safety of health professionals, and there has been considerable discussion and disagreement about health policies regarding mask use by the general public. Improper use of masks may have a role in creating mask shortages or transmitting infections. An evidence-based global policy on mask use for respiratory illnesses for health professionals, including nurses, and the general public needs to be adopted and supported by a wide-reaching education campaign.","Omura, M; Stone, T E; Petrini, M A; Cao, R",Int Nurs Rev,,199
315713,Fármacos utilizados no tratamento do COVID-19 em pediatria: revisão integrativa,2020,"Several lines of existing evidence support the possibility of airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, quantitative information on the relative importance of transmission pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains limited. To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we developed a modeling framework and leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors. A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R 2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R 2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases across the entire simulation period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of larger respiratory droplets and smaller respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among the passengers, even considering a conservative assumption of high ventilation rates and no air recirculation conditions for the cruise ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions.","Azimi, Parham; Keshavarz, Zahra; Cedeno Laurent, Jose Guillermo; Stephens, Brent; Allen, Joseph G",Proc.

It altered peoples way of life and shocked the world economy. In the United States, political ideology has clashed with the fight against the pandemic. President Trumps denial prevailed despite the warnings from the WHO and scientists who alerted of the seriousness of the situation. Despite this, some state governments did not remain passive in the absence of federal government measures, and passed laws restricting mobility (lockdowns). Consequently, the political polarity was accentuated. On the one hand, the defenders of more severe public health measures and, on the other, the advocates of individual rights and freedom above any other consideration. In this study, we analyze whether political partisanship and the political ideology has influenced the way Covid-19 was handled at the outbreak. Specifically, we analyze by using a Diff-in-Diff model, whether the ideology of each state, measure at three levels, affected the decrease in the NO2 levels observed after the pandemic outbreak in the US. We distinguish three alternative post-Covid periods and results show that the State ideology has a robust negative impact on the NO2 levels.

Methodology To better elucidate the public interest in the information regarding ""chest pain"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a Google Trends analysis from March 2019 to March 2021 to compare the internet searches between pre-COVID era and during the pandemic with country-wise [the United States (US) versus the United Kingdom (UK) versus India] variation. Results We observed a significantly rising public interest in ""chest pain"" internet searches during the peak COVID-19 pandemic. Rising trends were most prominent in the UK, followed by USA and India. Our analysis noted a spike in the trend of ""chest pain"" search in early March in the UK and USA, whereas in March and June 2020 for India. This shows an important temporal association between the surge of COVID-19 cases and the search for ""chest pain"" online. Conclusion Google Trends analyses indicate rising public interest in chest pain during the pandemic months and the possible association between COVID-19 and chest pain. These findings warrant further research, especially with increasing reports suggesting contradictory reports of decreased hospital visits by patients with known cardiovascular diseases.","Fong, H.

Overall, Risk Information Seeking and Processing variables such as information insufficiency and perceived information gathering capacity predicted the use of all four evidence types. However, other Risk Information Seeking and Processing variables (e.g. informational subjective norms) did not emerge as important predictors.

322481,"Covid-19: Excess deaths vary widely across England and Wales, show data",2020,"BACKGROUND: Initial reports indicate a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but more data are required to clarify if COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for AKI and how COVID-19-associated AKI may differ from AKI due to other causes. We therefore sought to study the relationship between COVID-19, AKI, and outcomes in a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to 2 acute hospitals in Derby, United Kingdom. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We extracted electronic data from 4,759 hospitalised patients who were tested for COVID-19 between 5 March 2020 and 12 May 2020. The data were linked to electronic patient records and laboratory information management systems. The primary outcome was AKI, and secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, need for ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of stay. As compared to the COVID-19-negative group (n = 3,374), COVID-19 patients (n = 1,161) were older (72.1 ± 16.1 versus 65.3 ± 20.4 years, p < 0.001), had a greater proportion of men (56.6% versus 44.9%, p < 0.001), greater proportion of Asian ethnicity (8.3% versus 4.0%, p < 0.001), and lower proportion of white ethnicity (75.5% versus 82.5%, p < 0.001). AKI developed in 304 (26.2%) COVID-19-positive patients (COVID-19 AKI) and 420 (12.4%) COVID-19-negative patients (AKI controls). COVID-19 patients aged 65 to 84 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.50), needing mechanical ventilation (OR 8.74, 95% CI 5.27 to 14.77), having congestive cardiac failure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.50), chronic liver disease (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.00), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.97 to 4.01) had higher odds for developing AKI. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 AKI versus COVID-19 patients without AKI (60.5% versus 27.4%, p < 0.001), and AKI was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.39 to 4.48). Compared with AKI controls, COVID-19 AKI was observed in a higher proportion of men (58.9% versus 51%, p = 0.04) and lower proportion with white ethnicity (74.7% versus 86.9%, p = 0.003); was more frequently associated with cerebrovascular disease (11.8% versus 6.0%, p = 0.006), chronic lung disease (28.0% versus 19.3%, p = 0.007), diabetes (24.7% versus 17.9%, p = 0.03), and CKD (34.2% versus 20.0%, p < 0.001); and was more likely to be hospital acquired (61.2% versus 46.4%, p < 0.001). Mortality was higher in the COVID-19 AKI as compared to the control AKI group (60.5% versus 27.6%, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AKI patients aged 65 to 84 years, (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.35) and &#8805;85 years of age (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.87 to 6.70), peak AKI stage 2 (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.90), AKI stage 3 (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.57), and COVID-19 (OR 3.80, 95% CI 2.62 to 5.51) had higher odds of death. Limitations of the study include retrospective design, lack of urinalysis data, and low ethnic diversity of the region. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 that was associated with a 3-fold higher odds of death than COVID-19 without AKI and a 4-fold higher odds of death than AKI due to other causes. These data indicate that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored for the development of AKI and measures taken to prevent this.

We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have a higher mortality-rate (390 of 1012 = 39%) compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin (270 of 1939 = 14%), presenting a risk ratio of 2.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [2.42, 3.16]; p = 4.45e-52). This difference persists even after balancing on a number of covariates including demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and method of oxygenation, with an increased mortality rate on discharge from the hospital of 37% (268 of 733) for unfractionated heparin versus 22% (154 of 711) for enoxaparin, presenting a risk ratio of 1.69 (95% CI: [1.42, 2.00]; p = 1.5e-8). In these balanced cohorts, a number of complications occurred at an elevated rate for patients administered unfractionated heparin compared to patients administered enoxaparin, including acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, septic shock, and anemia. Furthermore, a higher percentage of Black/African American COVID patients (414 of 1294 [32%]) were noted to receive unfractionated heparin compared to White/Caucasian COVID patients (671 of 2644 [25%]), risk ratio 1.26 (95% CI: [1.14, 1.40]; p = 7.5e-5). After balancing upon available clinical covariates, this difference in anticoagulant use remained statistically significant (311 of 1047 [30%] for Black/African American vs. 263 of 1047 [25%] for White/Caucasian, p = .02, risk ratio 1.18; 95% CI: [1.03, 1.36]). While retrospective studies cannot suggest any causality, these findings motivate the need for follow-up prospective research into the observed racial disparity in anticoagulant use and outcomes for severe COVID-19 patients.","Kirkup, Christian; Pawlowski, Colin; Puranik, Arjun; Conrad, Ian; O039,; Horo, John C; Gomaa, Dina; Banner-Goodspeed, Valerie M; Mosier, Jarrod M; Zabolotskikh, Igor Borisovich; Daugherty, Steven K; Bernstein, Michael A; Zaren, Howard A; Bansal, Vikas; Pickering, Brian; Badley, Andrew D; Kashyap, Rahul; Venkatakrishnan, A J; Soundararajan, Venky",J Med Virol,,199

METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Individuals with confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 admitted in our hospital were included. Blood samples were obtained systematically on days 1 and 4 of hospitalization. Levels of RCP, LDH, Ferritin and D-dimer, together with platelets, lymphocytes and neutrophils counts were measured. A combined outcome that included ICU admission and death was considered the primary outcome. Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: We included 335 patients with confirmed COVID-19. During their hospitalization, 23 (6.8%) needed ICU admission, and 10 (2.9%) died. In the multivariate analysis, a value of RCP greater than 10 mg/dl (OR 8.69, CI95% 1.45-52), an increase in RCP greater than 20% (OR 26.08, CI 95% 3.21-211.3), an increase in LDH greater than 20% (OR 6.29, CI 95% 1.84-21.44), a count of lymphocytes lower than 1500/mm3 (OR 2.74, CI 95% 1.04-7.23), a D-dimer value greater than 550 ng/ml (OR 9.8, CI 95% 1.78-53.9) and a neutrophil/lymphocyte index greater than 3(OR 4.5, CI 95% 1.43-14.19) were all associated with the primary outcome.

325637,Analysis of the government's crisis communication strategy discourse to defend COVID-19,2021,"This work tries to answer the following question: can healthcare be engineered using lean management tools? Lean is known to achieve successful results when implemented in the manufacturing sector. Typical results are operational cost reduction, cycle time reduction, and higher customer satisfaction. The service sector, however, has seen mixed results. For the last two decades, educators and healthcare professionals are trying to implement lean tools in healthcare. Some reported success and many did not, for variety of reasons. In this paper, we search the literature and reveal the special nature of healthcare services, success factors, and barriers facing implementation of lean in healthcare. We then conduct a survey of 18 elite Jordanian hospitals to study the case holistically. Statistical analysis of the survey results confirmed some of what the literature revealed; organizational leadership seems to be the most dominant factor, followed by knowledge of employees about lean, training, and patient satisfaction (customer focus). Another important finding, not captured by the literature, is that lean implementation success depends on educating physicians about continuous improvement and lean and ensuring they are part of the improvement team. Based on the revealed enablers and obstacles, we created a full lean implementation framework. This framework was then used along with selected engineering tools to implement lean in a major hospital successfully. Implementation results showed 60% of reduction in cycle time, 80% reduction in operational cost, and many other benefits.","Abdallah, Abdallah A",J Healthc Eng,,199
325786,An integrated framework of socio-economic and technological interventions for COVID-19 in different economies,2020,"We analyzed the nucleocapsid and surface proteins from several Coronaviridae viruses using an alignment-free computer program. Three isolates of novel, human coronavirus (SARS0CoV-2) (2019) that are responsible for the current pandemic and older SARS strains of human and animal coronaviruses were examined. The nucleocapsid and glycoprotein sequences are identical for the three novel 2019 human isolates and they are closely related to these sequences in six bat and human SARS coronaviruses. This strongly supports the bat origin of the pandemic, novel coronavirus. One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus. BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains. This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein sequence homologies of 58.9% and 82.5%, respectively, between the novel SARS0CoV-2 strains and the human SARS (2018) virus suggest that existing anti-SARS vaccines may provide some protection against the novel coronavirus.","Basu, Babu V; Brown, Olen R",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),,199
325834,Explanation of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis based on disinformation theory: a commentary,2020,"Over the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent that the microbiome is a central component in human well-being and illness. However, to establish innovative therapeutic methods, it is crucial to learn more about the microbiota. Thereby, the area of metagenomics and associated bioinformatics methods and tools has become considerable in the study of the human microbiome biodiversity. The application of these metagenomics approaches to studying the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients could be one of the promising areas of research in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disparity. Therefore, understanding how the gut microbiome is affected by or could affect the SARS-CoV-2 is very important. Herein, we present an overview of approaches and methods used in the current published studies on COVID-19 patients and the gut microbiome. The accuracy of these researches depends on the appropriate choice and the optimal use of the metagenomics bioinformatics platforms and tools. Interestingly, most studies reported that COVID-19 patients' microbiota are enriched with opportunistic microorganisms. The choice and use of appropriate computational tools and techniques to accurately investigate the gut microbiota is therefore critical in determining the appropriate microbiome profile for diagnosis and the most reliable antiviral or preventive microbial composition.","Sehli, Sofia; Allali, Imane; Chahboune, Rajaa; Bakri, Youssef; Al Idrissi, Najib; Hamdi, Salsabil; Nejjari, Chakib; Amzazi, Saaïd; Ghazal, Hassan",Bioinform Biol Insights,,199

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.","Traylor, Claire S; Johnson, Jasmine D; Kimmel, Mary C; Manuck, Tracy A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,199

METHODS: Eighty-six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 were enrolled in January-February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID-19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1-4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non-smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID-19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS-CoV-2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID-19, it is well-established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.","Watanabe, Mikiko; Balena, Angela; Tuccinardi, Dario; Tozzi, Rossella; Risi, Renata; Masi, Davide; Caputi, Alessandra; Rossetti, Rebecca; Spoltore, Maria Elena; Filippi, Valeria; Gangitano, Elena; Manfrini, Silvia; Mariani, Stefania; Lubrano, Carla; Lenzi, Andrea; Mastroianni, Claudio; Gnessi, Lucio",Diabetes metab. res. rev,,199

We aimed to review data of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published retrospective studies on the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. METHODS: We searched in four bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science) for studies March 10, 2020 focused on the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV for meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to quality assessment, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger's test. In the meta-analysis, a random-effects model with Stata/SE software, v.14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis with 8815 patients and the mean age was 46 years and 4647 (52.7%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of clinical symptoms were: fever (83%, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.89), cough (59%, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.69), myalgia or fatigue (31%, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.39), sputum production (29%, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.39), and dyspnea (19%, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.26).

It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (OR = 1.62) and sleep disorder (OR = 1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (OR = 1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (OR = 1.44, OR = 1.83, OR = 2.61) or >5000 CNY (OR = 1.47, OR = 1.45, OR = 2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (OR = 1.45, OR = 1.71, OR = 1. 85, OR = 1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor's degree and above) (OR = 1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder. Wuhan residents' psychological status and sleep quality were relatively poorer than they were before the COVID-19 epidemic; however, the rate of passive coping to stress was relatively higher.","Fu, Wenning; Wang, Chao; Zou, Li; Guo, Yingying; Lu, Zuxun; Yan, Shijiao; Mao, Jing",Transl Psychiatry,,199

A modification of the WWII metaphor can ensure that the narrative formulating around COVID-19 is inclusive of the women's reproductive health needs that are eminently present.","Bailey, Yuki; Shankar, Megha; Phillips, Patrick",Med. humanit,,199

329140,Gen Z Explorative Study on Tourism Activities in the Pandemic COVID-19 (preprint),2021,"Some international pharmaceutical companies have succeeded in producing vaccines against COVID-19. Countries all over the world have aimed to obtain these vaccines with minimum cost. We consider a set of K-independent Markovian waiting lists. Each list contains a set of countries, where each one of them has an exponential service time and a Poisson arrival process. These companies differ in some characteristics such as the vaccine production cost and the speed of the required quantity delivery. We present a new detection model that helps in providing an appropriate decision to choose a suitable company. Moreover, the concept of balking and the retention of reneged countries is taken into consideration under the quality control process of each waiting list. Under steady state, we face an interesting and difficult discrete stochastic optimization problem. Its solution gives an optimal distribution of the searching effort, which is bounded by a known probability distribution. A simulation study has been derived to get the minimum value of the paid cost random values. The highest service rate, the total expected profit of each queuing system, and the optimum performance measures, which depend on this cost, have been obtained to show the effectiveness of this model.","El-Hadidy, Mohamed Abd Allah; Alfreedi, Ajab A",,,199
329265,INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE: Preliminary investigations into the COVID-19 pandemic and management in Africa,2021,"Air pollution is the culprit to yearly millions of deaths worldwide, deteriorating human health. What is not yet clear is the impact of environmental factors on susceptibility to getting infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The study aimed to determine associations between air quality, meteorological factors, and COVID-19 cases in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Air pollutants and meteorological data in 2018–2020 were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia, while daily new COVID-19 cases in 2020 were obtained from the Ministry of Health Malaysia. Data collected were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). There were significant differences between PM 10, PM 2.5, SO 2, NO 2, CO, O 3,and solar radiation in 2019 and 2020 since movement control order (MCO) was implemented on 18 March 2020. Spearman’s correlation test showed that COVID-19 cases were positively correlated with PM 10(r = 0.131, p &lt; 0.001), PM 2.5(r = 0.151, p &lt; 0.001), SO 2(r = 0.091, p = 0.003), NO 2(r = 0.228, p &lt; 0.001), CO (r = 0.269, p = 0.001), and relative humidity (RH) (r = 0.106, p = 0.001), whereas ambient temperature (AT) was negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases (r = –0.118, p &lt; 0.001). Further, multiple linear regression suggested that NO 2and AT (R 2= 0.071, p &lt; 0.001, f 2= 0.08) were the most significant air pollutant and meteorological factors with weak contribution that influenced the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Kuala Lumpur. In general, better air quality, lower RH, higher AT, along with the targeted approach implemented thus far, have proven to curb the spread of this virus infection in Malaysia. This study supports future research in studies documented to understand the potential of transmission, survival, and infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Suhaimi, Nur Faseeha; Jalaludin, Juliana; Latif, Mohd Talib",Aerosol Air Qual.

329447,Lessons from the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu Pandemic in Africa,2020,"We started a study on the molecular docking of six potential pharmacologically active inhibitors compounds that can be used clinically against the COVID-19 virus, in this case, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, galidesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine interacting with the main COVID-19 protease in complex with a COVID-19 N3 protease inhibitor. The highest values of affinity energy found in order from highest to lowest were chloroquine (CHL), hydroxychloroquine (HYC), favipiravir (FAV), galidesivir (GAL), remdesivir (REM) and ribavirin (RIB). The possible formation of hydrogen bonds, associations through London forces and permanent electric dipole were analyzed. The values of affinity energy obtained for the hydroxychloroquine ligands was -9.9 kcal/mol and for the chloroquine of -10.8 kcal/mol which indicate that the coupling contributes to an effective improvement of the affinity energies with the protease. Indicating that, the position chosen to make the substitutions may be a pharmacophoric group, and cause changes in the protease.","Silva Arouche, Tiago da; Reis, Arthur Ferreira; Martins, Anderson Yuri; S Costa, Jose Francisco; Carvalho Junior, Raul Nunes; J C Neto, Antonio Maia",J Nanosci Nanotechnol,,199
330097,Let the DOCTOR decide whom to test: Adaptive testing strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Vaccination rates are an ongoing global concern. Many developing and developed countries have rates of vaccination below rates required for herd immunity, for differing reasons. One way in which to communicate information about vaccination to the wider public is via the use of the news media. Communication agenda-setting and framing theory generally hold that the news media sets the issues of importance to society and also tells us how we should think about those issues. Emphasis framing theory however, would suggest that positively-framed statements in the media may actually be viewed as persuasive in a coercing way, leading to resistance to the messages. Further, this theory claims that negative news media is viewed as more credible and therefore, more easily accepted. We were interested to explore the framing of news reports about vaccination and the potential effects this framing may have had on the wider public over the years 2016-2017 in both Australia and New Zealand (when changes in vaccination policy and publicity respectively were on the agenda). We undertook a content analysis of 197 articles and emphasis frame, type of message, and other variables recorded. In both Australia and New Zealand, the news media messages were predominately positively framed and yet the vaccination rates of New Zealand particularly (where no policy changes mandating vaccination took place) have been decreasing. We suggest the media emphasis on positive vaccination reporting may be having the opposite effect of engendering resistance to vaccination within those who are vaccine-hesitant.","Ashwell, Douglas; Murray, Niki",Vaccine,,199

Methods: A total of 479 participants from the Caregiving Transitions Study were included in the analysis, 244 (50.9%) of whom began substantial and sustained caregiving between baseline and follow-up interviews. We assessed associations between incident caregiving and change in social network size, change in monthly social contact, and satisfaction with social activities. Results: Incident caregivers reported lower satisfaction with social activities and greater decline in social network size than controls. Among only the caregivers, dementia caregivers reported greater decline in social network size while caregivers who were spouses, experienced higher strain, and provided more hours of care reported lower satisfaction with social activities. Discussion: Social engagement declined more among incident caregivers than controls. Future studies should aim to understand why subgroups of caregivers reported lower social engagement.","Liu, Chelsea; Fabius, Chanee D; Howard, Virginia J; Haley, William E; Roth, David L",J Aging Health,,199

331820,The impact of COVID-19 on tail risk: Evidence from Nifty index options,2021,"The clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in various target organs has been extensively studied and described. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of oral cavity involvement. This is surprising, considering that oral mucosal and salivary gland cells are known targets for the direct replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that the presence of the virus in saliva is a source of transmission of the infection. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of oral manifestations in COVID-19 survivors. We profiled the oral involvement in 122 COVID-19 survivors that were hospitalized and followed up at a single-referral university hospital in Milan, Italy, between July 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, after a median (interquartile range) time from hospital discharge of 104 (95 to 132) d. We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common. Overall, this retrospective and prospective cohort study of COVID-19 survivors revealed that residual damage of the oral cavity persists in the vast majority of patients far beyond clinical recovery, and suggests that the oral cavity represents a preferential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and oral disorders.","Gherlone, E F; Polizzi, E; Tetè, G; De Lorenzo, R; Magnaghi, C; Rovere Querini, P; Ciceri, F",J Dent Res,,199
332031,Pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic - Maternal and neonatal outcomes: A concise review,2020,"One of the many problems posed by the collective effort to tackle COVID-19 is non-compliance with restrictions. Some people would like to obey restrictions but cannot due to their job or other life circumstances; others are not good at following rules that restrict their liberty, even if the potential consequences of doing so are repeatedly made very clear to them. Among this group are a minority who simply do not care about the consequences of their actions. But many others fail to accurately perceive the harms that they might be causing. One of the main reasons for this is that the harms done by transmitting COVID-19 to someone else are morally distant from the agent, particularly in cases where infection is asymptomatic. In this paper, I describe seven different aspects of moral distance in the context of COVID-19, explore how they affect (lack of) motivation to obey restrictions, and suggest several ways in which such moral distance can be reduced - primarily through enhanced-contact tracing that makes it clear to individuals and the public precisely who they could be harming and how.","Shaw, David",J. med. ethics,,199

While some specialties are well suited to virtual care, Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery could be limited due to reliance on physical examination and nasal endoscopy, including Rhinology. It is likely virtual care will remain integrated for the foreseeable future and it is important to determine the strengths and weaknesses of this treatment modality for rhinology. METHODS: A survey on virtual care in rhinology was distributed to 61 Canadian rhinologists. The primary objective was to determine how virtual care compared to in-person care in each area of a typical appointment. Other areas focused on platforms used to deliver virtual care and which patients could be appropriately assessed by virtual visits. RESULTS: 43 participants responded (response rate 70.5%). The majority of participants use the telephone as their primary platform. History taking and reviewing results (lab work, imaging) were reported to be equivalent in virtual care. Non-urgent follow up and new patients were thought to be the most appropriate for virtual care. The inability to perform exams and nasal endoscopy were reported to be significant limitations. CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of virtual care. These results identify the perceived strengths and weaknesses of virtual care in rhinology, and will help rhinologists understand the role of virtual care in their practices.","Smith, Kristine A; Thamboo, Andrew; Chan, Yvonne; Chin, Christopher J; Werger, Megan; Rotenberg, Brian",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,199

Although early reports have shown that younger age groups experience less severe disease than older adults, our understanding of this phenomenon is in continuous evolution. Recently, a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with active or recent COVID-19 infection, has been increasingly reported. Children with MIS-C may demonstrate signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease, but also have some distinct differences. These children have more frequent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms and are more likely to present with a shock-like presentation. Moreover, they often present with cardiovascular involvement including myocardial dysfunction, valvulitis, and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms.

We developed a cut-and-paste reagent development system and used the fluorescent fusion protein system to show that immune checkpoint interactions are conserved across 160,000,000 years of evolution, CD200 is highly expressed on transmissible tumor cells, and coexpression of CD200R1 can block CD200 surface expression. The system's versatility across species was demonstrated by fusing a fluorescent reporter to a camelid-derived nanobody that binds human programmed death ligand 1. The evolutionarily conserved pathways suggest that naturally occurring cancers in devils and other species can be used to advance our understanding of cancer and immunological tolerance.","Flies, Andrew S; Darby, Jocelyn M; Lennard, Patrick R; Murphy, Peter R; Ong, Chrissie E B; Pinfold, Terry L; De Luca, Alana; Lyons, A Bruce; Woods, Gregory M; Patchett, Amanda L",Sci.

Individuals that received bariatric surgery may represent a particularly susceptible population to the adverse effects of lockdown for its potential impact on eating, psychological, and weight loss outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to investigate the incremental impact of COVID-19 lockdown on treatment outcomes of postbariatric patients in the risk period for weight regain. SETTING: Main hospital center. METHODS: This work uses data from an ongoing longitudinal study of bariatric patients assessed before surgery (T0), 1.5 years after sugery (T1), and 3 years after surgery (T2). Two independent groups were compared: the COVID-19_Group (n = 35) where T0 and T1 assessments were conducted before the pandemic started and T2 assessment was conducted at the end of the mandatory COVID-19 lockdown; and the NonCOVID-19_Group (n = 66), covering patients who completed T0, T1, and T2 assessments before the epidemic began. Assessment included self-report measures for disordered eating, negative urgency, depression, anxiety, stress, and weight outcomes. RESULTS: General linear models for repeated measures showed that the COVID-19_Group presented significantly higher weight concern (F = 8.403, P = .005, Æ2p = .094), grazing behavior (F = 7.166, P = .009, Æ2p = .076), and negative urgency (F = 4.522, P = .036, Æ2p = .05) than the NonCOVID-19_Group. The COVID-19_Group also showed less total weight loss (F = 4.029, P = .05, Æ2p = .04) and larger weight regain at T2, with more COVID-19_Group participants experiencing excessive weight regain (20% versus 4.5%). CONCLUSION: These results show evidence for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on eating-related psychopathology and weight outcomes in postbariatric surgery patients.","Conceição, Eva; de Lourdes, Marta; Ramalho, Sofia; Félix, Sílvia; Pinto-Bastos, Ana; Vaz, Ana Rita",Surg. obes. relat. dis,,199

RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have shown that there are three main themes in the epidemiology of stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-19 seems to be associated with stroke in a significant number of patients. This association has been reported in several clinical series, mainly from China. There is a consistent trend towards a decreased number of hospital admissions of stroke patients during the pandemic. There are no population-based data available on incident stroke in individuals with COVID-19. SUMMARY: In this review, we report on increased rates and severe prognosis of ischemic stroke among individuals with COVID-19, probably explained by hypercoagulability and inflammation, documented since the early phase of disease.We confirm the presence of falling rates of new ischemic stroke admissions in hospitals, probably due to social consequences of the pandemic: fear to be infected or not adequately treated in the hospital. This phenomenon is restricted to mild stroke and transient ischemic attacks.Short and long-term consequences of this trend of new strokes in the pandemic need to be evaluated.","Logroscino, Giancarlo; Beghi, Ettore",Curr. opin. neurol,,199

Methods: The study subjects were full-time nursing students from three European countries. A diagnostic survey was used as a research method, while the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (SES) and the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) were used to collect data. Results: The research was performed on a group of 1002 students. The mean age of those surveyed was 21.6 (±3.4). The results showed significant differences both in the level of the global self-esteem index (F = 40.74; p < 0.0001) and in the level of general satisfaction with life (F = 12.71; p < 0.0001). A comparison of the structure of results demonstrated that there were significantly fewer students with high self-esteem in Spain (11.06%) than in Poland (48.27%) and in Slovakia (42.05%), while more students with a high sense of life satisfaction were recorded in Spain (64.90%) than in Poland (37.87%) or in Slovakia (47.44%). A positive, statistically significant correlation was found between global self-esteem and satisfaction with life in the group of Slovak students (r = 0.37; p < 0.0001), Polish students (r = 0.31; p < 0.0001) and Spanish students (r = 0.26; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, a regression analysis proved that three variables explaining a total of 12% output variation were the predictors of life satisfaction in Polish students. The regression factor was positive (ßeta = 0.31; R2 = 0.12), which indicates a positive correlation and the largest share was attributed to global self-esteem (9%). In the group of Spanish students, global self-esteem explained 7% (ßeta = 0.27; R2 = 0.07) of the output variation and 14% in the group of Slovak students (ßeta = 0.38; R2 = 0.14). Conclusions: The global self-esteem demonstrates the predictive power of life satisfaction of nursing students, most clearly marked in the group of Slovak students. The measurement of the variables under consideration may facilitate the planning and implementation of programs aimed at increasing self-esteem among young people and promoting the well-being of nursing students.","Kupcewicz, Ewa; Grochans, Elzbieta; Mikla, Marzena; Kaducáková, Helena; Józwik, Marcin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

Patients with severe COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation are likely at highest risk. We sought to determine the incidence of radiographic markers of lung fibrosis and associated risk factors in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: The Electronic Medical Record at New York University was queried for subjects without a history of interstitial lung disease who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR, required mechanical ventilation, and had a chest computed tomography (CT) conducted during their hospitalization for COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data was collected. CT scans were blindly read by a thoracic radiologist using a novel scoring system where fibrotic changes were defined as consolidation and/or ground glass with traction, and honeycombing. The prevalence of fibrosis was established and analyses were done to evaluate for clinical associations. Data is represented as number of patients (percent of cohort), and mean ± standard deviation). Results: 88 patients were included, 61 (69.3%) had fibrotic changes on CT done 50.3 ± 33.6 days after admission, while 27 (30.7%) had no fibrosis seen on CT done 41.5 ± 26.0 days after admission. There were no significant differences in demographics or medical history between the subgroups. The fibrotic subgroup required mechanical ventilation for a longer duration than the non-fibrotic subgroup (52.8 ± 33.2 vs 32.1 ± 18.8 days) and had higher plateau pressures 21 days after intubation (26.6 ± 6.0 vs 16.5 ± 5.4 cmH2O). P/F ratios were similar on day of intubation (145.4 ± 55.5 fibrotic vs 145.7 ± 64.1 non-fibrotic), however the fibrotic subgroup had lower P/F ratios 7 days after intubation (146.3 ± 57.0 vs 182.1 ± 63.3), 14 days after intubation (166.3 ± 83.7 vs 236.8 ± 84.3), and 21 days after intubation (170.8 ± 90.5 vs 249.5 ± 103.0). The fibrotic subgroup also had higher peak ferritin (8899.92 ± 11461.3 vs 6715.6 ± 9680.1 ng/mL) and LDH (1031.67 ± 628.9 vs 929.0 ± 493.3 U/L). Conclusion: In our cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, over two-thirds had fibrotic changes on CT chest. Longer duration of mechanical ventilation, higher plateau pressures 21 days after intubation, lower P/F ratios 7 days or more after intubation, and higher peak ferritin and LDH levels were associated with presence of fibrosis. .","Heyman, B.; Solomon, J.; Ko, J.; Lynch, D.

A multipronged therapeutic approach was adopted in the form of self proning, thrombo–prophylaxis, chest physiotherapy, adequate nutrition, psychotherapy and early mobilization. We could transfer two patients on domiciliary oxygen therapy and one on room air. Despite aggressive measures to control infection, one patient developed fungal sepsis, and another developed pseudomonal pneumonia. Both the patients rapidly deteriorated and succumbed to secondary infection, despite having shown initial recovery from CARDS. Conclusion: Prevention of infections is the key to recovery after resolution of viremia. This warrants COVID step down facility and structured rehabilitation program.","Talwar, V.; Mustafi, S.

Traditionally, information and health communications issued by respected and established government agencies have been regarded as factual, unbiased and credible. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is such an agency that addresses all aspects of health and public health on behalf of the U.S Government for the benefit of its citizens. In July 2020, the CDC issued guidelines on reopening schools which resulted in open criticism by the U.S. President and others, prompting a review and publication of revised guidelines together with a special ""Statement on the Importance of Reopening Schools under COVID-19."" We hypothesize that this statement introduced bias with the intention to shift the public perception and media narrative in favor of reopening of schools. Using a mixed methods approach, including an online text analysis tool, we demonstrate that document title and structure, word frequencies, word choice, and website presentation did not provide a balanced account of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite available scientific guidance and practical evidence-based advice on how to manage infection risks when reopening schools, the CDC Statement was intentionally overriding possible parent and public health concerns. The CDC Statement provides an example of how political influence is exercised over the presentation of science in the context of a major pandemic. It was withdrawn by the CDC in November 2020.","Benzian, Habib; Johnston, Marilyn; Stauf, Nicole; Niederman, Richard",Front Public Health,,199

Although it is known that some of these deaths may have been influenced by the overload of health systems, the world medical literature lacks data on deaths due to COVID-19 in patients who have not received medical assistance. We conducted a retrospective transversal study to report the clinical and epidemiological profile of the first 200 consecutive cases of home deaths without medical assistance caused by COVID-19 diagnosed by verbal autopsy and real-time PCR in samples of postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs, in the state of Ceara, in Northeastern Brazil. The data show a slightly increased prevalence of cases in males (57%) and an average age of 76.8 years. Previous comorbidities were reported in 85.5% of cases, the most common being cardiovascular disease (45%), neurological disease (30%), and diabetes (29%). The main symptoms reported were dyspnea (79%), fever (75.5%), cough (69%), and fatigue (42.5%). The average time between the onset of illness and death was 7.3 days, being statistically shorter in patients who had previous comorbidities (P = 0.0215). This is the first study to evidence the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 home deaths without medical assistance, which may represent a considerable portion of the pandemic burden, especially in the context of health system overload.","Souza, Pedro Mansueto Melo de; Gerson, Gunter; Soares, Carlos Eduardo Lopes; Souza, Sarlene Gomes de; Dias, Josebson Silva; Melo, Deborah Nunes de; Ruiz, Erasmo Miessa; Tavora, Fabio; Cavalcanti, Luciano Pamplona de Goes",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,199

By using effective stitch size planning, sub-millimetre sewing accuracy is achieved for stitch sizes ranging from 2mm to 5mm. In addition, a thread manipulator for thread management and tension control is also proposed to perform successive knot tying to secure each stitch. Detailed laboratory experiments have been performed to access the proposed instruments and allied algorithms.

342833,COVID Snapshot: How Medical Libraries and Staff Adapt to Deliver Services during a Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Immunosuppression is the predominant cause of mortality for sepsis because of failure to eradicate pathogens. No effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are clinically available. Evidences implicate the involvement of the vitamin D receptor (NR1I1) in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. The anti-malarial artesunate was investigated to determine action on sepsis-induced immunosuppression. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of artesunate on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and human and mice cell lines. Bioinformatics predicted vitamin D receptor as a candidate target for artesunate, which was then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. Vdr, Atg16l1 and NF-&#954;B p65 were modified to investigate artesunate 's effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacterial clearance and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. KEY RESULTS: Artesunate significantly reduced the mortality of caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, artesunate interacted with vitamin D receptor, inhibiting its nuclear translocation, which influenced ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. Artesunate inhibited the physical interaction between vitamin D receptor and NF-&#954;B p65 in LPS-tolerant macrophages and then promoted the nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B p65, which activated the transcription of NF-&#954;B p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings provide evidence that artesunate interacted with vitamin D receptor to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-&#954;B-dependent manner, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of artesunate has a bidirectional immunomodulator.","Shang, Shenglan; Wu, Jiaqi; Li, Xiaoli; Liu, Xin; Li, Pan; Zheng, Chunli; Wang, Yonghua; Liu, Songqing; Zheng, Jiang; Zhou, Hong",Br J Pharmacol,,199

We find that the 4f electrons in CeN are highly itinerant and mixed-valence, showing a prominent quasi-particle peak near the Fermi level. On the contrary, they become well localized and display weak valence fluctuation in CeBi. It means that a 4f itinerant-localized crossover could emerge upon changing the X atom from N to Bi. Moreover, according to the low-energy behaviors of 4f self-energy functions, we could conclude that the 4f electrons in CeX also demonstrate interesting orbital-selective electronic correlations, which are similar to the other cerium-based heavy fermion compounds.","Lu, Haiyan; Huang, Li",J. phys. condens. matter,,199

This study aimed to investigate the variation in radiation therapy fractionation in breast cancer patients in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and to estimate survival outcome and cost implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a population-based cohort of patients who received radiation therapy for breast cancer (2009-2013), as captured in the NSW Central Cancer Registry. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type. Survival outcome was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Cost per treatment and potential cost saving associated with evidence-based fractionation was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 10,482 patients were available for analysis, divided into 3 cohorts (breast alone: N = 7000; breast + nodes: N = 1119; all chestwall: N = 2363). In multivariable analysis, increasing age, laterality (right), year of treatment (2013), early stage, lower socioeconomic status, and regional area of residence were independent predictors of hypofractionation for breast alone radiation therapy. For the breast + nodes and chest wall cohorts, common factors that predicted the use of hypofractionation were increasing age. In multivariable survival analysis, there was no difference between the fractionation regimens at 5 years. Estimated radiation therapy cost of this cohort approximated $52.1 million, compared with $38.5 million had these patients been treated with evidence-based fractionation. This demonstrated a potential saving of $13.6 million. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation appears underused for breast radiation therapy in NSW over time. This study highlights that evidence-based practice will translate to reduced health care treatment costs.","Batumalai, Vikneswary; Delaney, Geoff P; Descallar, Joseph; Gabriel, Gabriel; Wong, Karen; Shafiq, Jesmin; Barton, Michael",Radiother. oncol,,199

347069,Evaluation of pericardiocentesis videos on YouTube as a reliable source for on-line education in the COVID-19 period,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China; it has since spread rapidly throughout the world. Most of the patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, including cough, nasal symptoms, fever, and shortness of breath. However, several groups have reported that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the central nervous system via the olfactory bulb followed by spread throughout the brain and peripheral nervous system. This brief report illustrated a 78-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) on March 22, 2020, with chief complaints of dizziness and unsteadiness while walking. He had no symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 on arrival. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test performed at that time due to his atypical presentation and lymphocytopenia was positive for virus nucleic acids. The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 are frequently non-specific and may emerge several days before the respiratory symptoms; as such, identification of patients presenting with these subtle and seemingly unremarkable COVID-19 symptoms will be quite difficult. Added to this, numerous countries still limit testing for SARS-COV-2 to patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms. Frontline physicians should be aware of early, non-specific symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sia, Jacky",,,199

The widely used diagnostic test for the SARS-CoV 2 is the real-time reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools but the lack of specialized nucleic acid extraction and amplification laboratories hampers/slows down timely large scale testing. The use of animals with sensitive olfactory cue as an alternate testing model could serve as an alternative to detect COVID-19 in the saliva of carriers. The African giant rats (AGR) is highly versatile and detects odorant molecules from carriers of pathogens with high percentage success after few months of training hence can be taught to detect odour differences of COVID-19 in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. If these trained, could help to curtail further spread of COVID infections.","Adekanmbi, Adejoke Joan; Olude, Matthew Ayokunle",,,199

However, a small percentage of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC do respond, and the characteristics of these patients are not known. Here, we identify the characteristics of patients who may respond to ICI therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations who received PD-1/PD-L1 antibody monotherapy at nine institutions were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 58 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were analyzed. Various clinical factors such as smoking history and EGFR mutation type were not associated with progression-free survival (PFS) of ICIs, while the PFS of prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was inversely associated with that of ICIs. Patients who responded to prior EGFR TKIs for > 10 months exhibited a significantly shorter response to ICIs compared to those who had responded for &#8804; 10 months (PFS of ICI: 1.6 vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio: 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.26-5.12; p = 0.009).

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and psychological status of a specific population using an internet consultation platform during the outbreak of COVID-19. The questionnaire survey included questions regarding basic information (e.g. area, sex, age, occupation, and education level), clinical characteristics, and cognitive and psychological status concerning COVID-19 from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2020. There were 277 patients (43.49%) with three or more symptoms, 121 (12.11%) with a clinical questionnaire score &#8805;8, and 6.81% who lived in Hubei in the previous 14 days. Of the respondents, 4.9% had contact fever or were confirmed to have COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. The respondents were mostly aware that COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person and via the respiratory tract, but awareness of general susceptibility and specific symptoms of COVID-19 was low. Multivariate analysis showed that urban residents, clerk/students and higher education groups were well aware of COVID-19. Regarding mental health, the anxiety score of the respondents was 7.12 ± 2.32, and the proportion of anxiety was 54.15%. Younger women were more likely to have anxiety when they experienced positive symptoms. Individuals with a Hubei residence history and those who had contact with an individual with a fever or were confirmed patients in the previous 14 days were more likely to have moderate or severe anxiety. The COVID-19-related knowledge of the respondents was generally good but still could have been improved. Their psychological status was also affected by the pandemic. The internet consultation platform played a positive role in spreading pandemic-related information, providing medical help and psychological counseling, and strengthening early warning to the potential high-risk population.","Ouyang, Han; Wen, Jian; Gu, Wenyong; Shen, Huaying; Song, Kai",Sci Prog,,199

348995,"Early COVID-19 pandemic modeling: Three compartmental model cases studies from Texas, USA",2020,"In social insects, collective choices between food sources are based on self-organized mechanisms where information about resources are locally processed by the foragers. Such a collective decision emerges from the competition between pheromone trails leading to different resources but also between the recruiting stimuli emitted by successful foragers at nest entrances. In this study, we investigated how an additional nest entrance influences the ability of Myrmica rubra ant colonies to exploit two food sources of different quality (1M and 0.1M sucrose solution) and to select the most rewarding one. We found that the mobilisation of workers doubled in two-entrance nests compared to one-entrance nests but that ants were less likely to reach a food source once they exited the nest. Moreover, the collective selection of the most rewarding food source was less marked in two-entrance nests, with foragers distributing themselves evenly between the two feeders. Ultimately, multiple nest entrances reduced the foraging efficiency of ant colonies that consumed significantly less sugar out of the two available resources. Our results highlight that the nest structure, more specifically the number of nest entrances, can impede the ant's ability to process information about environmental opportunities and to select the most rewarding resource. This study opens new insights on how the physical interface between the nest interior and the outside environment can act upon collective decision-making and foraging efficiency in self-organized insect societies.","Lehue, Marine; Detrain, Claire",PLoS One,,199

Decreases in spatial memory abilities, changes in EEG, structural injuries, and the downregulation of phosphorylated-Ak strain transforming (p-AKT), phosphorylated-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMKII), phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK) and p-CREB was observed 6 h after microwave exposure. Significant differences in the expression of p-CaMKII were found between the S and L groups. The power amplitudes of the EEG waves (Î¸, Î´), levels of structural injuries and the expression of p-AKT, p-CaMK II, p-CREB, and p-ERK1/2 were significantly different in the S and L groups compared to the SL group. Interaction effects between the 2.856 and 1.5 GHz microwaves were found in the EEG and p-CREB changes.

DESIGN: Time series analyses using cross-sectional annual data from the Telephone Surveillance System (VIGITEL 2008-2019). Food consumption was evaluated through: (1) consumption of five or more portions of fruits and vegetables in &#8805;5 d/week; (2) consumption of beans in &#8805;5 d/week and (3) consumption of soft drinks or artificial juices in &#8805;5 d/week. Absolute inequality was assessed by the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative inequality by the concentration index (CIX). SII and CIX positive values indicate higher prevalence among more educated citizens and negative among less educated ones. Time trend was assessed by linear regression using weighted least squares. SETTING: 26 Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. PARTICIPANTS: 621 689 individuals &#8805;18 years. RESULTS: Fruits and vegetable consumption was more prevalent among the more educated citizens, while beans were mostly consumed by the less educated, and soft drinks or artificial juices was more prevalent among individuals with intermediate education. The highest absolute inequality was found for beans (SII2019 -25·9). In 12 years, the absolute inequality increased for fruit and vegetable consumption (from SII2008 12·8 to SII2019 16·2), remained for beans (SII2008 -23·1 to SII2019 -25·9) and reduced for soft drinks or artificial juices (SII2008 8·7 to SII2019 0·4). Relative inequality was low and constant. CONCLUSION: Despite the advances reducing inequalities in soft drinks or artificial juice consumption, the increase in the social gap for adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is troublesome.","Crepaldi, Barbara Virginia Caixeta; Okada, Letícia Martins; Rauber, Fernanda; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Azeredo, Catarina Machado",Public Health Nutr,,199
349329,COVID-19: impact on quality of work life in real estate sector,2021,"The most serious health issue today is the rapid outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A2A receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19.","Abouelkhair, Mohamed A",Med Hypotheses,,199

Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the postoperative period.","Vranis, Neil M; Bekisz, Jonathan M; Daar, David A; Chiu, Ernest S; Wilson, Stelios C",J Surg Res,,199

An understanding of the factors that affect severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood type distribution. The big data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University were used to assess the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The infection data in the early phase of the pandemic from six countries in each of six geographic zones divided according to the WHO were used, representing approximately 5.4 billion people around the globe. We calculated the infection growth factor, doubling times of infection and death cases, reproductive number and infection and death cases in relation to the blood type distribution. The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (<30%), the higher blood type A population (â©¾30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics. Thus, an association exists between SARS-CoV-2 and the ABO blood group distribution, which might be useful for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Yuefei; Häussinger, Lisa; Steinacker, Jürgen M; Dinse-Lambracht, Alexander",Epidemiol Infect,,199

A convenience sample of 902 Israeli adults (mean age = 46.21) completed measures of peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms and resilience, and reported on their media use experiences one month following the initial outbreak of the disease in Israel (April 2020). After controlling for COVID-19 related events and demographic covariates, experiencing media use as having a negative impact on coping was related to higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of resilience. In contrast, experiencing media as having a positive impact was not related to peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms or resilience. The findings suggest that those reporting that media use had a negative impact on coping are at greater risk of experiencing higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms as well as lower resilience. In addition, traditional media use was related to higher resiliency. Developing understanding of how media could be used to optimally support emergency responses is crucial in order to minimize psychopathology. Unified, clear, trustworthy and informative messaging has a special importance during a mass public health crisis. Further research will contribute to guidance of potential risk and resilience aspects of media use during emergencies.","Levaot, Yael; Greene, Talya; Palgi, Yuval",J. psychiatr. res,,199

By 24 September 2020, a staggering number of vaccines (more than 200) had started preclinical development, of which 43 had entered clinical trials, including some approaches that have not previously been licensed for human vaccines. Vaccines have been widely considered as part of the exit strategy to enable the return to previous patterns of working, schooling and socializing. Importantly, to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic, production needs to be scaled-up from a small number of preclinical doses to enough filled vials to immunize the world's population, which requires close engagement with manufacturers and regulators. It will require a global effort to control the virus, necessitating equitable access for all countries to effective vaccines. This review explores the immune responses required to protect against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology. We describe the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The review also addresses the critical steps between promising preclinical leads and manufacturing at scale. The issues faced during this pandemic and the platforms being developed to address it will be invaluable for future outbreak control. Nine months after the outbreak began we are at a point where preclinical and early clinical data are being generated for the vaccines; an overview of this important area will help our understanding of the next phases.","Tregoning, J S; Brown, E S; Cheeseman, H M; Flight, K E; Higham, S L; Lemm, N-M; Pierce, B F; Stirling, D C; Wang, Z; Pollock, K M",Clin Exp Immunol,,199

352509,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Stock Returns of Companies of Oil & Gas Industry of G7 Nations (preprint),2020,"Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R0 &#8776; 2.4 ± 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.","Kaplan, Edward H; Wang, Dennis; Wang, Mike; Malik, Amyn A; Zulli, Alessandro; Peccia, Jordan",Health care manag. sci,,199

Since they were unable to detect the precise cause, they named it ”Pneumonia of unknown etiology”. Later it was identified as SARS COV 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – coronavirus 2). At first, the disease spread locally affecting the people of Wuhan, and then started spreading throughout China, creating a worldwide panic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from China and local healthcare units organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The causative organism of this infection is a new virus that belongs to the “coronavirus (CoV)” family. After which the disease was called nCoV-19 (Novel coronavirus – 19). On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, renamed the disease as ”COVID-19,” which is the acronym of ”coronavirus disease 2019”. Viral epidemics like SARS-CoV in 2002, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the most recent one the MERS-CoV Middle East Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus (first identified in Saudi Arabia) in 2012 threatened the health of mankind in the past two decades. All of these were successfully prevented by systematically approaching the problem to solve it. Healthcare professionals around the world are well trained to manage any type of health crisis. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a ”PANDEMIC” pointing to over 118,000 cases and 80,000 dead in 110 countries or more. In a media briefing, the WHO Director General said: ”This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector, so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight.”.","Prasaath Sastha, K.

However, molecular mechanisms especially epigenetic regulation of mTEC homeostasis and TRA expression remain elusive. Here we show that the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b is essential to maintain the postnatal thymic medulla by promoting mTEC survival and regulating the expression of TRA genes. Moreover, mice lacking Kdm6b developed pathological autoimmune disorders. Mechanically, Kdm6b exerted its function by reducing repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the promoters of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 and a set of Aire-dependent TRA genes. Thus, our findings reveal a dual role of Kdm6b in the regulation of mTEC-mediated T cell central tolerance.","Liu, Zhi; Zhang, Haohao; Hu, Yiming; Liu, Dandan; Li, Lingling; Li, Cuifeng; Wang, Qi; Huo, Junhaohui; Liu, Hanshao; Xie, Ningxia; Huang, Xingxu; Liu, Yongzhong; Chen, Charlie Degui; Shi, Yufang; Zhang, Xiaoren",Cell death differ,,199

A number of vaccines, including those against influenza, tetanus and pertussis, have been shown to reduce both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality when used antenatally. We explore the role of COVID-19 vaccination in the setting of pregnancy, discuss the limited data available, and summarise current international guidelines.","Zamparini, J.; Murray, L.; Saggers, R.

354466,Accident Prediction Based On Integrated Design Consistency With The Lower Number Of Vehicles/Traffic Volumes (Due To Health Disaster/COVID-19),2020,"The enzyme cGAS functions as a sensor that recognizes the cytosolic DNA from foreign pathogen. The activation of the protein triggers the transcription of inflammatory genes, leading into the establishment of an antipathogen state. An interesting new discovery is that the detection of DNA by cGAS induced the formation of liquid-like droplets. However how cells regulate the formation of these droplets is still not fully understood. In order to unravel the molecular mechanism beneath the DNA-mediated phase separation of cGAS, we developed a polymer-based coarse-grained model which takes into accounts the basic structural organization in DNA and cGAS, as well as the binding properties between these biomolecules. This model was further integrated into a hybrid simulation algorithm. With this computational method, a multi-step kinetic process of aggregation between cGAS and DNA was observed. Moreover, we systematically tested the model under different concentrations and binding parameters. Our simulation results show that phase separation requires both cGAS dimerization and protein-DNA interactions, whereas polymers can be kinetically trapped in small aggregates under strong binding affinities. Additionally, we demonstrated that supramolecular assembly can be facilitated by increasing the number of functional modules in protein or DNA polymers, suggesting that multivalency and intrinsic disordered regions play positive roles in regulating phase separation. This is consistent to previous experimental evidences. Taken together, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational model to study condensation of cGAS-DNA complexes. While the method can reach the timescale beyond the capability of atomic-level MD simulations, it still includes information about spatial arrangement of functional modules in biopolymers that is missing in the mean-field theory. Our work thereby adds a useful dimension to a suite of existing experimental and computational techniques to study the dynamics of phase separation in biological systems.","Su, Zhaoqian; Dhusia, Kalyani; Wu, Yinghao",Arch Biochem Biophys,,199

Deep sequencing analysis of samples from lower respiratory tract revealed a novel coronavirus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Currently there is a rapid global spread. World Health Organization declare the disease a pandemic condition. The pathologic source of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins. Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate and spread through the entire lung. Endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization is critical. After entering the cells, it possibly activates or hijack many intracellular pathways in favor of its replication.

METHODS: We used routine care data from 51 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.8 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (CTC group) versus standard of care (no-CTC group) among adults 18 to 80 years old with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was intubation or death by day 28. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 891 patients included in the analysis, 203 were assigned to the CTC group. Use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with risk of intubation or death by day 28 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39) or cumulative death rate (wHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.98). However, use of corticosteroids was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death by day 28 in the prespecified subgroups of patients requiring oxygen &#8805; 3 L/min (wHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85) or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L (wHR 0.44, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.85). Number of hyperglycaemia events was higher for patients with than without corticosteroids, but number of infections was similar. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the use of corticosteroids and intubation or death in the broad population of patients 18 to 80 years old with COVID-19 hospitalized in non-intensive care unit settings. However, the treatment was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death for patients with &#8805; 3 L/min oxygen or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L at baseline.

METHODS: Using a purposive sampling methodology, we interviewed 21 health and social service personnel who assisted in wildfire recovery efforts in California in 2017 and 2018. The study participants worked or volunteered in medical facilities, social services agencies and philanthropy/nonprofit organizations located in communities affected by wildfires. Participants were asked about three common, overarching themes that fire-impacted communities navigate post-disaster: health issues, social issues, and response and recovery resources. Inductive coding was used to identify common subthemes. RESULTS: The two most frequently discussed social issues during interviews were housing and employment access. Mental and emotional well-being and access to health resources were identified as being the most challenging health concerns that survivors face post-disaster. Participants also identified the following private and public recovery resources that survivors use to attempt to restabilize following the fire: community support, county agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA,) insurance companies and philanthropic organizations. However, participants noted that the cumulative impacts of these efforts still leave many of their patients and clients without the resources needed to restabilize emotionally, financially and physically. Finally, participants spoke about the community-wide, downstream impacts of wildfires, noting that ""survivors"" are not only those whose health is immediately compromised by the disaster. CONCLUSION: Given the worsening wildfire seasons in California, we must increase our understanding of both the scope of the health and social issues that survivors navigate following a disaster, as well as the effectiveness and sustainability of recovery resources available to survivors. We must also understand the ""ripple effect"" that wildfires have on surrounding communalities, impacting housing access, social services, and health care access. More research and support, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, is urgently needed to improve our ability to support the health and social needs of wildfire survivors in the future.","Rosenthal, Annie; Stover, Eric; Haar, Rohini J",PLoS One,,199
361830,From Columbus to Covid-19: Amerindian Antecedents to the Global Pandemic,2020,"The third coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades has caused significant damage to the world's economy and community health. The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients' nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19.","Junaid, Kashaf; Ejaz, Hasan; Abdalla, Abualgasim Elgaili; Abosalif, Khalid O A; Ullah, Muhammad Ikram; Yasmeen, Humaira; Younas, Sonia; Hamam, Sanaa S M; Rehman, Abdul",Nutrients,,199

(Special Issue: COVID-19 data.),2021,"COVID-19 has caused a shortage of healthcare workers and has strained healthcare systems globally. Pre-registered healthcare students with training have a duty of care and can support the healthcare workforce. This study explored factors influencing the willingness of final-year nursing students to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of professional identity in volunteering as healthcare workers, and strategies to improve future volunteering uptakes and processes. A qualitative study using focus-group discussions was conducted. Final-year nursing students who volunteered, students who did not volunteer, and lecturers who supervised student volunteers were recruited. Interviews were conducted online, video-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was used. The themes were ""wavering thoughts on volunteering"", ""bringing out 'the nurse' in students through volunteering"" and ""gearing up to volunteer"". Findings suggested the need to look beyond the simplicity of altruism to the role of professional identity, operational, and motivational factors to explain nursing students' decision to volunteer and their volunteer behavior. Providing accommodation, monetary and academic-related incentives, supporting the transitionary phase from students to ""professional volunteers"", promoting cohesive and positive staff-student volunteer relationships, and establishing a volunteer management team are strategies identified to improve volunteering uptake and operational processes. Our findings advocate strategic partnerships between hospitals/communities and academic institutions in providing various healthcare services during pandemics.","Seah, Betsy; Ho, Ben; Liaw, Sok Ying; Ang, Emily Neo Kim; Lau, Siew Tiang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

This disturbs the dynamic equilibrium between the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and ACE2/Ang (1–7)/Mas receptor axis. Therefore, the clinically approved drugs belonging to (i) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, and enalaprilat, (ii) angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan, candesartan, olmesartan, azilsartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan and (iii) the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs such as losartan with lisinopril and captopril with losartan, and (iv) recombinant ACE2, were studied for their ability to activate ACE2 in different medical conditions including hypertension, inflammation, cardiovascular, renal and lung diseases. These clinically approved drugs were found to activate ACE2 that had been downregulated in different medical conditions including hypertension, inflammation, cardiovascular, renal and lung diseases. Therefore, these drugs may be repurposed to re-activate the downregulated ACE2 of COVID-19 patients.

Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation. Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu Province.

The rapid spread in the UK of this new variant has caused other countries to be vigilant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We based our initial screening of B.1.1.7 on the dropout of the S gene signal in the TaqPath assay, caused by the 69/70 deletion. Subsequently, we confirmed the B.1.1.7 candidates by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: We describe the first three imported cases of this variant from London to Madrid, subsequent post-arrival household transmission to three relatives, and the two first cases without epidemiological links to UK. One case required hospitalization. In all cases, drop-out of gene S was correctly associated to the B.1.1.7 variant, as all the corresponding sequences carried the 17 lineage-marker mutations. CONCLUSION: The first identifications of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in Spain indicate the role of independent introductions from the UK coexisting with post-arrival transmission in the community, since the early steps of this new variant in our country.","Buenestado-Serrano, Sergio; Recio, Raúl; Sola Campoy, Pedro J; Catalán, Pilar; Folgueira, M Dolores; Villa, Jennifer; Muñoz Gallego, Irene; de la Cueva, Víctor Manuel; Meléndez, M Angeles; Andrés Zayas, Cristina; Losa-García, Juan E; Goyanes, M José; Fraile Torres, Arturo; Von Wermitz, Andres; Fradejas-Villajos, Isabel; Del Arco, Carmen; Campelo-Gutiérrez, Carolina; González Bodi, Sara; López-Wolf, Daniel; Iglesias-Franco, Higinio; Pérez-Lago, Laura; Arce Arnaez, Araceli; Rodriguez Baena, Elena; Ordobas Gavin, María; Muñoz, Patricia; Delgado, Rafael; Cardeñoso, Laura; Viedma, Esther; García de Viedma, Darío",,,199
365807,COVID-19: Rethinking Global Society,2021,"Pandemics, like the 1918 Spanish Influenza and COVID-19, spread through regions of the World in subsequent waves. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Cot, Corentin; Sannino, Francesco",Sci Rep,,199
366285,Indian Education in Pandemic COVID-19 (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the context for antimicrobial stewardship in primary care. AIM: To assess the effect of the pandemic on antibiotic prescribing, accounting for changes in consultations for respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTIs/UTIs). DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from January 2017 to September 2020. METHOD: Interrupted time-series analysis evaluated changes in antibiotic prescribing and RTI/UTI consultations adjusting for age, sex, season, and secular trends. The authors assessed the proportion of COVID-19 episodes associated with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: There were 253 655 registered patients in 2017 and 232 218 in 2020, with 559 461 antibiotic prescriptions, 216 110 RTI consultations, and 36 402 UTI consultations. Compared with prepandemic months, March 2020 was associated with higher antibiotic prescribing (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.16). Antibiotic prescribing fell below predicted rates between April and August 2020, reaching a minimum in May (ARR 0.73; 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.75). Pandemic months were associated with lower rates of RTI/UTI consultations, particularly in April for RTIs (ARR 0.23; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.25). There were small reductions in the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotic prescribed and no reduction for UTIs. Among 25 889 COVID-19 patients, 2942 (11%) had antibiotics within a COVID-19 episode. CONCLUSION: Pandemic months were initially associated with increased antibiotic prescribing, which then fell below expected levels during the national lockdown. Findings are reassuring that antibiotic stewardship priorities have not been neglected because of COVID-19. Research is required into the effects of reduced RTI/UTI consultations on incidence of serious bacterial infections.","Rezel-Potts, Emma; L039,; Esperance, Veline; Gulliford, Martin C",Br J Gen Pract,,199

Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that, before the pandemic hit, 43 million workers worked in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Many of these workers lost their jobs since. Consistently with our model, employment losses have been largest in sectors that rely heavily on customer contact and where these contacts dropped the most: retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools. Our results can help quantify the economic costs of social distancing.","Koren, Miklós; Peto, Rita",PLoS One,,199

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Twelve client-owned cats with ureteral urolithiasis treated with ureteroneocystostomy. METHODS: Records were reviewed for signalment, location of the obstruction, diagnostic tests, surgical technique, perioperative complications, long-term measurements of kidney function, and survival. Cats were divided into two groups; in one group, a DPT was placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy, and, in the other group, a DPT was not placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy (NDPT). RESULTS: A DPT was placed in six of 12 cats. The NDPT group included four cats with temporary catheters and two cats with no catheter. Median creatinine concentration decreased from 10.4 mg/dL (range, 1.6-20.3) to 2.2 mg/dL (range, 1.1-3.6) at the time of discharge (P = .015) in all cats. Two cats in the NDPT group required revision surgery for uroabdomen. Eleven cats were discharged from the hospital. Long-term complications (hematuria, pollakiuria, urinary tract infections) were more common in the DPT group (P = .047). Seven cats were alive a median of 329 days (range, 8-1772) after surgery.

We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The two arms of the study included: 1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment, and 2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination (5CD) to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on three N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and two medical mask (MM) models. We inoculated FFR and MM materials with three coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and treated with 10 µM MB and exposed to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5CD using multiple US and international test methods and compared to the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all three coronaviruses with 99.8 - to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and MMs tested. FFR and MM integrity was maintained after 5 cycles of MBL treatment, whereas one FFR model failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O3. CONCLUSIONS: MBL treatment decontaminated respirators and masks by inactivating three tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5CD. MBL decontamination is effective, low-cost and does not require specialized equipment, making it applicable in all-resource settings.","Lendvay, Thomas Sean; Chen, James; Harcourt, Brian H; Scholte, Florine Em; Lin, Ying Ling; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Lamb, Molly M; Homdayjanakul, Kamonthip; Cui, Yi; Price, Amy; Heyne, Belinda; Sahni, Jaya; Kabra, Kareem B; Lin, Yi-Chan; Evans, David; Mores, Christopher N; Page, Ken; Chu, Larry F; Haubruge, Eric; Thiry, Etienne; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F; Wielick, Constance; Clark, Tanner; Wagner, Thor; Timm, Emily; Gallagher, Thomas; Faris, Peter; Macia, Nicolas; Mackie, Cyrus J; Simmons, Sarah M; Reader, Susan; Malott, Rebecca; Hope, Karen; Davies, Jan M; Tritsch, Sarah R; Dams, Lorène; Nauwynck, Hans; Willaert, Jean-Francois; De Jaeger, Simon; Liao, Lei; Zhao, Mervin; Laperre, Jan; Jolois, Olivier; Smit, Sarah J; Patel, Alpa N; Mayo, Mark; Parker, Rod; Molloy-Simard, Vanessa; Lemyre, Jean-Luc; Chu, Steven",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,199

This phenomenon, added to the fraudulent selling of medical devices, highlights the need for a closer surveillance of the market to guarantee the efficacy and safety of available medical devices. A rational use of medical devices is necessary to ensure the availability and safety of these products, which requires the involvement of different stakeholders, including hospital pharmacists. Thus, it is essential that hospital pharmacists receive specific training in technical aspects concerning the possession and use of medical devices. This will help guarantee an effective and safe use of medical products. The acquisition and use of medical devices requires a keen understanding of the technical and legal aspects concerning these products, which makes hospital pharmacists essential for the integral management of medical devices.","Climent-Ballester, Seira; Selva-Otaolaurruchi, Juan",Farm Hosp,,199
368361,Corona virus (Covid-19) pandemic: A systematic review,2020,"Purpose: As of November 28, 2020, COVID-19 has been reported in 220 countries with 61,036,793 confirmed cases and 1,433,316 confirmed deaths; countries became vigilant around the world. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia, many studies have reported ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. This article describes the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 on ischemic stroke.Materials and methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and other COVID-dedicated databases and the combination of the keywords 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19' and 'ischemic stroke' up to November 28, 2020.Results: SARS-CoV-2 invades the host through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in the brain and vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate the host immune response and can cause inflammation, coagulation disorders, renin angiotensin system disorders, hypoxia, and stress disorders, which may lead to the occurrence of ischemic stroke.Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 can develop ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a high risk of causing disability and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is hoped that when medical staff treat patients with COVID-19, they would pay attention to the occurrence of ischemic stroke to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Song, Yuxia; Fan, Hongyang; Tang, XiaoJia; Luo, Yuhan; Liu, Peipei; Chen, Yingzhu",Int J Neurosci,,199

A systematic review was carried out in accordance with the guidelines developed by the National Institute of Health Research at York University. The PubMed, EBSCOhost, Ulakbim Medical Database, Turkish Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were scanned. Three keywords in the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the articles were searched for in the Medical Subject Headings: ""Pregnancy,"" ""Decision-making,"" and ""Internet."" A total of 1143 articles were found in the first screening. Duplicate articles were removed. The remaining articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria. Only articles about healthy pregnant women were accessed, and only full-text research articles published in English were used. Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. The sample size varied between 9 and 7092. Most studies reported that pregnant women use the Internet as a source of information about pregnancy. Pregnancy, development of the fetus, labor, neonatal health, and nutrition were the subjects most researched. It was found that women with a higher education, who were young, nulliparous, and primigravid, looked for more information on the Internet. The Internet affects decisions about the type of delivery, drug use in pregnancy, and physical activity. Using the Internet had a positive effect on the decision-making processes of pregnant women, increased their awareness, and had a visible effect on this process.","Tastekin Ouyaba, Ayse; Infal Kesim, Selma",,,199

Multiple molecular diagnostic methods received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) and were promptly validated for use nationwide. Several studies reported the analytical and/ or clinical evaluation of these molecular assays, however differences in the viral materials used for these evaluations complicated direct comparison of their analytical performance. In this study, we compared the analytical sensitivity (lower limit of detection, LOD) of seven commonly used qualitative SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays: the Abbott Molecular RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay, the NeuMoDx&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 assay, the Roche Cobas®SARS-CoV-2 assay, the BD SARS-CoV-2 reagents for BD MAX&#8482; system, the Hologic Aptima® SARS-CoV-2 assay, the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test, and the GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. The comparison was performed utilizing a single positive clinical specimen that was serially diluted in viral transport media and quantified by the EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. Replicate samples were prepared and evaluated for reproducibility across different molecular assays with multiple replicates per assay. Our data demonstrated that the seven assays could detect 100 % of replicates at a nucleocapsid gene concentration of (N1 = 1,267 and N2 = 1,392) copies/mL. At a one log less concentration, the Abbott, the Roche, and the Xpert Xpress assays detected 100 % of the tested replicates.","Mostafa, Heba H; Hardick, Justin; Morehead, Elizabeth; Miller, Jo-Anne; Gaydos, Charlotte A; Manabe, Yukari C",J Clin Virol,,199

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in primary human target cells and tissues is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, given the limited access to clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, there is a pressing need for in vitro/in vivo models to investigate authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung cells or tissues with mature structures. The present study was designed to evaluate a humanized mouse model carrying human lung xenografts for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Methods: Human fetal lung tissue surgically grafted under the dorsal skin of SCID mice were assessed for growth and development after 8 weeks. Following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation into the differentiated lung xenografts, viral replication, cell-type tropism and histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and local cytokine/chemokine expression were determined over a 6-day period. The effect of IFN-&#945; treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested in the lung xenografts. Results: Human lung xenografts expanded and developed mature structures closely resembling normal human lung. SARS-CoV-2 replicated and spread efficiently in the lung xenografts with the epithelial cells as the main target, caused severe lung damage, and induced a robust pro-inflammatory response. IFN-&#945; treatment effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung xenografts. Conclusions: These data support the human lung xenograft mouse model as a useful and biological relevant tool that should facilitate studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and the evaluation of potential antiviral therapies.","Fu, Wenkun; Wang, Wei; Yuan, Lunzhi; Lin, Yanzhen; Huang, Xiumin; Chen, Rirong; Cai, Minping; Liu, Che; Chen, Liqiang; Zhou, Ming; Wu, Kun; Zhao, Huan; Pan, Dequan; Ma, Jian; Hong, Junping; Zhai, Bingke; Zhang, Yali; Kong, Zhibo; Wang, Yingbin; Chen, Yixin; Yuan, Quan; Zhu, Huachen; Cheng, Tong; Guan, Yi; Xia, Ningshao",Theranostics,,199

The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological links between the outbreaks using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, including four non-outbreak (A1-A4) and three outbreak cases (A5-A7) in hospital A and eight cases (S1-S8) in hospital S. Patients' hospital stays, COVID-19 symptoms, and transfer history were reviewed. RNA samples were submitted for WGS and genome-wide single nucleotide variants and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. RESULTS: The index patient (A5) in hospital A was transferred from hospital S on 26 March. Patients A6 and A7 were the family caregiver and sister, respectively, of the patient who shared a room with A5 for 4 days. Prior to transfer, A5 was at the next bed to S8 in the emergency room on 25 March. Patient S6, a professional caregiver, took care of the patient in the room next to S8's room for 5 days until 22 March and then S5 for another 3 days. WGS revealed that SARS-CoV-2 in A2, A3, and A4 belong to clades V/B.2, S/A, and G/B.1, respectively, whereas that of A5-A7 and S1-S5 are of the V/B.2.1 clade and closely clustered. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 in patients A5 and S5 showed perfect identity. CONCLUSION: WGS is a useful tool to understand epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. It is the first study to elucidate the role of patient transfer and caregivers as links of nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 in multiple hospitals.","Park, Kuenyoul; Lee, Jaewoong; Lee, Kihyun; Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Sung Han; Lee, Jina; Chalita, Mauricio; Yoon, Seok Hwan; Chun, Jongsik; Hur, Kyu Hwa; Sung, Heungsup; Kim, Mi Na; Lee, Hae Kyung",J Korean Med Sci,,199

371651,Population density and basic reproductive number of COVID-19 across United States counties,2021,"Severe illness and poor outcome are mainly associated with aging or certain medical comorbidities, especially chronic diseases. However, factors for unfavorable prognosis have not been well described owing to relatively small sample sizes and single-center reports. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the contribution of comorbidities in the development of critical conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by conducting a meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of 18 studies. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most strongly associated with the overall critical condition (RR = 4.22, 95% CI = 3.12-5.69), followed by cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 3.00, 95% CI = 2.41-3.73), malignancy (RR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.16-3.91), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (RR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.95-4.19), diabetes (RR = 2.10, 95% CI = 2.16-3.91), hypertension (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.82-2.23), and chronic kidney disease (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.36-2.94). The presence of comorbidities except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease significantly increased the risk of severe infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cardiac injury in the subgroup analysis by types of critical conditions. Preexisting hypertension and diabetes additionally increased the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among comorbidities, COPD had the highest probability of leading to severe COVID-19, ICU admission, and liver injury, while malignancy was most likely to cause ARDS and cardiac injury. In summary, preexisting COPD, CVD, CVA, hypertension, diabetes, and malignancy are more likely to worsen the progression of COVID-19, with severe infection, ICU admission requirement, and cardiac injury development.","Tung, Hoang Tho Tran Thi Anh",Infection and Chemotherapy,,199

In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, when a physician has to consult a patient remotely, the introduction of a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire has become particularly important for assessing the course of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment interventions. Our study involved 60 children aged 8 to 12 years and was conducted at the Communal Nonprofit Organization ""City Children's Clinical Hospital of Lviv"" (Ukraine). After the linguistic validation, both the Ukrainian FAQLQ-CF and Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) were used for interviewing children with diagnosed food allergy during the visit to the allergist. The prevalence of allergies, the proportion and the correlation between different allergens were analyzed in the children involved in the study. Reliability of FAQLQ-CF was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha. A factor analysis was performed to assess construct validity and to reveal an underlying structure of four factors that explain a total of 55% percent of the variance. The significant strong positive correlation was between the total FAQLQ-CF and the total FAIM (r=0.81, p&gt;0.05). Each of the FAQLQ-CF subscales correlated significantly with at least one of the FAIM scale questions. The internal consistency of the Ukrainian FAQLQ-CF was sufficient (Cronbach's alpha 0.73). The Ukrainian FAQLQ-CF is acknowledged as a suitable, reliable and valid tool to be self-completed by food allergic children aged 8-12 years. The information obtained from this questionnaire can be used in clinical trials, aiming at outcome assessment.","Matsyura, O.; Borysiuk, O.; Besh, L.; Zubchenko, S.; Lukyanenko, N.; Gutor, T.; Kovalska, O.; Flokstra-de Blok, B.

This emerging disease has caused an unexpected turn in the economy and in society, which has led to the necessity of social isolation and confinement. Diabetic foot consultation was affected by the ongoing situation. The aim of this study was to compare the number of medical visits and the severity of new lesions at presentation at the Diabetic Foot Unit during June 2020 compared to June 2019. Three hundred and fifty six medical visits were analyzed, resulting in a 29% reduction in the number of visits during 2020. The number of patients presenting with new lesions increased from 6.4% to 10.3% (p = ns) during pandemic. The number of visits from the patients' relatives was higher during June 2020 (16.3% vs. 1.4%) (p < 0.05). Controls of feet without active lesions (i.e.: closed wound or periodic control) decreased from 16.8% to 4.5% (p < 0.05).

374365,Gambling during the COVID-19 crisis - A cause for concern?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a new reusable, sterilisable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)-comparable face mask, known as the Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) system, given the dire need for personal protective equipment within healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Single-arm feasibility study. SETTING: Emergency department and outpatient oncology clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers who have previously undergone N95 fit testing. INTERVENTIONS: Fit testing of new iMASC system. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome is success of fit testing using an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-approved testing method, and secondary outcomes are user experience with fit, breathability and filter replacement. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were recruited to undergo fit testing, and the average age of subjects was 41 years (range of 21-65 years) with an average body mass index of 26.5 kg/m2. The breakdown of participants by profession was 46% nurses (n=11), 21% attending physicians (n=5), 21% resident physicians (n=5) and 12% technicians (n=3). Of these participants, four did not perform the fit testing due to the inability to detect saccharin solution on premask placement sensitivity test, lack of time and inability to place mask over hair. All participants (n=20) who performed the fit test were successfully fitted for the iMASC system using an OSHA-approved testing method. User experience with the iMASC system, as evaluated using a Likert scale with a score of 1 indicating excellent and a score of 5 indicating very poor, demonstrated an average fit score of 1.75, breathability of 1.6, and ease of replacing the filter on the mask was scored on average as 2.05. CONCLUSIONS: The iMASC system was shown to successfully fit multiple different face sizes and shapes using an OSHA-approved testing method.

This study was conducted to understand the experiences of students with preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities at a public university during COVID-19. We examined disruptions in the management of preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities and its impact on psychological well-being. Students were surveyed about their health care experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic between June and September 2020. Linear regressions and mediation analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between disruption to care, mental health self-efficacy, and four psychological well-being outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression, and overall distress). Of the total (N = 1,082) study participants, 258 (24%) reported having a preexisting mental health condition(s) or disabilities (81% female; Mage = 23.47). Of those, 155 (61%) reported that COVID-19 disrupted health care delivery and management of their conditions or disabilities. Of those who reported this disruption, 51% (n = 109) of participants reported a disruption in their ability to see a health care professional and 58% (n = 69) reported either that they lost care or that the quality of the new telemedicine care was not sufficient. A series of linear regressions revealed significant relationships between disruption to care and the four psychological outcomes. Mediation analyses revealed that depression, stress, anxiety, and overall distress were mediated by self-efficacy in managing mental health. University administrators and health care providers should evaluate the scope of mental health care and telemedicine services for students to help long-term psychological effects of COVID-19.","Ligus, Kaleigh; Fritzson, Emily; Hennessy, Emily A; Acabchuk, Rebecca L; Bellizzi, Keith",Transl Behav Med,,199

Humoral immunity plays critical roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery from COVID-19. However, differences in immune responses and clinical features among COVID-19 patients remain largely unknown. Here, we report a database for COVID-19-specific IgG/IgM immune responses and clinical parameters (COVID-ONE humoral immune). COVID-ONE humoral immunity is based on a dataset that contains the IgG/IgM responses to 21 of 28 known SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 197 spike protein peptides against 2,360 COVID-19 samples collected from 783 patients. In addition, 96 clinical parameters for the 2,360 samples and information for the 783 patients are integrated into the database. Furthermore, COVID-ONE humoral immune provides a dashboard for defining samples and a one-click analysis pipeline for a single group or paired groups. A set of samples of interest is easily defined by adjusting the scale bars of a variety of parameters.

375833,Covid-19: now is not the time to judge the UK's response,2020,"In March/April 2020 the Italian government drastically reduced vehicle traffic and interrupted all non-essential industrial activities over the entire national territory. Italy thus became the first country in the world, with the exception of Hubei, to enact lockdown measures as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to contain it. Italy is also a seismically active area, and as such is monitored by a dense permanent network of seismic stations. We analyse continuous seismic data from many stations in northern and central Italy, and quantify the impact of the lockdown on seismic ambient noise, as a function of time and location. We find that the lockdown reduces ambient noise significantly in the 1-10 Hz frequency range; because natural sources of seismic noise are not affected by the lockdown, the seismic signature of anthropic noise can be characterised with unprecedented clarity, by simply comparing the signal recorded before and after the lockdown. Our results correlate well with independent evaluations of the impact of the lockdown (e.g., cell phone displacements), and we submit that ambient-noise seismology is a useful tool to monitor containment measures such as the coronavirus lockdowns.","Poli, Piero; Boaga, Jacopo; Molinari, Irene; Cascone, Valeria; Boschi, Lapo",Sci Rep,,199

In this article, we make a contribution to the recent and growing scientific debate by exploring academic researchers’ processes of construction and de-construction of spatial, temporal and relational boundaries that take place in the pandemic work-life stay-athome style. Particular attention is paid to some macro-structural drivers of work and family life, specifically the role of gender and the organisational culture of the neoliberal university. We chose an exploratory, qualitative, non-directive methodology in order to grasp the permeability between the public and the private that this pandemic, as ever before, makes clear. The empirical material consists of ten in-depth narrative videointerviews conducted online with Italian researchers living in different Regions. The article offers an empirical analysis of working from home with a specific focus on the academic context, which is a privileged setting for the investigation of gender inequalities. The analysis sheds light on subjective experiences of the disarticulation of boundaries and their intertwining with the neoliberal ideal type of academic researcher that have unequal consequences on the experience of time-space, productivity, and intimate relationships between men and women, women with and without children and people who live alone or with family. © 2020.

376096,Make-over in the sustainable working platform during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, software engineers' daily life was disrupted and they were abruptly forced into working remotely from home. Across one exploratory and one confirmatory study (N = 482), we tested whether a typical working day is different to pre-pandemic times and whether specific tasks are associated with task-specific satisfaction and productivity. To explore the subject domain, we first run a two-wave longitudinal study, where we found that the time software engineers spent doing specific tasks (e.g., coding, bugfixing, helping others) from home was similar to pre-pandemic times. Also, the amount of time developers spent on each task was unrelated to their general well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables such as basic needs. In our confirmatory study, we found that task satisfaction and productivity are predicted by task-specific variables (e.g., how much autonomy software engineers had during coding) but not by task-independent variables such as general resilience or a good work-life balance. Additionally, we found that satisfaction and autonomy were significantly higher when software engineers were helping others and lower when they were bugfixing. Also, contrary to anecdotal evidence, software engineers' satisfaction and productivity during meetings is not lower compared to other tasks. Finally, we discuss implications for software engineers, management, and researchers.","Russo, Daniel; Hanel, Paul H.P.; Altnickel, Seraphina; Berkel, Niels van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07944v1.pdf,199

AIMS: To describe the national and regional temporal trends in emergency department (ED) admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, before, during and after the first national lockdown. METHODS: The weekly numbers of ED admissions for MI and stroke were collected from the OSCOUR® network, which covers 93.3% of all ED admissions in France. National and regional incidence rate ratios from 02 February until 31 May (2020 versus 2017-2019) were estimated using Poisson regression for MI and stroke, before, during and after lockdown. RESULTS: A decrease in ED admissions was observed for MI (-20% for ST-segment elevation MI and-25% for non-ST-segment elevation MI) and stroke (-18% for ischaemic and-22% for haemorrhagic) during the lockdown. The decrease became significant earlier for stroke than for MI. No compensatory increase in ED admissions was observed at the end of the lockdown for these diseases. Important regional disparities in ED admissions were observed, without correlation with the regional levels of COVID-19 cases. The impact of lockdown on ED admissions was particularly significant in six regions (Ile-de France, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hauts-de-France and Bretagne). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in ED admissions for MI and stroke observed during the lockdown was probably caused by fear of COVID-19 and augmented by the lockdown, and was heterogeneous across the French territory. ED admissions were slow to return to the usual levels from previous years, without a compensatory increase. These results underline the need to reinforce messages directed at the population to encourage them to seek care without delay in case of cardiovascular symptoms.","Olié, Valérie; Carcaillon-Bentata, Laure; Thiam, Marie-Michèle; Haeghebaert, Sylvie; Caserio-Schönemann, Céline",Arch Cardiovasc Dis,,199

Self-interested behaviour results in students not being ‘willing’ to adopt leadership roles. Students perceive business simulation and work-integrated learning activities to hold the potential to improve their ‘ability’ to lead.Practical implicationsThe study offers a conceptual schema for student leadership development, suggesting that accounting curricula in higher education should include the assessment of scaffolded leadership development activities.

One subgroup of PASC is a syndrome called ""long COVID-19,"" reminiscent of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a debilitating condition, often triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to years-long debilitating symptoms including profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive deficits, and orthostatic intolerance. Some are skeptical that either ME/CFS or long COVID-19 involves underlying biological abnormalities. However, in this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases. We also examine the bidirectional relationship between redox imbalance, inflammation, energy metabolic deficits, and a hypometabolic state. We speculate as to what may be causing these abnormalities. Thus, understanding the molecular underpinnings of both PASC and ME/CFS may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.","Paul, Bindu D; Lemle, Marian D; Komaroff, Anthony L; Snyder, Solomon H",Proc.

Various literature databases like PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to find the mean of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in different states and union territories of India, Pearson correlation was carried out to investigate the possible link between mean 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality per million of the population. RESULTS: An inverse correlation was observed between the mean level of 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (r = -0.43, p = 0.02) and mortality rate (r = -0.42, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present observational study revealed an association of vitamin D with SARS-CoV-2 infection and related mortality. Further studies are required to validate our observations.","Padhi, Sunali; Suvankar, Subham; Panda, Venketesh K; Pati, Abhijit; Panda, Aditya K",Int Immunopharmacol,,199

In this research, our team investigated the changes in the daily mobility pattern of people during the pandemic by utilizing an integrated data panel. To incorporate various aspects of human mobility, the team focused on the Social Distancing Index (SDI) which was calculated based on five basic mobility measures. The SDI patterns showed a plateau stage in the beginning of April that lasted for about two weeks. This phenomenon then followed by a universal decline of SDI, increased number of trips and reduction in percentage of people staying at home. We called the observation Quarantine Fatigue. The Rate of Change (ROC) method was employed to trace back the start date of quarantine fatigue which was indicated to be April 15th. Our analysis showed that despite the existence of state-to-state variations, most states started experiencing a quarantine fatigue phenomenon during the same period. This observation became more important by knowing that none of the states had officially announced the reopening until late April showing that people decided to loosen up their social distancing practices before the official reopening announcement. Moreover, our analysis indicated that official reopening led to a rapid decline in SDI, raising the concern of a second wave of outbreak. The synchronized trend among states also emphasizes the importance of a more nationwide decision-making attitude for the future as the condition of each state depends on the nationwide behavior.","Zhao, Jun; Lee, Minha; Ghader, Sepehr; Younes, Hannah; Darzi, Aref; Xiong, Chenfeng; Zhang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03716v2.pdf,199

The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.","Daughton, Christian G",Glob Epidemiol,,199

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among persons with diabetes (PWDs) registered for care at a diabetes clinic of a tertiary care center in Southern India. We collected following information by telephonic interviews: physician consultations, access to diabetes medications and blood sugar tests, use of telemedicine services, out of pocket expenditure and psychological morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 350 PWDs were interviewed. Majority were male (78%) and from rural areas (79%). One fourth (24%) met any physician for diabetes care at least once during lockdown. PWDs from rural areas mainly consulted a physician in a private clinic (55%) compared to urban areas (26%). Two third (65%) availed medications from private medical shops. Almost half (46%) got their blood sugar tested during and majority of them (81%) reported unsatisfactory glycemic control. Only few (5%) was aware and three utilized telemedicine services. Almost all (99%) spent money (US $ 8.3) for diabetes care. One third (33%) had moderate or high psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of PWDs did not consult a physician during lockdown.

Despite the implications for equity and emergency planning, we lack a quantitative understanding of how these social fault lines translate to different behaviors in large-scale emergency contexts. Here we investigate this problem in the context of Hurricane Harvey, using over 30 million anonymized GPS records from over 150,000 opted-in users in the Greater Houston Area to quantify patterns of disaster-inflicted relocation activities before, during, and after the shock. We show that evacuation distance is highly homogenous across individuals from different types of neighborhoods classified by race and wealth, obeying a truncated power-law distribution. Yet here the similarities end: we find that both race and wealth strongly impact evacuation patterns, with disadvantaged minority populations less likely to evacuate than wealthier white residents. Finally, there are considerable discrepancies in terms of departure and return times by race and wealth, with strong social cohesion among evacuees from advantaged neighborhoods in their destination choices. These empirical findings bring new insights into mobility and evacuations, providing policy recommendations for residents, decision makers, and disaster managers alike.","Deng, Hengfang; Aldrich, Daniel P.; Danziger, Michael M.; Gao, Jianxi; Phillips, Nolan E.; Cornelius, Sean P.; Wang, Qi Ryan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11169v2.pdf,199

Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","van Agteren, Joep; Bartholomaeus, Jonathan; Fassnacht, Daniel B; Iasiello, Matthew; Ali, Kathina; Lo, Laura; Kyrios, Michael",JMIR Ment Health,,199

People have been repeatedly exposed to such messages; however, whether the messages keep exerting a significant impact over time remains unclear. From April to August 2020, we conducted a four-wave online survey experiment to examine how five types of nudge-based messages influence Japanese people's self-reported preventive behaviors. In particular, we investigate how their behaviors are affected by repeated displays over time. The analysis with 4241 participants finds that only a gain-framed altruistic message, emphasizing their behavioral adherence would protect the lives of people close to them, reduces their frequency of going out and contacting others. We do not find similar behavioral changes in messages that contain an altruistic element but emphasize it in a loss-frame or describe their behavioral adherence as protecting both one's own and others' lives. Furthermore, the behavioral change effect of the gain-framed altruistic message disappears in the third and fourth waves, although its impact of reinforcing intentions remains. This message has even an adverse effect of worsening the compliance level of infection-prevention behaviors for the subgroup who went out less frequently before the experiment. The study's results imply that when using nudge-based messages as a countermeasure for COVID-19, policymakers and practitioners need to carefully scrutinize the message elements and wording and examine to whom and how the messages should be delivered while considering their potential adverse and side effects.","Sasaki, Shusaku; Kurokawa, Hirofumi; Ohtake, Fumio",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),,199

Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 leads to multifaceted disease outcomes from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress and potentially death. Understanding the host immune response is crucial for the development of interventional strategies. Humoral responses play an important role in defending viral infections and are therefore of particular interest. With the aim to resolve SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses at the epitope level, we screened clinically well-characterized sera from COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease outcome using high-density peptide microarrays covering the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we determined the longevity of epitope-specific antibody responses in a longitudinal approach.

However, the sudden shift to remote and online learning, as a result of social isolation during COVID-19, has created a social disconnect, making these immediate regulatory supports less accessible. A need was identified for strategies to support collaborative learning regulation when learning remotely and online. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on models of self-, co, and socially shared learning regulation, a series of resources were developed for students, teachers and parents to support effective online collaborative learning. These strategies embedded evidence-based principles of learning drawn from the learning sciences, including elaboration, retrieval, dual coding and concrete examples. Findings: A set of ten student resources have been developed, accompanied by supporting information and strategies for teachers and families. These resources have been shared with schools across Australia. Originality/value: These evidence-based strategies are valuable, as they are addressing an identified urgent community need. Based on the science of learning, these strategies are original in synthesising effective learning techniques with the three forms of learning regulation to encourage student connection and collaboration in online and remote learning.","MacMahon, Stephanie; Leggett, Jack; Carroll, Annemaree",inform.Learn.Sci,,199

Myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) was positive. We diagnosed ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (ANCA-RV). Treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by prednisolone (PSL) at 30 mg/day. We gradually reduced the PSL dose to 7.5 mg/day over 6 months. At that time, the patient developed disturbances of consciousness which progressed subacutely. MRI revealed regions of patchy white matter with an increased signal on T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences. JC virus DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), leading to a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare infectious demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus infection, occurring in highly immunosuppressed individuals such as HIV-infected patients and patients using some biological agents, and having a very poor prognosis. In the present case, PML may have been associated with steroid use, although there are very few case reports of PML in patients taking only steroids. We report progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during steroid treatment of ANCA-RV. When patients show progressive disturbance of consciousness during treatment for ANCA-RV, we need to take PML into consideration for differential diagnosis.","Tawara, Takashi; Kai, Hirayasu; Kageyama, Mikiko; Akiyama, Tomoki; Matsunaga, Takahiro; Sakuma, Aki; Ishii, Ryota; Tsunoda, Ryouya; Kawamura, Tetusya; Fujita, Akiko; Kaneko, Shuzo; Morito, Naoki; Saito, Chie; Usui, Joichi; Yamagata, Kunihiro",CEN case reports,,199
395892,Rapid Community Innovation: a Small Urban Liberal Arts Community Response to COVID-19,2020,"Since the discovery of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathology showed different faces. There is an increasing number of cases described as (meningo)encephalitis although evidence often lacks. Anosmia, another atypical form of COVID-19, has been considered as testimony of the potential of neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, though this hypothesis remains highly speculative. We did a review of the cases reported as brain injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Over 98 papers found, 21 were analyzed. Only four publications provided evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the central nervous system (CNS). When facing acute neurological abnormalities during an infectious episode it is often difficult to disentangle neurological symptoms induced by the brain infection and those due to the impact of host immune response on the CNS. Cytokines release can disturb neural cells functioning and can have in the most severe cases vascular and cytotoxic effects. An inappropriate immune response can lead to the production of auto-antibodies directed toward CNS components. In the case of proven SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion, the main hypothesis found in the literature focus on a neural pathway, especially the direct route via the nasal cavity, although the virus is likely to reach the CNS using other routes. Our ability to come up with hypotheses about the mechanisms by which the virus might interact with the CNS may help to keep in mind that all neurological symptoms observed during COVID-19 do not always rely on CNS viral invasion.","Pouga, Lydia",J. med. virol,,199

We compile industrial, transport, and construction data to estimate the reductions in energy-related CO2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 in China. Our results show that the fossil fuel related CO2 emissions decreased by 18.7% (182 MtCO2) in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, including reductions of 12.2% (92 MtCO2) in industry sectors, 61.9% (62 MtCO2) in transport, and 23.9% (28 MtCO2) in construction. The figure in annual CO2 emission reductions is expected to limit with an estimate of 1.6%. However, to achieve the economic target for the 13th Five-Year-Plan, stimulus packages including investments in ""shovel-ready"" infrastructure projects issued by China's central and local governments to response the COVID-19 may increase CO2 emissions with a higher speed in the coming years.

396233,Covid-19 and inequality: the importance of social rights,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Pan, Lei; Mu, Mi; Yang, Pengcheng; Sun, Yu; Wang, Runsheng; Yan, Junhong; Li, Pibao; Hu, Baoguang; Wang, Jing; Hu, Chao; Jin, Yuan; Niu, Xun; Ping, Rongyu; Du, Yingzhen; Li, Tianzhi; Xu, Guogang; Hu, Qinyong; Tu, Lei",Am J Gastroenterol,,199

During a pandemic, the medical community is attentive to controlling the disease outbreak, and most of the literature regarding physician involvement during a pandemic focuses primarily on physicians traveling to areas of need to help treat the disease. As a result, little has been written about medical volunteerism that focuses on medical treatment unrelated to the disease outbreak. In a world-wide pandemic, many factors are to be considered in determining whether, and when, a physician should travel to another region to provide care and training for medical issues not directly related to the pandemic. Leaders of humanitarian committees of orthopaedic surgery subspecialties engaged with one another and host orthopaedic surgeons and a sponsoring organization to provide thoughtful insight and expert opinion on the challenges faced and possible pathways to provide continued orthopaedic support around the globe.

METHODS: We collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 managed at the hospital. We compared their mean facility-based costs with those paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying cost-drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Total utilization costs ranged from US $494 for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US $4553 for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32%-66% of facility-based cost were subsidized, costs of SVD and CD during the pandemic have doubled and tripled, respectively, compared with those paid pre-COVID-19. Of the facility-based costs, cost of personal protective equipment was the major cost-driver (50%). Oxygen was the major driver for women with severe COVID-19 (48%). Excluding treatment costs for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs were US $228 (SVD) and US $948 (CD). CONCLUSION: Despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive.

For this purpose, we assess the limitations of bioclimatic correlative models to explain the geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of medical geography. Overall, there is a broad consensus that the global distribution of COVID-19 is not random but conditioned by environmental drivers. However, as the COVID-19 distribution becomes global, including tropical climates, the evidence reveals that atmospheric conditions explain, at most, only a limited amount of the space-time dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the usefulness of approaches based on bioclimatic envelopes is in question since the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19 seems to be the anthroposphere's non-stationary environment. In this sense, there is a need to clarify further the role of different transmission routes at multiple scales and outdoor and indoor environments beyond bioclimatic envelopes. At this time, the possible influence of the weather in COVID-19 spread is not sufficient to be taken into account in public health policies. Hence, until reliable bioclimatic envelopes of SARS-CoV-2, if any, are found, caution should be exercised when reporting, as this could have unforeseen consequences.","Gutiérrez-Hernández, Oliver; García, Luis V",Environ Res,,199

Despite this, reliable clinical performance data from large field studies is sparse. METHODS: In a prospective performance evaluation study, RDT from three manufacturers (NADAL®, Panbio&#8482;, MEDsan®, conducted on different samples) were compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 068 oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. Viral load was derived from standardised RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values. The data collection period ranged from November 12, 2020 to February 28, 2021. FINDINGS: The sensitivity of RDT compared to RT-qPCR was 42·57% (95% CI 33·38%-52·31%). The specificity was 99·68% (95% CI 99·48%-99·80%). Sensitivity declined with decreasing viral load from 100% in samples with a deduced viral load of &#8805;108 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml to 8·82% in samples with a viral load lower than 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml. No significant differences in sensitivity or specificity could be observed between samples with and without spike protein variant B.1.1.7. The NPV in the study cohort was 98·84%; the PPV in persons with typical COVID-19 symptoms was 97·37%, and 28·57% in persons without or with atypical symptoms. INTERPRETATION: RDT are a reliable method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons with high viral load. RDT are a valuable addition to RT-qPCR testing, as they reliably detect infectious persons with high viral loads before RT-qPCR results are available.

For participant safety, in-person mindfulness groups were transitioned online and assessments took place online. Survey questions asked participants about changes in their stress, smoking habits and quit attempts, as well as their perceptions of the mindfulness and text messaging intervention in the context of the pandemic. RESULTS: Most participants (71%, 15 of 21) indicated a change in stress due to the pandemic, with 93% (14 of 15) of those indicating higher stress. Participants shared concerns about finances, homelessness, health and social isolation. Most (81%, 17 of 21) believed that smoking increases risk for contracting COVID-19, and although that was motivating for some, others expressed lower motivation to quit because of higher stress. Most (86%, 18 of 21) said that practicing mindfulness was helpful during the pandemic. Mean ratings of the helpfulness of text messages and the extent they would recommend the program to others were 7.1 (median 8 on 10-point scale, SD=2.9) and 8.2 (median 9, SD=2.5), respectively. Through open-ended program evaluations, participants shared details about how mindfulness practice and the text messages helped them to manage stress and feel a sense of social support during the pandemic. Moreover, 53% (10 of 19) of participants achieved 7-day abstinence from smoking, with no differences between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the promise of text messaging and use of teleconferencing to provide mindfulness and smoking cessation services to underserved populations during a global pandemic.","Mhende, J.; Bell, S.

403004,Does COVID-19 offer English school leaders the opportunity to rethink schools?,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally for several months. Because its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, it is crucial to accurately and quickly detect COVID-19 infection. Many recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans. However, most existing work focuses on 2D datasets, which may result in low quality models as the real CT scans are 3D images. Besides, the reported results span a broad spectrum on different datasets with a relatively unfair comparison. In this paper, we first use three state-of-the-art 3D models (ResNet3D101, DenseNet3D121, and MC3\_18) to establish the baseline performance on the three publicly available chest CT scan datasets. Then we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to automatically search for the 3D DL models for 3D chest CT scans classification with the Gumbel Softmax technique to improve the searching efficiency. We further exploit the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique on our models to provide the interpretability of the results. The experimental results show that our automatically searched models (CovidNet3D) outperform the baseline human-designed models on the three datasets with tens of times smaller model size and higher accuracy. Furthermore, the results also verify that CAM can be well applied in CovidNet3D for COVID-19 datasets to provide interpretability for medical diagnosis.","He, Xin; Wang, Shihao; Chu, Xiaowen; Shi, Shaohuai; Tang, Jiangping; Liu, Xin; Yan, Chenggang; Zhang, Jiyong; Ding, Guiguang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05442v1.pdf,199

405036,Covid-19 as a Social Crisis and Justice Challenge for Cities,2020,"Addressing the vulnerability and unique needs of homeless populations during pandemics has been a major component of the Canadian federal response to the COVID-19 crisis. Rural and remote communities, however, have received little to no funding to aid in their care of homeless people during the pandemic. Similarly, there has been little to no research on rural communities' pandemic preparedness in the context of homelessness. There are large numbers of homeless individuals in rural and remote Canada, including Indigenous peoples who are over-represented in homeless populations. Rural communities, including rural and remote Indigenous communities, are often isolated and more limited than urban areas in their capacity to respond to pandemics. They are particularly vulnerable due to fewer healthcare and social service resources-the lack of which has been particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, we suggest that policy-makers need to take seriously the situation of rural homelessness in Canada, its implications for individual and community health, and consequences in the context of pandemics. Policy- and decision-makers can address these concerns through increased homelessness funding and support for rural and remote communities, policy change to recognize the unique challenges associated with rural pandemic planning and homelessness, and more research that can be translated into policy, programs, and supports for rural homelessness and pandemic planning response.","Schiff, Rebecca; Buccieri, Kristy; Schiff, Jeannette Waegemakers; Kauppi, Carol; Riva, Mylene",Can. j. public health,,199

Using topic modeling on over 1,100 open reports from a survey fielded during the first four weeks of the lockdown in Germany, we shed light on how personal experiences of the lockdown differ between women and men. Our results show that, in general, people were most concerned about social contacts and childcare. However, we find clear differences among genders: women worried more about childcare while men were more concerned about paid work and the economy. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting women more heavily than men not only at the physical level of work (e.g. women are reducing more paid work hours than men), but also through increasing the division regarding the cognitive level of work (e.g. women are more worried about childcare work while men are about paid work).

Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. Methods: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Conclusions: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.","Harris, Carlyn; Carson, Gail; Baillie, J Kenneth; Horby, Peter; Nair, Harish",J Glob Health,,199

Exploring the health-economy trade-off during COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was expected to have a negative impact on organ donation. With the differences in health care systems and lockdown policies in various regions, the pandemic's effect on organ donation and transplant service may vary. Most of the deceased donor organ referrals in our hospital came from non-intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study is to report our experience and quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on deceased donor organ donation in our center. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study comparing the deceased donor organ donation activity during the period January 23 to November 30, 2020 with the same period in 2018 in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS: There was a 26.9% reduction in deceased donor organ donor referral in 2020 compared with 2018. No significant difference in the proportion of referrals from ICU or non-ICU areas between the 2 time periods was observed. The brain death confirmation rate was significantly higher in 2020 (40.8% vs 20.2%, P = .003). Nine patients had family consent for organ donation in 2020 (vs 7 patients in the same period in 2018). There were no significant differences in consent rate and number of recovered organs between the 2 periods. CONCLUSIONS: With effective measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in a community, it is possible to support the needs of both patients with COVID-19 and deceased donor organ donation services.","Cheung, Chi Yuen; Pong, Mei Lan; Au Yeung, Suk Fun; Chak, Wai Leung",Transplant. proc,,199

408039,Ensuring Continuity of Pediatric Psychological Assessment Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic Challenges and Long-Term Implications,2020,"Early and accurate diagnosis of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is essential for patient isolation and contact tracing so that the spread of infection can be limited. Computed tomography (CT) can provide important information in COVID-19, especially for patients with moderate to severe disease as well as those with worsening cardiopulmonary status. As an automatic tool, deep learning methods can be utilized to perform semantic segmentation of affected lung regions, which is important to establish disease severity and prognosis prediction. Both the extent and type of pulmonary opacities help assess disease severity. However, manually pixel-level multi-class labelling is time-consuming, subjective, and non-quantitative. In this article, we proposed a hybrid weak label-based deep learning method that utilize both the manually annotated pulmonary opacities from COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient-level disease-type information available from the clinical report. A UNet was firstly trained with semantic labels to segment the total infected region. It was used to initialize another UNet, which was trained to segment the consolidations with patient-level information using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, multi-institutional CT datasets from Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the United States were utilized. Results show that our proposed method can predict the infected regions as well as the consolidation regions with good correlation to human annotation.","Wu, Dufan; Gong, Kuang; Arru, Chiara Daniela; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bizzo, Bernardo; Buch, Varun; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Neumark, Nir; Xu, Pengcheng; Liu, Zhiyuan; Fang, Wei; Xie, Nuobei; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca; Masjedi, Mahsa; Talari, Hamidreza; Babaei, Rosa; Mobin, Hadi Karimi; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Li, Quanzheng",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,199

408356,Assisting School Leaders in Overcoming Challenges Related to Covid-19,2020,"It is assumed that healthcare workers are at the highest risk to be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, few data from healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection support this assumption. We investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (Ig G) against SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the general population in a well-defined geographical area. The first part of the study was conducted in May 2020 in Val Mesolcina (Southern Switzerland), a valley with ~8000 inhabitants. All healthcare workers were invited. All participants (n = 488) of the Swiss Longitudinal Cohort Study (SWICOS), a cohort representative of the general population, were also invited. Circulating Ig G against spike protein subunit 1 of SARS-CoV-2 were tested in each subject. Subjects with positive Ig G were tested again after 6 months. The condition of being a healthcare worker, rather than a part of the general population, was tested as a predictor of seroprevalence positivity by both simple and multiple (adjusted for age and sex) logistic regression. Eleven (2.6%) of the 423 SWICOS participants and 46 (16%) out of 289 healthcare workers were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The seroprevalence OR was 7.01 (95% CI: 3.53-15.47) for healthcare workers as compared to SWICOS participants. After adjusting for age and gender, the seroprevalence OR was 5.13 (95% CI: 2.54-10.40). About three quarters of the subjects in the SWICOS (73%) and in healthcare (79%) group with a previous positive serology still presented positive Ig G against the SARS-CoV-2 after 6 months. The present seroprevalence data point out that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is seven times higher among healthcare workers than in the general population of Val Mesolcina. Efforts to effectively protect all the healthcare personnel are needed.","Milani, G. P.; Bianchetti, M. G.; Togni, G.; Schoenenberger, A. W.; Muggli, F.",Pathogens,,199

408597,"Covid-19, The local and the global: Lessons from Kerala",2020,"Background. Several cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been previously described. QT prolongation has been reported in COVID-19 infection in association with medications such as azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine but has not previously been reported as a direct result of COVID-19 infection. Case summary. We report the case of a 65-year-old female who developed a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) during a hospital admission with COVID-19. This patient was not on any QT prolonging treatment, serum electrolytes were normal, and there was no identifiable reversible cause for the QTc lengthening. Daily serial ECGs during admission showed resolution of the ventricular repolarization abnormality in synchronization with resolution of her COVID-19 viral illness. Discussions. Although there have been reports of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients, previous reports of this are for patients receiving medication that causes QT prolongation. This case uniquely demonstrates the development and resolution of this temporary ventricular repolarization abnormality in a patient with a structurally normal heart with no evidence of myocardial fibrosis or edema on cardiac MRI, that is unexplained by other confounding factors, such as medication. This suggests there may be a direct association between COVID-19 and temporary QTc prolongation.

409741,Evaluating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Residential Energy Use in Los Angeles,2021,"Background The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased the probability of viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some drawbacks have been observed with its extensive use, such as headaches, anxiety, and stress among physicians, which could affect decision-making processes, the performance of physicians, and consequently patients’ safety. Few articles have studied the impact of PPE on physicians from different specialties. This study assessed the effect of wearing PPE on the performance and decision-making of physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the effects of wearing PPE on physicians from different specialties. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out through an anonymous 39-item online questionnaire. The physicians were divided according to the probability and frequency of performing invasive procedures. Group 1 included emergency medicine and critical care physicians, intensivists, and anesthetists, group 2 included physicians from different surgical subspecialties, and group 3 included physicians from different medical fields. Results This study included 272 physicians;group 1 included 54, group 2 included 120, and group 3 included 98 physicians. Approximately, 90.4% of the participants aged between 30-40 years, and 72.8% of the participants were specialists. Results indicated that the comfort, vision, and communication were significantly reduced in all groups (81.1%, 88.7%, and 75.5%, respectively). In contrast, the handling of instruments was not significantly affected in the second group only. In addition, the decision-making and the rate of complications were not significantly affected. Conclusion There was a negative impact of wearing PPE on the non-technical skills (vision, communication and overall comfort), and the technical skills of the physicians. The decision-making and patients’ safety were not significantly affected. Recommendations include additional improvement of the PPE design due to its crucial effect on both non-technical and technical skills of physicians.","Foula, Mohammed S.; Nwesar, Fayrouz A.; Foula, Ahmed Oraby Esraa H.; Alarfaj, Mosab A.; Foula, Hassan S.; Mohamed, Noha E.",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,,199
409742,Evaluating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Residential Energy Use in Los Angeles,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], &#8805;70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization. Fifty percent of inpatients were hospitalized more than 7 days. Median length of hospitalization was 13 days [IQR: 8-29] among individuals aged 19-44 years, and 17 days [IQR: 11-24.6] among those aged 45-69. Forty-two percent of the fatal cases occurred among adults under 60 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a high proportion of COVID-19 cases in Honduras occurred among younger adults, who also constituted a significant proportion of severe and fatal cases. Pre-existing conditions were associated with severe outcomes independently from age and were highly prevalent in Honduran COVID-19 cases.","Zuniga-Moya, Julio C; Norwood, Dalton Argean; Romero Reyes, Luis Enrique; Barrueto Saavedra, Emilio; Diaz, Roxana; Fajardo, Wendy Carolina; Pineda, Allan; Torres, Diana; Barahona, Rodolfo; Leiva, Said Omar; Hernandez, Pastora X; Silva, Hector; Leiva, Carlos Raul; Estrada, Lourdes; Barahona-Campos, Alma; Gordon, Aubree",Clin Infect Dis,,199
409864,No long-term consequences for social irresponsibility? Adidas’ rent incident during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany,2021,"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.","Zhou, Dan; Dai, Sheng-Ming; Tong, Qiang",J Antimicrob Chemother,,199

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional anonymous survey of N = 787/2,287 patients (response rate = 42.6%) from a single academic fertility center. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive supplemental educational explaining the rationale behind recommendations to delay fertility treatments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Assessment of well-being was conducted via the Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Ways of Coping-Revised, the Appraisal of Life Events Scale, and influence of supplemental education on agreement with ASRM COVID-19 Taskforce recommendations and associated distress. RESULTS: Participants in the education v. no education groups were 35.51 (SD = 4.06) and 37.24 (SD = 5.34) years old, married (90.8% v. 89.8%), had a graduate degree (53.9% v. 55.4%), > 1 year of infertility (73.4% v. 74.4%), and were nulliparous (69.0% v. 72.6%), with moderate to high distress (64.9% v. 64.2%) (ns). Distress was related to age, duration of infertility, and engagement in social support seeking and avoidant coping strategies (P < 0.001). Agreement with recommendations was related to receipt of supplemental education, history of pregnancy loss, and use of cognitive coping (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Most participants were distressed by the delay of treatments. Supplemental education increased acceptance of recommendations but did not decrease distress. Future treatment delays should include education related to and assessment of understanding of recommendations, and inclusion of mental health professionals in patient care.","Lawson, Angela K; McQueen, Dana B; Swanson, Amelia C; Confino, Rafael; Feinberg, Eve C; Pavone, Mary Ellen",J Assist Reprod Genet,,199
410864,Risk Attitudes and Human Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-10,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major health threat. Pregnancy can lead to an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Although chest computed tomography (CT) represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, lung ultrasound (LUS) could be a valid alternative in pregnancy. The objectives of this prospective study were to assess the role of LUS in the diagnosis of lung involvement and in helping the physicians in the management of affected patients. Thirty pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted at the obstetrical ward of our Hospital. Mean age was 31.2 years, mean gestational age 33.8 weeks. Several LUS were performed during hospitalization. The management of the patients was decided according to the LUS score and the clinical conditions. Mean gestational age at delivery was at 37.7 weeks, preterm birth was induced in 20% of cases for a worsening of the clinical conditions. No neonatal complications occurred. In 9 cases with a high LUS score, a chest CT was performed after delivery. CT confirmed the results of LUS, showing a significant positive correlation between the two techniques. LUS seems a safe alternative to CT in pregnancy and may help in the management of these patients.","Porpora, Maria Grazia; Merlino, Lucia; Masciullo, Luisa; D039,; Alisa, Rossella; Brandolino, Gabriella; Galli, Cecilia; De Luca, Casimiro; Pecorini, Francesco; Fonsi, Giovanni Battista; Mingoli, Andrea; Franchi, Cristiana; Oliva, Alessandra; Manganaro, Lucia; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Piccioni, Maria Grazia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199
411217,COVID-19 Crisis and Screening of Foreign Direct Investments in EU Privatized Companies (preprint),2021,"Introduction: Social or physical distancing has been an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19 infections. Investigating the determinants of adherence to social distancing can inform public health strategies to improve the behaviour. However, there is a lack of data in various populations. This study investigates the degree to which South Africans complied with social distancing during the country's COVID-19 lockdown and identifies the determinants associated with being in close contact with large numbers of people. Materials and Methods: Data was collected from a South African national online survey on a data free platform, supplemented with telephone interviews. The survey was conducted from 8 to 29 April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of people that participants came into close contact with (within a 2-metre distance) the last time they were outside their home during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multivariate multinomial regression investigated the socio-demographic, psychosocial and household environmental determinants associated with being in contact with 1-10, 11-50 and more than 50 people. Results: Of the 17,563 adult participants, 20.3% reported having not left home, 50.6% were in close physical distance with 1-10 people, 21.1% with 11-50 people, and 8.0% with >50 people. Larger household size and incorrect knowledge about the importance of social distancing were associated with being in contact with >50 people. Male gender, younger age and being in the White and Coloured population groups were significantly associated with being in contact with 1-10 people but not with larger numbers of people. Employment, at least secondary school education, lack of self-efficacy in being able to protect oneself from infection, and moderate or high risk perception of becoming infected, were all associated with increased odds of close contact with 1-10, 11-50, and >50 people relative to remaining at home. Conclusion: The findings identify subgroups of individuals that are less likely to comply with social distancing regulations. Public health communication, interventions and policy can be tailored to address these determinants of social distancing.","Sewpaul, Ronel; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Dukhi, Natisha; Naidoo, Inbarani; Vondo, Noloyiso; Davids, Adlai Steven; Mokhele, Tholang; Reddy, Sasiragha Priscilla",Front Public Health,,199

Both epithelial and endothelial cells of the cornea harbor primary cilia, which sense changes in the external environment and regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that the primary cilium regulates corneal development in several ways, including participation in corneal epithelial stratification and maintenance of corneal endothelial cell morphology. In addition, the primary cilium has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several corneal diseases. In this review, we discuss recent findings that demonstrate the critical role of the primary cilium in corneal development. We also discuss the link between ciliary dysfunction and corneal diseases, which suggests that the primary cilium could be targeted to treat these diseases.","Song, Ting; Zhou, Jun",Zool Res,,199

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 5 healthy donors and 13 patients with COVID-19, including moderate, severe and convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in patients with COVID-19 showed a strong interferon-&#945; response and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ effector-GNLY (granulysin), CD8+ effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of immune responses during disease progression.","Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Wang, Xiang-Ming; Xing, Xudong; Xu, Zhe; Zhang, Chao; Song, Jin-Wen; Fan, Xing; Xia, Peng; Fu, Jun-Liang; Wang, Si-Yu; Xu, Ruo-Nan; Dai, Xiao-Peng; Shi, Lei; Huang, Lei; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Shi, Ming; Zhang, Yuxia; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus; Bai, Fan; Wang, Fu-Sheng",Nat Immunol,,199

Here we quantify immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of 6 months from COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients who were among the first be infected world-wide. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increase rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset are associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlate closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Although specific IgM-S/N become undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers have an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilize at relatively high levels over the 6 month observation period. At late time points, the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are still >70%.

A total of 611 healthcare workers were included in the final analysis from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and overall psychological problems was 26.84%, 34.70%, 34.53%, and 46.48%, respectively. The prevalence rates of anxiety were approximately equal amongst the groups of healthcare workers, and moderate-to-severe anxiety was the most common in physicians (11.11%). The prevalence of depression was the highest in nurses (38.65%) and moderate-to-severe depression was mainly found in physicians (11.81%). The prevalence rates of insomnia were 34.03% in physicians, 36.20% in nurses, and 31.21% in technicians;in particular, the rate of moderate-to-severe insomnia was higher in physicians and nurses compared to technicians. The prevalence of overall moderate-to-severe psychological problems was the highest among physicians (14.58%), followed by nurses (12.58%) and technicians (9.22%). Statistically significant associated factors of current psychological problems were the occupations of physicians or nurses, less than 1 year of experience, university education, living with 4–5 people, reporting 1000–5000 m distance between home and workplace, participating in the COVID-19 control for less than 1 week, being under social isolation at home, being affected a lot by the community, reporting inadequate equipment in current workplace conditions, frequently working in the department directly in contact with the COVID-19 patients, and feeling anxious, stressed, or sad about current works.

Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID-19 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID-19 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from 25 March to 7 April 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated. Follow-up time was 30 days from hospital admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 subjects (55.0-75.8 years, 32% female). During the study period, 26 (19.7%) patients underwent IMV. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260-per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120-1.417; P < .001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI &#8804;30 Kg/m2 (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243-1.874; P < .001). NC showed a good discrimination power in predicting patients requiring IMV (AUC 0.783; 95% CI:0.684-0.882; P < .001). In particular, NC > 40.5 cm (>37.5 for females and >42.5 for males) showed a higher and earlier IMV risk compared to subjects with lower NC (Log-rank test: P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: NC is an easy to measure parameter able to predict the need for IMV in adult COVID-19 inpatients.","Di Bella, Stefano; Cesareo, Roberto; De Cristofaro, Paolo; Palermo, Andrea; Sanson, Gianfranco; Roman-Pognuz, Erik; Zerbato, Verena; Manfrini, Silvia; Giacomazzi, Donatella; Dal Bo, Eugenia; Sambataro, Gianluca; Macchini, Elisabetta; Quintavalle, Francesco; Campagna, Giuseppe; Masala, Renato; Ottaviani, Luigi; Del Borgo, Cosmo; Ridola, Lorenzo; Leonetti, Frida; Berlot, Giorgio; Luzzati, Roberto",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,199

Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1984-2017, we examine the role of extrahousehold kin wealth and poverty in shaping racial inequalities in the risk of exiting homeownership. Our nonlinear decomposition results indicate that racial differences in family network resources explain a nontrivial portion of the racial gap in homeownership exit, but there is little evidence that the effects of kin resources on exit are moderated by race. Among both Black and White owners, having wealthier noncoresident kin does not lessen the negative impacts of adverse economic or health shocks on the probability of losing homeownership. Our findings have implications for policies and programs designed to buttress the ability of minority households, especially those in financial distress, to sustain the wealth-building state of homeownership.","Sharp, Gregory; Whitehead, Ellen; Hall, Matthew",DemographyDemography,,199
414256,The political spin of conviction: A critical discourse analysis of the origin of covid-19,2021,"The HIV epidemic has dramatically changed over the past 30 years; there are now fewer newly infected people (especially children), fewer AIDS-related deaths, and more people with HIV (PWH) receiving treatment. However, the HIV epidemic is far from over. Despite the tremendous advances in anti-retroviral therapies (ART) and the implementation of ART regimens, HIV incidence (number of new infections over a defined period of time) and prevalence (the burden of HIV infection) in certain regions of the world and socio-economic groups are still on the rise. HIV continues to disproportionally affect highly marginalized populations that constitute higher-risk and stigmatized groups, underserved and/or neglected populations. In addition, it is not uncommon for PWH to suffer enhanced debilitating conditions resulting from the synergistic interactions of both communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While research utilizing only a comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the biological settings of the co-occurring conditions from a molecular and mechanistic view, harmful interactions between comorbidities are often overlooked, particularly under adverse socio-economical and behavioral circumstances, likely prompting disease clustering in PWH. Synergistic epidemics (syndemics) research aims to capture these understudied interactions: the mainly non-biological aspects that are central to interpret disease clustering in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities only framework. Connecting population-level clustering of social and health problems through syndemic interventions has proved to be a critical knowledge gap that will need to be addressed in order to improve prevention and care strategies and bring us a step closer to ending the HIV epidemic.","Peprah, Emmanuel; Caler, Elisabet; Snyder, Anya; Ketema, Fassil",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

Method: Case report where the data were extracted from the clinical history and is in accordance with the SCARE 2018 criteria. Description of the case: A 36-year-old man, with no significant history, who presented fever and mucopurulent expectoration of 1 month of evolution, received antibiotics for 4 weeks without response to treatment. Chest tomography shows cystic image with heterogeneous content in the left lower lobe. We decided to opt for surgery, previously 1 PCR in RT and 7 serological tests for COVID-19 were performed, the result of which was non-reactive. In the postoperative period, the patient developed fever and dyspnea on mild exertion, so a new serological test for COVID-19 was performed: IgM/IgG reactive, in addition chest tomography showed both lungs with ""cracy paving"" pattern. Discussion: The serological tests did not contribute to a timely diagnosis of COVID-19 and generated confusion. We used oxygen therapy, broad spectrum antibiotics since the diagnosis of COVID-19. Likewise, respiratory physiotherapy was intensified even after discharge. Conclusion: The early diagnosis and use of antibiotics at doses of sepsis, associated with corticosteroid pulses and respiratory physiotherapy improve COVID-19 pneumonia in postoperative lung surgery.","Taipe, Ricardo; Euscatigue, Mardonio; Valdivia, Fernando; Belloso, Brenner; Huaroto, Irene",Int J Surg Case Rep,,199

Methods The novel portable and disposable endoscopy system (YunSendo) was self-designed. Two patients with suspected AUGIB underwent emergency gastroscopy with YunSendo system by a senior endoscopist. Standard image acquisition and assessments of operation performance and image quality were fulfilled to evaluate the preliminary safety, feasibility, and operation performance of the novel endoscopy. Results Emergency endoscopy was completed safely in two AUGIB patients by the YunSendo system without alternating current (AC) power supply. The endoscopic manipulation and observation, including water absorption, air inflation, water spray, body rotation, and specimen biopsy, can be smoothly and effectively achieved. The video-recording, image acquisition, and electronic graphic report output were achieved integratedly in YunSendo. The upper GI tract can be clearly visualized, with eligible specimen biopsy without any obvious adverse events and compilations. Operation time was similar to an ordinary gastroscopy. The disposable endoscope was discarded after use according to the requirements of the hospital infection-control department. Conclusions The novel portable and disposable endoscopy system, YunSendo, is safe and feasible for upper gastrointestinal examination, with favorable operation performance and image quality.

Methods: In total, 190 patients with nonmetastatic MMHN with complete clinical and pathological data before treatment were included in our retrospective study. Results: We extracted five IHC markers associated with overall survival (OS) and then constructed a signature in the training set (n=116) with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. The validation set (n=74) was further built to confirm the prognostic significance of this classifier. We then divided patients into high- and low-risk groups according to the IHC score. In the training set, the 5-year OS rate was 22.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.2%- 43.2%) for the high-risk group and 54.1% (95% CI: 41.8%-69.9%) for the low-risk group (P<0.001), and in the validation set, the 5-year OS rate was 38.1% (95% CI: 17.9%-81.1%) for the high-risk group and 43.1% (95% CI: 30.0%-61.9%) for the low-risk group (P=0.26). Multivariable analysis revealed that IHC score, T stage, and primary tumor site were independent variables for predicting OS (all P<0.05). We developed a nomogram incorporating clinicopathological risk factors (primary site and T stage) and the IHC score to predict 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS. Conclusions: A nomogram was generated and confirmed to be of clinical value. Our IHC classifier integrating five IHC markers could help clinicians make decisions and determine optimal treatments for patients with MMHN.","Xu, Qing-Qing; Li, Qing-Jie; Huang, Cheng-Long; Cai, Mu-Yan; Zhang, Mei-Fang; Yin, Shao-Han; Lu, Li-Xia; Chen, Lei",Front Immunol,,199

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all trauma referrals to the National Neurosurgical Centre at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, during the period March 1-May 31, 2019 and 2020. Patient characteristics including age, sex, alcohol use, anticoagulant/antiplatelet use and initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were recorded. Patients were grouped based on trauma aetiology and diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 527 and 437 trauma referrals in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Overall, there was a 17.1% reduction in trauma referrals between 2019 and 2020. Traumatic brain injury, spinal injury and cranial fractures referrals reduced 25% (375 vs 283), 59% (32 vs 13) and 18% (39 vs 32) respectively from 2019 to 2020.

Previous studies have suggested that serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%dCDT) levels, relative to blood alcohol levels (BALs), may better differentiate episodic binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted patients with traumatic injury. We characterized %dCDT levels and BAL levels to differentiate binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted trauma patients and their associations with outcomes. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study assessed %dCDT and BAL levels in admitted male and female patients with traumatic injury (&#8805;18 y) at an American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma level-1 center from July 2014 to June 2016. We designated patients with %dCDT levels &#8805;1.7% (CDT+) as chronic alcohol users and dichotomized acutely intoxicated patients using three different BAL-level thresholds. Primary outcomes included in-hospital complications, along with prolonged ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay, both defined as the top decile. Secondary outcomes included rates of drug or alcohol withdrawal and all-cause mortality. Analyses were adjusted for clinical factors. RESULTS: We studied 715 patients (77.5% men, 60.6% &#8804; 40 y of age, median Injury Severity Score: 14, 41.7% motor vehicle crashes, 17.9% gunshot wounds, 11.1% falls). While 31.0% were CDT+, 48.7% were BAL>0. After adjusting for CDT levels, BAL levels >0, >100, or >200 were not associated with adverse outcomes. However, CDT+ relative to patients with CDT were associated with complications (adjusted odds ratio: 1.96 [1.24-3.09]), prolonged ventilation days (3.23 [1.08-9.65]), and prolonged intensive care unit stays (2.83 [1.20-6.68]). CONCLUSIONS: In this 2-year prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study, we found that %dCDT levels, relative to BAL levels, may better stratify admitted patients with traumatic injury into acute versus chronic alcohol users, identifying those at higher risk for in-hospital complications.","Sakran, Joseph V; Mehta, Ambar; Matar, Maher M; Wilson, Dulaney A; Kent, Alistair J; Anton, Raymond F; Fakhry, Samir M",J Surg Res,,199

We base our analysis on data on emissions, employment and corona-related layoffs across sectors, and on previous research. We show that, among climate policies, labor-intensive green infrastructure projects, planting trees, and in particular pricing carbon coupled with reduced labor taxation boost economic recovery. Among coronavirus policies, aiding services sectors (leisure services such as restaurants and culture, or professional services such as technology), education and the healthcare sector appear most promising, being labor intensive yet low-emission-if such sectoral aid is conditioned on being directed towards employment and on low-carbon supply chains.

416768,Short-term forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak in India,2021,"Introduction: Right now, we are facing a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes the highly contagious human disease COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing at an alarming rate, more and more people suffer from it, and the death toll is on the rise since December 2019, when COVID-19 has presumably appeared. We need an urgent solution for the prevention, treatment, and recovery of the involved patients. Methods: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) is known as an immuno-supportive therapy in oncology. Our proposal is to apply this method to prevent the progression of the disease after its identification, to provide treatment when necessary, and deliver rehabilitation to diminish the fibrotic-often fatal-consequences of the infection. Hypothesis: The effects of mEHT, which are proven for oncological applications, could be utilized for the inactivation of the virus or for treating the fibrotic consequences. The hypothesized mEHT effects, which could have a role in the antiviral treatment, it could be applied for viral-specific immune-activation and for anti-fibrotic treatments.","Masaud, Syed Muzzammil; Szasz, Oliver; Szasz, A Marcell; Ejaz, Huma; Anwar, Rana Attique; Szasz, Andras",Front Immunol,,199

416891,The COVID-19 Response Has Uncovered and Increased Our Vulnerability to Biological Warfare,2021,"The modern-day pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly. There is limited data about the effects of the virus on pregnant women, even in women who were infected by other strains of coronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). After reviewing numerous articles published in the peer-reviewed journals and other authentic sources, in this mini-review, we evaluated various key clinical and laboratory aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in relation to pregnancy. Eligibility criteria included the patient being pregnant upon admission to the hospital, clinically diagnosed, and/or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Taking a comprehensive approach by reviewing numerous studies, it is safe to say that there is no concrete evidence of intrauterine transmission. With adequate infection control measures, breastfeeding in neonates of mothers with COVID-19 is safe postpartum. A disruption of Virchow's triad by COVID-19 and the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy put the expectant mothers at great risk of arterial, venous, and placental thrombus formation, which can be managed by antithrombotic and related pharmacologic agents including antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs.","Nasir, Umair; Ahmad, Sarfraz",SN Compr Clin Med,,199

417409,Road traffic injuries in Nepal during COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Exercise, support and advice are considered core components of management for most musculoskeletal conditions and are typically provided by physiotherapists through regular face-to-face treatments. However, exercise can be provided remotely as part of a home exercise programme, while support and advice can be provided over the telephone. There is initial evidence from trials and systematic reviews to suggest that remotely provided physiotherapy can be used to manage a variety of musculoskeletal conditions safely and effectively. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this single-blind randomised controlled non-inferiority trial is to determine whether a supported home exercise programme is as good as or better than face-to-face physiotherapy for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and ten participants will be recruited from five public hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Participants will be randomised to either the supported home exercise group or the face-to-face physiotherapy group. Participants allocated to the supported home exercise group will initially receive one face-to-face session with the trial physiotherapist and will then be managed remotely for the next 6 weeks. Participants allocated to the face-to-face physiotherapy group will receive a course of physiotherapy as typically provided in Sydney government hospitals. The primary outcome is function measured by the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 6 weeks. There will be nine secondary outcomes measured at 6 and 26 weeks. Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome, and all analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. A health economic evaluation will be conducted from a health funder plus patient perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained on the 17 March 2017 from the Northern Sydney Local Health District HREC, trial number HREC/16HAWKE/431-RESP/16/287. The results of this study will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals and be presented at national and international conferences. Recruitment commenced in March 2019, and it is anticipated that the trial will be completed by December 2021. This trial will investigate two different models of physiotherapy care for people with musculoskeletal conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CPMP/ICH-135/95.

420085,Orthopedic practice during the Covid-19 crisis in China,2020,"We researchers have taken searching for information for granted for far too long. The COVID-19 pandemic shows us the boundaries of academic searching capabilities, both in terms of our know-how and of the systems we have. With hundreds of studies published daily on COVID-19, for example, we struggle to find, stay up-to-date, and synthesize information-all hampering evidence-informed decision making. This COVID-19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the ""Search Triangle"" model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit-for-purpose search systems.","Gusenbauer, Michael; Haddaway, Neal R",Res. synth. methods (Online),,199

Additionally, the literature is inconsistent regarding the waning effect of the serological response. The aim of this study was to explore the temporal dynamic changes of the immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized and non-hospitalized symptomatic patients over a period of 10 months. Six different analytical kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection were used. Positivity rates, inter-assay agreement and kinetic models were determined. A high inter-individual and an inter-methodology variability was observed. Assays targeting total antibodies presented higher positivity rates and reached the highest positivity rates sooner compared with assays directed against IgG. The inter-assay agreement was also higher between these assays. The stratification by disease severity showed a much-elevated serological response in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients in all assays. In this 10-month follow-up study, serological assays showed a clinically significant difference to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infection with total antibody assays presenting the highest positivity rates. The waning effect reported in several studies should be interpreted with caution because it could depend on the assay considered.","Favresse, Julien; Eucher, Christine; Elsen, Marc; Gillot, Constant; Van Eeckhoudt, Sandrine; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan",,,199

METHODS: Systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar to retrieve original studies on chest CT findings of patients with confirmed COVID-19, available up to 10 May 2020. Data on frequency and distribution of chest CT findings were extracted from eligible studies, pooled and meta-analyzed using random-effects model to calculate the prevalence of chest CT findings. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies (pooled population: 9907 confirmed COVID-19 patients) were meta-analyzed. The most common CT findings were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (77.18%, 95%CI = 72.23-81.47), reticulations (46.24%, 95%CI = 38.51-54.14), and air bronchogram (41.61%, 95%CI = 32.78-51.01). Pleural thickening (33.35%, 95%CI = 21.89-47.18) and bronchial wall thickening (15.48%, 95%CI = 8.54-26.43) were major atypical and airway findings. Lesions were predominantly distributed bilaterally (75.72%, 95%CI = 70.79-80.06) and peripherally (65.64%, 95%CI = 58.21-72.36), while 8.20% (95%CI = 6.30-10.61) of patients had no abnormal findings and pre-existing lung diseases were present in 6.01% (95%CI = 4.37-8.23). CONCLUSIONS: The most common CT findings in COVID-19 are GGOs with/without consolidation, reticulations, and air bronchogram, which often involve both lungs with peripheral distribution. However, COVID-19 might present with atypical manifestations or no abnormal findings in chest CT, which deserve clinicians' notice.","Zarifian, Ahmadreza; Ghasemi Nour, Mohammad; Akhavan Rezayat, Arash; Rahimzadeh Oskooei, Reza; Abbasi, Bita; Sadeghi, Ramin",Clin Imaging,,199
421087,"COVID-19 Communication Ecologies: Using Interpersonal, Organizational, and Mediated Communication Resources to Cope With a Pandemic",2021,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in December 2019 and spread worldwide, causing more than 1.3 million deaths in 11 months. Similar to the human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 shares strong sequence homologies with a sarbecovirus circulating in Rhinolophus affinis bats. Because bats are expected to be able to transmit their coronaviruses to intermediate animal hosts that in turn are a source of viruses able to cross species barriers and infect humans (so-called spillover model), the identification of an intermediate animal reservoir was the subject of intense researches. It was claimed that a reptile (Ophiophagus hannah) was the intermediate host. This hypothesis was quickly ruled out and replaced by the pangolin (Manis javanica) hypothesis. Yet, pangolin was also recently exonerated from SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans, leaving other animal species as presumed guilty. Guided by the spillover model, several laboratories investigated in silico the species polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to find the best fits with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding site. Following the same strategy, we used multi-sequence alignment, 3-D structure analysis, and electrostatic potential surface generation of ACE2 variants to predict their binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2. We report evidence that such simple in silico investigation is a powerful tool to quickly screen which species are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, possible receptor binding does not necessarily lead to successful replication in host. Therefore, we also discuss here the limitations of these in silico approaches in our quest on the origins of COVID-19 pandemic.","Devaux, Christian A; Pinault, Lucile; Osman, Ikram Omar; Raoult, Didier",Front Public Health,,199

The primary aim was to determine what proportion of patients feel they should proceed with their elective hip and knee arthroplasty surgery during the COVID-19 climate. The secondary aim was to investigate what variables affected this decision. METHODS: Patient information from a single surgeon's waiting list in a district general hospital were recorded. A standardised telephone discussion was had with all the patients noting the severity of pain and the potential reasons for not wanting to proceed with surgery. RESULTS: A total of 70.6% (96/136) of patients wished to proceed with surgery; 29.4% (40/136) did not wish to proceed. The decision to proceed with surgery was not correlated with sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade or COVID-19 risk. Those who wished to proceed with surgery had a mean age of 68.5 years while those who did not had a mean age of 72.4 years (P = 0.03). Within the matched subgroups, patients under the age of 70 years were more willing to proceed with primary hip arthroplasty surgery (87.9%) compared with primary knee arthroplasty surgery (57.1%; P = 0.007); 75% of the patients who did not wish to proceed with surgery expressed concerns about perioperative COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: There is a significant proportion of arthroplasty patients on waiting lists who would be willing to accept the increased risks associated with COVID-19 to undergo surgery on an urgent basis. The subgroup of younger patients awaiting hip arthroplasty is more willing than those awaiting knee arthroplasty to proceed with surgery.","Madanipour, S; Al-Obaedi, O; Ayub, A; Iranpour, F; Subramanian, P",Ann.

422091,The Impact COVID-19 School Closures on Educational Inequalities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and over 80 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths were reported in 2020. This highly contagious virus is spread primarily via respiratory droplets from face-to-face contact and contaminated surfaces as well as potential aerosol spread. Over half of transmissions occur from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although several vaccines are currently available for emergency use, there are uncertainties regarding the duration of protection and the efficacy of preventing asymptomatic spread. Thus, personal protective health behaviour and measures against COVID-19 are still widely recommended after immunization. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of these measures, and the results may provide valuable guidance to policymakers to educate the general public about how to reduce the individual-level risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from Centro Hospitalar Conde de Sao Januario (C.H.C.S.J.), which was the only hospital designated to manage COVID-19 patients in Macao SAR, China, and 1113 control participants who completed a 14-day mandatory quarantine in 12 designated hotels due to returning from high-risk countries between 17 March and 15 April 2020. A questionnaire was developed to extract demographic information, contact history, and personal health behaviour. RESULTS: Participants primarily came from the United Kingdom (33.2%), followed by the United States (10.5%) and Portugal (10.2%). Independent factors for COVID-19 infection were having physical contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR, 12.108 [95% CI, 3.380-43.376], P &lt; 0.005), participating in high-risk gathering activities (adjusted OR, 1.129 [95% CI, 1.048-1.216], P &lt; 0.005), handwashing after outdoor activity (adjusted OR, 0.021 [95% CI, 0.003-0.134], P &lt; 0.005), handwashing before touching the mouth and nose area (adjusted OR, 0.303 [95% CI, 0.114-0.808], P &lt; 0.05), and wearing a mask whenever outdoors (adjusted OR, 0.307 [95% CI, 0.109-0.867], P &lt; 0.05). The daily count of handwashing remained similar between groups. Only 31.6% of participants had a sufficient 20-s handwashing duration. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in high-risk gatherings, wearing a mask whenever outdoors, and practising hand hygiene at key times should be advocated to the public to mitigate COVID-19 infection.","Lio, C.

This study investigates the knowledge and perceptions about SDF of graduating dental students in multiple U.S. dental schools, as well as their willingness to use SDF in their practices. METHODS: A survey was designed consisting of 21 total questions: 6 questions regarding students' demographic information and their SDF content exposure contextualization, 8 questions tailored to investigate 2 domains regarding students' knowledge about SDF (properties and indication), and 7 questions aiming to investigate 3 domains regarding students' perceptions about SDF (SDF usefulness, appropriateness of using SDF, and willingness to use SDF when in private practice). The survey was then distributed to graduating dental students at 7 U.S. dental schools. RESULTS: A total of 386 surveys (response rate of 55%) was collected from 7 schools in the Spring of 2019. The median score resulting from the SDF content exposure questions was 3 (SD = 1.43) from a range of 0-5. The median score from knowledge about SDF properties was 4 (SD = 1.18) from a range of 0 to 6. In the multivariate analysis, a linear model found that the covariates ""SDF Usefulness"", ""SDF Appropriateness"" and ""SDF Patient Willingness to Use"" were significantly associated with higher student willingness to use SDF (R2 = 0.395). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the graduating students have a positive perception of SDF regarding its usefulness and appropriateness. Graduating students appear inclined to utilize SDF upon entering private practice.","Dang, Connor; Comnick, Carissa L; Tabrizi, Maryam; Kaufman, Laura; Soto, Annetty; Smith, Becky M; Ribeiro, Ana Paula Dias; Tobey, Tamara; Capin, Oriana Reis; Scully, Allison; Prince, David; Xie, Xian Jin; Marchini, Leonardo",J. dent. educ,,199

In both surveys, there was a moderate level of adherence to regular handwashing (85% and 77%, respectively), wearing of facemasks (41.4% and 69%, respectively), and respecting physical distancing (58% and 43.4%, respectively). The second survey found that, working in private (OR = 2.31, CI: 1.66-3.22; p < 0.001) and public organizations (OR = 1.61, CI: 1.04-2.49; p = 0.032) and being a healthcare worker (OR = 2.19, CI: 1.57-3.05; p < 0.001) significantly increased the odds for better adherence. However, a unit increase in age (OR = 0.99, CI: 0.98-0.99; p < 0.026), having attained lower education levels (OR = 0.60, CI: 0.46-0.78; p < 0.001), living in a room (OR = 0.36, CI: 0.15-0.89; p = 0.027), living in a studio (OR = 0.26, CI: 0.11-0.61; p = 0.002) and apartment (OR = 0.29, CI: 0.10-0.82; p = 0.019) significantly decreased the odds for better adherence. We recommend a multi-sectorial approach to monitor and respond to the pandemic threat. While physical distancing may be difficult in Africa, it should be possible to increase the use of facemasks.","Ditekemena, John D; Mavoko, Hypolite M; Obimpeh, Michael; Van Hees, Stijn; Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Nkamba, Dalau M; Tshefu, Antoinette; Van Damme, Wim; Muyembe, Jean Jacques; Colebunders, Robert",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

425618,Corpus Driven Analysis of News Reports about Covid-19 in a Malaysian Online Newspaper,2020,"BACKGROUND: The clinical efficacy of matrine in treating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been confirmed; however, its underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. METHODS: TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, SEA, GeneCards, CTD, and TTD were used to identify potential targets for matrine in SARS-CoV-2. Cytoscape software was used to determine the target-pathway network for topographical analysis. The online STRING analysis platform and Cytoscape were together used to generate a PPI network and for GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Finally, molecular docking simulations were performed to study matrine-Mpro, matrine-ACE2, and matrine-RdRp interactions. RESULTS: Ten common matrine targets were obtained, particularly including TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and CASP3. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed five significantly enriched signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, programmed cell death, and immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 treatment, matrine regulates viral replication, host cell apoptosis, and inflammation by targeting the TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and CASP3 in the TNF signalling pathway.","Peng, Wenpan; Xu, Yong; Han, Di; Feng, Fanchao; Wang, Zhichao; Gu, Cheng; Zhou, Xianmei; Wu, Qi",Arch Physiol Biochem,,199
425716,"First AIDS, now COVID-19: Another plague shows us who we are",2020,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this scoping review was to ascertain how 'telehealth' is utilised within health care, from pre hospital to admission, discharge and post discharge, with patients who have suffered major trauma. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature published in English since 1980 was conducted using MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Austhealth, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane library) and Web of Science MEDLINE and MEBASE to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: We included 77 eligible studies with both randomised controlled trial and cohort design methodology. A variety of trauma was included such as traumatic brain injuries (n = 52; 67.5%), spinal cord injury (n = 14; 18.2%) and multi-trauma (n = 9; 11.7%) to both adult (n = 38) and paediatric (n = 32) participants. Telehealth is used in pre-hospital and acute-care settings (n = 11; 14.3%) to facilitate assessment, and in rehabilitation and follow-up (n = 61; 79.2%) to deliver therapy. Effects on health were reported the most (n = 46), with no negative outcomes. The feasibility of telehealth as a delivery mode was established, but coordination and technical issues are barriers to use. Overall, both patients and clinicians were satisfied using this mode of delivery. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates how telehealth is utilised across a spectrum of patients with traumatic injuries and to facilitate delivery of therapy, specialist consultations and assessments, with many studies reporting improvements to health. There is a paucity of high-quality rigorous research, which makes replication of findings and uptake of the intervention problematic. Future telehealth and trauma research should focus on the quality and reproducibility of telehealth interventions and the economic feasibility of using this platform to deliver trauma care.","Wake, Elizabeth; Atkins, Heidi; Willock, Ashley; Hawkes, Angela; Dawber, Jessica; Weir, Kelly A",J Telemed Telecare,,199
425717,"First AIDS, Now COVID-19: Another Plague Shows Us Who We Are",2020,"While misinformation and disinformation have been thriving in social media for years, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political and the health misinformation merged, thus elevating the problem to a whole new level and giving rise to the first global infodemic. The fight against this infodemic has many aspects, with fact-checking and debunking false and misleading claims being among the most important ones. Unfortunately, manual fact-checking is time-consuming and automatic fact-checking is resource-intense, which means that we need to pre-filter the input social media posts and to throw out those that do not appear to be check-worthy. With this in mind, here we propose a model for detecting check-worthy tweets about COVID-19, which combines deep contextualized text representations with modeling the social context of the tweet. We further describe a number of additional experiments and comparisons, which we believe should be useful for future research as they provide some indication about what techniques are effective for the task.

There is an established association between race and severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults in England; however, whether a similar association exists in children is unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants: In this cohort study, children (0-18 years of age) from participating family practices in England were identified in the QResearch database between January 24 and November 30, 2020. The QResearch database has individually linked patients with national SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital admission, and mortality data. Exposures: The main characteristic of interest is self-reported race. Other exposures were age, sex, deprivation level, geographic region, household size, and comorbidities (asthma; diabetes; and cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic conditions). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospital admission with confirmed COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2-positive test result and any hospital attendance with confirmed COVID-19 and intensive care admission. Results: Of 2â¯576â¯353 children (mean [SD] age, 9.23 [5.24] years; 48.8% female), 410â¯726 (15.9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 26â¯322 (6.4%) tested positive. A total of 1853 children (0.07%) with confirmed COVID-19 attended hospital, 343 (0.01%) were admitted to the hospital, and 73 (0.002%) required intensive care. Testing varied across race. White children had the highest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 tests (223â¯701/1â¯311â¯041 [17.1%]), whereas Asian children (33â¯213/243â¯545 [13.6%]), Black children (7727/93â¯620 [8.3%]), and children of mixed or other races (18â¯971/147â¯529 [12.9%]) had lower proportions. Compared with White children, Asian children were more likely to have COVID-19 hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12-2.36), whereas Black children (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.90-2.31) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93-2.10) had comparable hospital admissions. Asian children were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (adjusted OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14), and Black children (adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.08-4.94) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.25-3.65) had longer hospital admissions (&#8805;36 hours). Conclusions and Relevance: In this large population-based study exploring the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes, several race-specific disparities were observed in severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, ascertainment bias and residual confounding in this cohort study should be considered before drawing any further conclusions. Overall, findings of this study have important public health implications internationally.","Saatci, Defne; Ranger, Tom A; Garriga, Cesar; Clift, Ash Kieran; Zaccardi, Francesco; Tan, Pui San; Patone, Martina; Coupland, Carol; Harnden, Anthony; Griffin, Simon J; Khunti, Kamlesh; Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Hippisley-Cox, Julia",JAMA pediatr.

Guidance suggests that all correspondence should be directed to patients. Covid-19 led to an increase in direct-to-patient communication. This study aims to determine the quantity and quality of plastic surgery clinic letters sent to patients before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 127 pre-Covid clinic letters from November to December 2019 and 103 peri-Covid clinic letters from April to May 2020 were identified and assessed for readability. Text was analyzed using a standardized set of commonly used readability formulae, including SMOG, Flesch Reading Ease, and the Coleman-Liao Index. A total of 100 pre-Covid and 58 peri-Covid letters were suitable for inclusion. Median results for formulae that output a U.S. grade score ranged between 9 and 12.9 for letters written prior to Covid-19 and 9 and 13.2 for those written during Covid-19. Eight percent of letters were sent to patients pre-Covid, increasing to 28% during the pandemic. Letters sent to patients had a median grade score of between 8 and 12 prior to Covid-19 and 8 and 10.6 during Covid-19. Letters sent to clinicians ranged between 9 and 13 and 9 and 13.3, respectively. Outpatient plastic surgery letters are written at a readability level too high to facilitate understanding among the general population. The increase in direct-to-patient contact during the Covid-19 outbreak has not led to a significant improvement in the readability of clinic letters.

Based on the clustering abilities of self-organizing maps we are able to spatially group together countries that are similar according to their coronavirus cases, in this way being able to analyze which countries are behaving similarly and thus can benefit by using similar strategies in dealing with the spread of the virus. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained, that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus. Most of the previous papers dealing with data of the Coronavirus have viewed the problem on temporal aspect, which is also important, but this is mainly concerned with the forecast of the numeric information. However, we believe that the spatial aspect is also important, so in this view the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised self-organizing maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus proposing that strategies for similar countries could be established accordingly.","Melin, Patricia; Monica, Julio Cesar; Sanchez, Daniela; Castillo, Oscar",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,199

However, data on cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains scarce. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on 223 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 from 26 hospitals in Hubei, China. An individualized nomogram was constructed based on multivariate Cox analysis. Considering the convenience of the nomogram application, an online tool was also created. The predictive performance and clinical application of nomogram were verified by C-index, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Among cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2, there were significant differences in clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors, and compared with patients with solid tumors including lung cancer, patients with hematological malignancies had a worse prognosis. Male, dyspnea, elevated PCT, increased heart rate, elevated D-dimers, and decreased platelets were risk factors for these patients. Furthermore, a good prediction performance of the online tool (dynamic nomogram: https://covid-19-prediction-tool.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/ ) was also fully demonstrated with the C-indexes of 0.841 (95% CI 0.782-0.900) in the development cohort and 0.780 (95% CI 0.678-0.882) in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: Overall, cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 had unique clinical features, and the established online tool could guide clinicians to predict the prognosis of patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and to develop more rational treatment strategies for cancer patients.","Song, Congkuan; Dong, Zhe; Gong, Hongyun; Liu, Xiao-Ping; Dong, Xiaorong; Wang, Aifen; Chen, Yuan; Song, Qibin; Hu, Weidong",J. cancer res. clin. oncol,,199

Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500-1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: -0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: -0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: -0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, D M; Hassan, A B",J Nutr Health Aging,,199

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services previously announced that all non-essential planned surgeries and procedures should be postponed until further notice and only urgent procedures should proceed. METHODS: We share our experiences with safely performing neurosurgical procedures on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, to aide other neurosurgical teams in preparing for these high-risk cases, especially for neurosurgical interventions which are essential at saving a life or preserving functioning of the central nervous system that cannot be delayed. Perioperative and intraoperative strategies, considerations, as well as challenges arisen under the specific circumstance have been discussed: the hospital should be equipped with negative pressure areas and multiple areas to quarantine positive patients; the operating rooms should be negative pressure or have HEPA-filtration systems in place; all healthcare personnel who immediately participate in neurosurgical interventions for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients should take airborne precautions and wear enhanced personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Successful management of neurosurgical emergencies without healthcare personnel infection has been achieved during this pandemic crisis. CONCLUSION: Following the proposed guidance, urgent neurosurgical surgeries and procedures can be safely performed for the benefit of critical patients with or suspected for COVID-19.","Reed, Laura K; Wen, Jun; Liang, Buqing; Wang, Xiangyu; Feng, Dongxia; Huang, Jason H",Neurol Res,,199

A critical question concerning the innovative concept of crowd emotions is whether the emotional content of crowd sounds can be characterized by frequency-amplitude features, using analysis techniques similar to those applied on individual voices, where deep learning classification is applied to spectrogram images derived by sound transformations. In this work, we present a technique based on the generation of sound spectrograms from fragments of fixed length, extracted from original audio clips recorded in high-attendance events, where the crowd acts as a collective individual. Transfer learning techniques are used on a convolutional neural network, pre-trained on low-level features using the well-known ImageNet extensive dataset of visual knowledge. The original sound clips are filtered and normalized in amplitude for a correct spectrogram generation, on which we fine-tune the domain-specific features. Experiments held on the finally trained Convolutional Neural Network show promising performances of the proposed model to classify the emotions of the crowd.","Franzoni, Valentina; Biondi, Giulio; Milani, Alfredo",Multimed Tools Appl,,199

The case demonstrates how the theoretical framework was applied to enhance their weekly mentorship discussions, and organize the student's learnings relating to the Ministry's policy on hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic by viewing the work through the framework's five streams.","Anderson, Kelly; Heenan, Michael",Healthc Manage Forum,,199
431199,"The COVID-19 pandemic: What can bioengineers, computer scientists and big data specialists bring to the table",2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, most universities implemented digital teaching at short notice for the summer semester 2020 (SS20), whereas they simultaneously shut down classroom teaching. In the psychiatric clinic of the University Medical Center Göttingen, students' ratings concerning the learning effect and their substantive assessment for both forms of teaching were comparatively evaluated to determine the quality of this process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 350 students who had visited classroom teaching (winter semester, WS18/19 to WS19/20) vs. digital teaching (SS20) assessed their form of teaching post hoc, within a standardized survey. They rated the individual learning effect in seven psychiatric subjects and did a substantive assessment on eight dimensions. In addition, they rated their expenditure of time. RESULTS: For digital teaching, the individual learning effect was rated as either being equivalent or superior (subjects: psychotherapy, schizophrenia). Despite a significantly heightened expenditure of time, digital teaching was substantively assessed as being equivalent to classroom teaching or superior (dimensions: independent processing of learning goals, overall format of lecture). Concerning their anticipated preparation for the professional practice, students rated digital teaching as being inferior to classroom teaching. CONCLUSION: A pandemic-driven conversion from classroom to digital teaching did not result in a loss of quality on the dimensions measured in this comparative evaluation. With a view to professional practice, digital teaching should complement classroom teaching and be part of future curricula.","Besse, Matthias; Wiltfang, Jens; Belz, Michael; Signerski-Krieger, Jörg",Nervenarzt,,199

As CORD-19 has an up-to-date collection of coronavirus literature, text mining approaches can be successfully used to retrieve answers pertaining to all coronavirus-related questions. The existing a lite BERT for self-supervised learning of language representations (ALBERT) model is finetuned for retrieving all COVID relevant information to scientific questions posed by the medical community and to highlight the context related to the COVID-19 query. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a finetuned ALBERT-based QA system in association with Best Match25 (Okapi BM25) ranking function and its variant BM25L for context retrieval and provided high scores in benchmark data sets such as SQuAD for answers related to COVID-19 questions. In this context, this paper has built a QA system, pre-trained on SQuAD and finetuned it on CORD-19 data to retrieve answers related to COVID-19 questions by extracting semantically relevant information related to the question. Findings: BM25L is found to be more effective in retrieval compared to Okapi BM25. Hence, finetuned ALBERT when extended to the CORD-19 data set provided accurate results. Originality/value: The finetuned ALBERT QA system was developed and tested for the first time on the CORD-19 data set to extract context and highlight the span of the answer for more clarity to the user. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Godavarthi, D.; Mary Sowjanya, A.",World Journal of Engineering,,199

Effective coping strategies likely reduce the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. This study aimed to (1) understand how COVID-19 stressors are related to different coping strategies and (2) identify whether coping strategies act as mechanisms accounting for the associations between COVID-19 stressful experiences and mental health problems in pregnancy. Participants were 304 pregnant women from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and perceived stress were assessed using validated measures. COVID-related stressors (i.e., financial difficulties, social isolation), subjective negative impact of COVID-19, and coping strategies used in response to COVID-19 were assessed by questionnaires. Results indicated that the subjective negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with more dysfunctional coping and less emotion-focused coping, whereas specific COVID-19 stressors, namely financial difficulties and social isolation, were associated with more dysfunctional coping and problem-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping was linked to elevated mental health problems and emotion-focused coping was linked to less mental health problems. Dysfunctional coping and emotion-focused coping partially mediated the effects of specific COVID-19 stressors on mental health outcomes. Findings indicate that coping is one pathway through which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts mental health in pregnancy. Supports and interventions for pregnant women during the pandemic should focus on bolstering coping skills, in order to minimize the mental health consequences of COVID-19.","Khoury, Jennifer E; Atkinson, Leslie; Bennett, Teresa; Jack, Susan M; Gonzalez, Andrea",,,199

Methods: The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system was used to observe the time-dependent apoptosis process of BMMSCs. Besides, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), dynamic light scattering technology and streaming potential method were used to measure the surface characteristics of BMMSCs derived ApoEVs. The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system was used to observe the process of RAW264.7 phagocyting 5-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (5-TAMRA-SE) labeled ApoEVs. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1). Cell immunofluorescence and Western blotting were used to detect the number of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)(+) macrophages and iNOS protein expression level in each experiment group. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect tumor necrosis factro-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) level in the Pg-LPS induced pro-inflammatory macrophage culture supernatant in each experiment group. Results: After treating with 0.5 µmol/L staurosporine for 12 hours, mouse BMMSCs underwent shrinking with obvious vesicles structure around. The FESEM showed the ApoEVs were in spherical shapes. The size range of ApoEVs was about 100-1 000 nm and the average Zeta potential was -16.6 mV. The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system showed RAW264.7 could phagocytose 5-TAMRA-SE labeled ApoEVs by pseudopodia. The relative mRNA expression of Arg-1 was significantly increased in RAW 264.7 after being treated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and ApoEVs (261.97±15.91) compared to that with IL-4 alone (115.29±15.42) (P<0.01). Cell immunofluorescence showed that ApoEVs could reduce the number of iNOS(+) macrophages induced by Pg-LPS (39.33±4.70) comparing to those without ApoEVs (95.33±4.70) (P=0.007). In the meanwhile, ApoEVs could also down-regulate the iNOS protein level of macrophages induced by Pg-LPS (5.84±1.05) comparing to those without ApoEVs (14.91±3.87) (P<0.01). Besides, ApoEVs could also reduce the TNF-&#945; secretion in the culture supernatant of pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by Pg-LPS [(21 899.71±409.73) ng/L] comparing to those without ApoEVs [(71 296.50±2 344.22) ng/L] (P=0.003). Conclusions: BMMSCs derived ApoEVs could regulate the polarization of macrophages and could also attenuate the pro-inflammatory condition of macrophages induced by Pg-LPS.","Ye, Q Y; Li, Z H; Wang, Y Z; Liu, S Y; Zhou, J; Wang, Q T",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,199

Their increased sensitivity has facilitated rapid pathways for the exclusion of MI. However, hs-cTn is now more readily detectable in patients without symptoms typical of MI, in whom a degree of myocardial injury is assumed. Recently, the practice of using the 99th centile of hs-cTn as a working 'upper reference limit' has been challenged. There is increasing evidence that hs-cTn may provide useful prognostic information, regardless of any suspicion of MI, and as such these assays may have potential as a general biomarker for mortality. This raises the concept that detection of hs-cTn 'never means nothing.' AREAS COVERED: In this review, we will evaluate the evidence for the use of hs-cTn assays outside their common clinical indication to rule out or diagnose acute MI. EXPERT OPINION: The data presented suggest that hs-cTn testing may in the future have a generalized role as a biomarker of mortality risk and may be used less as a test for ruling in acute MI, but will remain a frontline test to exclude that diagnosis in ED. Further, the data suggest that the detection of hs-cTn 'never means nothing.'","Hinton, Jonathan; Gabara, Lavinia; Curzen, Nick",Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,,199

438445,Chronicle of a Pandemic Foretold Learning From the COVID-19 Failure Before the Next Outbreak Arrives,2020,"PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to address how to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. METHODS: The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. RESULTS: The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. CONCLUSION: Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.","Korobelnik, Jean-François; Loewenstein, Anat; Eldem, Bora; Joussen, Antonia M; Koh, Adrian; Lambrou, George N; Lanzetta, Paolo; Li, Xiaoxin; Lövestam-Adrian, Monica; Navarro, Rafael; Okada, Annabelle A; Pearce, Ian; Rodríguez, Francisco J; Wong, David T; Wu, Lihteh",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,,199
438512,Covid-19: Medical leaders call for urgent action to make hospitals safe,2020,"BACKGROUND: The possibility of psychopathological symptoms and related risk factors among normal persons and patients infected during the outbreak of COVID-19 has been widely investigated. The mental health outcomes of the second wave of the pandemic remain unclear, especially those of patients with an infection. Thus, this study aims to explore the prevalence of and related risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms among patients infected with COVID-19 during the second wave. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five isolated wards of a designated hospital in Beijing, China, from July 1 to July 15, 2020. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted to assess psychiatric disorders, and a series of scales were used to measure self-reported psychopathological symptoms and psychosomatic factors. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms. RESULTS: Among 119 participants with infections, the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms (51.3%), depressive symptoms (41.2%), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (33.6%) was observed. Loneliness, hope, coping strategies, and history of mental disorders were the shared risk or protective factors across several psychopathological symptoms. The perceived impact of COVID-19 is the specific risk factor associated with state anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSS/PTSD is high among patients with infections during the second wave of the pandemic in Beijing. Clinical doctors must realize that these patients will probably experience depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSS/PTSD, as well as some neuropsychiatric syndromes. Specific mental health care is urgently required to help patients manage the virus during the second wave of the pandemic.","Zhang, Zhiyang; Feng, Yi; Song, Rui; Yang, Di; Duan, Xuefei",Global Health,,199

(Special Issue: Coronavirus pandemic.),2020,"BackgroundBNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against COVID-19 and is currently authorized for emergency use or conditional approval worldwide. At the time of authorization, data beyond 2 months post-vaccination were unavailable. MethodsIn an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy study, 44,165 [≥]16-year-old participants and 2,264 12-15-year-old participants were randomized to receive 2 doses, 21 days apart, of 30 {micro}g BNT162b2 or placebo. Study endpoints reported here are vaccine efficacy (VE) against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and safety data, both up to 6 months post-vaccination. ResultsBNT162b2 continued to be safe and well tolerated. Few participants had adverse events leading to study withdrawal. VE against COVID-19 was 91% (95% CI 89.0-93.2) through up to 6 months of follow-up, among evaluable participants and irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE of 86%-100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and COVID-19 risk factors in participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE against severe disease was 97% (95% CI 80.3-99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, B.1.351 (beta), was predominant, 100% (95% CI 53.5, 100.0) VE was observed. ConclusionWith up to 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradually declining trend in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19.

This article seeks to establish an association between novel coronavirus sequelae and cancer. A literature review on COVID-19 mechanisms of action, molecular responses it elicits upon infection and tumorigenesis pathways is conducted to establish this association. Major signaling pathways implicated in aberrant cellular growth are activated, the ensuing cytokine storm weakens the immune system response to tumors, and patients may develop cancer as a result of superimposed mutagenic and/or carcinogenic events. Future work needs to be performed to support this hypothesis, both in in vitro models and preclinical studies.

Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. PURPOSE: The present study examined prospective relations between demographic factors, personality traits, social cognitions and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID-19 deaths in the United State between late March and early May 2020. METHODS: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses, and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. RESULTS: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80%), yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results show how inconsistencies and politicization of health policy communication were concomitant with the effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.","Milad, Elizabeth; Bogg, Tim",Ann Behav Med,,199

Although environmental factors, such as those influencing the survival of viruses and their transmission between species including humans, play important roles in PHERSs, little attention has been given to these factors. This study describes and elucidates the roles of environmental factors in future PHERSs. To improve countries' capability to respond to public health emergencies associated with viral infections such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of environmental factors should be considered before, during, and after the responses to such emergencies. More specifically, to prevent pandemic outbreaks, we should strengthen environmental and wildlife protection, conduct detailed viral surveillance in animals and hotspots, and improve early-warning systems. During the pandemic, we must study the impacts of environmental factors on viral behaviors, develop control measures to minimize secondary environmental risks, and conduct timely assessments of viral risks and secondary environmental effects with a view to reducing the impacts of the pandemic on human health and on ecosystems. After the pandemic, we should further strengthen surveillance for viruses and the prevention of viral spread, maintain control measures for minimizing secondary environmental risks, develop our capability to scientifically predict pandemics and resurgences, and prepare for the next unexpected resurgence. Meanwhile, we should restore the normal life and production of the public based on the ""One Health"" concept, that views global human and environmental health as inextricably linked.

Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4-5; N = 673) and three weeks later (Feb 29-30; N = 521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (N = 1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up. Our results indicate that mindfulness meditation might be a viable low-cost intervention to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.","Zhu, Julie Lei; Schülke, Rasmus; Vatansever, Deniz; Xi, Dayou; Yan, Junjie; Zhao, Hanqing; Xie, Xiaohua; Feng, Jianfeng; Chen, Mark Yuting; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Wang, Shouyan",Transl Psychiatry,,199

To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid.","Gao, Jing; Quan, Lei",Med Sci Monit,,199
447253,Media Representation of the Pandemic: a Metaphorical Image of War (based on American Newspapers),2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly. Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs). Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting. METHODS: Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact. The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure. RESULTS: Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case. Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days. None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset. All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms. Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of &gt;15 minutes. Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact. The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department. CONCLUSION: We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting. These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts. The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.","Canova, Vera; Lederer Schläpfer, Heidi; Piso, Rein Jan; Droll, Armin; Fenner, Lukas; Hoffmann, Tobias; Hoffmann, Matthias",Swiss Med Wkly,,199

447466,Local Covid-19 Syndemics and the Need for an Integrated Response,2021,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted personal and work lives and created great uncertainty and stress, especially for frontline health care professionals like doctors and nurses who risk personal health while facing increased workloads and new COVID-related tasks. People can passively respond to this disruption, or they can be more active and choose to shape the conditions surrounding their work during the crisis. We designed a multiwave, multisource study examining whether a proactive orientation is a key resource for frontline health care professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from proactive and conservation of resources theories, we studied a sample of 408 doctors and nurses at a COVID-19 hospital in the locked-down area surrounding Wuhan City, China during the first wave of the virus. Our aim is to examine how personal agency contributes to health care professionals' performance and well-being when combating COVID-19. Proactive personality as a dispositional resource was associated with higher levels of perceived strengths use, a job-related motivational resource. This effect was jointly moderated by routine disruption and perceived organizational support. Proactive personality was indirectly associated with performance and two indicators of well-being (resilience and thriving) through perceived strengths use. More frequent physical exposure to the virus magnified the effects of perceived strengths use on an archival indicator of performance during the first wave of the pandemic.

Various techniques have been applied in identification of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 infection including computed tomography imaging, whole genome sequencing, and molecular methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This review article discusses the diagnostic methods currently being deployed for SARS-CoV-2 identification including optical biosensors and point-of-care diagnostics that are on the horizon. These innovative technologies may provide a more accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to manage the present novel coronavirus outbreak, and could be beneficial in preventing any future epidemics.

447768,Pandemic: Looking Back and Thinking Ahead,2020,"Causal inference is one of the most fundamental problems across all domains of science. We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two observed discrete symbolic sequences X and Y. We present a framework which relies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from sequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one sequence compresses the other sequence. We infer X causes Y if the grammar inferred from X better compresses Y than in the other direction. To put this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions without demanding temporal structures. We evaluate these models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present two unique applications of the proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using numerous sequences, we show that our models capture causal information exchanged between genome sequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues in sequence analysis to investigate the evolution of virulence and pathogenicity in future applications.","Sy, Pranay; Nagaraj, Nithin",J Biomed Inform,,199

The IHU strategy is to develop innovative tools, including epidemiological monitoring, point-of-care laboratories, and the ability to mass screen the population. In this study, we review the strategy and guidelines proposed by the IHU and its application to the COVID-19 pandemic and summarise the various challenges it raises. Early diagnosis enables contagious patients to be isolated and treatment to be initiated at an early stage to reduce the microbial load and contagiousness. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to deal with a shortage of personal protective equipment and reagents and a massive influx of patients. Between 27 January 2020 and 5 January 2021, 434,925 nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 12,055 patients with COVID-19 were followed up in our out-patient clinic, and 1888 patients were hospitalised in the Institute. By constantly adapting our strategy to the ongoing situation, the IHU has succeeded in expanding and upgrading its equipment and improving circuits and flows to better manage infected patients.","Fournier, P.

We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8 L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was < 120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra Optia&#8482; Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. CONCLUSION: Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.","Faqihi, Fahad; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Alshaya, Rayan; Papanikolaou, John; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J; Brindley, Peter G; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,199

This small (12 kDa) protein is encoded by ORF1a, binds to RNA and seems to be essential for viral RNA synthesis. The crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 protein and other homologues suggest that the protein is dimeric as also confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering. Our data constitute the prerequisite for further NMR-based characterization, and provide the starting point for the identification of small molecule lead compounds that could interfere with RNA binding and prevent viral replication.","F Dudás, Erika; Puglisi, Rita; Korn, Sophie Marianne; Alfano, Caterina; Bellone, Maria Laura; Piaz, Fabrizio Dal; Kelly, Geoff; Monaca, Elisa; Schlundt, Andreas; Schwalbe, Harald; Pastore, Annalisa",Biomolecular NMR assignments,,199

In order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, infected people must be quickly identified and isolated, and contact with the infected must be blocked early. This study attempted to verify the intervention effects on the spread of an infectious disease by using these measures in a mathematical model. Methods: We used the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model for a virtual population group connected by a special structured network. In the model, the infected state (I) was divided into I in which the infection is undetected and Ix in which the infection is detected. The probability of transitioning from an I state to Ix can be viewed as the rate at which an infected person is found. We assumed that only those connected to each other in the network can cause infection. In addition, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of isolation by temporarily removing the connection among these people. Results: In Scenario 1, only the infected are isolated; in Scenario 2, those who are connected to an infected person and are also found to be infected are isolated as well. In Scenario 3, everyone connected to an infected person are isolated. In Scenario 3, it was possible to effectively suppress the infectious disease even with a relatively slow rate of diagnosis and relatively high infection rate. Conclusion: During the epidemic, quick identification of the infected is helpful. In addition, it was possible to quantitatively show through a simulation evaluation that the management of infected individuals as well as those who are connected greatly helped to suppress the spread of infectious diseases.","Kwon, Okyu; Son, Woo-Sik; Kim, Jin Yong; Kim, Jong-Hun",Epidemiol Health,,199

As such, this study examines one such short-term option, the disposable gas-powered transport ventilator to effectively deliver aerosol therapy. Factors such as aerosol generator type, patient breathing pattern, humidification and nebuliser position within the respiratory circuit were also examined. METHODS: Aerosol drug delivery characterisation was undertaken using two different disposable transport ventilators (DTVs). Two different nebuliser types, a closed circuit vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and an open circuit jet nebuliser (JN), at different locations in a respiratory circuit, proximal and distal to an endotracheal tube (ETT), with and without passive humidification, were evaluated in simulated adult and paediatric patients. RESULTS: Placement of a nebuliser proximal to the ETT (VMN: 25.19%-34.15% and JN: 3.14%-8.92%), and the addition of a heat and moisture exchange filter (VMN: 32.37%-40.43% and JN: 5.60%-9.91%) resulted in the largest potential lung dose in the adult patient model.

In the present study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1 ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (~120%) and ORF 1 ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/L) than August (~897.5 copies/L), corresponding to a ~2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.","Kumar, Manish; Joshi, Madhvi; Patel, Arbind Kumar; Joshi, Chaitanya G",Environ Res,,199

METHODS: The patients' demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.","Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Alenazi, Thamer H; Alhejazi, Ayman; Al Safi, Faisal; Al Olayan, Ashwaq",JCO Glob Oncol,,199

METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R2adj = 0.569). INTERPRETATION: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing a better management of COVID-19 patients, effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

459866,COVID-19 in pregnancy: Maintaining clarity with expanding evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced drastic changes to daily life, from the implementation of stay-at-home orders to mandating facial coverings and limiting in-person gatherings. While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; Hardcastle, Austin N; Moore, Carson Paige; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,199

Its impact is attested to by the number of research studies on it. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of sustainability (quality of life), on sustainable development, and on the global economy. A computerized literature search was performed, and journal articles from authentic sources were extracted, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald Insight. The references in selected articles were screened to identify any relevant studies. The following inclusion criteria were followed: research articles based on the COVID-19 pandemic, and articles, research papers, journals, and news articles published 2010 to 2020. The exclusion criteria were as follow: psychology research, articles, and journals published before 2010 and research articles having no link with the current pandemic's impact on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy. Of the initial 350 articles identified, only 61 studies were found to be relevant and meet the inclusion criteria. Based on these articles, the review highlights that compared to developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as African countries with compromised health structures have been greatly affected. There are close associations between health, economic, environmental, and political issues globally. The pandemic can be managed if we follow new policies that implement economic and public health changes worldwide. A planned, coordinated approach between the public-private sector is required, designed according to each country's health system and economy. We can come out of this crisis if we work together and support both developed and developing nations.","El Keshky, Mogeda El Sayed; Basyouni, Sawzan Sadaqa; Al Sabban, Abeer Mohammad",Front Psychol,,199

From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries. In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection. Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity). All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications.","Napoli, Pietro Emanuele; Nioi, Matteo",J.

An overview of PubMed literature depicting the state of the art of urology residency in the COVID-19 era was performed as well, to contextualize the issue. METHODS: An online learning event for residents was set up at the beginning of the pandemic; the faculty consisted of experts in urology who provided on-line lectures and videos on surgical anatomy, procedures, updates in guidelines, technology, training. The audience was composed of 30-500 attendees from Italy, USA, India and Belgium. A questionnaire to analyze relevance, satisfaction and popularity of the lessons was mailed to 30 local residents. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Almost all residents defined the web environment suitable to achieve the learning outcomes; the method, the number and the competence of the faculty were appropriate/excellent. Most of the younger residents (81.8%) stated their surgical knowledge would improve after the course; 72.7% declared they would take advantage into routine inpatients clinical activity. Nineteen more expert residents agreed that the course would improve their surgical knowledge and enhance their practical skills; almost all stated that the initiative would change their outpatients and inpatients practice. Overall, 44 articles available in PubMed have addressed the concern of urological learning and training during the pandemic from different standpoints; four of them considered residents' general perception towards web-based learning programs. CONCLUSIONS: The paper confirms residents' satisfaction with e-learning methods and, to our knowledge, is the first one focusing on a specific event promptly settled up at the beginning of the outbreak. Web-based educational experience developed during the pandemic may represent the very basis for the implementation of prospective on-site training and overall scientific update of future urologists.","Calcagnile, Tommaso; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Sarchi, Luca; Assumma, Simone; Filippi, Beatrice; Bonfante, Giulia; Cassani, Alessandra; Spandri, Valentina; Turri, Filippo; Puliatti, Stefano; Bozzini, Giorgio; Moschovas, Marcio; Bianchi, Giampaolo; Micali, Salvatore; Rocco, Bernardo",Urologia,,199

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection following nonelective hip and knee surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey during this time. A retrospective cohort of 149 patients who underwent nonelective hip and knee surgery from March 27, 2020, through May 25, 2020, at 2 institutions was identified. The cohort was divided into hip fracture and non-fracture patients to compare the postoperative experience of these patient populations. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection diagnosed via severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, discharge disposition, postoperative complications, and mortality rate. A total of 149 patients underwent nonelective hip and knee surgeries, including 76 hip fracture cases and 73 nonelective hip and knee arthroplasty cases.

In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood samples collected from six healthy controls and 14 COVID-19 samples including severe, moderate, and convalescent samples from three severely/critically ill and four moderately ill patients. We found that the monocytes were strongly remodeled in the severely/critically ill patients with COVID-19, with an increased proportion of monocytes and seriously reduced diversity. In addition, we discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets: Mono 0 and Mono 5. These subsets expressed amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene, exhibited an enriched erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, and appeared to exhibit pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammation characteristics. We also found metabolic changes in Mono 0 and Mono 5, including increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Notably, one pre-severe sample displayed a monocyte atlas similar to that of the severe/critical samples. In conclusion, our study discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets as potential predictors and therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19. Overall, this study provides potential predictors for severe disease and therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and thus provides a resource for further studies on COVID-19.","Zhang, Yan; Wang, Shuting; Xia, He; Guo, Jing; He, Kangxin; Huang, Chenjie; Luo, Rui; Chen, Yanfei; Xu, Kaijin; Gao, Hainv; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan",,,199

We therefore conducted a survey to explore these issues. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 226 PWUD from three Norwegian cities in May/June 2020. Participants completed an interview-administrated questionnaire. Three separate multiple binary logistic regression models were estimated with the outcomes (no/yes): 1. Familiarity with COVID-19 symptoms, 2. Awareness of COVID-19 services tailored towards PWUD and, 3. Willingness to take a COVID-19 test. RESULTS: The mean age was 44.1 years and 73 % were males. Fifty-four percent were injectors, and heroin/other opioids (35.8 %) and cocaine/amphetamine (25.2 %) were the most common main drugs used. Overall, 54.9 % were in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). The majority (65.9 %) stated they knew the COVID-19 symptoms. Almost all the participants (91.2 %) reported they would take a COVID-19 test if experiencing relevant symptoms. The majority (63.7 %) were not aware of COVID-19 services available to PWUD. OMT patients were more likely to be familiar with COVID-19 symptoms (aOR = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.7; 6.8), and to be aware of COVID-19 services (aOR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1; 6.3). Overall, 35.4 % reported reduced drug availability, mainly for tranquilizers, while 61.5 % reported increased drug prices, mainly for cannabis. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment may play an important role in COVID-19 prevention, as those in OMT were more likely to be aware of symptoms and of availability of services.","Welle-Strand, Gabrielle K; Skurtveit, Svetlana; Clausen, Thomas; Sundal, Christine; Gjersing, Linn",Drug Alcohol Depend,,199

Design: Comparative case-control study. Setting: Multicenter, comprehensive tertiary healthcare facility in Detroit, MI. Patients/Subjects: Adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection were compared with patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (control). Interventions: None. MEASUREMENTS AND Main Results: We included 384 patients in the analysis. Inpatient mortality was significantly higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection compared with controls (64% vs 49%;p = 0.007). Despite both groups demonstrating similar ventilatory function and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on day 1 of intubation, with similar lung compliance throughout the study period, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection demonstrated progressive hypoxia compared with controls across the study period. Similarly, higher positive end-expiratory pressure levels and increased use of paralytics were observed in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection group. On univariate analysis of the entire cohort, significant risk factors for inpatient mortality included coronavirus disease 2019 infection (p = 0.007), older age (p &lt; 0.001), high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (p = 0.003), vasopressor use (p = 0.039), paralytic use (p &lt; 0.001), higher positive end-expiratory pressure levels on day 3 (p = 0.027) and day 7 (p &lt; 0.001), in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome severity on both days 3 (p = 0.008) and 7 (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified coronavirus disease 2019 infection (odds ratio, 1.939;p = 0.021), older age (odds ratio, 1.042;p &lt; 0.001), paralytic use (odds ratio, 3.366;p &lt; 0.001), and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (odds ratio, 1.152;p = 0.027) as significant predictors of mortality across the entire cohort. Conclusions: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection demonstrated higher mortality compared with control patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome prior to the pandemic, with progressive hypoxia throughout the study period, despite similar lung mechanics and initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection, older age, paralytic use, and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality across the entire cohort.","Abu Sayf, A.; Fadel, R.; Scott, A.; Al Bizri, L.; Kong, W.

468282,An overview about the impact of COVID-19 in the cruise industry and some considerations about its impact in florida,2021,"At present, the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rampant all over the country, and controlling the spread of its epidemic has become a top priority. It is very difficult to control the epidemic spreading because there is no specific drug to fight against it. Therefore, it is urgent task for us to develop a specific drug as soon as possible, and attracting worldwide attention. The studies on anti-2019-nCoV drugs were generally carried out in three modes, as vaccine, chemical drugs and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Because the developing on vaccines and chemicals takes too long, it is hard to solve the urgent problem. Moreover, the RNA of coronavirus has been recombined so quickly that the vaccines and drugs studied with great efforts not only may miss the epidemic time, but also cannot be used in the next generation of new coronavirus treatment, as a result that the work of epidemic prevention is formidable. However, the prescriptions from traditional Chinese medicine theory can cure the epidemic disease, but how to develop it into a specific drug with clear chemical composition and clear pharmacologic mechanism, is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the new coronavirus and its drug development are reviewed, while the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed, and the drug dilemma research phenomenon is clarified by using the supramolecular “qi chromatography” theory. It is suggested that the strategy of anti-coronavirus drug developing should be put forward based on the impact of “qi chromatography” of biological supramolecular “imprinting template”, in order to develop new drugs against 2019-nCoV to control the spread of the epidemic as quick as we can, and establish a new research and development model of anti-coronavirus drug on integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, turning passive into active.","He, Fu-Yuan; Deng, Kai-Wen; Pan, Xue; Zhou, Yi-Qun",Chin.

469013,The resilience of African migrant entrepreneurs in China under COVID-19,2020,"As global vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 proceed, there is emerging interest in the longevity of immune protection, especially with regard to increasingly infectious virus variants. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are promising correlates of protective immunity and have been successfully used for prevention and therapy. To assess neutralizing capacity, we developed a bead-based multiplex ACE2 RBD competition assay as a large scalable, time-, cost-, and material-saving alternative to infectious live-virus neutralization tests. By mimicking the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, this assay detects the presence of Nabs against SARS-CoV2 in serum. Using this multiplex approach allows the simultaneous analysis of Nabs against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest in a single well. Following validation, we analyzed 325 serum samples from 186 COVID-19 patients of varying severity. Neutralization capacity was reduced for all variants examined compared to wild-type, especially for those displaying the E484K mutation. The neutralizing immune response itself, while highly individualistic, positively correlates with IgG levels. Neutralization capacity also correlated with disease severity up to WHO grade 7, after which it reduced.","Junker, Daniel; Dulovic, Alex; Becker, Matthias; Wagner, Teresa R; Kaiser, Philipp D; Traenkle, Bjoern; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Kienzle, Katharina; Bunk, Stefanie; Strümper, Carlotta; Häberle, Helene; Schmauder, Kristina; Malek, Nisar; Althaus, Karina; Koeppen, Michael; Bitzer, Michael; Göpel, Siri; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole",,,199

However, current computational methods have not studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver gene identification and combinatorial drug discovery for individual patients. Here, we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect signatures for individual patients. In addition, CPGD identified 90 drug combinations candidates from SARS-COV2 dataset as potential drug repurposing candidates for recently spreading COVID-19.","Guo, Wei-Feng; Zhang, Shao-Wu; Feng, Yue-Hua; Liang, Jing; Zeng, Tao; Chen, Luonan",Nucleic acids res,,199

Since December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 ï¼COVID-19ï¼ outbreaks caused by 2019 novel coronavirus ï¼2019-nCoVï¼ has occurred in China and many countries around the world. Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against 2019-nCoV need to be quickly screened. The antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-2019-nCoV effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The current dosage recommended in clinical treatment is larger than that in previous treatment of malaria and the period of treatment is longer. Many provinces have required close clinical monitoring of adverse reactions. This paper reviews the pharmacological effects, poisoning and toxicological mechanisms, in vivo metabolism and distribution, and forensic issues of chloroquine drugs, in order to provide help to forensic practice and clinical work.","Duan, Y J; Liu, Q; Zhao, S Q; Huang, F; Ren, L; Liu, L; Zhou, Y W",Fa Yi Xue Za Zhi,,199

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study was conducted in the pediatric emergency, pediatric intensive care unit (PICUs) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) hospital of a tertiary teaching and referral hospital in North India over a period of 5 months (September 2020 to January 2021). Clinical details, laboratory investigations, intensive care needs, treatment and short-term outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Forty children with median interquartile range age of 7 (5-10) years were enrolled. The common clinical features were fever (97.5%), mucocutaneous involvement (80%), abdominal (72.5%) and respiratory (50%) symptoms. Shock was noted in 80% children. Most cases (85%) required PICU admission where they received nasal prong oxygen (40%), non-invasive (22.5%) and invasive (22.5%) ventilation and vasoactive drug support (72.5%). The confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure was in the form of positive serology (66.7%), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (10%), and contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive case (12.5%). The common echocardiographic findings included myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%; 72.5%), and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (22.5%). The immunomodulatory treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) (100%) and steroids (methylprednisolone 10-30 mg/kg/day for 3-5 days) (85%). Aspirin was used in 80% and heparin (low molecular weight) in 7.5% cases. Two children died (5%) and median duration of PICU and hospital stay in survivors were 5 (2-8) and 7 (4-9) days, respectively. Children with shock showed higher total leucocyte count and higher rates of myocardial dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular involvement and shock are predominant features in severe disease. Early diagnosis can be challenging given the overlapping features with other diagnoses. A high index of suspicion is warranted in children with constellation of fever, mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular involvement alongwith evidence of systemic inflammation and recent or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

472145,Impact of Covid-19 on Household Food Waste: The Case of Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the disease has gained momentum with every passing day. Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.","Afzal, Muhammad; Hussain, Maqbool; Hussain, Jamil; Bang, Jaehun; Lee, Sungyoung",J Med Internet Res,,199

473249,A Study of the Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic on Tourism Industry in Anhui Province and the Development Strategies,2020,"At the beginning of the 21st century, a new deadly infectious disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized as a global public health threat. Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern. This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent. In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe. As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.","da Costa, Vivaldo Gomes; Moreli, Marcos Lázaro; Saivish, Marielena Vogel",Arch Virol,,199

Addressing these challenges will require fundamental changes to public health data systems. For example, of the core data systems for immunization campaigns is the immunization information system (IIS); however, IISs were designed for tracking the vaccinated, not finding the patients who are high risk and need to be vaccinated. Health systems have this data in their electronic health records (EHR) systems and often have a greater capacity for outreach. Clearly, a partnership is needed. However, successful collaborations will require public health to change from its historical hierarchical information supply chain model to an ecosystem model with a peer-to-peer exchange with population health providers. Examples of the types of informatics innovations necessary to support such an ecosystem include a national patient identifier, population-level data exchange for immunization data, and computable electronic quality measures. Rather than think of these components individually, a comprehensive approach to rapidly adaptable tools for collaboration is needed.","Lenert, Leslie A; Ding, Wei; Jacobs, Jeff",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,199

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possible non-linear influences remain unknown. Data were analyzed from COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile range [IQR] 38-55, range 18-60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was statistically significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased lymphocyte counts influence disease severity independently of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p = 0.039) are particularly associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 specifically in young patients, whereas no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. This study identified increased levels of complement C3 as a unique risk factor for adverse outcomes specific to young COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Weiting; Hornung, Roman; Xu, Kai; Yang, Cai Hong; Li, Jian",Sci Rep,,199

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis was undertaken of retrospective data from cirrhotic patients who underwent oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) and a triphasic abdominal CT from January to December 2019. Endoscopists and radiologists provided their respective independent assessment of OV grading after being blinded to the clinical details. Performance of CT grading of OVs was compared with the reference standard endoscopic grading using weighted kappa (k). Non-invasive scores such, as aspartate transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index, platelet: spleen (PS) ratio were correlated between the two techniques. RESULTS: OV grading between endoscopists and radiologists showed 81.73% agreement (85 out of 104 patients) in the comparative analysis of 104 cirrhotic patients, of which no varices (57.1%, n=4), small (85.1%, n=23), medium (72.2%%, n=26), and large varices (94.1%, n=32) with a weighted k score of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.94). Overall, the sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of no, small, medium, and large OVs was 66.6%, 79.3%, 89.6%, and 94.1%, respectively, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) score of 0.775, 0.887, 0.839, and 0.914. Performance of APRI, FIB-4, and PS ratio correlated well with the severity of OVs with no difference between OGD and CT grading. CONCLUSION: Triphasic abdominal CT can be an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and grading of OVs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jothimani, D; Danielraj, S; Nallathambi, B; Pandurangan, B; Kalyanasundaram, S; Subbiah, K; Ramachandran, H; Venugopal, R; Dhas, D; Rela, M",Clin. radiol,,199

The world convened in international efforts, experiences and technologies in order to fight the emerging pandemic. Isolation, hygiene measure, diagnosis, and treatment are the most efficient ways of prevention and intervention nowadays. The health organizations and global care systems screened the available resources and offered recommendations of approved and proposed medications. However, the search for a specific selective therapy or vaccine against COVID-19 remains a challenge. METHODS: A literature search was performed for the screening of natural and derived bio-active compounds which showed potent antiviral activity against coronaviruses using published articles, patents, clinical trials website (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and web databases (PubMed, SCI Finder, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). RESULTS: Through the screening for natural products with antiviral activities against different types of the human coronavirus, extracts of Lycoris radiata (L'Hér.), Gentiana scabra Bunge, Dioscorea batatas Decne., Cassia tora L., Taxillus chinensis (DC.), Cibotium barometz L. and Echinacea purpurea L. showed a promising effect against SARS-CoV. Out of the listed compound Lycorine, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate, pristimerin, harmine, conessine, berbamine, 4`-hydroxychalcone, papaverine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, monensin sodium, cycloheximide, oligomycin and valinomycin show potent activity against human coronaviruses. Additionally, it is worth noting that some compounds have already moved into clinical trials for their activity against COVID-19 including fingolimod, methylprednisolone, chloroquine, tetrandrine and tocilizumab. CONCLUSION: Natural compounds and their derivatives could be used for developing potent therapeutics with significant activity against SARS-COV-2, providing a promising frontline in the fighting against COVID-19.","Khalifa, Shaden A M; Yosri, Nermeen; El-Mallah, Mohamed F; Ghonaim, Reem; Guo, Zhiming; Musharraf, Syed Ghulam; Du, Ming; Khatib, Alfi; Xiao, Jianbo; Saeed, Aamer; El-Seedi, Haged H R; Zhao, Chao; Efferth, Thomas; El-Seedi, Hesham R",Phytomedicine,,199

Almost every aspect of the pathogen remains largely unknown, ranging from mechanisms involved in infection transmission, interplay with the human immune system, and covert mechanisms of end-organ damage. COVID-19 has manifested itself worldwide with a syndromic appearance that is dominated by respiratory dysregulations. While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which may not exhibit overt clinical features. Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19. However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2. In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus. The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.","Baig, Abdul Mannan",ACS Chem Neurosci,,199

479664,The Silencing of US Campuses Following the COVID-19 Response: Evaluating Root Mean Square Seismic Amplitudes Using Power Spectral Density Data,2021,"A central paradigm of immunity is that interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses precede pro-inflammatory ones, optimizing host protection and minimizing collateral damage1,2. Here, we report that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this paradigm does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 moderate-to-severe patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-&#955; and type I IFN production were both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they became critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were produced before IFNs in all patients and persisted for a prolonged time. This condition was reflected in blood transcriptomes wherein prominent IFN signatures were only seen in critically ill patients who also exhibited augmented inflammation. By comparison, in 16 patients with influenza (flu) hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to those of COVID-19 and 24 nonhospitalized patients with flu with milder symptoms, IFN-&#955; and type I IFN were robustly induced earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were only acutely produced. Notably, higher IFN-&#955; concentrations in patients with COVID-19 correlated with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance and a higher IFN-&#955; to type I IFN ratio correlated with improved outcome for critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 correlated with longer hospitalization and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19, contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","Galani, Ioanna-Evdokia; Rovina, Nikoletta; Lampropoulou, Vicky; Triantafyllia, Vasiliki; Manioudaki, Maria; Pavlos, Eleftherios; Koukaki, Evangelia; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Panou, Vasiliki; Rapti, Vasiliki; Koltsida, Ourania; Mentis, Andreas; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Koutsoukou, Antonia; Andreakos, Evangelos",Nat. immunol,,199

METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C-EAT (COVID-19 EAT) survey in April-May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7 ± 2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined as cross-sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open-ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic-related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re-emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.","Simone, Melissa; Emery, Rebecca L; Hazzard, Vivienne M; Eisenberg, Marla E; Larson, Nicole; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Int J Eat Disord,,199

480814,Planning for the Post-Covid-19 ‘New Normal’: Trends and Scenarios for Cities in the United Kingdom,2020,"Coronaviruses are a big family of viruses that can infect mammalians and birds. In humans they mainly cause respiratory tract infections, with a large spectrum of severity, from mild, self-limited infections to highly lethal forms as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scanty data are reported for the involvement of endocrine glands by human coronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-2. In this review we summarize endocrinological involvement by human coronaviruses, including data on animal coronaviruses. Avians, ferrets and bovine are affected by specific coronavirus syndromes, with variable involvement of endocrine glands. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as target receptor, so ACE2 plays a central role for viral transmission and initial organ involvement. Autoptic studies on SARS patients revealed that thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary gland, endocrine pancreas and especially adrenals and testis can be impaired by different mechanisms (direct damage by SARS-CoV, inflammation, vascular derangement and autoimmune reactions) and few clinical studies have evidenced functional endocrine impairment. Only few data are available for COVID-19 and gonads and endocrine pancreas seem to be involved. International endocrinological societies have brought some recommendations for COVID-19 pandemic but further studies need to be performed, especially to detect long-term hormonal sequelae.","Parolin, Matteo; Parisotto, Matteo; Zanchetta, Francesca; Sartorato, Paola; De Menis, Ernesto",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,199

While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen, and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate or, perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago during the first 6 months of the pandemic. DESIGN: Ecological, observational study at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to September 2020. SETTING: Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. PARTICIPANTS: All populated ZCTAs in the 3 cities. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality cumulatively through the end of September 2020. Predictors were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and its 4 domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. The spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 outcomes was examined by using global and local Moran I statistics, and estimated associations were examined by using spatial conditional autoregressive negative binomial models. RESULTS: Spatial clusters of high and low positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality were found, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability in the 3 cities. Evidence was also found for spatial inequities in testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates and higher positivity ratios, confirmed case rates, and mortality rates. LIMITATIONS: The ZCTAs are imperfect and heterogeneous geographic units of analysis. Surveillance data were used, which may be incomplete. CONCLUSION: Spatial inequities exist in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in 3 large U.S. cities.

486234,"Human Mobility, COVID-19, and Policy Responses: The rights and Claims-Making of Migrant Domestic workers",2021,"Ideally, the classroom serves as a space where students feel comfortable voicing their opinions and asking questions without fear of judgment or hostility. Historically, this conscious placemaking is referred to as a “safe-space,” a term which some scholars suggest has become insufficient in its aims. Seeking to reframe the classroom as a place of collaboratively navigating multiple values and viewpoints, I posit a new term, “negotiated space” as an alternative approach. Events like school shootings and the pandemic of COVID-19 have demonstrated the limited control a teacher has in their ability to assure the safety of their students. Further, the recent call for police reform and dismantling institutional racism raise questions as to the merit of claiming the classroom as a “safe-space”–safe for whom? Through critical analysis of pedagogy, I reflect on the role a classroom plays in creating a collaborative environment, and the tools necessary in negotiating its creation. Part I contextualizes negotiated space within the conversation of “safe-space” rhetoric and the shortcomings identified by its critics. Part II outlines methods for implementing the groundwork of a negotiated space in the theatre classroom using various embodied strategies of inclusivity. © 2021 American Alliance for Theatre and Education.","Macpherson, J.",Youth Theatre Journal,,199

Simple bedside prognostic scores can help immensely in predicting the outcome. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A total of 721 patients, from 5 of our previous studies, were included. With primary outcome measure as death, a prognostic model was derived using binary logistic regression. The model was assessed using discrimination and calibration, and internally validated using the bootstrap method. A bedside prognostic score was derived by rounding of the regression coefficients to the nearest integers. RESULTS: A total of 126 (17.48%) patients died. The final model found that higher age, stage III disease, baseline MBI &#8804; 12, papilledema and hydrocephalus were significant predictors of death. The final model showed good discrimination as evident by an AUC = 83.1% (95% confidence interval 79.5%-86.7%, P < .001) and good calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow test P = .579). The model remained valid after internal validation by boot strapping. A simple bedside score with the acronym MASH-P to denote variables baseline MBI (M), age (A), stage (S), hydrocephalus (H) and papilledema (P), was thus derived. The score can range from 0 to 10. Higher the score, higher is the probability of death; a score of 0 carries a predicted probability of just 1.7% while a score of 10 corresponds to a predicted probability of 65%. An electronic ready reckoner has also been developed to aid prognostication on the go. CONCLUSION: MASH-P is a simple prognostic scoring model that can be used at bedside and aid in decision making as well as counselling.","Rizvi, Imran; Malhotra, Hardeep Singh; Garg, Ravindra Kumar; Kumar, Neeraj",J Neurol Sci,,199

It is controversial whether the virus can be transmitted via tears and its ocular implications have not been widely studied. In this article, the current evidence related to ocular transmission and ocular manifestations is reviewed. RESULTS: Several mechanisms for the ocular transmission of the virus are proposed with highlight on the nasolacrimal system as a conduit between the eye and the respiratory tract, and the role of the lacrimal gland in hematogenous spread. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported. CONCLUSION: The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions. The ocular tropism of the virus and its potential to cause localized ocular disease are worth considering.","Ho, Dawn; Low, Rebecca; Tong, Louis; Gupta, Vishali; Veeraraghavan, Aravamudan; Agrawal, Rupesh",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,199

This study explores the impact of political distrust on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The study utilised qualitative dominant mixed methods approach comprising telephone interviews and a survey of 120 educated Nigerians purposively selected from four COVID-19 most affected states including Lagos, Oyo, Kano and Rivers as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The study also relied on secondary data on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria sourced from Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control from 27 February to 31st August 2020. The study found that political corruption motivates large-scale political distrust. This undermines public compliance to government protocols, limits the outcomes of government responses to COVID-19 and facilitates the spread of the virus in Nigeria. The paper concludes that improving government accountability in the public sector management is relevant for building public trust, promoting citizens' compliance to COVID-19 safety measure and mitigating the spread of the pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.","Ezeibe, Christian C; Ilo, Chukwudi; Ezeibe, Ezinwanne N; Oguonu, Chika N; Nwankwo, Nnamdi A; Ajaero, Chukwuedozie K; Osadebe, Nnabuike",Glob Public Health,,199

METHODS: We conducted individual qualitative interviews with key informants working with public health using a self-assessment survey tool in order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the interrelation or multidisciplinary work in Kolding Municipality. The developed self-assessment survey tool entailed questions about essential public health activities performed in a municipality. RESULTS: The Municipality organizes and contributes to core service delivery EPHOs, namely health protection, health promotion, and disease prevention. It collaborates with the general practitioners and the Region of Southern Denmark, responsible for hospital care, to fulfill the selected EPHOs. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain a comprehensive picture of the organizations that deliver public health services within a municipality, it is necessary to conduct interviews with representatives from those organizations as well. Additionally, the results from this study can be used to improve the survey tool further and hereafter conduct a nationwide survey in Denmark, as well as other European countries.","Safi, Mariam; Bertram, Maja L; Gulis, Gabriel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,199

489408,The Covid-19 and the Educational Gaps El Covid-19 y las Brechas Educativas/ The Covid-19 and the Educational Gaps,2020,"Manganese oxide minerals can become enriched in a variety of metals through adsorption and redox processes, and this forms the basis for a close geochemical relationship between Mn oxide phases and Co. Since oxalate-producing fungi can effect geochemical transformation of Mn oxides, an understanding of the fate of Co during such processes could provide new insights on the geochemical behaviour of Co. In this work, the transformation of Mn oxides by Aspergillus niger was investigated using a Co-bearing manganiferous laterite, and a synthetic Co-doped birnessite. A. niger could transform laterite in both fragmented and powder forms, resulting in formation of biomineral crusts that were composed of Mn oxalates hosting Co, Ni and, in transformed laterite fragments, Mg. Total transformation of Co-doped birnessite resulted in precipitation of Co-bearing Mn oxalate. Fungal transformation of the Mn oxide phases included Mn(III,IV) reduction by oxalate, and may also have involved reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). These findings demonstrate that oxalate-producing fungi can influence Co speciation in Mn oxides, with implications for other hosted metals including Al and Fe. This work also provides further understanding of the roles of fungi as geoactive agents which can inform potential applications in metal bioremediation, recycling and biorecovery.","Ferrier, John; Csetenyi, Laszlo; Gadd, Geoffrey Michael",Environ. microbiol,,199

490619,Pandemic politics: Reflections on COVID-19 in the gulf,2020,"Many U.S. households have insufficient savings to cope with income losses, expenditure shocks, and other financial emergencies, yet little research evidence explains why. Guided by Sherraden (2013) model of financial capability, we expand on prior research that examines the role of financial knowledge by incorporating additional factors and testing income interactions to explain a greater proportion of variance concerning whether or not households have money set aside for emergencies. We analyzed data from the 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 National Financial Capability Surveys and found that subjective financial knowledge, financial confidence, and savings account ownership, but not objective financial knowledge, were significant and consistent predictors of having an emergency fund. Savings account ownership was the strongest predictor, accounting for an increase in the probability of having an emergency fund of 25% to 29% across study years. Adding homeownership and ability to cover expenses to the models increased the proportion of variance explained by an average of 29%. Strategies to promote emergency savings should be multifaceted and include help from financial educators and counselors to create greater financial slack as well as programs and policies to increase access to short-term savings opportunities and incentives.","Despard, Mathieu R; Friedline, Terri; Martin-West, Stacia",J Fam Econ Issues,,199
490676,Digital options for treating mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an overview of available electrical stimulation devices in neurogenic patients with lower urinary tract disease. RECENT FINDINGS: It is advocated to do more studies in neurogenic patients as results seem promising and useful but most studies did not include neurogenic patients or neurogenic patients were not analyzed or reported separately. Most studies included a small heterogenous neurogenic group with multiple pathophysiologic origin focusing on effect of a treatment instead of results of a treatment in a specific neurogenic group. Neuromodulation or stimulation has the advantage that it acts on different organs, like bladder and bowel, so can treat neurogenic patients, who mostly suffer from multiple organ failure. SUMMARY: Brindley procedure, sacral neuromodulation (SNM) and posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) are available for a while already. The Brindley procedure (including sacral anterior root stimulation in combination with a rhizotomy of posterior sacral roots) is developed for selected spinal cord injury patient with a complete spinal injury, and has shown results for many years in neurogenic patients. An alternative to the rhizotomy is not established yet. SNM and PTNS are other modalities that are used in nonneurogenic patients, but are not yet indicated and much studied in neurogenic patients.","Martens, F M J; Sievert, K-D",Curr Opin Urol,,199

We consider a scenario where a heavier DM particle inelastically scatters off an electron and is converted into a lighter DM particle. A small mass difference between the two DM particles is transferred into electron recoil energy. We investigate the DM-electron interaction mediated by a massive dark photon and evaluate the inelastic DM scattering rate, taking account of the atomic structure. It is found that the scattering rate is significantly enhanced because of the small mass splitting, which allows for a small momentum transfer matched with the size of the electron wave function. We show that there exists a viable parameter space which explains the excess of electron recoil events around 2-3 keV recently reported by the XENON1T experiment.","Harigaya, Keisuke; Nakai, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Motoo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11938v2.pdf,199

Therefore, the need remains to understand how the virus is transmitted in order to identify high-risk environments and activities that disproportionately contribute to its spread so that effective preventative measures could be put in place. Contact tracing and household studies in particular provide robust evidence about the parameters of transmission. In this viewpoint, we discuss the available evidence from large-scale, well-conducted contact tracing studies from across the world and argue that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics should inform policy decisions about mitigation strategies for targeted interventions according to the needs of the society by directing attention to the settings, activities and socioeconomic factors associated with the highest risks of transmission.","Cevik, Muge; Marcus, Julia L; Buckee, Caroline; Smith, Tara C",Clin. infect. dis,,199

Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant.","Zhou, Daming; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Mentzer, Alexander J; Ginn, Helen M; Zhao, Yuguang; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Tuekprakhon, Aekkachai; Nutalai, Rungtiwa; Wang, Beibei; Paesen, Guido C; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; Slon-Campos, Jose; Hallis, Bassam; Coombes, Naomi; Bewley, Kevin; Charlton, Sue; Walter, Thomas S; Skelly, Donal; Lumley, Sheila F; Dold, Christina; Levin, Robert; Dong, Tao; Pollard, Andrew J; Knight, Julian C; Crook, Derrick; Lambe, Teresa; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Bibi, Sagida; Flaxman, Amy; Bittaye, Mustapha; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Gilbert, Sarah; James, William; Carroll, Miles W; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Dunachie, Susanna J; Fry, Elizabeth E; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin R",Cell,,199

In this work we aim to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of pneumococcal infection in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every COVID-19 patient presenting with concomitant pneumococcal pneumonia during March 2020 in a tertiary teaching Hospital In Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS: Five patients with PCR confirmed COVID19 or clinical and radiological suspicion were diagnosed of pneumococcal infection. In all cases chest X-ray were abnormal, with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Procalcitonin showed to be not sensitive enough to detect pneumococcal infection. Antibiotherapy was promptly started in all five cases with subsequent satisfactory evolution. CONCLUSION: International guidelines do not include the universal screening for bacterial co-infection. Radiological pattern of COVID-19 can be indistinguishable from that of pneumococcus pneumonia and frequency of co-infection is not well stablished, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possible SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus association to avoid misdiagnosis and delay antibiotic therapy.","Cucchiari, David; Pericàs, Juan M; Riera, Josep; Gumucio, Roberto; Md, Emmanuel Coloma; Nicolás, David",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,199

RESULTS: A notable overall reduction in emergency room visits and admissions is observed in all pediatric areas, maintaining care in neonatology and scheduled admissions in oncology. DISCUSSION: The reduction in global activity in pediatric emergencies is not only explained by the decrease in contagious diseases. The decrease in inadequate demand and inappropriate income may have contributed. The availability of pediatric beds would make the reduction of programmed surgical activity unnecessary and would allow the redistribution of resources to areas with greater healthcare pressure.","Martínez-Navarro, Gorka; Lozano-Zafra, Cristina; Caballero-Chabrera, Francesc; Modesto-Alapont, Vicente; Oltra-Benavent, Manuel",,,199

The virus is likely to show seasonal dynamics in European climates as other respiratory viruses and coronaviruses do. Analysing the association with meteorological factors might be helpful to anticipate how cases will develop with changing seasons. METHODS: Routinely measured ambient daily mean temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity were the explanatory variables of this analysis. Test-positive COVID-19 cases represented the outcome variable. The analysis included 54 English cities. A two-stage meta-regression was conducted. At the first stage, we used a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model including distributed lag non-linear elements. Thereby, we investigate the explanatory variables' non-linear effects as well as the non-linear effects across lags. RESULTS: This study found a non-linear association of COVID-19 cases with temperature. At 11.9°C there was 1.62-times (95%-CI: 1.44; 1.81) the risk of cases compared to the temperature-level with the smallest risk (21.8°C). Absolute humidity exhibited a 1.61-times (95%-CI: 1.41; 1.83) elevated risk at 6.6 g/m3 compared to the centering at 15.1 g/m3. When adjusting for temperature RH shows a 1.41-fold increase in risk of COVID-19 incidence (95%-CI: 1.09; 1.81) at 60.7% in respect to 87.6%. CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that in England meteorological variables likely influence COVID-19 case development. These results reinforce the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing and mask use) during all seasons, especially with cold and dry weather conditions.","Nottmeyer, Luise N; Sera, Francesco",Environ Res,,199

Specifically, male patients are at a higher death risk than female patients, and the older population is significantly more affected than young individuals. Whether this difference is a consequence of a pre-existing differential response to the virus, has not been studied in detail. We created DeCovid, an R shiny app that combines gene expression (GE) data of different human tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project along with the COVID-19 Disease Map and COVID-19 related pathways gene collections to explore basal GE differences across healthy demographic groups. We used this app to study differential gene expression of COVID-19 associated genes in different age and sex groups. We identified that healthy women show higher expression-levels of interferon genes. Conversely, healthy men exhibit higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, young people present a stronger complement system and maintain a high level of matrix metalloproteases than older adults. Our data suggest the existence of different basal immunophenotypes amongst different demographic groups, which are relevant to COVID-19 progression and may contribute to explaining sex and age biases in disease severity. The DeCovid app is an effective and easy to use tool for exploring the GE levels relevant to COVID-19 across demographic groups and tissues.","Liu, Tianyuan; Balzano-Nogueira, Leandro; Lleo, Ana; Conesa, Ana",,,199

496542,COVID-19 as an opportunity to make field-based earth sciences and other similar courses easily accessible and affordable,2021,"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures. Those measures, especially social distancing, are a challenge for developing countries, such as Brazil. In São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), most COVID-19 cases up to April 18th were reported in the Capital and metropolitan area. However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in São Paulo territory. We hypothesize that urban hierarchy is the main responsible for the disease spreading, and we identify the hotspots and the main routes of virus movement from the metropolis to the inner state. In this ecological study, we use geographic models of population mobility to check for patterns for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identify two patterns based on surveillance data: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area, and the other hierarchical with long-distance spread through major highways that connects São Paulo city with cities of regional relevance. This knowledge can provide real-time responses to support public health strategies, optimizing the use of resources in order to minimize disease impact on population and economy.","Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco; Guimarães, Raul Borges; Catão, Rafael de Castro; Ferreira, Cláudia Pio; Berg de Almeida, Gabriel; Nogueira Vilches, Thomas; Pugliesi, Edmur",PLoS One,,199

496995,The Coronavirus' Impact on Education-School Students' Perspective,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The usage of a feeding jejunostomy has been a well-established practice in maintaining nutrition in patients undergoing resections for upper gastrointestinal cancer. As surgical technique has evolved, together with the adoption of enhanced recovery after surgery pathways, the routine insertion of feeding jejunostomy tubes appears to be changing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was constructed using Google Forms. The link was distributed to consultant upper gastrointestinal surgeons via the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons' membership database. Results were collated and analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: A total of 55 responses were received from 28 units across the UK; 27 respondents (49.1%) no longer routinely use feeding jejunostomy in upper gastrointestinal resections, oesophagectomy or gastrectomy. The most common primary feeding modality used by these respondents was oral diet 17 (65.4%), with total parenteral nutrition (19.2%) and nasojejunal (11.5%) routes also being used. Respondents who used feeding jejunostomies inserted them primarily for oesophagectomy (n = 27; 96.4%), with fewer surgeons using them in extended total gastrectomy (n = 12; 42.9%) and total gastrectomy (n = 11; 39.3%). Of the total, 20 surgeons (71.4%) would insert the jejunostomy using an open approach, with 19 (67.9%) employing a Witzel tunnel. Eleven respondents (39.3%) would continue feeding via the jejunostomy after discharge. Some 24 responders thought that feeding jejunostomies did not facilitate the enhanced recovery after surgery pathway (strongly and slightly disagree), whereas 17 considered that they did (strongly and slightly agree); 13 responders did not have strong views either way. CONCLUSIONS: There is a split in current practice regarding the usage of feeding jejunostomies. There is also a division of opinion on the role of feeding jejunostomy in enhanced recovery after surgery.","Ireland, P; Jaunoo, S",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,199

Research is critically needed to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to describe children's mental health during the initial phase of the pandemic, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial moderator of children's increased distress. Method: Children and parents from 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported (i) retrospectively on children's well-being (e.g., worry, happiness) immediately prior to the pandemic and (ii) on children's current well-being;irritability;social support;and anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Childperceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity and attenuated increase in psychological distress. Conclusions: Study findings suggest possible broad psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. These findings may inform clinical assessments and highlight the need for public resources to safeguard children's mental health.

La recherche est essentiellement nécessaire pour identifier l'effet de la pandémie sur la santé mentale des enfants, notamment les facteurs psychosociaux qui prédisent la résilience, le rétablissement, et la détresse persistante. La présente étude a recueilli des données en juin-juillet 2020 afin de décrire la santé mentale des enfants durant la phase initiale de la pandémie, y compris la magnitude et la nature de la détresse psychiatrique et psychologique chez les enfants, et d'évaluer le soutien social comme modérateur psychosocial putatif de la détresse accrue des enfants. Méthode: Les enfants et les parents de 190 familles d'enfants de 8 à 13 ans de la région Windsor-Essex du sud-ouest de l'Ontario ont déclaré (i) rétrospectivement sur le bien-être des enfants (p. ex., inquiétude, bonheur) immédiatement avant la pandémie et (ii) sur le bien-être actuel des enfants;irritabilité;soutien social, et symptômes anxieux, dépressifs, et de stress post-traumatique à l'évaluation de base d'une étude longitudinale en cours de la pandémie de la COVID-19. Résultats: Enfants et parents ont déclaré un bien-être amoindri et une détresse psychologique durant la pandémie comparativement aux déclarations rétrospectives sur le bien-être pré-pandémique. Le soutien social de la famille et des amis perçu par les enfants était associé à une moins grande gravité des symptômes et atténuait la hausse de la détresse psychologique. Conclusions: Les résultats de l'étude suggèrent la possibilité d'effets psychologiques répandus de la pandémie de la COVID-19 et sont conformes à la recherche précédente qui indique le rôle protecteur du soutien social pour atténuer l'effet psychologique négatif de la pandémie. Ces résultats peuvent éclairer les évaluations cliniques et souligner le besoin de ressources publiques pour sauvegarder la santé mentale des enfants.

500260,“More Attention than Usual”: A Thematic Analysis of Dog Ownership Experiences in the UK during the First COVID-19 Lockdown,2021,"A sudden fall of stock prices happens during a pandemic due to the panic sell-off by the investors. Such a sell-off may continue for more than a day, leading to a significant crash in the stock price or, more specifically, an extreme event (EE). In this paper, Hilbert-Huang transformation and a structural break analysis (SBA) have been applied to identify and characterize an EE in the stock market due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hilbert spectrum shows a maximum energy concentration at the time of an EE, and hence, it is useful to identify such an event. The EE's significant energy concentration is more than four times the standard deviation above the mean energy of the normal fluctuation of stock prices. A statistical significance test for the intrinsic mode functions is applied, and the test found that the signal is not noisy. The degree of nonstationarity test shows that the indices and stock prices are nonstationary. We identify the time of influence of the EE on the stock price by using SBA. Furthermore, we have identified the time scale ( &#964;) of the shock and recovery of the stock price during the EE using the intrinsic mode function obtained from the empirical mode decomposition technique. The quality stocks with V-shape recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic have definite &#964; of shock and recovery, whereas the stressed stocks with L-shape recovery have no definite &#964;. The identification of &#964; of shock and recovery during an EE will help investors to differentiate between quality and stressed stocks. These studies will help investors to make appropriate investment decisions.","Mahata, Ajit; Rai, Anish; Nurujjaman, Md; Prakash, Om; Prasad Bal, Debi",Chaos,,199

The understanding of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of paramount importance for the COVID-19 control, combating, and prevention. Due to the rapid growth of both the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the number of unique mutations, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates faces an emergent large-data challenge. We introduce a dimension-reduced $k$-means clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. We examine the performance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). By using four benchmark datasets, we found that UMAP is the best-suited technique due to its stable, reliable, and efficient performance, its ability to improve clustering accuracy, especially for large Jaccard distanced-based datasets, and its superior clustering visualization. The UMAP-assisted $k$-means clustering enables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates.","Hozumi, Yuta; Wang, Rui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15268v1.pdf,199

The characteristic, outcome, and risk factor of COVID-19 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis remain unclear.Methods: Medical records were collected from 23 Chinese hospitals. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and age- and sex-matched non-liver disease patients were enrolled with 1:4 ratio using stratified sampling.Results: There were more comorbidities with higher Chalson Complication Index (p < 0.001), higher proportion of patients having gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, ascites, and diarrhea among those patients (p < 0.05) and in decompensated cirrhosis patients. Mortality (p < 0.05) and the proportion of severe ill (p < 0.001) were significantly high among those patients. Patients in severe ill subgroup had higher mortality (p < 0.001), MELD, and CRUB65 score but lower lymphocytes count. Besides, this subgroup had larger proportion of patients with abnormal (PT), activated partial thromboplatin time (APTT), D-Dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBL) and Creatinine (Cr) (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression for severity shown that MELD and CRUB65 score reached significance. Higher Child-Pugh and CRUB65 scores were found among non-survival cases and multivariate logistic regression further inferred risk factors for adverse outcome. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves also provided remarkable demonstrations for the predictive ability of Child-Pugh and CRUB65 scores.Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis had larger proportion of more severely disease and higher mortality. MELD and CRUB65 score at hospital admission may predict COVID-19 severity while Child-Pugh and CRUB65 score were highly associated with non-survival among those patients.","Xiao, Yong; Wu, Dongwen; Shi, Xiao; Liu, Shuzhong; Hu, Xudong; Zhou, Chenliang; Tian, Xia; Liu, Huimin; Long, Hui; Li, Zhihong; Wang, Ji; Tan, Tao; Xu, Ying; Chen, Bitao; Liu, Ting; Zhang, Heng; Zheng, Shihua; Hu, Shunlin; Song, Jun; Tang, Jie; Song, Jichun; Cheng, Zhengwei; Xu, Weitian; Shen, Yongxiang; Yu, Wenhu; Xu, Yong; Li, Jiao; Zhou, Jing; Wang, Fen; Chen, Mingkai",Virulence,,199

502216,Patient-centered communication: Collaborative learning and communication strategies for patients and health care providers in the new normal of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74·0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24·8%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26·1%) patients. 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 81·7% (219 of 268) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28-2·40], p<0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65-3·22], p<0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3-5 versus grades 1-2 (2·35 [1·57-3·53], p<0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01-2·39], p=0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06-2·63], p=0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01-2·31], p=0·047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

This study aims to examine the association between risk perception and mental health while taking social support as a moderator. Methods: An online cross-sectional study recruiting 2993 participants was conducted in China, from 1st to 10th, February 2020. The relationship between risk perception, social support, and mental health was examined using multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: This study indicated that risk perception was associated with a higher level of mental health symptoms. The subscale ""Perceived uncontrollability"" seemed to present a stronger correlation with depressive symptoms (Beta=0.306) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Beta=0.318) than the subscale ""Perceived Severity"" did. Moreover, social support moderated the relationship between perceived uncontrollability and mental health symptoms. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to design mental health strategies and programs from a risk perception perspective (more mental health strategies should be delivered to build reasonable risk perception), while social support from family and friends may be protective to against depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms. There is a demand for mental health intervention from a risk perception perspective.","Liu, C.; Huang, N.; Fu, M.; Zhang, H.; Feng, X. L.; Guo, J.",Risk Management &amp; Healthcare Policy,,199
502991,Physical principle used in reliability,2021,"Background: COVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP. Patients and Methods: Patients &#8805;18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results: CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex. Conclusions: Common cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. They provide a promising therapeutic target for monoclonal antibody production.","Greenbaum, Uri; Klein, Kimberly; Martinez, Fernando; Song, Juhee; Thall, Peter F; Ramdial, Jeremy L; Knape, Cristina; Aung, Fleur M; Scroggins, Jamie; Knopfelmacher, Adriana; Mulanovich, Victor; Borjan, Jovan; Adachi, Javier; Muthu, Mayoora; Leung, Cerena; Medina, Mayrin Correa; Champlin, Richard; Olson, Amanda; Alousi, Amin; Rezvani, Katayoun; Shpall, Elizabeth J",Front Immunol,,199

There have been some major changes in the classification of dissociative disorders in the transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11. One important revision is the elimination of the term ""conversion disorder"" from the grouping title as well as the omission of any appraisal of the patient´s behavior or motivation. In ICD-11, the dissociative neurological symptom disorder has gained in importance, reflected in its presentation in the first place of this category. In contrast to ICD-10, dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) has become a single disorder. Bodily distress disorder has replaced the somatoform disorders of ICD-10 and now includes neurasthenia, while hypochondria was eliminated from this category altogether. Bodily distress disorder is defined by distinct psychological features such as extreme distress but not by the presence or absence of medical findings.","Herpertz-Dahlmann, Beate",Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother,,199

505454,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The infection of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) is challenging health problems worldwide. COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with the number of infected cases increased to 54.4 million with 1.32 million deaths. Different types of statistical models have been developed to predict viral infection and multiple studies have compared the performance of these predictive models, but results were not consistent. This study aimed to develop and provide easy to use model to predict the Covid-19 infection severity in the patients and to help understanding the patient's condition. METHODS: This study analyzed simulated data obtained from the large database for 340 patients with an active Covid-19 infection. The study identified predictors of Covid-19 outcomes that may be measured in two different ways: the total T-cell levels in the blood with T-cell subsets and number of cells in the blood infected with virus. All measures are relatively unobtrusive as they only require a blood sample, however there is a significant laboratory cost implications for measuring the number of cells infected with virus. This study used methodological approach using two different methods showing how multiple regression and logistic regression can be used in the context of Covid-19 longitudinal data to develop the prediction models. RESULTS: This study has identified the predictors of Covid-19 infection outcomes and developed prediction models. In the regression model of Total_T Cell, the predictors BMI, comorbidity and Total_Tcell were all associated with increased levels of infection severity (p < 0.001). For BMI, the mean % of unhealthy cells increased by 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) and comorbidity predictor has on average 8.3% more unhealthy liver cells than without comorbidity (95% CI - 2.9%-1.29%). The results of multivariate logistic regression model predicting the Covid-19 Infection severity were promising. The significant predictors were observed such as Age (OR 0.95, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99), Helper T_cells (OR O.93, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.87-0.99), Basic_Tcell (OR 1.11, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71) and Comorbidity (OR 0.41, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.16-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study recommendation has been provided to clinical researchers on the best way to use the various Covid-19 infections measures along with identifying other possible predictors of Covid-19 infection. It is imperative to monitor closely the T-cell subsets using prediction models that might provide valuable information about the patient's condition during the treatment process.","Ansari, Rashid M; Baker, Peter",J Infect Public Health,,199

The analysis reveals that financial markets may underreact to the announcements by taking a finite time to re-adjust prices, thus moving against the efficient market hypothesis. We observe that this empirical regularity can be related to the speculative behavior of market participants, whose willingness to switch toward better performing investment strategies, as well as their degree of reactivity to price trend or mispricing, can induce long-lasting volatility cascades.","Spelta, Alessandro; Pecora, Nicolò; Flori, Andrea; Giudici, Paolo",Ann Oper Res,,199
506898,Anti-Federalist Federalism: American “Populism” and the Spatial Contradictions of US Government in the Time of Covid-19,2021,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the health and socioeconomic outcomes for low-income populations, people of color, and immigrant children and families in the United States. As inequities in resources (i.e., food, internet, housing), health care, and education increased for marginalized families as a result of COVID-19, child-focused clinicians had to broaden their professional scope and implement new advocacy efforts. The current paper uses clinical vignettes taken from a New York State Office of Mental Health-licensed child and adolescent outpatient clinic in the Bronx, New York. The vignettes highlight the social inequities that impacted marginalized children and families during the pandemic, as well as the clinical team's response through the integration of evidence-base practice and advocacy. Implications for practice with vulnerable populations as the COVID-19 pandemic persists are discussed.","Bailin, Abby; Burton, Samantha; Rego, Simon; Alpert, Jonathan; Pimentel, Sandra",,,199
507056,COVID-19: a wake-up call to protect planetary health,2021,"Background: Changes in platelet count are common in COVID-19 patients. The platelet count reflects the thrombocyte turnover, acting as a sensitive indicator of illness severity that is of great clinical utility to monitor a quickly changing health condition of patients affected by aggressive viral infections. This study aims to investigate the significance of platelet count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 532 COVID-19 patients were involved in the cohort study from the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan from January 7, 2020, to February 28, 2020. We collected the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of patients. Patients still hospitalized before February 29, 2020, died on admission, with malignant tumors, previous gastrointestinal surgery, missing baseline platelet count, or platelet count detected only once, were excluded. We used a generalized additive model and generalized additive mixed model to compare trends in platelet count over time among survivors and non-survivors, with an adjustment for potential confounders. Results: During the follow-up, twenty-nine subjects died (mortality rate, 5.45%). The platelets among non-survivors decreased and among survivors increased gradually within 1 week after admission. In addition, the difference between the two groups showed an increasing trend during 1 week after admission. This difference increased by an average of 5.3 × 10^9/L daily. Conclusions: In the early stage, platelet count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. Early decrease in platelet count was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Causality, however, cannot be deduced from our data.","Zhao, Xiaofang; Wang, Kun; Zuo, Peiyuan; Liu, Yuwei; Zhang, Meng; Xie, Songpu; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Xinglin; Liu, Chengyun",EPMA J,,199
507298,"Person, Place, Time and COVID-19 Inequities",2021,"OBJECTIVES: In South Africa, the Control of Tobacco and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill seeks to regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products, including their advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Population data on e-cigarette advertising in South Africa are needed to inform public health programs, practice and policy. We examined self-reported e-cigarette advertising exposure during 2017. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Household-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3063 individuals who participated in the 2017 South African Social Attitudes survey, a nationally representative, in-person survey of the non-institutionalised civilian adult population aged &#8805;16 years EXPOSURE: 'In the past 12 months, have you seen advertisements or promotions for e-cigarettes (including e-shisha, e-pipe) on any of the following media: newspapers/magazines, billboards, in the malls or any other source?' MAIN OUTCOMES: Beliefs and attitudes regarding e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Participants' mean age was 37.7 years. Overall, 20.1% reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements. By age, exposure was most prevalent among those aged 16-19 years (24.6%). Top sources of exposure among those exposed were stores, 40.7%; malls, 30.9%; and television, 32.5%. Of those aware of e-cigarettes, 61.2% believed 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes'; 62.7% believed that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotions may make ex-smokers think of starting smoking cigarettes again'; and 59.5% supported the statement that 'e-cigarette smoking should be banned indoors just as traditional cigarette smoking'. Notably, teens aged 16-19 reported the lowest prevalence (49.0%) of those believing that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes', whereas this percentage was highest among those aged 55-64 years (73.2%). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive regulatory efforts are needed to address e-cigarette advertising, marketing and sponsorship in order to protect public health. The urgent enactment of the new tobacco control legislation, The Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill, can help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising in South Africa.","Agaku, Israel Terungwa; Egbe, Catherine O; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A",BMJ Open,,199

Most patients present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke remains a medical emergency even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who presented with acute ischemic stroke in the absence of common risk factors for cerebrovascular accidents. A 70-year-old male patient, with no prior comorbidities, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, cough, and shortness of breath for four days, and altered level of consciousness and right-sided weakness with the sensory loss for one day. On examination, the patient had a score of 8/15 on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). There was a right-sided sensory loss and weakness in both upper and lower limbs with a positive Babinski's sign. The pulmonary examination was remarkable for bilateral crepitation. On blood workup, there was leukocytosis and raised c-reactive protein (CRP). D-dimer, ferritin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, and hypercoagulability workup were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography was also normal. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the virus. Chest x-ray showed infiltrations in the left middle and both lower zones of the lungs in the peripheral distribution. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed peripheral and mid to basal predominant multilobar ground-glass opacities. CT scan of the head showed a large hypodense area, with a loss of gray and white matter differentiation, in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed abnormal signal intensity area in the left parietal region. It appeared isointense on T1 image and hyperintense on T2 image. It also showed diffusion restriction on the diffusion-weighted 1 (DW1) image with corresponding low signals on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. These findings were consistent with left middle cerebral artery territory infarct due to COVID-19. The patient was intubated in the ED. He was deemed unfit for thrombolysis and started on aspirin, anti-coagulation, and other supportive measures. Patients with COVID-19 should be evaluated early for neurological signs. Timely workup and interventions should be performed in any patient suspected of having a stroke to reduce morbidity and mortality.","Farooque, Umar; Shabih, Sohaib; Karimi, Sundas; Lohano, Ashok Kumar; Kataria, Saurabh",Cureus,,199

Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus through social distancing and shelter-at-home edicts have unintended consequences upon clinical and educational missions and mental well-being of radiology departments. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residencies with respect to the educational mission and perceptions of impact on well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was IRB exempt. An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the Association of Program Directors in Radiology membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). RESULTS: Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8% (3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107). Regarding morale of program directors, 61% (65/106) report either mild or marked decreased morale. Program innovations reported by program directors were catalogued and shared.

509617,Addressing associated risks of COVID-19 infections across water and wastewater service chain in Asia,2021,"Prevention and intervention methods are urgently needed to curb the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, a general pro-antigen strategy for subunit vaccine development based on the reversibly formulated receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) is reported. Since the poor lymph node targeting and uptake of S-RBD by antigen-presenting cells prevent effective immune responses, S-RBD protein is formulated into a reversible nanogel (S-RBD-NG), which serves as a pro-antigen with enhanced lymph node targeting and dendritic cell and macrophage accumulation. Synchronized release of S-RBD monomers from the internalized S-RBD-NG pro-antigen triggers more potent immune responses in vivo. In addition, by optimizing the adjuvant used, the potency of S-RBD-NG is further improved, which may provide a generally applicable, safer, and more effective strategy for subunit vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses.","Chen, Long; Liu, Bo; Sun, Peng; Wang, Wenjun; Luo, Shiqiang; Zhang, Wenyuan; Yang, Yuanfan; Wang, Zihao; Lin, Jian; Chen, Peng R",Small,,199
509643,Four health science librarians’ experiences how they responded to the covid-19 pandemic crisis,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. Its intense politicization constantly made headlines, especially regarding the use of face masks as a safety precaution. However, the extent to which public opinion is polarized on wearing masks has remained anecdotal and the verbal representation of this polarization has not been explored. This study examined the types, themes, temporal trends, and exchange patterns of hashtags about mask wearing posted from March 1 to August 1, 2020 by Twitter users based in the United States. On the one hand, we found a stark rhetorical polarization in terms of semantic antagonism between pro- and anti-mask hashtags, exponential frequency increases of both types of hashtags during the period under study, in parallel to growing COVID-19 case counts, state mask mandates, and media coverage. On the other hand, the results showed an asymmetric participatory polarization in terms of a predominance of pro-mask hashtags along with an ""echo chamber"" effect in the dominant pro-mask group, which ignored the subversive rhetoric of the anti-mask minority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, this study provides a nuanced account of the digital polarization of public opinion on mask wearing. It draws attention to political polarization both as a rhetorical phenomenon and as a participatory process.","Lang, Jun; Erickson, Wesley W; Jing-Schmidt, Zhuo",PLoS One,,199

Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India. Methods: The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. Results: Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in administrative staff (19.6%) and least in physicians (5.4%). The staff who used public (20%) and hospital transportation (16.9%) showed higher seroprevalence compared to staff using personal transportation (12.4%). No difference was observed between HCWs posted in COVID versus non-COVID areas. All seropositive symptomatic HCWs in our study (53.6%) had mild symptoms, and the remaining 46.4 per cent were asymptomatic. The antibody positivity rate progressively increased from 7.0 per cent in the first week to 18.6 per cent in the fourth week during the study. Interpretation & conclusions: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a significant number of asymptomatic HCWs, association with the use of public transport, relatively lower seroprevalence compared with the non-HCWs and rising trend during the period of the study highlight the need for serosurveillance, creating awareness for infection control practices including social distancing and study of infection dynamics in the community for effective control of an infectious pandemic.","Gupta, Ritu; Dwivedi, Tanima; Gajendra, Smeeta; Sahoo, Biswajeet; Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar; Vikas, H; Singh, Angel Rajan; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Singh, Sheetal; Wundavalli, Laxmitej; Guleria, Randeep",Indian J Med Res,,199

To monitor bovine farm biosecurity levels, one-step multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the simultaneous detection of group A rotavirus (RVA), bovine torovirus (BToV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), and bovine coronavirus (BCV) was designed, with the aim of configuring candidates for ""viral pathogen indicators"". A total of 322 bovine fecal samples were collected from calves aged less than three months at 48 bovine farms in Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures. At farm A, 20 calves were selected and sampled weekly for 12 weeks (184 samples); at farm B, 10 calves were selected and sampled for five weeks (50 samples); and at the rest of the 46 farms, 88 calves were sampled once. The screening on the 358 field samples proved positive for 27 RVA, 4 BToV, 55 BEV, and 52 BCV. In the successive sampling, RVA was detected once but not continuously, whereas BEV and BCV were detected in succession for up to five weeks. The results revealed that RVA was the primary agent among the positive samples obtained from calves aged three weeks or less, while BEV was the primary among those from the older than three weeks old.

Design/methodology/approach - The study accessed the data on COVID-19 accumulated cases of fatalities and infections across SEA countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, covering the early days of March to May 21, 2020. The approach involved the computation of the CFR using the simple linear regression model. The slope of the regression line was the estimate of the CFR at a 95% confidence interval. The study also reviewed the different approaches of the SEA countries in dealing with the pandemic. Findings - As of May 21, 2020, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines were the top three SEA countries with the highest record of COVID-19 infections. Brunei had one fatality, while Cambodia, Laos, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam had nil fatalities. Indonesia and the Philippines had the highest CFR with 6.66 and 6.59%, with R-2 of 97.95 and 99.43%, respectively. Singapore had the lowest CFR (0.068%) despite high infections. Originality/value - Increased CFR in Indonesia and the Philippines suggests that COVID-19 in the two countries is rising at an alarming rate. Strict implementation of shared management approaches to control the pandemic is seen to be closely associated with the decrease of CFR.","Puno, G. R.; Puno, R. C. C.; Maghuyop, I.

511315,"Spatio- temporal analysis of turbidity in ganga river in patna, bihar using sentinel-2 satellite data linked with covid-19 pandemic",2020,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define chronic diseases as conditions that last 1 year or more and that require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living, or both (1). Chronic diseases may be influenced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle and social behaviors, health care system factors, community influences, and environmental determinants of health (2). These risk factors often coexist and interact with each other. Therefore, a better understanding of determinants of chronic diseases such as tobacco use, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity stands to benefit from effective strategies for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary disease prevention and management in diverse global settings (3). Strategies to prevent and manage chronic disease outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have global commonalities (4-7). The impact of chronic diseases is disproportionately evident in Black and Brown communities (8,9). Chronic disease prevention and management typically focus on behavioral interventions such as healthy eating, increased physical activity, and cessation of unhealthy practices such as tobacco and alcohol use (10-15). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic added to the fact that chronic diseases disproportionately affect low-resource communities, where many Black and Brown populations live (16,17). COVID-19 demonstrated that chronic disease disparities actually present as preexisting conditions in Black and Brown communities, who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 outcomes. Although most of the articles in this Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) collection were published before the pandemic, the insights they present, combined with the racial and ethnic data on the burden of COVID-19 thus far, support this reality. Many researchers and public health practitioners often consider the need to sufficiently address the relationships between chronic diseases and social, behavioral, and community factors (18). Global lessons in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, therefore, can help researchers and practitioners benefit from the shared lessons and experience derived from research and interventions conducted in different parts of the world. There are more than 7 billion people worldwide, who speak diverse languages and who have different nationalities, identities, and health systems. Yet, if we share challenges and opportunities for chronic disease prevention and management, many of the global adversities to improving health and well-being can be ameliorated, which is the purpose of this collection. The authors in this collection share lessons that represent experiences in diverse contexts across countries and regions of the world.","Airhihenbuwa, Collins O; Tseng, Tung-Sung; Sutton, Victor D; Price, LeShawndra",Prev Chronic Dis,,199

We investigated if the radiotherapy-augmented Warburg effect helped myeloid cells acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype, resulting in limited treatment efficacy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Radiotherapy enhanced the tumor-promoting activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pancreatic cancer. Sustained increase in lactate secretion, resulting from the radiation-augmented Warburg effect, was responsible for the enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSCs after radiotherapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) was essential for tumor cell metabolism and lactate-regulated activation of MDSCs via the G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/HIF-1&#945;/STAT3 pathway. Blocking lactate production in tumor cells or deleting Hif-1&#945; in MDSCs reverted antitumor T cell responses and effectively inhibited tumor progression after radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Our investigation highlighted the importance of radiation-induced lactate in regulating the inhibitory immune microenvironment of PDAC. Targeting lactate derived from tumor cells and the HIF-1&#945; signaling in MDSCs may hold distinct promise for clinical therapies to alleviate radioresistance in PDAC.","Yang, Xuguang; Lu, Yun; Hang, Junjie; Zhang, Junfeng; Zhang, Tiening; Huo, Yanmiao; Liu, Jun; Lai, Songtao; Luo, Dawei; Wang, Liwei; Hua, Rong; Lin, Yuli",Cancer immunology res.

A total of 49 children (mean age 11.5 ± 5.12 years) confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the study, including 11 (22.4%) domestic cases and 38 (77.6%) imported cases. Nine (81.8%) local cases and 12 (31.6%) imported cases had a definitive epidemiological exposure. Twenty-eight (57.1%) were symptomatic and 21 (42.9%) were asymptomatic. Neither asymptomatic nor symptomatic cases progressed to severe diseases. The mean duration of viral shedding for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract was 14.1 ± 6.4 days in asymptomatic cases and 14.8 ± 8.4 days in symptomatic cases (P > 0.05). Forty-five (91.8%) cases had viral RNA detected in stool. The mean duration of viral shedding in stool was 28.1 ± 13.3 days in asymptomatic cases and 30.8 ± 18.6 days in symptomatic participants (P > 0.05). Children < 7 years shed viral RNA in stool for a longer duration than school-aged children (P < 0.05). Forty-three (87.8%) cases had seropositivity for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within 1-3 weeks after confirmation with infection. In conclusion, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may be common in children in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic wave. Asymptomatic cases shed viral RNA in a similar pattern as symptomatic cases do. It is of particular concern that asymptomatic individuals are potentially seed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and pose a challenge to disease control.","Cai, Jiehao; Wang, Xiangshi; Zhao, Jun; Ge, Yanling; Xu, Jin; Tian, He; Chang, Hailing; Xia, Aimei; Wang, Jiali; Zhang, Jinqiang; Wei, Zhongqiu; Li, Jingjing; Wang, Chuning; Wang, Jianshe; Zhu, Qirong; Zhai, Xiaowen; Zeng, Mei",Virol Sin,,199

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of hand hygiene have been extensively studied suggesting adequate knowledge but poor compliance. Similar data on aprons, mobile phone and stethoscope disinfection practices are lacking. This becomes an extensively important topic of discussion in current COVID-19 pandemic where inadequacy in hygiene practices is devastating. Aim: To study the knowledge, attitude, and infection prevention practices of HCWs aprons, electronic devices, stethoscopes, and hands. Methods: A cross sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted among HCWs of Medicine ward and ICU. Results: Sixty-six HCWs responded to the survey. Awareness that hands, aprons, mobile phones, stethoscopes could cause cross transmission and knowledge of correct practices was present in majority of the respondents. Hand hygiene was performed by 65.2% of the respondents before touching a patient and 54.5% after touching the patient surroundings while 13.6% performed only when it was visibly soiled. Mobile phones and stethoscopes were disinfected by 13.6 and 30.3% of the respondents after each patient encounter, respectively. Aprons were washed after using them at a stretch for a median duration of 5 days (1-30 days). Forgetfulness, lack of reinforcement, lack of time, inadequate awareness on standard disinfection practices and fear of damaging electronic devices from disinfectants use were reasons for poor compliance. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to spread awareness and formulate standard guidelines on disinfection practices especially for mobile phones, stethoscopes, and aprons in addition to reinforcing hand hygiene practices.","Kumar, Arvind; Keri, Vishakh C; Khan, Maroof Ahmad; Ranjan, Piyush; Rastogi, Neha; Sahu, Monalisa; Wig, Naveet",J Prev Med Hyg,,199

514068,Social Distancing and Cultural Bias: On the Spatiality of COVID-19,2020,"AIMS: In the absence of a commonly agreed dosing protocol based on pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations, the dose and treatment duration for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 disease currently vary across national guidelines and clinical study protocols. We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear, indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Efforts in this sense are a prerequisite for best benefit/risk balance.","Thémans, Pauline; Dauby, Nicolas; Schrooyen, Loïc; Lebout, Faustine; Delforge, Marc; Nasreddine, Rakan; Libois, Agnès; Payen, Marie-Christine; Konopnicki, Déborah; Wuillaume, Francoise; Lescrainier, Cecile; Verlinden, Veerle; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Hamdani, Jamila; Musuamba, Flora T",Br J Clin Pharmacol,,199

Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden. In an effort to improve epidemic control, Sweden has increased testing rates, implemented more restrictive prevention measures, and increased their intensive care unit bed capacity.","Yarmol-Matusiak, Erica A; Cipriano, Lauren E; Stranges, Saverio",Scand J Public Health,,199

Retrospective at the time of COVID-19],2020,"The unique cytokine signature of COVID-19 might provide clues to disease mechanisms and possible future therapies. Here, we propose a pathogenic model in which the alarmin cytokine, interleukin (IL)-33, is a key player in driving all stages of COVID-19 disease (ie, asymptomatic, mild-moderate, severe-critical, and chronic-fibrotic). In susceptible individuals, IL-33 release by damaged lower respiratory cells might induce dysregulated GATA-binding factor 3-expressing regulatory T cells, thereby breaking immune tolerance and eliciting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced autoinflammatory lung disease. Such disease might be initially sustained by IL-33-differentiated type-2 innate lymphoid cells and locally expanded Î³Î´ T cells. In severe COVID-19 cases, the IL-33-ST2 axis might act to expand the number of pathogenic granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-expressing T cells, dampen antiviral interferon responses, elicit hyperinflammation, and favour thromboses. In patients who survive severe COVID-19, IL-33 might drive pulmonary fibrosis by inducing myofibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We discuss the therapeutic implications of these hypothetical pathways, including use of therapies that target IL-33 (eg, anti-ST2), T helper 17-like Î³Î´ T cells, immune cell homing, and cytokine balance.","Zizzo, Gaetano; Cohen, Philip L",Lancet Rheumatol,,199

Methods: The study was based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 10 Israeli MWPWS who regularly visit various prostitution venues. The interviews were conducted between April and July 2020, between the first and the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Results: The findings focus on four major aspects of the participants' experiences: the participants' inability to pay for sex, the difficulties imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic to participants' sex-for-pay experiences, the positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their sex-for-pay experiences, and the insignificance of COVID-19 pandemic to their sex-for-pay experiences. Conclusions: I conclude that COVID-19 pandemic triggers various sexual, emotional, and gendered experiences for MWPWS. Accordingly, MWPWS may reevaluate their engagement in sex-for-pay, and their experiences of it may be reshaped in light of the pandemic. I discuss the findings' contribution to sexuality and masculinity studies, and the methodological possibilities that they raise for qualitative scholars studying social phenomena during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy Implications: The study highlights the significance of developing ad hoc prostitution policy that supports the individuals involved in the sex industry-both MWPWS and the women who are paid for sex-during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it suggests that prostitution policy should address the diverse experiences of MWPWS, beyond viewing them as merely offenders who should be punished, or re-educated.","Prior, Ayelet",Sex Res Social Policy,,199

517812,Academic ophthalmology in the post-COVID-19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, and clinical research has been promoted worldwide. We aimed to assess the clinical and methodological characteristics of treatment clinical trials that have been set forth as an early response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: First, we reviewed all registered clinical trials on COVID-19. The World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform and national trial registries were searched for COVID-19 trials through April 19th, 2020. For each record, independent researchers extracted interventions, participants, and methodological characteristics. Second, on September 14th, 2020 we evaluated the recruitment status and availability of the results of COVID-19 treatment trials previously identified. RESULTS: In April 2020, a total of 580 trials evaluating COVID-19 treatment were registered. Reporting quality was poor (core participant information was missing in 24.1 to 92.7%). Between 54.0 and 93.8% of the trials did not plan to include older people or those with a higher baseline risk. Most studies were randomised (67.9%), single-centre (58.3%), non-industry-funded (81.1%), to be conducted in China (47.6%), with a median duration of 184 days and a median sample size of 100 participants. Core endpoints (mortality, clinical status, and hospitalization length) were planned to be assessed in 5.2 to 13.1% of the trials. Five months later, 66 trials (11.4%) were reported as ""Completed"", and only 46 (7.9%) had public results available. One hundred forty-four of 580 trials (24.8%) either had the status ""Not yet recruiting"" or ""Suspended"", and 18 (3.1%) trials were prematurely stopped (""Terminated"" or ""Withdrawn"") The number of completed trials and trials with results are much lower than anticipated, considering the planned follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results raise concerns about the success of the initial global research effort on COVID-19 treatment. The clinical and methodological characteristics of early COVID-19 treatment trials limit their capability to produce clear answers to critical questions in the shortest possible time.","Mainoli, Beatrice; Machado, Tiago; Duarte, Gonçalo S; Prada, Luísa; Gonçalves, Nilza; Ferreira, Joaquim J; Costa, João",BMC Med Res Methodol,,199
517889,Navigating maternity service redesign in a global pandemic: A report from the field,2020,"INTRODUCTION: As lock-downs and social distancing measures around the world begin to ease after the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, discussions surrounding immunity and antibody testing are on the rise. This single-centre observational study reports data from a UK renal transplant centre with regards to seroprevalence amongst staff members. Members of staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) with Abbott International assays. Electronic records were accessed for PCR RNA and antibody results, with data anonymised by hospital number. IgA antibodies were not tested due to test kit availability during this period. 200 members of staff (25% male, 75% female, mean age 45.3 ± 12.0 years) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 24/200 (12.0%) positive. Most interestingly, 2/30 (6.6%) co-workers had positive nose/throat RNA PCR but negative antibody tests. This study demonstrates that frontline healthcare workers have a relatively low seroprevalence rate of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. To further evaluate this, larger patient populations, multicentre studies and different antibody assays are needed to better understand whether detection of antibodies is suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","Black, J T; Haroon, U; Barnes, S C; Mayaleh, S; Bagul, A",Transplant. int,,199

Radical surgical removal of the LVAD may distort the left ventricular cavity and thus affect its function, in addition to the associated risks of the operation. Innovative ways to deactivate the LVAD, relying mainly on vascular plugs implanting in the outflow graft, have been used. Few reports have shown the success of this method. In this case report, we review the story of a young patient with advanced heart failure who underwent LVAD implantation. After six months, there was a dramatic improvement of heart function that enabled successful deactivation of the device.","Alkattan, Hani N; Kjellman, Ulf; Selimovic, Nedim; Alomrani, Ahmed; Alghamdi, Abdullah A",J. card. surg,,199
520201,Convergence Innovation in the Digital Age and in the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis,2020,"In an effort to establish a consensus position on the ethical principles and ideals that should guide vaccine allocation during the Covid-19 pandemic, various organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, released sample allocation frameworks to help guide government entities charged with distributing vaccine doses. One area of agreement among these reports is that front line health care workers, especially those who come into regular contact with Covid-19 patients, ought to be afforded highest priority. But this convergence, though significant, raises questions concerning the ethics of vaccine distribution among those highest-priority health care workers: If a hospital has inadequate supply to vaccinate its entire workforce, which of its essential workers should it prioritize? In this paper, we begin with a general overview of ethical questions of vaccine administration before narrowing our focus to some of the most pressing theoretical and practical issues hospital officials must face in building justifiable and actionable frameworks for vaccinating their workers. We discuss and assess some potential ambitions of hospital allocation plans, concentrating especially on the goal of protecting the community from catastrophic loss of life. Finally, we consider some specific questions hospitals will encounter when developing distribution guidelines that aim to realize this aspiration.","Reis-Dennis, Samuel; Applewhite, Megan K",Immunol Invest,,199

In this context, leaders have faced a trade-off between imposing stringent measures to limit the contagion, and minimizing the short-run costs on their national economy, which could impact their electoral prospects. Leveraging on both the timing of elections and the constitutional term limits faced by leaders in presidential systems, we document how incumbents who can run for re-election implement less stringent restrictions when the election is closer in time. The effect is driven by measures more likely to have a negative economic impact. This shows how electoral concerns help explain the observed differences in the response to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic across different countries.","Pulejo, Massimo; Querubín, Pablo",J Public Econ,,199
520561,"COVID-19 and U.S. International Pandemic Preparedness, Prevention, and Response",2020,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question to this study? Do the sweat glands' maximum ion reabsorption rates increase following heat acclimation in healthy older individuals and is this associated with elevated aldosterone concentrations? What is the main finding and its importance? Sweat gland maximum ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across body sites, which occurred without any changes in aldosterone concentration following a controlled hyperthermic heat acclimation protocol in healthy older individuals. ABSTRACT: We examined whether the eccrine sweat glands' ion reabsorption rates improved following heat acclimation (HA) in older individuals. Ten healthy older adults (>65 years) completed a controlled hyperthermic (+0.9°C rectal temperature, Tre ) HA protocol for nine non-consecutive days. Participants completed a passive heat stress test (lower leg 42°C water submersion) pre-HA and post-HA to assess physiological regulation of sweat gland ion reabsorption at the chest, forearm and thigh. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate (SR). We explored the responses again after a 7-day decay. During passive heating, the Tb thresholds for sweat onset on the chest and forearm were lowered after HA (P < 0.05). However, sweat sensitivity (i.e. the slope), the SR at a given Tre and gross sweat loss did not improve after HA (P > 0.05). Any changes observed were lost during the decay. Pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis did not change after HA (P &#8805; 0.801). Maximum ion reabsorption rate was only enhanced at the chest (P = 0.001) despite unaltered aldosterone concentration after HA. The data suggest that this adaptation is lost after 7 days' decay. The HA protocol employed in the present study induced partial adaptive sudomotor responses. Eccrine sweat gland ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across the skin sites. It is likely that aldosterone secretion did not alter the chest sweat ion reabsorption rates observed in the older adults.","Gerrett, Nicola; Amano, Tatsuro; Inoue, Yoshimitsu; Kondo, Narihiko",Exp. physiol,,199

The management of patients with these diseases involves dental care to reduce systemic complications caused by odontogenic infections, and/or to treat oral manifestations of systemic comorbidities. In this regard, the dental care of these individuals must be guaranteed during the pandemic. Although a high risk of exposure to and catching of COVID-19 is expected to befall dental professionals, biosafety guidelines reduce the likelihood of infection. Thus, the current scenario poses challenges, and offers decision-making approaches and tools that facilitate the management of individuals with oral manifestations of chronic and/or critical diseases, using hospital-based services. This article presents an overview for hospital service providers who are at the forefront of COVID-19 care, including a secure protocol, and clinical guidelines based on the experience of the Hospital das Clínicas in Belo Horizonte, a public referral service, supported by the Brazilian National Health System.","SOUZA, Alessandra Figueiredo; ARRUDA, José Alcides Almeida de; COSTA, Fernanda Pereira Delgado; BEMQUERER, Larissa Marques; CASTRO, Wagner Henriques; CAMPOS, Felipe Eduardo Baires; KAKEHASI, Fabiana Maria; TRAVASSOS, Denise Vieira; SILVA, Tarcília Aparecida",Braz. oral res.

In dental clinics, there is a potential risk of cross-infection between dental health worker and patients. Therefore, new infection prevention measures have been recommended to minimize spread of COVID-19 in dental clinics. AIM: The aim of this study is to get an insight into the infection control measures followed by dentists and modification done in personal protective equipment (PPE) to combat spread of infection during COVID-19 in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional data using online Google survey. The sample included dentists working in either private or government from different regions in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Chi-square test was used to investigate the association between categorical variables (p &lt; 0.05) RESULTS: Seventy dentists included in the study of which 40% are working in Riyadh. Dental clinics are undertaken respiratory triage and reduce number of patients in waiting area (91% and 98%, respectively). Increased usage of PPE (head cap, face shield, and N95 mask) during the pandemic was observed in the study sample (p = 0.001). Working hours and number of patients were reduced during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Evidence shows that majority of dentists working in KSA are following recommended measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Some dentists modified their PPE during the pandemic. However, further research is required to investigate adherence to infection control measures by dentists.","Abdelrahim, R. K.; Abdoun, H. A. E.; Koppolu, P.; Swapna, L.

MethodsSera from 536 healthy adult blood donors collected in June -2021 were tested using a commercially available quantitative assay for the total antibodies including IgG against the spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2. Results399 (74.4%) of the donors tested positive for the antibodies of whom 69 (17.3%) were confirmed to have been previously infected, 245(61.4%) have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 123(30.8%) were neither diagnosed nor vaccinated. The seropositive donors were significantly more likely to have been vaccinated or previously infected. ConclusionThe crude seroprevalence rate of 74.4% among this group of healthy donors may be encouraging in terms of approaching herd immunity, however with predominance of the delta variant and the uncertainty regarding the required level of herd immunity this goal appears to be far from full achievement in Jordan.","Sughayer, Maher A.; Mansour, Asem; Nuirat, Abeer Al; Souan, Lina; Abdel-Razeq, Rashid; Siag, Mahmoud",,,199

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This review provides an overview of the proceedings of the symposium ""Tackling the Challenges of Nanomedicines: Are We ready?"" organized by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Hospital Pharmacy Section and Non-Biological Complex Drugs (NBCDs) Working Group at the 2019 FIP World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Debate centered on reasons underlying the current complex regulatory landscape for nanomedicines and their follow-on products (referred to as nanosimilars) and the pivotal role of hospital pharmacists in selecting, handling, and guiding usage of nanomedicines and nanosimilars. SUMMARY: The evaluation and use of nanomedicines are recognized among scientific, pharmaceutical, and regulatory bodies as complex. Interchangeability and substitutability of nanomedicines and nanosimilars are confounded by a lack of pharmaceutical and pharmacological equivalence, reflecting the inherent complex nature of these drug products and manufacturing processes. Consequences include implications for clinical safety and efficacy and, ultimately, comparability. Local regulatory approvals of some nanomedicines have occurred, but there is no standard to ensure streamlined evaluation and use of consistent measures of therapeutic equivalence of reference products and their nanosimilars. Hospital pharmacists are expected to be experts in the selection, handling, and substitution of nanomedicines and familiarize themselves with the limitations of current methods of assessing pharmaceutical and clinical equivalence of nanosimilars in order to ensure informed formulary decision-making and eventual patient benefit. CONCLUSION: Supportive guidance for pharmacists focusing on the substitutability and/or interchangeability of nanomedicines and their nanosimilars is needed. Current FIP guidance for pharmacists on therapeutic interchange and substitution should be extended to include nanomedicines and nanosimilars.","Hertig, John B; Shah, Vinod P; Flühmann, Beat; Mühlebach, Stefan; Stemer, Gunar; Surugue, Jacqueline; Moss, Rob; Di Francesco, Tiziana",Am. j. health system pharm,,199

523936,COVID-19 and its implications for research on work ability,2020,"Introduction: In the initial pandemic regional differences may have existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and patient outcomes in New York City. Whether these patterns were present in public hospitals is unknown. The aim of this brief study was to investigate COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system during the initial pandemic response. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on COVID-19 admissions in New York City public hospitals during the exponential phase of the pandemic. All data were collected from an integrated electronic medical records system (Epic Health Systems, Verona, WI). Overall, 5,422 patients with at least one admission each for COVID-19 were reviewed, with a study of demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, BMI), pregnancy status, comorbidities, facility activity, and outcomes. Data related to hospitalization and mortality trends were also collected from City of New York website. These data often involved more than one facility and/or service line resulting in more location or treatment facility counts than patients due to utilization of services at more than one location and transfers between locations and facilities. Results: Higher mortality was associated with increasing age with the highest death rate (51.9%) noted in the age group >75 years (OR 7.88, 95%CI 6.32-10.08). Comorbidities with higher mortality included diabetes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.33-1.70), hypertension (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44-1.83), cardiovascular conditions (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.47-1.87), COPD (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.50). It was deduced that 20% of all New York City COVID-19 positive admissions were in public health system during this timeframe. A high proportion of admissions (21.26%) and deaths (19.93%) were at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. Bellevue and Metropolitan Hospitals had the lowest number of deaths, both in borough of Manhattan. Mortality in public hospitals in Brooklyn was 29.9%, Queens 28.1%, Manhattan 20.4%. Conclusion: Significant variations existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system in New York City during the initial pandemic. Although outcomes are worse with older age and those with comorbidities, variations in hospitals and boroughs outside of Manhattan are targets to investigate and strategize efforts.","Dinesh, Anant; Mallick, Taha; Arreglado, Tatiana M; Altonen, Brian L; Engdahl, Ryan",Front Public Health,,199

COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which might attack not only the respiratory system, but also the other important organs, including the heart. It was reported that COVID-19 patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases would have a higher mortality. Meanwhile, elevated troponin levels were frequently observed in COVID-19 cases. Besides the comprehensive treatments for COVID-19, as a cardiologist, we should also remain vigilant about the cardiac injuries, especially those with severe emergent cardiovascular symptoms.","Chen, Chen; Li, Huihui; Hang, Weijian; Wang, Dao Wen",J Mol Cell Cardiol,,199

590303,Natural resources commodity prices volatility and economic performance: Evidence from China pre and post COVID-19,2021-09-09,"Background: COVID-19 transmission was significant among Healthcare workers worldwide. In March 2020, Qatar started reporting numbers of COVID-19 positive cases among workers in Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC). The study estimates the burden of the aforementioned infections and examines the demographic characteristics associated with the recorded positivity rates. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among Primary healthcare workers between March 1st and October 31st, 2020. The study examined the positivity rate of the different types of Primary healthcare workers and, analyzed the demographic characteristics of the infected persons. Results: 1,048 (87.4%) of the infected Health Care Workers (HCWs) belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC Health Centers (HCs) Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID dedicated HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p = 0.26). Storekeepers, engineering & maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, support staff, and security staff (outsourced non-clinical positions) had the highest positivity rates, 100, 67.2, 47.1, 32.4, and 29.5% respectively. Conclusion: The elevated risk of infection among outsourced non-clinical healthcare workers can be explained by environmental factors such as living conditions. Furthermore, better containment within clinical healthcare workers can be attributed to strict safety training and compliance with preventative measures which is recommended to be implemented across all settings.","Al-Kuwari, Mohamed Ghaith; AbdulMalik, Mariam Ali; Al-Nuaimi, Asma Ali; Abdulmajeed, Jazeel; Al-Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Semaan, Sandy; Kandy, Mujeeb",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.679254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095077/,199
590629,‘Herbal Immune Booster-Induced Liver Injury in the COVID-19 Pandemic – A cautious interpretation is desired before any generalization is attempted’,2021-08-14,"COVID-19 became pandemic in 2020 and causes higher mortality in males (M) than females (F) and among older people. In some countries, like Belgium, more than half of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected deaths occurring in spring 2020 concerned residents of care homes. The high incidence in this population is certainly linked to its peculiar age structure but could also result from its poorer general health condition and/or from a higher contamination through the staff of care homes, while protection equipment and testing capacity were initially limited. To address these issues, we used data from Wallonia (Belgium) to characterize the distribution of death rates among care home institutions, to compare the dynamics of deaths in and outside care homes, and to analyse how age and sex affected COVID-19 death rates inside and outside care homes. We also used annual death rates as a proxy for the health condition of each population. We found that: (1) COVID-19 death rate per institution varied widely from 0{per thousand} to 340{per thousand} (mean 43{per thousand}) and increased both with the size of the institution (number of beds) and with the importance of medical care provided. (2) 65% of COVID-19 deaths in Wallonia concerned residents of care homes where the outbreak started after but at a faster pace than the outbreak seen in the external population. (3) The impact of age on both annual and COVID-19 mortality closely follows exponential laws (i.e. Gompertz law) but mortality was much higher for the population living in care homes where the age effect was lower (mortality rate doubling every 20 years of age increment in care homes, 6 years outside them). (4) Both within and outside care homes, the ratio of M/F death rates was 1.6 for annual mortality but reached 2.0 for COVID-19 mortality, a ratio consistent among both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths. (5) When reported to the annual death rate per sex and age, the COVID-19 relative mortality was little affected by age and reached 24% (M) and 18% (F) of their respective annual rate in nursing homes, while these percentages reduced to 10% (M) and 9% (F) in homes for elderly people (with less medical assistance), and to 5% (M) and 4% (F) outside of care homes. In conclusion, a c. 130x higher COVID-19 mortality rate found in care homes compared to the outside population can be attributed to the near multiplicative combination of: (1) a 11x higher mortality due to the old age of its residents, (2) a 3.8x higher mortality due to the low average health condition of its residents, and (3) probably a 3.5x higher infection rate (1.6x in homes for elderly people) due to the transmission by its staff, a problem more acute in large institutions. Our results highlight that nursing home residents should be treated as a very specific population, both for epidemiological studies and to take preventive measures, due to their extreme vulnerability to COVID-19.","Hardy, O.

591984,"Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada",2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Italy surpassed 1.5 million confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections on November 26, as its death toll rose rapidly in the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak which is a heavy burden on hospitals. Therefore, it is necessary to forecast and early warn the potential outbreak of COVID-19 in the future, which facilitates the timely implementation of appropriate control measures. However, real-time prediction of COVID-19 transmission and outbreaks is usually challenging because of its complexity intertwining both biological systems and social systems. METHODS: By mining the dynamical information from region networks and the short-term time series data, we developed a data-driven model, the minimum-spanning-tree-based dynamical network marker (MST-DNM), to quantitatively analyze and monitor the dynamical process of COVID-19 spreading. Specifically, we collected the historical information of daily cases caused by COVID-19 infection in Italy from February 24, 2020 to November 28, 2020. When applied to the region network of Italy, the MST-DNM model has the ability to monitor the whole process of COVID-19 transmission and successfully identify the early-warning signals. The interpretability and practical significance of our model are explained in detail in this study. RESULTS: The study on the dynamical changes of Italian region networks reveals the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission at the network level. It is noteworthy that the driving force of MST-DNM only relies on small samples rather than years of time series data. Therefore, it is of great potential in public surveillance for emerging infectious diseases.","Dong, Min; Zhang, Xuhang; Yang, Kun; Liu, Rui; Chen, Pei",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249495/,199

This swift achievement has generated excitement and arrives at a time of great need, as the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to rapidly increase. Two vaccines are currently approved for full use, both built on mRNA and lipid nanotechnology platforms, a success story of mRNA technology 20 years in the making. For patients with cancer, questions arise around the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in the setting of immune alterations engendered by their malignancy and/or therapies. We summarize the current data on leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and vaccination of patients undergoing immunomodulatory cancer treatments. Most current cancer therapeutics should not prevent the generation of protective immunity.

This quasi-experimental study compared hourly fine (PM(2.5)) and coarse (PM(10)) particulate matter measurements from six air monitors (three beta attenuation monitors; three low-cost sensors) in commercial and low/middle-income residential areas of Temuco, Chile between 2019 and 2020. The potential impact of varying annual meterological conditions on air quality was also assessed. During COVID-19 lockdown, average monthly ambient PM(2.5) concentrations in a commercial and middle-income residential neighborhood of Temuco were up to 50% higher (from 12 to 18 μg/m(3)) and 59% higher (from 22 to 35 μg/m(3)) than 2019 levels, respectively. Conversely, PM(2.5) levels decreased by up to 52% (from 43 to 21 μg/m(3)) in low-income areas. The fine fraction of PM(10) in April 2020 was 48% higher than in April 2017–2019 (from 50% to 74%) in a commercial area. These changes did not appear to result from meterological differences between years. During COVID-19 lockdown, higher outdoor PM(2.5) pollution from wood heating existed in more affluent areas of Temuco, while PM(2.5) concentrations declined among poorer households refraining from wood heating. To reduce air pollution and energy poverty in south-central Chile, affordability of clean heating fuels (e.g. electricity) should be a policy priority.","Martinez-Soto, Aner; Avendaño Vera, Constanza C.; Boso, Alex; Hofflinger, Alvaro; Shupler, Matthew",Energy Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511701/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421521004419?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301421521004419,199
595368,Adapting the reverse pyramid airplane boarding method for social distancing in times of COVID-19,2020-11-04,"Improving the quality of health care across a nation is complex and hard. Countries often rely on multiple single national level programmes to make progress. But the key is to use a framework to develop a balanced overall strategy, and evaluate the main elements continuously and over time. Achieving that requires having a critical mass of leaders who collectively can see the bigger picture now, envision a roadmap for the future to chart an intelligent course, and course correct regularly. This is a long-term agenda requiring commitment, careful stewardship, different perspectives, trust, and the building of knowledge and experience over time. It is also almost completely at odds with much current policymaking which is short term, reactive and demands hard results. Many countries are making progress. But the rapid introduction of new types of care during the COVID 19 pandemic, such as online and digital, the use of new technologies which could soon revolutionalise the way care is delivered, experienced and evaluated, and the huge pressures on spending on health care in future mean we will have to do better. Achieving system-wide quality of care requires having a critical mass of leaders who collectively can see the bigger picture now, envision a roadmap for the future to chart a balanced intelligent course. For the Israeli health system, the recent IJHPR article by Dreiher et al. will help, but it will be important, in the future, to analyse how Israel measures up on the framework outlined above.

599387,Mentoring in the Time of COVID‐19: An Analysis of Online Focus Groups with Mentors to Youth,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine is among the most effective antipsychotic used for treatment resistant schizophrenia. Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. In March 2020, at the start of the Coronavirus -19 pandemic, clinicians raised concerns regarding continuation of antipsychotic treatment, and specifically of clozapine, in patients with coronavirus disease. We aimed here at providing a short report focusing on the association between neutropenia and clozapine in a case series of psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. PATIENTS & METHODS: We retrospectively inspected data of 10 patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and July 2020; selection was based on their COVID-19 positive PCR test. We used a linear regression model to estimate whether there was a significant drop in the neutrophil count during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis was done in R using a linear regression to the origin. RESULTS: Data were collected on 10 patients, of which 7 were males. During COVID-19 infection, neutrophils’ count (ANC) 4.13 × 109/l (SD = 2.70) from a baseline value of 5.2 × 109/l (SD = 2.24). The mean relative reduction in ANC was -0.2729 (SD = 0.1666). The beta value of 0.8377 obtained with the linear regression showed that ANC values during SARS-CoV-2 infection were 83.77% of the baseline ANC showing that within the two time points there was a decrease in ANC of 16.23%. The linear regression had a pvalue = 8.96 x 10-8 and an adjusted R2 of 95.94% which shows that the variability of the data is very well explained by the model. We also compared baseline ANC with ANC values approximately a month after resolution of the infection and results indicate that ANC values return to a 95% of baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should bear in mind that a significant drop in neutrophils’ count may occur in patients taking clozapine and affected from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and that this drop is only transitory","Bonaccorso, Stefania; Ricciardi, Angelo; Ouabbou, Sophie; Theleritis, Christos; Ross-Michealides, Arabella; Metastasio, Antonio; Stewart, Neil; Mohammed, Marwa; Schifano, Fabrizio",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527097/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354621000156?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354621000156,199

Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis. C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis. DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice. Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival. The DN T cells with production of IFN-γ and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8(+) T cells via the Fas/FasL dependent pathway. The delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells may lead to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis. In short, our study identified DN T cells contributing to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis in C3H/HeJ mice, which provides a rationale for modulating DN T cells for the management of viral hepatitis.","Wang, Xiaojing; Yan, Weiming; Lu, Yulei; Chen, Tao; Sun, Ying; Qin, Xiaomin; Zhang, Jiangguo; Han, Meifang; Guo, Wei; Wang, Hongwu; Wu, Di; Xi, Dong; Luo, Xiaoping; Ning, Qin",Cell Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874912002043; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2012.11.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23261832/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874912002043,199

We observed 55 miRNAs that were altered in COVID-19 patients during early-stage disease, with the inflammatory miR-31-5p the most strongly upregulated. Supervised machine learning analysis revealed that a three-miRNA signature (miR-423-5p, miR-23a-3p and miR-195-5p) independently classified COVID-19 cases with an accuracy of 99.9%. In a ferret COVID-19 model, the three-miRNA signature again detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with 99.7% accuracy, and distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from influenza A (H1N1) infection and healthy controls with 95% accuracy.

As a compliment to traditional pharmacovigilance and clinical studies, evidence to comprehensively assess COVID- 19 vaccine safety in pregnancy will need to be generated through observational epidemiologic studies in large populations. However, there are several unique methodological challenges that face observational assessments of vaccination during pregnancy, some of which may be more pronounced for COVID-19 studies. In this contribution, we discuss the most critical study design, data collection, and analytical issues likely to arise. We offer brief guidance to optimize the quality of such studies to ensure their maximum value for informing public health decision-making.","Fell, Deshayne B.; Dimitris, Michelle C.; Hutcheon, Jennifer A.; Ortiz, Justin R.; Platt, Robert W.; Regan, Annette K.; Savitz, David A.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715900/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.070; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21002619?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21002619,199
601525,Trust Buffers Against Reduced Life Satisfaction When Faced With Financial Crisis,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak lead to nationwide lockdown in Finland on the March 16th, 2020. Previous data regarding to the patient load in the emergency departments during pandemics is scarce. Our aim is to describe the effect of national lockdown and social distancing on the number and reasons for emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions in three large volume hospitals prior to and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Finland. METHODS: Data for this register-based retrospective cohort study were collected from three large ED’s in Finland, covering 1/6 of the Finnish population. All patients visiting ED’s six weeks before and six weeks after the lockdown were included. Pediatric and gynecological patients were excluded. Numbers and reasons for ED visits and inpatient admissions were collected. Corresponding time period in 2019 was used as reference. RESULTS: A total of 40,653 ED visits and 12,226 inpatient admissions were analyzed. The total number of ED visits decreased 16% after the lockdown, whereas the number of inpatient admissions decreased 15% (p < 0.001). This change in inpatient admissions was similar in all participating hospitals. Visits due to back or limb pain decreased 31% and infectious diseases 28%. The visit rate and inpatient admissions due to acute myocardial infarction and strokes remained stable throughout the study period. Interestingly, the rate of inpatient admissions due to psychiatric diagnoses remained unchanged, although the ED visit rate decreased by 19%. The number of ED visits (n = 282) and inpatient admissions (n = 55) due to COVID-19 remained low in the participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ED visits and inpatient admissions prior to and during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak were unpredictable, and our results may help hospitals and especially ED’s focus their resources better. Surprisingly, there was a major decrease in the rate of ED visits due to back or limb pain and not so surprisingly in infectious diseases. Rates of acute myocardial infarctions and cerebral strokes remained stable. In summary, stabile resources for the treatment of patients with severe diseases will be needed in hospitals and ED’s.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Ponkilainen, Ville T.; Launonen, Antti P.; Reito, Aleksi; Hevonkorpi, Teemu P.; Paloneva, Juha; Mattila, Ville M.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-020-00810-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276799/,199

Material and MethodsA cohort of previously RT-PCR+ve (detected by nasopharyngeal swab during the acute phase), male convalescent patients, all with mild symptoms, were enrolled on serial blood sample collection for evaluation of longitudinal nAb titers and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA). Nabs were detected by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-based VNT), carried out with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MT350282) ResultsA total of 78 male volunteers provided 316 samples, spanning a total of 4820 days of study. Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers [â¥]160, after a median of 100 days after the onset of disease, there was a high probability of sustaining nAB titers [â¥]160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was [â¥]1280, weight [â¥] 90kg or BMI classified as overweight or obese, evidenced by Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox hazard regression. There was no correlation between ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers. High IgG anti-NP (S/CO [â¥]5.0) is a good surrogate for detecting nAB [â¥]160, defined by ROC curve (sensitivity = 90.5%; CI95% 84.5-94.7%) ConclusionSelection of CCP donors for multiple collections based on initial high nAb titers ([â¥]1280) or overweight/obese (BMI) provides a simple strategy to achieve higher quality in CCP programs. High IgG anti-NP levels can also be used as surrogate markers for high nAb screening.","Wendel, Silvano; Fontao-Wendel, Rita; Fachini, Roberta M; Candelaria, Gabriela; Scuracchio, Patricia; Achkar, Ruth; Brito, Mayra A; Reis, Luiz Fernando L; Camargo, Anamaria; Amano, Mariane T; Machado, Rafael RG; Araujo, Danielle; Soares, Camila B; Durigon, Edison",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.20230391; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230391v1?rss=1,199

Of the 8 small- to large-scale interventions, 6 were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and the remaining 2 in South Asia. All the interventions were done in rural settings; the majority involved sanitation and hygiene deliverables along with the nutrition strategies, such as distribution of nutrition supplements. In assessing effectiveness, no significant improvements were seen in growth indicators; reduction in diarrheal rate among children was also not universal across interventions. Further strengthening of WASH, especially an improvement in “W”, or water access, is warranted to ensure uptake of sanitation and hygiene behaviors and prevent the fecal–oral route among children.

However, research examining the mental health effects of maternity harassment is lacking. We aimed to examine the association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy in Japan. METHODS: A cross‐sectional Internet survey was conducted on 359 pregnant employees (including women who were working at the time their pregnancy was confirmed) from May 22 to May 31, 2020, during which time a COVID‐19 state of emergency was declared. Maternity harassment was defined as being subjected to any of the 16 adverse treatments prohibited by national guidelines. Depression was defined as a score of ≥9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Japanese version). Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% of the pregnant employees had experienced maternity harassment by supervisors and/or colleagues. After adjusting for demographics, pregnancy status, work status, and fear of COVID‐19, pregnant employees who experienced maternity harassment were more likely to have depression than those who did not (odds ratio 2.48, 95% confidential interval 1.34‐4.60). This association was not influenced by whether they were teleworking or not as a COVID‐19 measure. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of pregnant employees experienced maternity harassment and had a higher prevalence of depression than those who did not. Being physically away from the office through teleworking may not reduce the effect of maternal harassment on depression. To protect the mental health and employment of pregnant women, employers should comply with the laws and take measures to prevent maternity harassment.","Kachi, Yuko; Fujiwara, Takeo; Eguchi, Hisashi; Inoue, Akiomi; Baba, Sachiko; Ohta, Hiroshi; Tsutsumi, Akizumi",J Occup Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470006/; https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12196,199

METHODS: Data on all cancer patients with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) at Guy’s Cancer Centre and King’s College Hospital between 29 February and 31 July 2020 was used. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify which factors were associated with COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: Three hundred and six SARS-CoV-2-positive cancer patients were included. Seventy-one had mild/moderate and 29% had severe COVID-19. Seventy-two patients died of COVID-19 (24%), of whom 35 died <7 days. Male sex [hazard ratio (HR): 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15–3.38)], Asian ethnicity [3.42 (1. 59–7.35)], haematological cancer [2.03 (1.16–3.56)] and a cancer diagnosis for >2–5 years [2.81 (1.41–5.59)] or ≥5 years were associated with an increased mortality. Age >60 years and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) were also associated with COVID-19 death. Haematological cancer, a longer-established cancer diagnosis, dyspnoea at diagnosis and raised CRP were indicative of early COVID-19-related death in cancer patients (<7 days from diagnosis). CONCLUSIONS: Findings further substantiate evidence for increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for male and Asian cancer patients, and those with haematological malignancies or a cancer diagnosis >2 years. These factors should be accounted for when making clinical decisions for cancer patients.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte L.; Shah, Vallari; Ko, Thinzar Ko; Palmer, Kieran; Sylva, Rushan; George, Gincy; Monroy-Iglesias, Maria J.; Patten, Piers; Ceesay, Muhammed Mansour; Benjamin, Reuben; Potter, Victoria; Pagliuca, Antonio; Papa, Sophie; Irshad, Sheeba; Ross, Paul; Spicer, James; Kordasti, Shahram; Crawley, Danielle; Wylie, Harriet; Cahill, Fidelma; Haire, Anna; Zaki, Kamarul; Sita-Lumsden, Ailsa; Josephs, Debra; Enting, Deborah; Swampillai, Angela; Sawyer, Elinor; D’Souza, Andrea; Gomberg, Simon; Harrison, Claire; Fields, Paul; Wrench, David; Rigg, Anne; Sullivan, Richard; Kulasekararaj, Austin; Dolly, Saoirse; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",Br J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400804/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-021-01500-z,199

High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) increased by TGF-β1 is involved in the induction of nasal inflammation and injury in patients with allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. In the present study, to investigate how HMGB1 affects the barrier of normal human nasal epithelial cells, 2D and 2.5D Matrigel culture of primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells were pretreated with TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor EW-7197 before treatment with HMGB1. Knockdown of angulin-1/LSR downregulated the epithelial barrier. Treatment with EW-7197 decreased angulin-1/LSR and concentrated the expression at tTJs from bTJs and increased the epithelial barrier. Treatment with a binder to angulin-1/LSR angubindin-1 decreased angulin-1/LSR and the epithelial barrier. Treatment with HMGB1 decreased angulin-1/LSR and the epithelial barrier. In 2.5D Matrigel culture, treatment with HMGB1 induced permeability of FITC-dextran (FD-4) into the lumen. Pretreatment with EW-7197 prevented the effects of HMGB1. HMGB1 disrupted the angulin-1/LSR-dependent epithelial permeability barriers of HNECs via TGF-β signaling in HNECs.","Ohwada, Kizuku; Konno, Takumi; Kohno, Takayuki; Nakano, Masaya; Ohkuni, Tsuyoshi; Miyata, Ryo; Kakuki, Takuya; Kondoh, Masuo; Takano, Kenichi; Kojima, Takashi",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445093/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168390,199

One of the striking features of this pandemic is the considerable variation in disease presentation and severity amongst patients, ethnic groups, and countries. This variation can be partially explained by differences in population density, demographic factors (age, sex) and comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus).

Among emerging technologies, distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, is a powerful business enhancer whose potential can disrupt projects, AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) firms, and construction supply chain, and in a broader sense, the whole construction industry. This technology has not reached the plateau of productivity due to several barriers and challenges. Previous studies have started to investigate the barriers to implementing DLT in various sectors and segmentations. However, we still need further surveys in the construction industry. This study evaluates the applicability of identified challenges and barriers based on a sustainability perspective. Precisely, we will answer which challenges need to be addressed for the sustainability of the construction industry. To meet the research objective, the ordinal priority approach (OPA) in multiple attributes decision-making (MADM) was utilized. This novel method determines the weight of sustainability attributes and barriers simultaneously. The results show that DLT implementation needs (i) infrastructure for data management, (ii) advanced applications and archetypes, and (iii) customers’ demand, interest, and tendency, and (iv) taxation and reporting.

Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations.

A one-step RT-ddPCR multiplex assay was developed for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 E, RdRp and N viral RNA, and human Rpp30 DNA and GUSB mRNA, for internal nucleic acid (NA) extraction and RT-PCR control. Dilution series of viral RNA transcripts were prepared in water and total NA extract of Covid-19-negative patients. As reference assay, an E-GUSB duplex RT-PCR was used. GUSB mRNA detection was used to set validity criteria to assure viral RNA and RT-PCR assay quality and to enable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In a background of at least 100 GUSB mRNA copies, 5 copies of viral RNA are reliably detectable and 10 copies viral RNA copies are reliably quantifiable. It was found that assay sensitivity of the RT-ddPCR was not affected by the total NA background while assay sensitivity of the gold standard RT-PCR assay is drastically decreased when SARS-CoV-2 copies were detected in a background of total NA extract compared with water. The present study describes a robust and sensitive one-step ddRT-PCR multiplex assay for reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. By determining the fractional abundance of viral RNA with respect to a human housekeeping gene, viral loads from different samples can be compared, what could be used to investigate the infectiveness and to monitor Covid-19 patients.","de Kock, Remco; Baselmans, Mieke; Scharnhorst, Volkher; Deiman, Birgit",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-020-04076-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104899/,199

We compared the clinical characteristics between younger patients (aged <60 years) and older patients (aged ≥60 years) with COVID-19, detected the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital stay, and examined the treatments commonly used with a particular focus on antiviral therapies. Methods : This retrospective study was conducted at the West Campus, Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The sample consisted of 123 patients admitted to the hospital between February 9, 2020, and March 3, 2020. The data related to the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment were analyzed to identify discrepancies between younger and older patients and those with and without primary diseases. The risk factors that contribute to a prolonged hospital stay were subsequently identified. Results : Patients aged ≥60 years required longer hospital stay than younger patients (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001, respectively). The percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in older patients and those with primary diseases (P = 0.016 and P = 0.042, respectively). The findings revealed that the risk factors that contributed to the length of hospital stay were age, the number of days of illness before hospitalization, white blood cell (WBC) count and albumin levels at admission, a neutrophil fraction at discharge, and antibiotic treatment. Analysis using a model that consisted of the above five risk factors for predicting prolonged hospital stay (i.e., >14 days) yielded an area under the ROC (AuROC) curve of 0.716. Antiviral and antibiotic treatments were administered to 97.6% and 39.0% of patients, respectively. The antiviral drugs most commonly administered were traditional Chinese medicine (83.7%) and arbidol (75.6%). Conclusions : In this study, older patients and those with primary diseases were at a higher risk of worse clinical manifestations. The physicians who treat the patients should pay close attention to the risk factors that contribute to the length of hospital stay, which could be used for predicting prolonged hospital stay. Traditional Chinese medicine and arbidol were the most frequently used antiviral drugs.

618050,Global economic impacts of COVID-19 lockdown measures stand out in high-frequency shipping data,2021-04-14,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, pandemic-specific stressors have potentiated the—already severe—stress load across the world. However, stress is more than an adverse state, and chronic exposure is causally involved in the development of mental and physical disease. We ask the question whether resilience and the Big Five personality traits predict the biological stress response to the first lockdown in Germany. In a prospective, longitudinal, observational study, N = 80 adult volunteers completed an internet-based survey prior to the first Covid-19-related fatality in Germany (T0), during the first lockdown period (T1), and during the subsequent period of contact restrictions (T2). Hair strands for the assessment of systemic cortisol and cortisone levels were collected at T2. Higher neuroticism predicted higher hair cortisol, cortisone and subjective stress levels. Higher extraversion predicted higher hair cortisone levels. Resilience showed no effects on subjective or physiological stress markers. Our study provides longitudinal evidence that neuroticism and extraversion have predictive utility for the accumulation of biological stress over the course of the pandemic. While in pre-pandemic times individuals high in neuroticism are typically at risk for worse health outcomes, extraverted individuals tend to be protected. We conclude that, in the pandemic context, we cannot simply generalize from pre-pandemic knowledge. Neurotic individuals may currently suffer due to their general emotional lability. Extraverted individuals may primarily be socially stressed. Individualized stress management programs need to be developed, and offered in a lockdown-friendly format, to minimize the stress burden caused by Covid-19 or future pandemics and to protect the most severely affected individuals from the development of stress-associated disease.","Engert, Veronika; Blasberg, Jost U.; Köhne, Sophie; Strauss, Bernhard; Rosendahl, Jenny",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01569-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455419/,199

The COVID19 economic shock led to rapid public policy responses across the globe to lessen the impact of mass unemployment, potentially shifting community perceptions of individuals who are out of work and rely on government income support. We used a repeated cross-sections design to study change in stigma tied to unemployment and benefit receipt in a pre-existing pre-COVID19 sample (n = 260) and a sample collected during COVID19 pandemic (n = 670) by using a vignette-based experiment. Participants rated attributes of characters who were described as being employed, working poor, unemployed or receiving unemployment benefits. The results show that compared to employed characters, unemployed characters were rated substantially less favorably at both time points on their employability and personality traits. The difference in perceptions of the employed and unemployed was, however, attenuated during COVID19 with benefit recipients perceived as more employable and more Conscientious than pre-pandemic. These results add to knowledge about the determinants of welfare stigma highlighting the impact of the global economic and health crisis on perception of others.","Suomi, Aino; Schofield, Timothy P.; Butterworth, Peter",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.594837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178089/,199

Is it your time after COVID-19?",2021,"BACKGROUND: Intrahospital transfers have become more common as hospital staff balance patient needs with bed availability. However, this may leave patients more vulnerable to potential pathogen transmission routes via increased exposure to contaminated surfaces and contacts with individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the association between the number of intrahospital transfers undergone during a hospital spell and the development of a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). METHODS: A retrospective case–control study was conducted using data extracted from electronic health records and microbiology cultures of non-elective, medical admissions to a large urban hospital network which consists of three hospital sites between 2015 and 2018 (n=24 240). As elderly patients comprise a large proportion of hospital users and are a high-risk population for HAIs, the analysis focused on those aged 65 years or over. Logistic regression was conducted to obtain the OR for developing an HAI as a function of intrahospital transfers until onset of HAI for cases, or hospital discharge for controls, while controlling for age, gender, time at risk, Elixhauser comorbidities, hospital site of admission, specialty of the dominant healthcare professional providing care, intensive care admission, total number of procedures and discharge destination. RESULTS: Of the 24 240 spells, 2877 cases were included in the analysis. 72.2% of spells contained at least one intrahospital transfer. On multivariable analysis, each additional intrahospital transfer increased the odds of acquiring an HAI by 9% (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: Intrahospital transfers are associated with increased odds of developing an HAI. Strategies for minimising intrahospital transfers should be considered, and further research is needed to identify unnecessary transfers. Their reduction may diminish spread of contagious pathogens in the hospital environment.","Boncea, Emanuela Estera; Expert, Paul; Honeyford, Kate; Kinderlerer, Anne; Mitchell, Colin; Cooke, Graham S; Mercuri, Luca; Costelloe, Céire E",BMJ Qual Saf,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495288/,199

The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851–2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437–0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than [Formula: see text]. Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively.

Understanding which parameters influenced this drop and how to minimize the number of hospitalizations and overall positive cases is urgently needed. In this study we conducted an observational analysis which included COVID-19 data with over 12,000,000 PCR tests from 250 cities in Israel. In addition, we performed a simulation of different vaccination campaigns to find the optimal policy. Our analysis revealed that cities with younger populations reached a decrease in new cases when a lower percentage of their residents were immunized, showing that median age is a crucial parameter effecting overall immunity, while other parameters appeared to be insignificant. This variance between cities is explained by recalculating the immunized population and multiplying each individual by a factor symbolizing the impact of their age on the spread on the virus. This factor is easily calculated from historical data of positive cases per age. The simulation proves that prioritizing different age groups or changing the rate of vaccinations drastically effects the overall hospitalizations and positive cases.","ross, c.; spector, o.; Tsadok, M.

626441,Trends and Challenges of Telehealth in an Academic Institution: The Unforeseen Benefits of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic,2020-07-22,"SARS-CoV-2 fine-tunes the interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral responses, which play a key role in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression. Indeed, critically ill patients show an impaired type I IFN response accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, responsible for cell and tissue damage and associated multi-organ failure. Here, the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells was investigated by interrogating an in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based experimental model. We found that, even in absence of a productive viral replication, the virus mediates a vigorous TLR7/8-dependent production of both type I and III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known to contribute to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed how virus-induced type I IFN secreted by PBMC enhances anti-viral response in infected lung epithelial cells, thus, inhibiting viral replication. This type I IFN was released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) via an ACE-2-indipendent but Neuropilin-1-dependent mechanism. Viral sensing regulates pDC phenotype by inducing cell surface expression of PD-L1 marker, a feature of type I IFN producing cells. Coherently to what observed in vitro, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects displayed a similar pDC phenotype associated to a very high serum type I IFN level and induction of anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes in PBMC. Conversely, hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 display very low frequency of circulating pDC with an inflammatory phenotype and high levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. This study further shed light on the early events resulting from the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells occurring in vitro and confirmed ex vivo. These observations can improve our understanding on the contribution of pDC/type I IFN axis in the regulation of the anti-viral state in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients.","Severa, Martina; Diotti, Roberta A.; Etna, Marilena P.; Rizzo, Fabiana; Fiore, Stefano; Ricci, Daniela; Iannetta, Marco; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Lodi, Alessandra; Mancini, Nicasio; Criscuolo, Elena; Clementi, Massimo; Andreoni, Massimo; Balducci, Stefano; Barzon, Luisa; Stefanelli, Paola; Clementi, Nicola; Coccia, Eliana M.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473805/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009878,199

Excessive COVID-19-related information caused substantial mental distress among the public. Although most studies focused on the impact of information on individuals during the pandemic, they usually focused on information from internet sources, and few studies compared the impacts between different information sources. We examine the sociodemographic profiles of participants receiving different information sources and the impact of various COVID-19-related information sources on public worry. Methods A cross-sectional online survey with a total of 2007 participants aged 20 years and above recruited anonymously was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sociodemographic data, frequencies at which participants received COVID-19-related information, the information sources (e.g., traditional media, interpersonal information exchange, and academic courses), and the levels of past, current, and anticipated worry about COVID-19 were assessed. Results The most common sources of COVID-19-related information were internet media (80.52%), traditional media (52.62%), family members (24.36%), coworkers (23.57%), friends (21.08%), academic courses (20.18%), and medical staff (19.03%). We found that the COVID-19-related information from traditional media, internet media, and friends was associated with higher current worry (the unstandardized regression coefficient, B, ranged from 0.27 to 0.30), and the information from friends was associated with higher past worry (B was 0.18). In contrast, participants who received information from academic courses had lower past worry and anticipated worry (B ranged from -0.15 to -0.17). Conclusions Academic courses may play a protective role in public worry during the pandemic. Therefore, academic courses and the information they provide may help facilitate public education and reduce public worry in cases of infectious disease outbreaks.","Ho, Hsing-Ying; Chen, Yi-Lung; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Internet Interv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782920301160?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100350; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214782920301160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072524/,199

We report the fundamental pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases. METHODS: The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on bodies of two deceased cases with COVID-19. Gross anatomy and histological investigation by Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained were reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining were performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages. FINDINGS: The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2.

629134,Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on electric energy load and pricing in the Iberian electricity market,2021-11-30,"OBJECTIVES: The co-occurrence of chronic diseases in the elderly is a common problem. However, the relationship between comorbidities and the prognosis of elderly patients with COVID-19 was not clear. This study was supposed to describe the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with COVID-19 infection from Sichuan province and the effects of comorbidity. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 patients from Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu between December 16, 2019 and February 26, 2020 were included in this study. Patients were divided into elderly group (≥60 years old) and non-elderly group (< 60 years old). RESULTS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 indicated relatively higher proportion of comorbidities, and the most common were atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (56.5%), hypertension (43.5%) and chronic pulmonary disease (21.7%). The proportion of severe cases was higher in elderly group than that in non-elderly group (73.9% and 42.2%, respectively, P=0.012). During hospitalization, elderly patients indicated relatively higher proportion of complications, such as shock (21.7%), respiratory failure (21.7%). The proportion of patients with a decreased number of CD8+ lymphocytes (82.6%) and B lymphocytes (77.8%) in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly group (48.9% and 44.8%, respectively). All 3 deaths were elderly patients with comorbidities and the cell counts of T lymphocyte subsets, B and NK cells of them were significantly decreased at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 had a high proportion of severe cases and comorbidities, more likely to show low immune function, and indicate higher proportion of complications.

629414,School Nursing Data Collection During COVID-19,2020-09-24,"Abstract We have demonstrated by primer elongation and cap analysis that mature vaccinia virus late transcripts are discontinuously synthesized. We have shown that RNA transcripts from a translocated 11K and from the authentic 11K and 4b late promoters are extended by approximately 35 nucleotides beyond the “start site” determined by S1 mapping using vaccinia genomic DNA as a probe. Sequencing of the RNA and of the first strand cDNA reveal that a homopolymeric poly(A) sequence is linked to the 5′ terminus of the RNA transcripts. S1 mapping of RNA transcripts with a DNA probe containing an A-stretch, replacing promoter sequences upstream of position −1, confirms the existence of a poly(A) leader of approximately 35 A-residues.","Schwer, Beate; Visca, Paolo; Vos, Jan C.; Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3594569/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867487902121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867487902121,199

METHODS On Day 45, a comprehensive interdisciplinary discussion on the best course of treatment resulted in the general consensus that his lungs would not recover. As such, he was evaluated and listed for a lung transplant. RESULTS We performed a bilateral lung transplant, and the patient was weaned off ECMO and MV postoperatively. This is the first report of lung transplants in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan.

630533,Unemployment in the time of COVID-19: A research agenda(),2020-05-08,"A nationwide lockdown was imposed in India due to COVID-19 pandemic in five phases from 25th March to May 31, 2020. The lockdown restricted major anthropogenic activities, primarily vehicular and industrial, thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration. This work investigates the variation in Black Carbon (BC) concentration and its sources (primarily Fossil Fuel (ff) burning and Biomass Burning (bb)) over Delhi from 18th February to July 31, 2020, covering one month of pre-lockdown phase, all the lockdown phases, and two months of successive lockdown relaxations. The daily average BC concentration varied from 0.22 to 16.92 μg/m(3), with a mean value of 3.62 ± 2.93 μg/m(3). During Pre-Lockdown (PL, 18th Feb-24th March 2020), Lockdown-1 (L1, 25th March-14th April 2020), Lockdown-2 (L2, 15th April-3rd May 2020), Lockdown-3 (L3, 4th-17th May 2020), Lockdown-4 (L4, 18th-31st May 2020), Unlock-1 (UN1, June 2020), and Unlock-2 (UN2, July 2020) the average BC concentrations were 7.93, 1.73, 2.59, 3.76, 3.26, 2.07, and 2.70 μg/m(3), respectively. During the lockdown and unlock phases, BC decreased up to 78% compared to the PL period. The BC source apportionment studies show that fossil fuel burning was the dominant BC source during the entire sampling period. From L1 to UN2 an increasing trend in BC(ff) contribution was observed (except L3) due to the successive relaxations given to anthropogenic activities. BC(ff) contribution dipped briefly during L3 due to the intensive crop residue burning events in neighboring states. CWT analysis showed that local emission sources were the dominant contributors to BC concentration over Delhi.","Goel, Vikas; Hazarika, Naba; Kumar, Mayank; Singh, Vikram; Thamban, Navaneeth M.; Tripathi, Sachchida Nand",Chemosphere,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004565352033633X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129435; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352033633X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412356/,199

632379,COVID 19: Disruptive impacts and transformative opportunities in undergraduate nurse education,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia has been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This study aimed to investigate blood lipid profiles in patients with COVID‐19 and to explore their predictive values for COVID‐19 severity. METHODS: A total of 142 consecutive patients with COVID‐19 were included in this single‐center retrospective study. Blood lipid profile characteristics were investigated in patients with COVID‐19 in comparison with 77 age‐ and gender‐matched healthy subjects, their predictive values for COVID‐19 severity were analyzed by using multivariable logistic regression analysis, and their prediction efficiencies were evaluated by using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: There were 125 and 17 cases in the non‐severe and severe groups, respectively. Total cholesterol (TC), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) gradually decreased across the groups in the following order: healthy controls, non‐severe group, and severe group. ApoA1 was identified as an independent risk factor for COVID‐19 severity (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.865, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800–0.935, p < 0.001), along with interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) (adjusted OR: 1.097, 95% CI: 1.034–1.165, p = 0.002). ApoA1 exhibited the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) among all single markers (AUC: 0.896, 95% CI: 0.834–0.941); moreover, the risk model established using ApoA1 and IL‐6 enhanced prediction efficiency (AUC: 0.977, 95% CI: 0.932–0.995). CONCLUSION: Blood lipid profiles in patients with COVID‐19 are quite abnormal compared with those in healthy subjects, especially in severe cases. Serum ApoA1 may represent a good indicator for predicting the severity of COVID‐19.","Zhu, Zhe; Yang, Yayun; Fan, Lingyan; Ye, Shuyuan; Lou, Kehong; Hua, Xin; Huang, Zuoan; Shi, Qiaoyun; Gao, Guosheng",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260764/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23911,199

The research conducted so far has indicated an increase in the severity of anxiety and aggression and an escalation of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the severity of anxiety, the amount of alcohol consumed and the severity of aggression. Materials and Methods: A total of 538 Polish residents—413 women (76.77%) and 125 men (23.23%)—participated in the study via an online survey. It included socio-demographic parameters and psychological scales: AUDIT—to determine the model of alcohol consumption, GAD-7—to measure the severity of anxiety and the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Results: There was a correlation between the severity of anxiety and generalized aggression, and its two components—anger and hostility—in the entire study group. Moreover, relations were found between the intensity of alcohol consumption and generalized aggression and its components—anger and verbal and physical aggression. Those relationships turned out to be gender specific. The increased anxiety intensity affected the pattern of alcohol consumption and the severity of aggression. Conclusions: Psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational interactions and some elements of psychiatric treatment should aim at reducing the severity of anxiety in society, and thus minimizing the health and social consequences—aggressive behaviour and excessive alcohol consumption.","Florek, Szymon; Dębski, Paweł; Piegza, Magdalena; Gorczyca, Piotr; Pudlo, Robert",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577882/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57090959,199

635766,Air Pollution Reduction and Mortality Benefit during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China,2020-03-27,"Background: Stethoscopes and non infrared thermometers are the customary medical equipment used by the physicians on a daily basis, among various patients. With the rise of potential infections in the healthcare facilities and the transmission nature of the current volantly evolving COVID 19, consistent and correct disinfections of these devices after each use should not be pardoned. This study, therefore, describes the level of stethoscope and non infrared thermometer disinfection practices among physicians and determines its associated factors during the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire via Google form with a consent form appended to it. Results: Four hundred twenty-two physicians participated (62.80% medical doctors, 33.65% seniors, and 3.55% residents). The proportion of stethoscope and non Infrared thermometer disinfections after every use was 13.9% (95%CI: 10.9-17.6) and 20.4% (95%CI: 16.7-24.5), respectively. In adjusted analyses, taking COVID-19 training (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.52; 95% [Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.29-4.92) and the availability of stethoscope disinfection materials at the workplace (AOR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.29-7.10) were significantly increased the odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use. The odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use was significantly decreased for those who reported the use of shared stethoscope (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.92). Among the physicians, disinfection after every use was significantly higher in resident physicians compared to those of general practitioners for both stethoscope (AOR: 4.61; 95%CI: 1.29-16.52) and non Infrared thermometers (AOR: 7.10; 95%CI: 2.30-21.95). Conclusion: Only a wee share of the respondents reported that they have disinfected their stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers after every use possibly jeopardizing both patients and clinicians safety, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic and these results must be sternly dealt with. Provisions of training and securing constant and available stethoscope disinfection supplies can significantly increase disinfection practices among the physicians after every use. These simple interventions could be replicated by other healthcare facilities.","Sahiledengle, B.; Tekalegn, Y.; Bekele, K.; Tesemma, A.; Edward Quisido, B.

A web‐based survey of medical oncologists certified by the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology was conducted between November 1 and December 31, 2019. Of the 1369 medical oncologists who were invited to participate, 415 (30.3%) responded to our survey. The questionnaire comprised 4 sections: “oncologist characteristics,” “oncologist attitude toward influenza vaccines and the current status of influenza vaccination for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,” “incidence of influenza infection and associated treatment complications,” and “treatment policy for influenza infection.” In total, 153 (36.9%) physicians replied that they did not actively encourage influenza vaccination for patients undergoing chemotherapy. The primary reasons given were lack of evidence (48/153, 31.4%) and uncertainty of appropriate timing (46/153, 30.1%). There was diverse variation in the timing of vaccination and in the levels of encouragement based on the cancer location and medication type. Two hundred eighty‐three (68.2%) oncologists reported that their cancer patients had experienced influenza infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and 169 (40.7%) responded that their patients had experienced an administration delay or discontinuation of medication because of influenza infection. Our surveillance revealed some oncologists considered evidence regarding the administration of influenza vaccine to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (particularly the optimal timing and level of recommendation by cancer location and medication) to be lacking. It also exposed the adverse impact of influenza infection in cancer patients.","Maeda, Toshiki; Sasaki, Hidenori; Togawa, Atsushi; Tanaka, Toshihiro; Arima, Hisatomi; Takata, Tohru; Takamatsu, Yasushi",Cancer Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215475/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14742,199

The twenty first century is yet again witnessing a gross global pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally no vaccines or drug specific to COVID-19 is available. Corona viruses have been in mutual relationship with humans and other hosts over many decades though aggressive zoonotic strains have caused havoc. Zoonotic emergent corona viruses prior to SARS-COV-2 included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with the former leading to aggressive infectious spread and the later with high mortality rate. Although they emerged in the early period of the twenty first century, resilient biomedical and expertise in pharmaceutical domain could not appropriate any proprietary therapeutics. Studies envisaged towards curtailing their spread employed different stages of the virus life cycle with all zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) sharing genomic and structural similarities. Hence the strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could prove effective against the recent outbreak of SAR-CoV-2. The review unravels key events involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 while highlighting the possible avenues of therapy. The review also holds the scope in better understanding a broad-spectrum antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors against viral glycoproteins, host cell receptor, viral mRNA synthesis, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and viral proteases in order to design and develop antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","Krishna, Gayathri; Pillai, Vinod Soman; Veettil, Mohanan Valiya",Eur J Pharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920305422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739174/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173450; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920305422,199

A quasi-experiment in the Beijing economic belt during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-20,"The simple knowledge norm of assertion (SKNA) holds that one may (epistemically permissibly) assert that p only if one knows that p. Turri (Aust J Philos 89(1):37–45, 2011) and Williamson (Knowledge and its limits, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000) both argue that more is required for epistemically permissible assertion. In particular, they both think that the asserter must assert on the basis of her knowledge. Turri calls this the express knowledge norm of assertion (EKNA). I defend SKNA and argue against EKNA. First, I argue that EKNA faces counterexamples. Second, I argue that EKNA assumes an implausible view of permissibility on which an assertion is epistemically permissible only if it is made for a right reason, i.e., a reason that contributes to making it the case that it is epistemically permissible to make that assertion. However, the analogous view in other normative domains is both controversial and implausible. This is because it doesn’t make it possible for one to act or react rightly for the wrong reason. I suggest that proponents of EKNA have conflated requirements for φ-ing rightly (or permissibly) with requirements for φ-ing well. Finally, I argue that proponents of SKNA can explain the intuitive defectiveness of asserting on the basis of an epistemically bad reason (e.g., a random guess), even when the asserters know the content of their assertion, by arguing that the asserters are epistemically blameworthy.","Lewis, Max",Synthese,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03362-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413549/,199

There is an overlap in physical and mental health correlates of FA and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to examine sex differences in the rates of positive FA status in individuals with threshold/subthreshold PTSD, and to examine sex differences in the physical and mental health correlates of FA. Methods: Post-9/11 veterans/service members seeking PTSD treatment were recruited. Participants were diagnosed with PTSD via the administration of a clinical interview. FA status was determined using Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale-2, binary sex and body mass index were assessed with demographics questions. Results: Nearly half (43%) of the sample were women. There were no sex differences in the rates of FA, with an overall FA prevalence of 18%. There were no sex differences in FA symptom count in the whole sample (M = 1.63) or those with FA status (M = 6.21). Individuals with FA reported higher frequency of disordered eating, higher severity of PTSD, and depression symptoms. Conclusions: FA should be assessed in tandem with PTSD symptoms, as its prevalence in that sample is higher than in the general population, and it appears to affect both sexes at similar rates.","Stojek, Monika M.; Lipka, Justyna; Maples-Keller, Jessica M.; Rauch, Sheila A.

Here we investigate the mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems. Method: We included participants (8-18 years) from a psychiatric (N = 249) and pediatric (N = 90) sample, and compared them to a general population sample (N = 844). Measures were assessed during the first lockdown (April-May 2020) in the Netherlands. Main outcome measures were Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger, and Sleep-Related Impairment. Additionally, socio-demographic variables, COVID-19-related questions, changes in atmosphere at home from a parent and child perspective, and children's experiences of lockdown regulations were assessed. Results: On all measures except Global Health, the pediatric sample reported least problems. The psychiatric sample reported significantly more problems than the general population sample on all measures except for Anxiety and Peer Relationships. Having a COVID-19 affected friend/relative and a COVID-19 related change in work situation negatively moderated outcome, but not in the samples with pre-existing problems. All parents reported significant decreases in atmosphere at home, as did children from the general population.

Vaccination is one of the pillars of this road map, with the goal to reduce the number of cases and deaths due to Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus agalactiae. The risk of developing invasive bacterial infections (IBI) due to these bacterial species includes genetic and acquired factors that favor repeated and/or severe invasive infections. We searched the PubMed database to identify host risk factors that increase the susceptibility to these bacterial species. Here, we describe a number of inherited and acquired risk factors associated with increased susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections. The burden of these factors is expected to increase due to the anticipated decrease in cases in the general population upon the implementation of vaccination strategies. Therefore, detection and exploration of these patients are important as vaccination may differ among subjects with these risk factors and specific strategies for vaccination are required. The aim of this narrative review is to provide information about these factors as well as their impact on vaccination against the four bacterial species. Awareness of risk factors for IBI may facilitate early recognition and treatment of the disease. Preventive measures including vaccination, when available, in individuals with increased risk for IBI may prevent and reduce the number of cases.","Deghmane, Ala-Eddine; Taha, Muhamed-Kheir",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668334/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030467,199

A conjoint analysis of how vaccine characteristics influence vaccination intentions,2021-01-04,"Human ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 of novel SARS-CoV-2 are primary entry receptors in host cells. Expression of these genes at the transcriptional level has not been much discussed in detail. The ISRE elements of the ACE2 promoter are a binding site for the ISGF3 complex of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. TMPRSS2, including IFNβ, STAT1, and STAT2, has the PARP1 binding site near to TSS either up or downstream promoter region. It is well documented that PARP1 regulates gene expression at the transcription level. Therefore, to curb virus infection, both promoting type I IFN signaling to boost innate immunity and prevention of virus entry by inhibiting PARP1, ACE2 or TMPRSS2 are safe options. Most importantly, our aim is to attract the attention of the global scientific community towards the codon 72 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of p53 and its underneath role in the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we discuss codon 72 SNP of human p53′s role in the different innate immune response to restrict virus-mediated mortality rate only in specific parts of the world.

This drives the necessity to refine and customize reference genomes (RGs). Our laboratory has recently developed a strategy, the Perfect Match Genomic Landscape (PMGL), to detect variation between genomes [K. Palacios-Flores et al.. Genetics 208, 1631–1641 (2018)]. The PMGL is precise and sensitive and, in contrast to most currently used algorithms, is nonstatistical in nature. Here we demonstrate the power of PMGL to refine and customize RGs. As a proof-of-concept, we refined different versions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RG. We applied the automatic PMGL pipeline to refine the genomes of microorganisms belonging to the three domains of life: the archaea Methanococcus maripaludis and Pyrococcus furiosus; the bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis; and the eukarya Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus oryzae, and several strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus. We analyzed the reference genome of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and previously published viral genomes from patients’ samples with COVID-19. We performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in E. coli and show that the PMGL strategy can detect specific mutations generated at any desired step of the whole procedure. We propose that PMGL can be used as a final step for the refinement and customization of any haploid genome, independently of the strategies and algorithms used in its assembly.","Palacios-Flores, Kim; García-Sotelo, Jair; Castillo, Alejandra; Uribe, Carina; Morales, Lucía; Boege, Margareta; Dávila, Guillermo; Flores, Margarita; Palacios, Rafael",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737447/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025192118,199
643503,From the Classroom to the Virtual World: Faculty Response to COVID-19,2021,"Soon after they were first described in 1990, aptamers were largely recognized as a new class of biological ligands that can rival antibodies in various analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides capable of folding into complex 3D structures, enabling them to bind to a large variety of targets ranging from small ions to an entire organism. Their high binding specificity and affinity make them comparable to antibodies, but they are superior regarding a longer shelf life, simple production and chemical modification, in addition to low toxicity and immunogenicity. In the past three decades, aptamers have been used in a plethora of therapeutics and drug delivery systems that involve innovative delivery mechanisms and carrying various types of drug cargos. However, the successful translation of aptamer research from bench to bedside has been challenged by several limitations that slow down the realization of promising aptamer applications as therapeutics at the clinical level. The main limitations include the susceptibility to degradation by nucleases, fast renal clearance, low thermal stability, and the limited functional group diversity. The solution to overcome such limitations lies in the chemistry of aptamers. The current review will focus on the recent arts of aptamer chemistry that have been evolved to refine the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Moreover, this review will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such chemical modifications and how they impact the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Finally, this review will summarize the conjugation strategies of aptamers to nanocarriers for developing targeted drug delivery systems.","Odeh, Fadwa; Nsairat, Hamdi; Alshaer, Walhan; Ismail, Mohammad A.; Esawi, Ezaldeen; Qaqish, Baraa; Bawab, Abeer Al; Ismail, Said I.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861277/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25010003,199

METHODS: All patients sustaining trauma requiring surgery treated in our institution during the lockdown period were included. Retrospective data for all admissions were collected, including outcomes, length of stay and complications. Telephone interviews were performed with all patients, families or their carers to assess COVID-19 transmission at minimum of 6 week post-discharge. RESULTS: 161 patients underwent surgery, 107 females and 54 males with average age of 56 (2–99). There were lower limb related procedures, upper limb related respectively. 13 people died during this period, of these one was directly attributed to COVID-19 related morbidity. 75% responded to telephone interviews and found no cases of symptomatic spread to any patient or household members. CONCLUSION: Following reorganization, our experience has shown that trauma services can be safely resumed with little to no significant adverse effect to patient or spread into community, especially as concerns of second wave risk overwhelming the NHS.

Therefore, it is imperative to integrate these effects while estimating environmental and economic relationships. Although prevailing literature reveals various emissions-deriving and eliminating factors, however, there is a dearth of empirical evidence that estimates the asymmetric and time-varying effect of globalization, natural resources, and financial development from a multidimensional perspective in China. In doing so, we employ the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and cross-wavelet modeling framework to explore the long- and short-run nonlinear and time-variant association between globalization, natural resources, financial development, and carbon emissions from 1980 to 2017. The NARDL method has the benefit of discriminating the long-term and short-term asymmetric carbon emission responses due to a positive and negative shock in our primary variables of interest. Mainly, the findings of NARDL estimations confirm that positive shocks in globalization and financial developments have a significant positive impact on carbon emissions, whereas negative shock in natural resources has a significant positive impact on carbon emissions. Similarly, the outcomes of continuous wavelet transformation and wavelet transformation coherence confirm the causal linkages between covariates; however, this effect varies across different time and frequency domains. These results imply that environmental researchers should consider asymmetric transmission channels and time–frequency associations among variables to devise long-term sustainable policies.","Ling, Gao; Razzaq, Asif; Guo, Yaqiong; Fatima, Tehreem; Shahzad, Farrukh",Environ Dev Sustain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01724-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421336/,199

We characterized the temporal dynamics in diversity of E. coli in fecal samples from a cohort of goat kids and adult meat goats on pasture over a one-year period. Isolates were characterized based on phylogenetic grouping, virulence genes; shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx1&Stx2) (STEC), intimin (eaeA), hemolysin (hly) and select important sero-groups (026, 045, 0103, 0126 and 0146) using molecular methods. RESULTS: A total of 516 E. coli isolates were screened. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was 65 and 56% respectively. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was significantly higher in goat kids less than six months (76% /66%) than adults (48% /28%). Isolates with virulence profiles of two or more genes were also higher in young goat kids (50%) than adults (20%). Entero-pathogenic E. coli (EPEC-eaeA gene only) were mostly from pre-weaned goat kids while hly gene only isolates were significantly higher in adults. The stx1, stx2 and hly genes peaked around weaning (60, 63 and 52%) respectively. Goats kids were mostly hosts to group D (59%) while adults older than one year had B1 (75%) isolates. Group D isolates were most abundant at weaning (64%) and diarrhea samples (74%). Group B2 isolates overall (6%) were mostly detected around weaning (63%) while A isolates were 4% overall. Twenty-four isolates belonged to sero-groups 026, 0103 and 0146 with 70% of the isolates detected around weaning. Nineteen of these isolates were STEC with most harboring the stx1/stx2/hly/eae (25%) profile. Most belonged to O26 sero-group (75%) and phylogroup D (75%). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first study to highlight longitudinal age related differences in E. coli phylogenetic diversity, abundance of virulence genes and select important sero-groups in goats. Differences detected suggest a possible role of age and weaning stress in influencing E. coli diversity in the gut of goats. The findings are relevant to both animal and public health to advise on further studies on caprine E. coli isolates as animal and human pathogens.","Ndegwa, Eunice; Alahmde, Aber; Kim, Chyer; Kaseloo, Paul; O’Brien, Dahlia",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731899/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02479-0,199

Apart from presenting antigens to T cells, DCs carry out many other functions in regulating immunity. DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is a novel receptor that plays an important role in DC migration and adhesion, the inflammatory response, T cell activation, initiating the immune response, and immune escape of pathogens and tumors. DC-SIGN mediates DC binding to ICAM-3 on the T cell surface and ICAM-2 on the endothelial cell (EC) surface, and takes part in the initial interaction between DC and T cells or vascular ECs. The procedure of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method in which single-stranded oligonucleotides are selected from a wide variety of sequences, based on their interaction with a target molecule. In this study, we selected DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN protein by SELEX, and measured their binding affinity for DC-SIGN. Finally, an appropriate aptamer with high affinity for DC-SIGN was obtained, and it blocked DC adhesion to ECs as effectively as anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody.","Hui, Yan; Shan, Li; Lin-fu, Zhou; Jian-hua, Zhu",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17660953/,199
648168,Secondary Household Covid-19 Transmission Modelling of Students Returning Home from University,2020-11-13,"Abstract This prospective longitudinal study examined the epidemiology and disease syndrome associated with bovine coronavirus (BCV) infections in a cohort of 8 conventional calves from 0 to 120 days of age, in two dairy herds in Ohio. The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24–48 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24–48 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.","Heckert, R.

So far as a result of this epidemic, 4,434,653 confirmed cases and 302,169 deaths are reported. The growing infection rate and death toll demand the use of all possible approaches to design novel drugs and vaccines to curb this disease. In this study, we combined drugs repurposing and virtual drug screening strategies to target 3CLpro, which has an essential role in viral maturation and replication. A total of 31 FDA approved anti-HIV drugs, and Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) database were screened to find potential inhibitors. As a result, Saquinavir, and five drugs (TCM5280805, TCM5280445, TCM5280343, TCM5280863, and TCM5458190) from the TCM database were found as promising hits. Furthermore, results from molecular dynamics simulation and total binding free energy revealed that Saquinavir and TCM5280805 target the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and possess stable dynamics behavior. Thus, we suggest that these compounds should be tested experimentally against the SARS-COV-2 as Saquinavir has been reported to inhibit HIV protease experimentally.

Objective: In search of better prognostic markers in COVID-19, we hypothesized that circulating soluble ST2 (sST2) could be associated to a worse outcome, prompted by our previous knowledge of sST2 involvement in heart failure-associated lung deterioration, and by mounting evidence favoring a role of IL-33/ST2 axis in the disease. Design, Setting and participants: One hundred and fifty-two patients admitted for confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in a prospective non-interventional, observational study carried out in a tertiary teaching center. Blood samples were drawn at admission, 48-72 hours later and at discharge. sST2 concentrations, and routine blood laboratory were analyzed. Main outcomes: Primary end-points were admission at intensive care unit (ICU) and, mortality. Other outcomes were a need for high oxygen flow therapy (HOF) or increasing treatment at 48/72 hours. Results: Median age was 57.5 years (SD: 12.8), 60.4% males. Ten per cent of patients (n=15) were derived to ICU and/or died during admission. The rest stayed hospitalized 8(IQR:6) days on average. About 34% (n=47), 38% (n=53) and 48.5% (n=66) needed HOF, up-titrate therapy or both, respectively. Median (IQR) sST2 serum concentration (ng/mL) rose to 53.1(30.9) at admission, peaked at 48-72h (79.5[64]) and returned to admission levels at discharge (44.9[36.7]), remaining significantly elevated above healthy donor values (18.6[15.1]). A concentration of sST2 above 58.9 ng/mL identified patients progressing to ICU admission or death. These results remained significant after multivariable analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of sST2 for the occurrence of end-points was 0.776 (p=0.001). Admission sST2 was higher in patients who needed up-tritate therapy. Conclusions and relevance: In patients admitted for COVID-19 infection, measurement of sST2 measurement early within 24h after at admission was able to identify patients at risk of severe complications or death.","SANCHEZ-MARTELES, M.; RUBIO-GRACIA, J.; PENA-FRESNEDA, N.; GARCES-HORNA, V.; GRACIA-TELLO, B.; MARTINEZ-LOSTAO, L.; CRESPO-AZNAREZ, S.; PEREZ-CALVO, J.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), being the main cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, plays a role in the entry of the virus into the cell. Currently, there are neither specific antiviral drugs for the treatment or preventive drugs such as vaccines. METHODS: We proposed a bioinformatics analysis to test in silico existing drugs as a fast way to identify an efficient therapy. We performed a differential expression analysis in order to identify differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 patients correlated with ACE-2 and we explored their direct relations with a network approach integrating also drug-gene interactions. The drugs with a central role in the network were also investigated with a molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: We found 825 differentially expressed genes correlated with ACE2. The protein-protein interactions among differentially expressed genes identified a network of 474 genes and 1130 interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of drug-gene interactions in the network and molecular docking analysis allows us to obtain several drugs with antiviral activity that, alone or in combination with other treatment options, could be considered as therapeutic approaches against COVID-19.","Cava, Claudia; Bertoli, Gloria; Castiglioni, Isabella",BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40360-020-00444-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883368/,199

The study finds that the size of the banking sector and the presence of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are positively associated with a stronger implementation record. These results suggest that cooperative motives of internalising externalities, creating a level playing field and preserving financial stability play a role in explaining the implementation record. We find evidence that this cooperative behaviour may be driven by the self-interest of global players as the positive record is particularly strong in countries where large banking sectors and big banks are both present, and where regulation only applies to large players. Sectoral concentration, bank health and the share of foreign ownership yield more mixed results as regards their impact on implementation.","Schuknecht, Ludger; Siegerink, Vincent",Eur J Polit Econ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2020.101941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904514/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0176268020300896; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300896?v=s5,199

The innate immune system utilizes numerous germ-line encoded receptors called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral nucleic acids, ultimately resulting in antiviral immune responses in the form of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The immune-stimulatory role of DNA is known for a long time; however, DNA sensing ability of the innate immune system was unraveled only recently. At present, multiple DNA sensors have been proposed, and most of them use STING as a key adaptor protein to exert antiviral immune responses. In this review, we aim to provide molecular and structural underpinnings on endosomal DNA sensor Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and multiple cytosolic DNA sensors including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), interferon-gamma inducible 16 (IFI16), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI) to provide new insights on their signaling mechanisms and physiological relevance. We have also addressed less well-understood DNA sensors such as DEAD-box helicase DDX41, RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and meiotic recombination 11 homolog A (MRE11). By comprehensive understanding of molecular and structural aspects of DNA-sensing antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, potential new targets for viral and autoimmune diseases can be identified.","Zahid, Ayesha; Ismail, Hazrat; Li, Bofeng; Jin, Tengchuan",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329609/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.613039,199
651265,"International trade as critical parameter of COVID-19 spread that outclasses demographic, economic, environmental, and pollution factors",2021-06-15,"OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in licensed substance use treatment facilities' adoption of telemedicine and how adoption varies across local factors, including county-level drug overdose rates, urbanicity measures, and state policy laws. METHODS: We analyzed data (2016–2019) from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Our main outcome was telemedicine use by a treatment facility. We also captured independent variables from other datasets, including estimated county-level drug poisoning deaths and state-level telemedicine policies. We estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to determine which facility characteristics were associated with offering telemedicine. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, an average of 12,334 treatment facilities were included. During this period, the unadjusted proportion of facilities offering telemedicine grew from 13.5% to 17.4% (p < 0.001). In adjusted models, rural location; offering multiple treatment settings; offering pharmacotherapy; and serving both adult and pediatric patients were associated with greater telemedicine adoption (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). DISCUSSION: Use of telemedicine is increasing steadily among substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities; however, uptake is uneven and relatively low. As such, telemedicine may be an underutilized tool to expand access to care for patients with SUDs.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Cantor, Jonathan; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Busch, Alisa; Barnett, Michael",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740547220303160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547220303160?v=s5,199
651423,Family Life in Lockdown,2021-08-04,"Most of the recent studies indicated the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) are increasing after the COVID pandemic around the world. Bo et al. reported PTSS prevalence of 96.2% among the COVID-19-infected people. The sociocultural and individual vulnerability and protective factors may influence onset and maintenance of the symptoms. However, there is significant lack in understanding the risk factors and preventive factors that influence the maintenance of Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms that defines Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The digital technology gives us the unique opportunity to assess this risk, to monitor and track this evolution longitudinally. In this research project we aimed to design and develop a smartphone application for longitudinal data collection enabling to (1) predict and follow the evolution of PTSS toward PTSD, (2) assess the relative efficacy of several methods to prevent the evolution of PTSS right after exposure to trauma (1-24 h), (3) educate people about psychological effects that can occur during and after trauma, normalize acute distress and refer to professional help if a disorder is constituted. We hope that this research project will help to understand how to maximize the self help support during the acute phase (golden hours) after trauma to prevent the transition from PTSS to PTSD.

Fine particulate matter and COVID-19 mortality as an example,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to guide treatment and limit spread of the virus. The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. RESULTS: We enrolled 1368 consecutive patients (median age 68 [interquartile range, IQR 53–80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3822 tests (median 2 [IQR 1–3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1368), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. CONCLUSIONS: In patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19. Diagnostic performance is significantly improved by repeated testing.

Consequently, background depletion and virome enrichment techniques are usually needed for clinical samples where viral load is much lower than background sequences. Methods A viral Sequence Independent Targeted Amplification (VSITA) approach using a set of non-ribosomal and virus-enriched octamers (V8) was developed and compared with traditionally used random hexamers (N6). Forty-five archived clinical samples of different types were used in parallel to compare the V8 and N6 enrichment performance of viral sequences and removal performance of ribosomal sequences in the step of reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ten sera samples from patients with fever of unknown origin and 10 feces samples from patients with diarrhea of unknown origin were used in comparison of V8 and N6 enrichment performance following NGS analysis. Results A minimum 30 hexamers matching to viral reference sequences (sense and antisense) were selected from a dataset of random 4,096 (46) hexamers (N6). Two random nucleotides were added to the 5' end of the selected hexamers, and 480 (30 × 42) octamers (V8) were obtained. In general, VSITA approach showed higher enrichment of virus-targeted cDNA and enhanced ability to remove unwanted ribosomal sequences in the majorities of 45 predefined clinical samples. Moreover, VSITA combined with NGS enabled to detect not only more viruses but also achieve more viral reads hit and higher viral genome coverage in 20 clinical samples with diarrhea or fever of unknown origin. Conclusion The VSITA approach designed in this study is demonstrated to possess higher sensitivity and broader genome coverage than traditionally used random hexamers in the NGS-based identification of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples.","ZHANG, Yi; ZHANG, Chen; LI, Bo; LI, Yang; Zhou, HE Xiao; LI, Acher; WU, Wei; DUAN, Su Xia; QIU, Fang Zhou; WANG, Ji; SHEN, Xin Xin; YANG, Meng Jie; LI, De Xin; MA, Xue Jun",Biomedical and Environmental Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2018.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398818300539; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398818300539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29773090/,199

Differently from other previous models, we consider the environment to be a multi-region space in which the epidemic spreads according to the dynamics and the concentration of agents in such regions. This paper suggests that software agents can provide a more suitable model for individuals, and their features, thus showing the influence of civil society in the context of pandemic management. This is achieved by modeling an individual as an agent with a wide range of features (health condition, purchasing power, awareness, mobility, professional activity, age, and gender). The model supports the design of populations and interactions akin to real-life scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed model can be applied in several ways to support decision-makers to better understand the epidemic spread and the actions that can be taken against the pandemic.","Castro, Brenno Moura; de Abreu de Melo, Yuri; Fernanda dos Santos, Nicole; Luiz da Costa Barcellos, André; Noya, Ricardo Choren; Salles, Ronaldo Moreira",Comput Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001048252100439X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048252100439X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325230/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104645,199

652501,"Politicizing the Mask: Political, Economic and Demographic Factors Affecting Mask Wearing Behavior in the USA",2021-01-05,"Introduction Outcomes of patients with hematological cancers and Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) have been dismal with high rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit and high mortality of up to 20% compared to general population, more so pronounced among black and ethnic minorities. There is hardly any data on outcomes of patients with lymphoma and concurrent COVID-19 from eastern mediterranean region. From eastern mediterranean area no similar studies have been reported so far. Methods Here we describe outcomes of eleven consecutive patients who had history malignant lymphoma (either treated or currently on treatment) and now had developed COVID-19 infection, recently admitted at our tertiary care center between April and July 2020 with minimum of 10 days follow up. Results Total of eleven (n=11) patients were identified with COVID-19 who also had diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. There were 5 males and 6 females and median age was 31 years (Range 19-59). Diagnoses included five cases of diffuse large b cell lymphoma, two cases of primary central nervous system lymphoma, three cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, one case of low grade non Hodgkin lymphoma. Two cases were newly diagnosed and had not received any treatment while six patients were on active treatment and three patients had received treatment more than six months prior. Three patients were on Rituximab based therapy at the time of infection and two patients had prior autologous stem cell transplant. Seven patients had mild COVID-19 while four had severe form of disease. All patients were on supportive care and treatment included various options including chloroquine, antibiotics, convalescent plasma, interferon, enoxaparin, Tocilizumab depending on treating physician’s discretion. Four patients had home isolation and recovered fully, while seven patients needed hospitalization of which three made full recovery while three needed admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID-19. Out of three patients in ICU, two needed noninvasive ventilation, one needed mechanical ventilation. At the time analysis one ICU patient made complete recovery and discharged home while two others are still in hospital. After a median follow up of 37 days (range 10-87), no mortality has been recorded so far. Out of four patients with severe COVID-19, one was newly diagnosed and treatment naïve, and one was in remission for more than a year, the remaining two were on active rituximab based chemotherapy for lymphoma. However, 3 out of 4 patients had cleared COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction testing. Conclusions Our results suggest that COVID-19 causes significant morbidity in patients with lymphoma like other studies, however there has been no mortality so far in our cohort with relatively long follow up, although some patients are still admitted at the time of analysis. One of the reason for lower mortality could be younger age group. Our study also suggests that over two thirds of the patients had only mild disease out of which majority of them were on some sort of therapy or had undergone recent transplant, making us wonder if recent immunochemotherapy may have some protective effect against cytokine storm or severe COVID-19 by having dampening role on immune system. Half of the patients who had severe disease were not on any therapy while the other two who were on active therapy, although still inpatients, had cleared the virus interestingly. Further studies needed to examine this further, our results from this ethnic community are encouraging.

654375,COVID‐19: A threat to educated Muslim women's negotiated identity in Pakistan,2020-05-08,"Backgrounds The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as a gold-standard method. However, COVID-19 test kits, especially the positive control samples that are synthesized by laboratories or companies, have increased the inconclusiveness of disease interpretation. Therefore, development of new methods for the preparation of reliable positive controls that are not impaired by contamination for diagnosing COVID-19 remains a challenge. Methods A new approach for producing synthetic positive controls using synthetic positive template (SPT) oligonucleotides was designed. SPT oligonucleotides contain probe binding and virus-irrelevant regions as templates for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genes (RdRP, E, and N SARS-CoV-2) by real-time RT-PCR was performed in a concentration-dependent manner. The limit of detection (LOD) for individual SARS-CoV-2 genes by Ct values with concentration ranges was determined with SPT templates and genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2. Results LODs with SPT templates were >10-15 (atto) M for RdRP, 10-12 (femto) to 10-13 (100 atto) M for E gene, and 10-12 to 10-14 (10 atto) M for N gene, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR assay using serially diluted genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2 showed that picogram quantities of RNAs prepared from COVID-19 virus cultures resulted in the LOD. The sensitivity based on Ct values for RdRP and E genes were less sensitive to this platform than N gene. Conclusion This method significantly decreased the risk of contamination and false-positive reactions that result from contamination of the synthesis procedures that are used to produce positive control materials. Therefore, this approach may be integrated into the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 and provides a general method for preparing positive controls for diagnosing emerging RNA virus infections.","Cho, Hyejin; Hwan Jung, Young; Bum Cho, Hong; Kim, Hee-tae; Kim, Kwang-sun",Clin Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.10.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120304721?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058837/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120304721,199
654592,Stress‐Buffering Role of Social Support during COVID‐19,2020-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause severe illness and death. Predictors of poor outcome collected on hospital admission may inform clinical and public health decisions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort investigation of 297 adults admitted to eight academic and community hospitals in Georgia, United States, during March 2020. Using standardized medical record abstraction, we collected data on predictors including admission demographics, underlying medical conditions, outpatient antihypertensive medications, recorded symptoms, vital signs, radiographic findings, and laboratory values. We used random forest models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS: Compared with age <45 years, ages 65–74 years and ≥75 years were predictors of IMV (aOR 3.12, CI 1.47–6.60; aOR 2.79, CI 1.23–6.33) and the strongest predictors for death (aOR 12.92, CI 3.26–51.25; aOR 18.06, CI 4.43–73.63). Comorbidities associated with death (aORs from 2.4 to 3.8, p <0.05) included end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and neurologic disorders, but not pulmonary disease, immunocompromise, or hypertension. Pre-hospital use vs. non-use of angiotensin receptor blockers (aOR 2.02, CI 1.03–3.96) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (aOR 1.91, CI 1.03–3.55) were associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for patient and clinical characteristics, older age was the strongest predictor of death, exceeding comorbidities, abnormal vital signs, and laboratory test abnormalities. That coronary artery disease, but not chronic lung disease, was associated with death among hospitalized patients warrants further investigation, as do associations between certain antihypertensive medications and death.","Jackson, Brendan R; Gold, Jeremy A W; Natarajan, Pavithra; Rossow, John; Neblett Fanfair, Robyn; da Silva, Juliana; Wong, Karen K; Browning, Sean D; Bamrah Morris, Sapna; Rogers-Brown, Jessica; Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Szablewski, Christine M; Oosmanally, Nadine; Tobin-D’Angelo, Melissa; Drenzek, Cherie; Murphy, David J; Hollberg, Julie; Blum, James M; Jansen, Robert; Wright, David W; SeweSll, William M; Owens, Jack D; Lefkove, Benjamin; Brown, Frank W; Burton, Deron C; Uyeki, Timothy M; Bialek, Stephanie R; Patel, Priti R; Bruce, Beau B",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971532/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1459,199

655001,A Contribution to the Mathematical Modeling of the Corona/COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-06,"Dietary improvement not only benefits human health conditions, but also offers the potential to reduce the human food system’s environmental impact. With the world’s largest population and people’s bourgeoning lifestyle, China’s food system is set to impose increasing pressures on the environment. We evaluated the minimum environmental footprints, including carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF) and ecological footprint (EF), of China’s food systems into 2100. The minimum footprints of healthy eating are informative to policymakers when setting the environmental constraints for food systems. The results demonstrate that the minimum CF, WF and EF all increase in the near future and peak around 2030 to 2035, under different population scenarios. After the peak, population decline and aging result in decreasing trends of all environmental footprints until 2100. Considering age-gender specific nutritional needs, the food demands of teenagers in the 14–17 year group require the largest environmental footprints across the three indicators. Moreover, men’s nutritional needs also lead to larger environmental footprints than women’s across all age groups. By 2100, the minimum CF, WF and EF associated with China’s food systems range from 616 to 899 million tons, 654 to 953 km(3) and 6513 to 9500 billion gm(2) respectively under different population scenarios. This study builds a bridge between demography and the environmental footprints of diet and demonstrates that the minimum environmental footprints of diet could vary by up to 46% in 2100 under different demographic scenarios. The results suggest to policymakers that setting the environmental constraints of food systems should be integrated with the planning of a future demographic path.","Han, Aixi; Chai, Li; Liao, Xiawei",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751477/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081021,199

This may have increased the number of hours spent online and could have impacted the quality of the enacted behavior, in terms of loss of control of Internet use. In this online survey, we were interested in measure how much loss of control was perceived regarding online gambling, online shopping, the fruition of online pornographic content and web navigation. Design and methods: The online survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in the post-lockdown and 1232 subjects participated in the survey. In the participating sample, healthcare workers (HW) were 43.1% of the sample, of which 18.7% were directly involved in the Coronavirus emergency, and 52.3% of the sample is not a HW. Only 0.6% of the sample gambled online and 37.5% of those reported losing control of their gambling mode. Most of the sample shopped online during the LD (70.1%), but only 7.2% of those lost control by buying and/or spending more than what they had set themselves. Results: Significant data emerged showing that those who lost control while online shopping also lost control regarding the amount of time spent online (p<0.001); 21.6% of the sample, reported making use of online pornographic material during LD, 4.7% of them stated that the frequency increased and 5.1% reported losing control by having spent more money or more time than what was intended. Finally, 44.7% of the sample have experienced loss of control during the web navigation. Furthermore, during the LD 67.8% of the sample reports having experienced unpleasant emotions. Of these, 8.4% state that they enacted behaviors such as online gambling, online shopping, online pornographic material viewing and web navigation to counter their negative emotions. Interestingly, we found a correlation between loss of control during web navigation and online shopping and the emotional states “upset”, “scared” and “restless” (p<0.05). Conclusion: To conclude, there was no significant increase in potentially addictive behaviors, nor an increase in loss of control of these behaviors when enacted online. However, the loss of control in online shopping and web navigation was significantly correlated to the unpleasant emotional states of nervousness, fear and restlessness, whereas those who reported feeling strong and able to handle the situation experienced a lower loss of control in their web navigation. These correlations may suggest that these online behaviors may act as modulators of unpleasant emotional states.","Zamboni, Lorenzo; Carli, Silvia; Belleri, Marika; Giordano, Rosaria; Saretta, Giulia; Lugoboni, Fabio",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623775/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.1759,199

It is unknown the immediate impact of social restriction recommendations (i.e., lockdown, stay-at-home) on the life-space mobility of older people. Objective: To investigate the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on life-space mobility of community-dwelling Brazilian older adults and examine the social determinants of health associated with change in life-space mobility. Design: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study (REMOBILIZE Study). Setting: Community. Subject: A convenience snowball sample of participants aged 60 and older (n = 1,482) living in 22 states in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online and phone survey using an adapted version of the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Linear regression models were used to investigate social determinants of health on the change in LSA score. Results: Regardless of their gender and social determinants of health, participants showed a significant reduction in life-space mobility since COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Life-space mobility reduction was higher among black individuals, those living alone and aged between 70 and 79. Other variables associated with change in life-space mobility, to a lesser extent, were sex, education and income. Conclusion: Social restriction measures due to pandemic caused substantial reduction in older adults' life-space mobility in Brazil. Social inequalities strongly affected vulnerable groups. Concerted actions should be put in place to overcome the deterioration in life-pace mobility amongst these groups. Failure in minimizing health inequalities amplified by the pandemic may jeopardize the desired achievements of the Decade of Healthy Aging.","Perracini, Monica R.; de Amorim, Juleimar Soares Coelho; Lima, Camila Astolphi; da Silva, Alexandre; Trombini-Souza, Francis; Pereira, Daniele Sirineu; Pelicioni, Paulo Henrique Silva; Duim, Etiene; Batista, Patricia Parreira; dos Santos, Renato Barbosa; de Lima, Maria do Carmo Correia",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898378/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.643640,199

There is no proven antiviral therapy for COVID-19 so far, but profound immunosuppression has recently been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19-associated CRS. We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection with a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy with tocilizumab (TCZ). The rapid clinical and biochemical improvement following TCZ administration suggests that treatment with immunotherapy can be life-saving in selected patients with COVID-19-induced CRS. LEARNING POINTS: Cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.

659468,Information Behavior During the Covid-19 Crisis in German-Speaking Countries,2020-07-27,"OBJECTIVES: Iran is facing a big challenge controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, and it is unclear to how individuals are engaging in preventive behaviors. This study aimed to investigate changes in preventive behaviors during the first 3 mo of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. METHOD: This cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1477 adults aged 18 y and older in 31 provinces of Iran. Data were collected by an anonymous online questionnaire. RESULT: Overall, engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable, and more than 45% of subjects always carried out all preventive behaviors. Engaging in all preventive behaviors had a peak in the second month and obviously declined during third month. Engagement in some preventive behaviors, such as “wearing a face mask” and “keeping a safe distance from others,” was observed less than other behaviors. There was a statistically significant difference in the engagement in preventive behaviors by gender and occupation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable for the first 2 mo of the outbreak, it has declined gradually. This is a warning for public health decision makers. COVID-19 is still a crucial issue in Iran, and it is necessary that government decision be based on the fact that Iranian people must live with a coronavirus for months, with full caution and compliance toward all preventive care protocols.","Shamsalinia, Abbas; Mohammadi, Sepideh; Ghaffari, Fatemeh; Arazi, Tajmohammad",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040769/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.378,199
660331,Online educational methods vs. traditional teaching of anatomy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-10-01,"It is estimated that behaviors such as poor diet, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, sedentary behavior, and excessive ultraviolet exposure account for nearly half of all cancer morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, the behavioral, social, and communication sciences have been important contributors to cancer prevention and control research, with methodological advances and implementation science helping to produce optimally effective interventions. To sustain these contributions, it is vital to adapt to the contemporary context. Efforts must consider ancillary effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, profound changes in the information environment and public understanding of and trust in science, renewed attention to structural racism and social determinants of health, and the rapidly increasing population of cancer survivors. Within this context, it is essential to accelerate reductions in tobacco use across all population subgroups; consider new models of energy balance (diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior); increase awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, and identify better communication practices in the context of cancer-related decisions such as screening and genetic testing. Successful integration of behavioral research and cancer prevention depends on working globally and seamlessly across disciplines, taking a multilevel approach where possible. Methodological and analytic approaches should be emphasized in research training programs and should employ new and underutilized data sources and technologies. As the leadership core of the National Cancer Institute's Behavioral Research Program, we reflect on these challenges and opportunities and consider implications for the next phase of behavioral research in cancer prevention and control.","Klein, William M P; O’Connell, Mary E; Bloch, Michele H; Czajkowski, Susan M; Green, Paige A; Han, Paul K J; Moser, Richard P; Nebeling, Linda C; Vanderpool, Robin C",J Natl Cancer Inst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34240206/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djab139,199

661887,How the COVID-19 Pandemic Is Reshaping the Trade Landscape and What to Do About It,2020-06-07,"Peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) is an antioxidant enzyme with both the activities of peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which is involved in regulation of many cellular reactions. However, the function of PRDX6 during virus infection remains unknown. In this study, we found that the abundance of PRDX6 protein was dramatically decreased in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infected cells. Overexpression of PRDX6 inhibited FMDV replication. In contrast, knockdown of PRDX6 expression promoted FMDV replication, suggesting an antiviral role of PRDX6. To explore whether the activity of peroxidase and PLA2 was associated with PRDX6-mediated antiviral function, a specific inhibitor of PLA2 (MJ33) and a specific inhibitor of peroxidase activity (mercaptosuccinate) were used to treat the cells before FMDV infection. The results showed that incubation of MJ33 but not mercaptosuccinate promoted FMDV replication. Meanwhile, overexpression of PRDX6 slightly enhanced type I interferon signaling. We further determined that the viral 3C(pro) was responsible for degradation of PRDX6, and 3C(pro)-induced reduction of PRDX6 was independent of the proteasome, lysosome, and caspase pathways. The protease activity of 3C(pro) was required for induction of PRDX6 reduction. Besides, PRDX6 suppressed the replication of another porcine picornavirus Senecavirus A (SVA), and the 3C(pro) of SVA induced the reduction of PRDX6 through its proteolytic activity as well. Together, our results suggested that PRDX6 plays an important antiviral role during porcine picornavirus infection, and the viral 3C(pro) induces the degradation of PRDX6 to overcome PRDX6-mediated antiviral function.

661997,Accepting Restrictions and Compliance With Recommended Preventive Behaviors for COVID-19: A Discussion Based on the Key Approaches and Current Research on Fear Appeals,2021-06-07,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide illness and New York became the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States from Mid-March to May 2020. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the coagulopathic presentation of COVID and its natural course during the early stages of the COVID-19 surge in New York. To investigate whether hematologic and coagulation parameters can be used to assess illness severity and death. DESIGN: Retrospective case study of positive COVID inpatients between March 20, 2020-March 31, 2020. SETTING: Montefiore Health System main hospital, Moses, a large tertiary care center in the Bronx. PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients with positive COVID tests hospitalized at MHS. EXPOSURE (FOR OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES): Datasets of participants were queried for demographic (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and self-reported race and/or ethnicity), clinical and laboratory data. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Relationship and predictive value of measured parameters to mortality and illness severity. RESULTS: Of the 225 in this case review, 75 died during hospitalization while 150 were discharged home. Only the admission PT, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and first D-Dimer could significantly differentiate those who were discharged alive and those who died. Logistic regression analysis shows increased odds ratio for mortality by first D-Dimer within 48 hrs. of admission. The optimal cut-point for the initial D-Dimer to predict mortality was found to be 2.1 μg/mL. 15% of discharged patients required readmission and more than a third of readmitted patients died (5% of all initially discharged). CONCLUSION: We describe here a comprehensive assessment of hematologic and coagulation parameters in COVID-19 and examine the relationship of these to mortality. We demonstrate that both initial and maximum D-Dimer values are biomarkers that can be used for survival assessments. Furthermore, D-Dimer may be useful to follow up discharged patients.","Reyes Gil, Morayma; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D.; Rahman, Shafia; Barouqa, Mohammad; Szymanski, James; Ikemura, Kenji; Lo, Yungtai; Billett, Henny H.",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.618929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708136/,199

METHODS: In July 2020, a cross-sectional survey of 2909 participants in Saudi Arabia during the outbreak was conducted to collect data related to sociodemographic characteristics and scores on the Brief Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (BOCS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). RESULTS: Most participants were female (73.9%) with a university level of education or higher (81%). The prevalence of new-onset obsessions was 57.8%, compulsions 45.9%, and moderate/high perceived stress 72.4%. New-onset dirt, germs, and virus obsessions were significantly higher among 40-49 age group, employees, housewives, students, quarantine discipliners, and those who spent 20 or more days in quarantine. New-onset hand-washing compulsions were significantly higher among the 30-49 age group.

664632,The Impact of Information on Attitudes toward Sustainable Wildlife Utilization and Management: A Survey of the Chinese Public,2021-09-08,"Some newly emerging viral lung infections have the potential to cause large outbreaks of severe respiratory disease amongst humans. In this contribution we discuss infections by influenza A (H5N1), SARS and Hanta virus. The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (bird flu) has crossed the species barrier and causes severe illness in humans. So far, 328 humans in twelve countries have contracted the disease and 200 have died. The young are particularly affected. Oseltamivir is the antiviral drug of choice and should be given as early as possible. Patients require supportive care, often including invasive ventilation. If H5N1 develops the ability to transmit efficiently between humans, an influenza pandemic is likely. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first seen in China in 2002. The outbreak was finally contained in 2003, by which time 8098 probable SARS cases had been identified with at least 774 deaths. The virus was identified in 2003 as belonging to the coronaviridae family. SARS is transmitted between humans and clusters have been seen. The mainstay of treatment is supportive. Various antiviral agents and adjunctive therapies were tried but none were conclusively effective. Hanta virus is an emerging cause of viral lung disease. In 1993, a new species of Hanta virus was recognized, after an outbreak of a new rapidly progressive pulmonary syndrome in the US, 465 cases of ‘Sin Nombre’ virus have now been seen in the US with a mortality rate of 35%. Many of the confirmed cases had contact with rodents (the major host of hanta viruses).

665570,International medical graduates: how can UK psychiatry do better?,2021-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes are known to be associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and resultant mortality. In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from ‘Worldometer’. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. RESULTS: The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002–0.7, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5–41.2, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution frequency of ACE insertion/insertion (II) genotype may have a significant influence on COVID-19 mortality. This information has potential utility for resource planning at a systemic level, as well as for clinical management.","Aung, Ar K; Aitken, Tess; Teh, Bing M; Yu, Christiaan; Ofori-Asenso, Richard; Chin, Ken L; Liew, Danny",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320307088?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197472/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320307088,199
665717,Data-Driven Dynamic Clustering Framework for Mitigating the Adverse Economic Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown Practices,2020-07-03,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed health systems across the world, both in general hospitals and in oncology institutes or centres. For cancer specialists, particularly breast cancer (BC), the COVID-19 pandemic represents a combination of challenges since the hospital resources and staff have become more limited; this has obliged oncology specialists to seek a consensus and establish which patients with BC require more urgent attention and which patients can wait until there is a better control of this pandemic. The health system in Latin America has some special characteristics; in some of the countries, there are shortages which limit access to several specialities (surgery, clinical oncology and radiotherapy) in some regions. OBJECTIVE: After a systematic review of the most recent literature regarding the management of BC during the COVID-19 pandemic, the main objective is to understand the position of the different Latin American Societies of Mastology in terms of available alternatives for the treatment of BC. METHODS: After carrying out a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the most recent guides on the management of BC during the COVID-19 pandemic, the board members of the Latin American Federation of Mastology invited, via email, different specialists, all experts in BC care, to complete an anonymous survey online. The survey was distributed between 30 and 10 May 2020. The survey included 27 questions on four topics: demographic information, consultations, imaging and treatment of BC. The questionnaire was sent and then distributed to various health specialists including breast surgeons, clinical oncologists, radiation oncologists and radiologists via the Presidents of the different Latin American Societies of Mastology in 18 countries. The results are summarised as tallies based on the number of responses to each question. RESULTS: A total of 499 responses were received. The majority of the respondents were males (275 (55.11%)); 290 participants were over 45 years (58.11%). The questionnaire presented those surveyed with three possible answers (agree, disagree and neither agree nor disagree). The results reflect that there was consensus in the majority of situations presented. Only seven questions revealed disagreement among those responding. The results are presented as recommendations. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with BC presents unique challenges during the current world health situation produced by COVID-19 pandemic. Breast care specialists (surgical oncologists, breast care clinicians, clinical oncologists, radiation oncologists and radiologists) from 18 countries in Central and South America submitted through their responses and recommendations for the treatment of BC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Luis Pendola, G; Elizalde, Roberto; Vargas, Pablo Sitic; Mallarino, José Caicedo; González, Eduardo; Parada, José; Camus, Mauricio; Schwartz, Ricardo; Bargalló, Enrique; Freitas, Ruffo; Costa, Mauricio Magalhaes; de Oliveira, Vilmar Marques; Escobar, Paula; Oller, Miguel; Viaña, Luis Fernando; Bambino, Antonio Jurado; Sarria, Gustavo; Terrier, Francisco; Corrales, Roger; Sanabria, Valeria; Agostini, Juan Carlos Rodríguez; Chacón, Gonzalo Vargas; Pérez, Víctor Manuel; Avilés, Verónica; Galarreta, José; Laviña, Guillermo; Fuentes, Jorge Pérez; de Castellanos, Lía Bueso; Osorio, Bolívar Arboleda; Castillo, Herbert; Figueroa, Claudia",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209106/,199
666773,"Economic, social and political issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic",2020-08-20,"Many host pathogen interactions such as human viruses (including non-SARS-coronaviruses) rely on attachment to host cell-surface glycans. There are conflicting reports about whether the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to sialic acid commonly found on host cell-surface N-linked glycans. In the absence of a biochemical assay, the ability to analyze the binding of glycans to heavily- modified proteins and resolve this issue is limited. Classical Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR can be confounded by overlapping sugar resonances that compound with known experimental constraints. Here we present ‘universal saturation transfer analysis’ (uSTA), an NMR method that builds on existing approaches to provide a general and automated workflow for studying protein-ligand interactions. uSTA reveals that B-origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer binds sialoside sugars in an ‘end on’ manner and modelling guided by uSTA localises binding to the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). The sialylated-polylactosamine motif is found on tetraantennary human N-linked-glycoproteins in deeper lung and may have played a role in zoonosis. Provocatively, sialic acid binding is abolished by mutations in some subsequent SARS- CoV-2 variants-of-concern. A very high resolution cryo-EM structure confirms the NTD location and ‘end on’ mode; it rationalises the effect of NTD mutations and the structure-activity relationship of sialic acid analogues. uSTA is demonstrated to be a robust, rapid and quantitative tool for analysis of binding, even in the most demanding systems. Extended Abstract The surface proteins found on both pathogens and host cells mediate entry (and exit) and influence disease progression and transmission. Both types can bear host-generated post- translational modifications such as glycosylation that are essential for function but can confound biophysical methods used for dissecting key interactions. Several human viruses (including non- SARS-coronaviruses) attach to host cell-surface N-linked glycans that include forms of sialic acid (sialosides). There remains, however, conflicting evidence as to if or how SARS-associated coronaviruses might use such a mechanism. Here, we demonstrate quantitative extension of ‘saturation transfer’ protein NMR methods to a complete mathematical model of the magnetization transfer caused by interactions between protein and ligand. The method couples objective resonance-identification via a deconvolution algorithm with Bloch-McConnell analysis to enable a structural, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of ligand binding beyond previously-perceived limits of exchange rates, concentration or system. Using an automated and openly available workflow this ‘universal saturation transfer’ analysis (uSTA) can be readily-applied in a range of even heavily-modified systems in a general manner to now obtain quantitative binding interaction parameters (KD, kEx). uSTA proved critical in mapping direct interactions between natural sialoside sugar ligands and relevant virus-surface attachment glycoproteins – SARS-CoV-2-spike and influenza-H1N1-haemagglutinin variants – by quantitating ligand signal in spectral regions otherwise occluded by resonances from mobile protein glycans (that also include sialosides). In B- origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer ‘end on’-binding to sialoside sugars was revealed contrasting with ‘extended surface’-binding for heparin sugar ligands; uSTA-derived constraints used in structural modelling suggested sialoside-glycan binding sites in a beta-sheet-rich region of spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Consistent with this, uSTA-glycan binding was minimally- perturbed by antibodies that neutralize the ACE2-binding domain (RBD) but strongly disrupted in spike from the B1.1.7/alpha and B1.351/beta variants-of-concern, which possess hotspot mutations in the NTD. Sialoside binding in B-origin-lineage-NTD was unequivocally pinpointed by cryo-EM to a site that is created from residues that are notably deleted in variants (e.g. H69,V70,Y145 in alpha). An analysis of beneficial genetic variances in cohorts of patients from early 2020 suggests a model in which this site in the NTD of B-origin-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 (but not in alpha/beta-variants) may have exploited a specific sialylated-polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary human N-linked-glycoproteins in deeper lung. Together these confirm a novel binding mode mediated by the unusual NTD of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest how it may drive virulence and/or zoonosis via modulation of glycan attachment. Since cell-surface glycans are widely relevant to biology and pathology, uSTA can now provide ready, quantitative, widespread analysis of complex, host-derived and post-translationally modified proteins with putative ligands relevant to disease even in previously confounding complex systems.","Buchanan, Charles J.; Gaunt, Ben; Harrison, Peter J.; Yang, Yun; Liu, Jiwei; Khan, Aziz; Giltrap, Andrew M.; Bas, Audrey Le; Ward, Philip N.; Gupta, Kapil; Dumoux, Maud; Daga, Sergio; Picchiotti, Nicola; Baldassarri, Margherita; Benetti, Elisa; Fallerini, Chiara; Fava, Francesca; Giliberti, Annarita; Koukos, Panagiotis I.; Lakshminarayanan, Abirami; Xue, Xiaochao; Papadakis, Georgios; Deimel, Lachlan P.; Casablancas-Antràs, Virgínia; Claridge, Timothy D.W.; Bonvin, Alexandre M.J.J.; Sattentau, Quentin J.; Furini, Simone; Gori, Marco; Huo, Jiandong; Owens, Raymond J.; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Berger, Imre; Renieri, Alessandra; Naismith, James H.; Baldwin, Andrew; Davis, Benjamin G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.14.439284,199

PURPOSE: To report a case of ribavirin-associated severe hyperuricemia in an immunocompromised patient treated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. SUMMARY: A 21-year-old male with a past medical history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in full remission after allogenic bone marrow transplantation complicated with chronic graft-versus-host disease. He was hospitalized due to fever, malaise, and respiratory syndromes. A diagnosis of RSV upper respiratory tract infection complicated by secondary pneumonia was made, and oral ribavirin (600 mg in 3 divided doses daily) and intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) were initiated. On day 2 of the hospital admission, the patient’s uric acid levels had increased from a baseline of 4 to 6 mg/dL to values of 19.3 and 22.2 mg/dL after the fourth and fifth doses of ribavirin, respectively, and his serum creatinine steadily had increased from a baseline of 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL to a value of 1.6 mg/dL. Ribavirin was discontinued after the sixth dose, and a single dose of intravenous rasburicase (7.5 mg) was administered. On day 3, the patient’s serum uric and creatinine concentrations had decreased to 4.7 mg/dL and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. He continued to recover on antibiotics and was discharged with normal uric acid and serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: We report a case of severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury that developed early after initiation of ribavirin for RSV infection and suspected bacterial pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient without hepatitis C, requiring ribavirin discontinuation and rasburicase administration. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe hyperuricemia in a patient treated with ribavirin for RSV infection rather than chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute and severe hyperuricemia following ribavirin administration.","Sakran, Razan; Frisch, Avraham; Elias, Adi; Sliman, Hend; Ammuri, Hanna; Kurnik, Daniel",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617629/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab043,199

Ozone has been proposed as an effective disinfection method against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including viruses with similar morphology to SARS-CoV-2. Due to this efficacy, numerous gaseous and aqueous phase ozone applications have emerged potentially to inhibit virus persistence in aerosols, surfaces, and water. In this work, a numerical model, a RANS CFD model for ozone dispersion inside tram and underground coach has been developed including the chemical self-decomposition and surface reactions of the ozone. The CFD model has been developed for a real tram coach of 28.6 ×2.4 ×2.2 m (L x W x H) using 1.76 million nodes and the Menter’s shear stress transport turbulence model. The model predicts the O(3) concentration needed to meet disinfection criteria and the fluid dynamics inside the public transport coach. The effectiveness of the system against disinfection and virus inactivation has been validated with laboratory and field tests in real full-scale coach against the inactivation of cytopathogenic porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and murine norovirus (MNV-1) as SARS-CoV-2 virus surrogates. Lab-scale experiments on plastic surfaces demonstrated O(3) disinfection inactivate >99.8% murine norovirus (MNV-1) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) used as enteric virus and SARS-CoV-2 surrogates, respectively. Additionally, field tests in real full-scale coach gives virus inactivation as >98.6% of infectious MNV-1 and >96.3% PEDV were inactivated.","Falcó, Irene; Randazzo, Walter; Sánchez, Gloria; Vilarroig, Jose; Climent, Javier; Chiva, Sergio; Chica, A.; Navarro-Laboulais, J.",J Environ Chem Eng,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2021.106217; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343721011945?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422551/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213343721011945,199

AIM: To compare 2 different period (from March 9 to April 9 2019 and from March 9 to April 9 2020), searching differences in terms of number and type of interventions in emergency surgery of a main University Hospital in Ferrara, a city in Emilia Romagna region, North of Italy. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out at the General Surgery Department of Sant’Anna University Hospital in Ferrara, Italy. We examined the number of emergency surgeries performed and patient outcomes during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and subsequent total lockdown. We then drew a comparison with the number of surgeries performed and their outcomes during the same period in 2019. The study examined all adult patients who underwent emergency surgery from March 9 to April 9, 2019 (n = 46), and those who underwent surgery during the first month of the lockdown, from March 9 to April 9, 2020 (n = 27). Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification scores and types of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients underwent emergency surgery at Sant’Anna University Hospital in Ferrara during the first month of the lockdown. This represents a 41.3% reduction in the number of patients who were hospitalized and underwent emergency surgery compared to the same period in 2019. The complication rate during the pandemic period was substantially higher than it was during the analogous period in 2019: 15 out of 27 cases from March 9 to April 9, 2020 (55) vs 17 out of 46 cases from March 9 to April 9, 2019 (36.9). Of the 27 patients who underwent emergency surgery during the pandemic, 10 were screened for COVID-19 using both thorax high resolution computerized tomography and a naso-pharyngeal swab, while 9 only underwent thorax high resolution computerized tomography. Only 1 patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and died following surgery. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in emergency surgeries at our center during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is plausible that there were analogous reductions at other centers across Italy.","D'Urbano, Francesco; Fabbri, Nicolò; Koleva Radica, Margherita; Rossin, Eleonora; Carcoforo, Paolo",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953845/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i17.3691,199

COVID-19 pandemic has impacted negatively on economy, health, education and infrastructure globally. COVID-19 vaccine was developed with the aim of stopping the pandemic and allowing the rebuilding of our societies and economies. The vaccine was rolled out in December 2020 and the distribution plan appears to be skewed in favour of high income countries. This paper highlights the need for consideration of the principles of equity and universal health coverage in the distribution plan of the vaccine. It emphasizes the need to ensure that the interests of citizens of developing and low income countries are well protected. The paper concludes that issues of disparity in economic status of countries entering agreement with the vaccine manufacturing companies, absence of logistic support among others should not be a barrier to ensuring equitable access to vaccine for all consistent with the sustainable development goal 3.7.","Adejumo, Oludamilola Adebola; Adejumo, Oluseyi Ademola",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.39.197.29041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603578/,199
669669,Pattern of disinfectants use and their adverse effects on the consumers after COVID-19 outbreak,2020-09-30,"INTRODUCTION: The use of devices that provide continuous positive pressure in the airway has shown improvement in various pathologies that cause respiratory failure. In the COVID-19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, alternative devices have been manufactured. The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data are collected from patients admitted for pneumonia due to COVID-19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital. Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA. Alternative CPAP was used in five patients (21.7%), while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients (78.3%). A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used (from 94% on average to 98 and 99% on average after 30 and 60 minutes with the mask, respectively), although this change was not significant (p = 0.058 and p = 0.122, respectively). No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.423), but among those who did not use alternative CPAP (p = 0.001). A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation / fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.040) CONCLUSION: The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters. To better observe the evolution of patients undergoing this therapy and compare them with patients with other types of ventilatory support, further studies are necessary.","Mateos-Rodríguez, Alonso; Ortega-Anselmi, Justo; Candel-González, Francisco Javier; Canora-Lebrato, Jesús; Fragiel-Saavedra, Marcos; Hernández-Píriz, Alba; Behzadi-Koocahni, Navid; González-del Castillo, Juan; Pérez-Alonso, Antonio; de la Cruz-Conty, María Luisa; García-de Casasola, Gonzalo; Marco-Martínez, Javier; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio",Med Clin (Barc),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025775320307326; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775320307326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239247/,199
670263,"A hierarchical spatio-temporal model to analyze relative risk variations of COVID-19: a focus on Spain, Italy and Germany",2021-03-23,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has given rise to the devastating global pandemic. In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as “coronavirus disease 2019” or COVID-19. Intriguingly, besides the respiratory tract, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems of the human body. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection itself may cause myocardial inflammation and injury. One possible explanation of such phenomena is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor required for viral entry. ACE2 is expressed in the cells of many organs, including the heart. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase that can cleave several endogenous substrates, including angiotensin II, thus regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It remains largely unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the enzymatic properties of ACE2, thereby contributing to cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that ACE2 cleavage of des-Arg9-bradykinin substrate analog is markedly accelerated, while cleavage of angiotensin II analog is minimally affected by the binding of spike protein. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Kiseleva, Anna A; Troisi, Elizabeth M; Hensley, Scott E; Kohli, Rahul M; Epstein, Jonathan A",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774672/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab041,199

Identification of aggregates has become a useful diagnostic tool for certain viral infections. There is wide variety of viral aggregates, which differ by their location, size, content and putative function. The role of aggregation in the context of a specific virus is often poorly understood, especially in the case of plant viruses. The aggregates are utilized by viruses to house a large complex of proteins of both viral and host origin to promote virus replication, translation, intra- and intercellular transportation. Aggregated structures may protect viral functional complexes from the cellular degradation machinery. Alternatively, the activation of host defense mechanisms may involve sequestration of virus components in aggregates, followed by their neutralization as toxic for the host cell. The diversity of virus-induced aggregates in mammalian and plant cells is the subject of this review.","Moshe, Adi; Gorovits, Rena",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v4102218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202461/,199

This paper shares the perspectives of expert clinicians working with OCD considering how to identify OCD in the context of COVID-19, changes in the presentation, and importantly what to consider when undertaking cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for OCD in the current climate. The expert consensus is that although the presentation of OCD and treatment may have become more difficult, CBT should still continue remotely unless there are specific reasons for it not to, e.g. increase in risk, no access to computer, or exposure tasks or behavioural experiments cannot be undertaken. The authors highlight some of the considerations to take in CBT in light of our current understanding of COVID-19, including therapists and clients taking calculated risks when developing behavioural experiments and exposure tasks, considering viral loading and vulnerability factors. Special considerations for young people and perinatal women are discussed, as well as foreseeing what life may be like for those with OCD after the pandemic is over. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1)..

Developments during this period often resulted from new therapies (and their adverse effects) necessitating greater precision in the histopathological classification of disease, for which morphology alone can be insufficient. Conversely, histopathology has contributed to advances in our understanding of disease, leading directly to novel and more effective treatments. New infections, some involving histopathology in their discovery, have also led to fresh diagnostic challenges. Increasingly, patients have benefited from fundamental changes in professionalism in pathology. Through audit, external quality assurance, continuing professional development, standardized reporting, and increasing specialization, the consistency and reliability of histopathological diagnoses have steadily improved. Regarding the specialty's future, some now see rivalry between the morphological and molecular approaches to diagnosis and classification, particularly for neoplastic disease. An integrated strategy led by the specialty is more likely to strengthen histopathology and ultimately to have the greatest benefit for patients.","Underwood, James C E",Histopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27960234/; https://doi.org/10.1111/his.13047,199

For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load, viral culture, and virus neutralization assays were performed weekly. For SARS-CoV-2 negative HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month after inclusion. Among the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 65/67 (97.0%) developed mild form of COVID-19. Other respiratory pathogens were found in 6/66 (9.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 47/241 (19.5%) SARS-Cov-2 negative HCWs (p = 0.07).

676960,"COVID-19: Pandemic Risk, Resilience and Possibilities for Aging Research",2020-05-19,"Background: In this study, we focused on communicating with cancer patients on active treatment during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the patient’s main sources of pandemic information. Methods: In the first wave of the pandemic, during the first lockdown, we conducted an observational study in 8 of the 13 oncology centers in Croatia. The study is based on an anonymous self-report questionnaire designed for this study. It included 422 oncology patients, older than 18 years, who were in active oncology treatment at the time. To study the correlation between the patient’s perspective on communicating with medical staff during a pandemic, the preferred type of communication, and the main sources of pandemic information relative to clinical and sociodemographic data, we used univariate descriptive and bivariate analyzes. Results: In the first lockdown, our respondents communicated with the oncologist and oncology nurses mostly in-person (77.7% vs. 81%), and with the general practitioner mostly virtually, most often by phone (70.6%). Regardless of the pandemic, the majority of oncology patients (76.1%) prefer to communicate with an oncologist in-person, and most expressed satisfaction with communicating with medical staff during a pandemic. The choice of information sources and type of communication depends on the age, gender, income, education, and the seat of the disease of patients. Conclusions: For most of our respondents, in-person visits were the basic way of communicating with oncologists and oncology nurses. On the other hand, a virtual visit was the basic way to communicate with the general practitioner. As patients stated that, regardless of the pandemic, they prefer to communicate with the oncologist in-person, we can conclude that the virtual visit does not meet the needs of cancer patients who are in active oncology treatment. In our study men showed a tendency to communicate in-person, while women, breast cancer patients, younger people, highly educated people, and people of higher income are more prone to virtual visits and are more inclined to use the Internet as a source of information about a pandemic.

677823,The political economy of the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-02-12,"Viral infections are closely linked to wheezing illnesses in children of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main causative agent of bronchiolitis, whereas rhinovirus (RV) is most commonly detected in wheezing children thereafter. Severe respiratory illness induced by either of these viruses is associated with subsequent development of asthma, and the risk is greatest for young children who wheeze with RV infections. Whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma is the subject of intense debate. RSV-induced wheezing illnesses during infancy influence respiratory health for years. There is definitive evidence that RSV-induced bronchiolitis can damage the airways to promote airway obstruction and recurrent wheezing. RV likely causes less structural damage and yet is a significant contributor to wheezing illnesses in young children and in the context of asthma. For both viruses, interactions between viral virulence factors, personal risk factors (eg, genetics), and environmental exposures (eg, airway microbiome) promote more severe wheezing illnesses and the risk for progression to asthma. In addition, allergy and asthma are major risk factors for more frequent and severe RV-related illnesses. Treatments that inhibit inflammation have efficacy for RV-induced wheezing, whereas the anti-RSV mAb palivizumab decreases the risk of severe RSV-induced illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. Developing a greater understanding of personal and environmental factors that promote more severe viral illnesses might lead to new strategies for the prevention of viral wheezing illnesses and perhaps reduce the subsequent risk for asthma.","Jartti, Tuomas; Gern, James E.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917313453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987219/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917313453,199

Single variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify mortality-related factors. We combined multiple factors to predict mortality, which was validated by receiver operating characteristic curves. As a result, in a total of 336 patients, 34 (10.1%) patients died during hospitalisation. Through multivariable logistic regression, we found that decreased lymphocyte ratio (Lymr, %) (odds ratio, OR 0.574, P < 0.001), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (OR 1.513, P = 0.009), and raised D-dimer (DD) (OR 1.334, P = 0.002) at admission were closely related to death. The combined prediction model was developed by these factors with a sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 97.2%. In conclusion, decreased Lymr, elevated BUN, and raised DD were found to be in association with death outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. A scoring system was developed to predict the clinical outcome of these patients.","Liu, Q.; Song, N. C.; Zheng, Z. K.; Li, J. S.; Li, S.

680204,Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on Asia-Europe relations,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A significant number of reported COVID-19 cases can be traced back to superspreader events (SSEs), where a disproportionally large number of secondary cases relative to the standard reproductive rate, R0, are initiated. Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: ‘societal’ and ‘isolated’ SSEs. METHODS: We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ‘Societal’ SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, ‘isolated’ SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.","Majra, Dasha; Benson, Jayme; Pitts, Jennifer; Stebbing, Justin",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320307179?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320307179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245943/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.11.021,199

Quality training experiences must be maintained to produce competent pharmacy practitioners and maintain program standards. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of postgraduate pharmacy trainees in the United States was conducted to evaluate training experience changes and assess perceived impacts on residents and fellows following the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset. RESULTS: From June 4 through June 22, 2020, 511 pharmacy trainees in 46 states completed the survey. Participants’ median age was 26 (interquartile range [IQR], 25-28) years, with included responses from postgraduate year 1 residents (54% of sample), postgraduate year 2 residents (40%), and postgraduate fellows (6%). Compared to experiences prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer trainees conducted direct patient care (38.5% vs 91.4%, P < 0.001), more worked from home (31.7% vs 1.6%, P < 0.001), and less time was spent with preceptors per day (2 [IQR, 2-6] hours vs 4 [IQR, 1-4] hours, P < 0.001). Sixty-five percent of respondents reported experiencing changes in their training program, 39% reported being asked to work in areas outside of their routine training experience, and 89% stated their training shifted to focus on COVID-19 to some degree. Most respondents perceived either major (9.6%) or minor (52.0%) worsening in quality of experience, with major and minor improvement in quality of experience reported by 5.5% and 8.4% of respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pharmacy resident/fellow experiences were perceived to have been extensively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in varying ways. Our findings describe shifts in postgraduate training and may aid in the development of best practices for optimizing trainee experiences in future crises.","Moore, W Justin; Webb, Andrew; Morrisette, Taylor; Sullivan, Louisa K; Alosaimy, Sara; Hossain, Shahrier; Howe, Zachary; Vlashyn, Olga O; Paloucek, Frank P; Rybak, Michael J; Wang, Sheila K",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740818/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab114,199

In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry. Of special relevance are the methodologies which can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices and the use of artificial intelligence that do not require products from a well-developed biotech industry.","Mattioli, Isabela A.; Hassan, Ayaz; Oliveira, Osvaldo N.; Crespilho, Frank N.",ACS Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267587/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01382,199
684618,Effectiveness of Testing and Contact-Tracing to Counter COVID-19 Pandemic: Designed Experiments of Agent-Based Simulation,2021-05-24,"Anthropogenic climate change is adversely impacting people and contributing to suffering and increased costs from climate-related diseases and injuries. In responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis, mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and/or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems’ resilience to future impacts. While these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself, they also often have other positive externalities or health co-benefits. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) considered health in the thinking, but health outcomes were not their primary intention. Additionally, existing guidance documents such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience. However, a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework, which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point, has not yet been developed to guide research in this area. In this paper, we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health, describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies, and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high, middle, and low-income settings. We then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity.","Bikomeye, Jean C.; Rublee, Caitlin S.; Beyer, Kirsten M.

A Perspective on Early Communication During COVID-19,2020-11-09,"Summary Regardless of their genetic constitution, viral genomes are replicated, expressed, and assembled in association with living host cells. These entities do not undergo division, but rather generate new particles through the assembly of preformed components. Some viruses go further by modifying cellular metabolism to create a more favorable environment for viral gene expression. In a few instances, these clever strategies also facilitate escape from the host’s defense responses. The process of replication is typically divided into the phases of attachment, entry, uncoating, genome replication and expression, assembly, maturation, and finally, egress or release from the host cell. In this chapter, we address genome replication and expression, including the multiple strategies that serve to control gene expression and ensure preferential propagation of the virus.","Rampersad, Sephra; Tennant, Paula",Viruses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128112571000036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128112571000036,199

We collected 64 air samples from COVID and non-COVID areas of various hospitals and 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by COVID patients. 4 samples from COVID care areas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious predilection towards ICU/non-ICU areas in the hospital samples. In the closed room experiments, where one or more COVID-19 patients spent a short duration of time, one sample - collected immediately after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the room - was positive. Our results indicate that the chance of picking up SARS-CoV-2 in the air is directly related to a number of COVID positive cases in the room, their symptomatic status, and the duration of exposure and that the demarcation of hospital areas into COVID and non-COVID areas is a successful strategy to prevent cross infections.

688320,Tracking the global reduction of marine traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-27,"Summary Introduction: COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for physicians and scientists. Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. Methods: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with “off-label” use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus-disease-2019. Results: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 102 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (85%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%). There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7 %), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them “serious” (64%), 48 of which proved ≥ 500 ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%). Six reports derived from automedication. Discussion and conclusion: “Off-label” use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable. Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection. Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.","Gérard, Alexandre; Romani, Serena; Fresse, Audrey; Viard, Delphine; Parassol, Nadège; Granvuillemin, Aurélie; Chouchana, Laurent; Rocher, Fanny; Drici, Milou-Daniel",Therapie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418730/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300913?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300913,199
688976,"A Possible Future in Medical, Psycho-Social and Moral Fields",2020,"PURPOSE: Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency medical consultation. While simple appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics or surgery, complex appendicitis including gangrene, abscess, and perforation requires appendectomy. During the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, an overall drop in emergency room consultations was observed. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence and treatment strategies of acute appendicitis during that period. METHODS: Data of insurance holders with the ICD code for “acute appendicitis” or OPS procedure of appendectomy of a major health insurance company in Germany were analyzed retrospectively. Groups were built, containing of the means of March–June of 2017, 2018, and 2019, defined as “pre-COVID group” with the “COVID group,” defined as data from March to June of 2020. Data was analyzed by age, sex, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, diagnoses, and treatment. Data of the COVID group was analyzed for simultaneous COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic of early 2020, an overall reduction by 12.9% of patients presenting with acute appendicitis was noticeable. These results were mainly due to decreased rates of uncomplicated appendicitis, while complicated appendicitis was scarcely affected. Especially in the group of females < 40 years, a drastic reduction was visible. Rates of extended surgery did not change. Likewise, the complication rate like appendix stump leakage or need for re-operation did not differ. In March 2020, 4.8% of acute appendicitis patients had concomitant COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: In line with the overall drop of emergency room visits during the COVID-19 pandemic of spring 2020 in Germany, a significantly lowered number of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis were noticeable, whereas complicated appendicitis did not differ. Also, treatment and complication rate of acute appendicitis did not change. These findings might be a hint that acute appendicitis is not a progressing disease but caused by different entities for uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis and therefore another clue that uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics or observation. Nevertheless provided data does not cover outpatient treatment; therefore, no statement observation or antibiotics in outpatients can be made.","Köhler, Franziska; Acar, Laura; van den Berg, Anne; Flemming, Sven; Kastner, Carolin; Müller, Sophie; Diers, Johannes; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Lock, Johann F.; L’hoest, Helmut; Marschall, Ursula; Wiegering, Armin",Langenbecks Arch Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-021-02081-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420517/,199

At present, the researchers focus on possibility to use IVM in treatment of certain forms of cancer and viral diseases such as COVID-19. The mechanisms of IVM action are not clear. It is assumed that IVM affects chloride channels and increases cytoplasmic concentration of chloride. This study examines the effect of IVM on chloride currents induced by glycine (I(Gly)). Experiments were carried out on isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus with whole-cell patch clamp. A short-term (600 msec) application of IVM in a concentration of 10 μM induced a slow inward current, which persisted after washing the neurons. The low concentrations (0.1-1000 nM) of IVM did not induce any novel current, but it rapidly and reversibly reduced the peak amplitude and accelerated desensitization of I(Gly) in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentrations of IVM sufficient to reduce peak amplitude of I(Gly) and to accelerate desensitization of I(Gly) were 100 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively.

This study examined the effects of a cognitive method, namely psychological inoculation (PI) + health information (experimental) versus health information alone (control) on anxiety, resilience and adherence. DESIGN A randomized controlled trial was used. Participants were assigned to the experimental or control conditions, all provided on an automatized computerized system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES These included anxiety, adherence to the Covid-19 Israeli health ministry's recommendations, and mental resilience. Participants were assessed before, immediately after and a week after the interventions. RESULTS Controls increased only in adherence at 1 week compared to baseline. In contrast, those in the PI increased in resilience and adherence and reported lower anxiety immediately after treatment compared to baseline levels. In the PI condition, degree of refuting challenging sentences correlated with less anxiety.

690791,CORONAVIRUS-RELATED HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2016-2017,2020-10-31,"Considering the similarities with other pandemics due to respiratory virus infections and subsequent development of neurological disorders (e.g. encephalitis lethargica after the 1918 influenza), there is growing concern about a possible new wave of neurological complications following the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson’s disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient’s FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","Morassi, Mauro; Palmerini, Francesco; Nici, Stefania; Magni, Eugenio; Savelli, Giordano; Guerra, Ugo Paolo; Chieregato, Matteo; Morbelli, Silvia; Vogrig, Alberto",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884450/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10560-3,199
