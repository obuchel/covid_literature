13283,Erratum regarding previously published articles,2020-10-14,"Aging, defined by a decrease in the physical and functional integrity of the tissues, leads to age-associated degenerative diseases. There is a relation between aged dental pulp and the senescence of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular processes underlying the senescence of DPSCs to elucidate the dental pulp aging mechanisms. p-Cresol (PC), a uremic toxin, is strongly related to cellular senescence. Here, age-related phenotypic changes including senescence, apoptosis, inflammation, and declining odontoblast differentiation in PC-treated canine DPSCs were investigated. Under the PC condition, cellular senescence was induced by decreased proliferation capacity and increased cell size, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, and senescence markers p21, IL-1β, IL-8, and p53. Exposure to PC could stimulate inflammation by the increased expression of IL-6 and cause the distraction of the cell cycle by the increased level of Bax protein and decreased Bcl-2. The levels of odontoblast differentiation markers, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1, and osterix, were decreased. Consistent with those findings, the alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase, and DSPP protein level were decreased during the odontoblast differentiation process. Taken together, these findings indicate that PC could induce cellular senescence in DPSCs, which may demonstrate the changes in aging dental pulp.","Zayed, Mohammed; Iohara, Koichiro",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555360/,442
15078,Temporal Trends in Incidence Rates of Lower Extremity Amputation and Associated Risk Factors Among Patients Using Veterans Health Administration Services From 2008 to 2018,2021-01-22,"Sepsis is the life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. With an estimated 48.9 million patients being affected by sepsis every year, sepsis is one of the most common diseases worldwide. Approximately 20% of global deaths are considered as sepsis-related. In Germany, a study based on nationwide hospital discharge data of almost all German hospitals found a sepsis incidence of 158 per 100,000 inhabitants. Estimates based on clinical patient data from other industrialized countries were 780/100,000 (Sweden) and 517/100,000 (USA). However, the comparability of incidence rates is limited due to the different data sources and sepsis case identification strategies used. In all, 41.7% of sepsis patients died in hospital, and 17.9% of intensive care unit patients are affected by sepsis. Case identification of sepsis in health claims data has a low sensitivity; therefore, it is likely that sepsis incidence is underestimated using these data, as many sepsis cases are not coded as such. For the purpose of epidemiological surveillance, health claims data should be complemented by other data sources such as registries or electronic health records.","Fleischmann-Struzek, C.; Schwarzkopf, D.; Reinhart, K.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7841759/,442
16199,2020 ACVIM Forum On Demand Research Abstract Program,2020-10-10,"Thyroid hormone (TH) regulates many functions including metabolism, cell differentiation, and nervous system development. Alteration of thyroid hormone level in the body can lead to nervous system-related problems linked to cognition, visual attention, visual processing, motor skills, language, and memory skills. TH has also been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Males and females display sex-specific differences in neuronal signaling. Steroid hormones including testosterone and estrogen are considered to be the prime regulators for programing the neuronal signaling in a male- and female-specific manner. However, other than steroid hormones, TH could also be one of the key signaling molecules to regulate different brain signaling in a male- and female-specific manner. Thyroid-related diseases and neurological diseases show sex-specific incidence; however, the molecular mechanisms behind this are not clear. Hence, it will be very beneficial to understand how TH acts in male and female brains and what are the critical genes and signaling networks. In this review, we have highlighted the role of TH in nervous system regulation and disease outcome and given special emphasis on its sex-specific role in male and female brains. A network model is also presented that provides critical information on TH-regulated genes, signaling, and disease.","Baksi, Shounak; Pradhan, Ajay",Biol Sex Differ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971120/,442
21031,Evaluation of Technology-Enabled Monitoring of Patient-Reported Outcomes to Detect and Treat Toxic Effects Linked to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,2021-08-30,"Value-based initiatives are growing in importance as strategic models of healthcare management, prompting the need for an in-depth exploration of their outcome measures. This systematic review aimed to identify measures that are being used in the application of the value agenda. Multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched. Eligible studies reported various implementations of value-based healthcare initiatives. A qualitative approach was used to analyze their outcome measurements. Outcomes were classified according to a tier-level hierarchy. In a radar chart, we compared literature to cases from Harvard Business Publishing. The value agenda effect reported was described in terms of its impact on each domain of the value equation. A total of 7,195 records were retrieved; 47 studies were included. Forty studies used electronic health record systems for data origin. Only 16 used patient-reported outcome surveys to cover outcome tiers that are important to patients, and 3 reported outcomes to all 6 levels of our outcome measures hierarchy. A considerable proportion of the studies (36%) reported results that contributed to value-based financial outcomes focused on cost savings. However, a gap remains in measuring outcomes that matter to patients. A more complete application of the value agenda by health organizations requires advances in technology and culture change management.","Zanotto, Bruna Stella; Etges, Ana Paula Beck da Silva; Marcolino, Miriam Allein Zago; Polanczyk, Carisi Anne",J Healthc Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423138/,442

21974,Errors in Table and Figure,2021-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Little guidance exists regarding how best to upskill and support those delivering complex healthcare interventions to ensure robust trial outcomes and implementation fidelity. Mentoring was provided to occupational therapists (OTs) delivering a complex vocational rehabilitation (VR) intervention to stroke survivors. This study aimed to explore mentors’ roles in supporting OTs with intervention delivery and fidelity, and to describe factors affecting the mentoring process and intervention delivery. METHODS: Quantitative data (duration, mode and total time of mentoring support) was extracted from mentoring records and emails between mentors and OTs, alongside qualitative data on barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery. Semi-structured interviews with mentors (n = 6) and OTs (n = 19) explored experiences and perceptions of intervention training, delivery and the mentoring process. Mean total and monthly time spent mentoring were calculated per trial site. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Forty-one OTs across 16 sites were mentored between March 2018 and April 2020. Most mentoring was provided by phone or Microsoft Teams (range: 88.6–100%), with the remainder via email and SMS (Short Message Service) text messages. Mentors suggested strategies to enhance trial recruitment, improved OTs’ understanding of- and adherence to trial processes, intervention delivery and fidelity, and facilitated independent problem-solving. Barriers to mentoring included OT non-attendance at mentoring sessions and mentors struggling to balance mentoring with clinical roles. Facilitators included support from the trial team and mentors having protected time for mentoring. CONCLUSIONS: Mentoring supported mentee OTs in various ways, but it remains unclear to what extent the OTS would have been able to deliver the intervention without mentoring support, or how this might have impacted fidelity. Successful implementation of mentoring alongside new complex interventions may increase the likelihood of intervention effectiveness being observed and sustained in real-life contexts. Further research is needed to investigate how mentors could be selected, upskilled, funded and mentoring provided to maximise impact. The clinical- and cost-effectiveness of mentoring as an implementation strategy and its impact on fidelity also requires testing in a future trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12464275.

22313,Oral Research Communications of the 23rd ECVIM‐CA Congress,2013-12-26,"The increasing antimicrobial-resistant prevalence has become a severe health problem. It has led to the invention of a new antimicrobial agent such as antimicrobial peptides. Heteroscorpine-1 is an antimicrobial peptide that has the ability to kill many bacterial strains. It consists of 76 amino acid residues with a cecropin-like region in N-terminal and a defensin-like region in the C-terminal. The cecropin-like region from heteroscorpine-1 (CeHS-1) is similar to cecropin B, but it lost its glycine-proline hinge region. The bioinformatics prediction was used to help the designing of mutant peptides. The addition of glycine-proline hinge and positively charged amino acids, the deletion of negatively charged amino acids, and the optimization of the hydrophobicity of the peptide resulted in two mutant peptides, namely, CeHS-1 GP and CeHS-1 GPK. The new mutant peptide showed higher antimicrobial activity than the native peptide without increasing toxicity. The interaction of the peptides with the membrane showed that the peptides were capable of disrupting both the inner and outer bacterial cell membrane. Furthermore, the SEM analysis showed that the peptides created the pore in the bacterial cell membrane resulted in cell membrane disruption. In conclusion, the mutants of CeHS-1 had the potential to develop as novel antimicrobial peptides.","Erviana, Rima; Saengkun, Yutthakan; Rungsa, Prapenpuksiri; Jangpromma, Nisachon; Tippayawat, Patcharaporn; Klaynongsruang, Sompong; Daduang, Jureerut; Daduang, Sakda",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512776/,442

However, the complexity of this brain process makes the analysis and classification of this type of signals a relevant topic of research. The goals of this study were: to develop a new algorithm based on Deep Learning (DL), referred to as CNNeeg1-1, to recognize EEG signals in imagined vowel tasks; to create an imagined speech database with 50 subjects specialized in imagined vowels from the Spanish language (/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/); and to contrast the performance of the CNNeeg1-1 algorithm with the DL Shallow CNN and EEGNet benchmark algorithms using an open access database (BD1) and the newly developed database (BD2). In this study, a mixed variance analysis of variance was conducted to assess the intra-subject and inter-subject training of the proposed algorithms. The results show that for intra-subject training analysis, the best performance among the Shallow CNN, EEGNet, and CNNeeg1-1 methods in classifying imagined vowels (/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/) was exhibited by CNNeeg1-1, with an accuracy of 65.62% for BD1 database and 85.66% for BD2 database.","Sarmiento, Luis Carlos; Villamizar, Sergio; López, Omar; Collazos, Ana Claros; Sarmiento, Jhon; Rodríguez, Jan Bacca",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512781/,442
22319,2015 ACVIM Forum Research Abstract Program,2015-05-27,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are one of the leading causes of death and disability in humans. From a mechanistic perspective, the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms contributes to NDDs. Therefore, there is an urgency to provide novel multi-target agents towards the simultaneous modulation of dysregulated pathways against NDDs. Besides, their lack of effectiveness and associated side effects have contributed to the lack of conventional therapies as suitable therapeutic agents. Prevailing reports have introduced plant secondary metabolites as promising multi-target agents in combating NDDs. Polydatin is a natural phenolic compound, employing potential mechanisms in fighting NDDs. It is considered an auspicious phytochemical in modulating neuroinflammatory/apoptotic/autophagy/oxidative stress signaling mediators such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response elements (ARE), matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), interleukins (ILs), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Accordingly, polydatin potentially counteracts Alzheimer’s disease, cognition/memory dysfunction, Parkinson’s disease, brain/spinal cord injuries, ischemic stroke, and miscellaneous neuronal dysfunctionalities. The present study provides all of the neuroprotective mechanisms of polydatin in various NDDs. Additionally, the novel delivery systems of polydatin are provided regarding increasing its safety, solubility, bioavailability, and efficacy, as well as developing a long-lasting therapeutic concentration of polydatin in the central nervous system, possessing fewer side effects.","Fakhri, Sajad; Gravandi, Mohammad Mehdi; Abdian, Sadaf; Akkol, Esra Küpeli; Farzaei, Mohammad Hosein; Sobarzo-Sánchez, Eduardo",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513080/,442
22321,2014 ACVIM Forum Research Abstracts Program,2014-04-28,BACKGROUND: Disasters may result in mass casualties and an imbalance between health care demands and supplies. This imbalance necessitates the prioritization of the victims based on the severity of their condition. Contributing factors and their effect on decision-making is a challenging issue in disaster triage. The present study seeks to address criteria for ethical decision-making in the prioritization of patients in disaster triage. METHODS: This conventional content analysis study was conducted in 2017. Subjects were selected from among Iranian experts using purposeful and snowball sampling methods. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and were analyzed by the content analysis. RESULTS: Efficient and effective triage and priority-oriented triage were the main categories. These categories summarized a number of medical and nonmedical factors that should be considered in the prioritization of the victims in disaster triage. CONCLUSION: A combination of measures should be considered to maximize the benefits of the prioritization of causalities in disasters. None of these measures alone would suffice to explain all aspects of ethical decision-making in disaster triage. Further investigations are needed to elaborate on these criteria in decision-making.

22337,2016 ACVIM Forum Research Abstract Program,2016-05-31,"The purpose of this narrative review is to bring together the most recent epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical findings to offer our perspective on best practices for managing patients with A. baumannii infections with an emphasis on carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB). To date, the preferred treatment for CRAB infections has not been defined. Traditional agents with retained in vitro activity (aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and tetracyclines) are limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetic characteristics, emergence of resistance, and/or toxicity. Recently developed and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor agents do not provide enhanced activity against CRAB. On balance, cefiderocol and eravacycline demonstrate potent in vitro activity and are well tolerated, but clinical data for patients with CRAB infections do not yet support widespread use. Given that CRAB has the capacity to infect vulnerable patients and preferred regimens have not been identified, we advocate for combination therapy. Our preferred regimen for critically ill patients infected, or considered to be at high risk for CRAB, includes meropenem, polymyxin B, and ampicillin/sulbactam. Importantly, site of infection, severity of illness, and local epidemiology are essential factors to be considered in selecting combination therapies. Molecular mechanisms of resistance may unveil preferred combinations at individual centers; however, such data are often unavailable to treating clinicians and have not been linked to improved clinical outcomes. Combination strategies may also pose an increased risk for antibiotic toxicity and Clostridioides difficile infection, and should therefore be balanced by understanding patient goals of care and underlying health conditions. Promising therapies that are in clinical development and/or under investigation include durlobactam–sulbactam, cefiderocol combination regimens, and bacteriophage therapy, which may over time eliminate the need for the continued use of polymyxins. Future goals for CRAB management include pathogen-focused treatment paradigms that are based on molecular mechanisms of resistance, local susceptibility rates, and the availability of well-tolerated, effective treatment options.","Abdul-Mutakabbir, Jacinda C.; Griffith, Nicole C.; Shields, Ryan K.; Tverdek, Frank P.; Escobar, Zahra Kassamali",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514811/,442

30835,Research Abstract Program of the 12(th) Annual ACVIM Forum,2008-06-28,"A generalized computer model of forest growth and nutrient dynamics (LINKAGES) was adapted for the temperate evergreen forests of New Zealand. Systematic differences in species characteristics between eastern North American species and their New Zealand counterparts prevented the initial version of the model from running acceptably with New Zealand species. Several equations were identified as responsible, and those modeling available light were extended to give more robust formulations. The resulting model (LINKNZ) was evaluated by comparing site simulations against independent field measurements of stand sequences and across temperature and moisture gradients. It successfully simulated gap dynamics and forest succession for a range of temperate forest ecosystems in New Zealand, while retaining its utility for the forests of eastern North America. These simulations provided insight into New Zealand conifer–hardwood and beech species forest succession. The adequacy of the ecological processes, such as soil moisture balance, decomposition rates, and nutrient cycling, embodied in a forest simulation model was tested by applying it to New Zealand forest ecosystems. This gave support to the model’s underlying hypothesis, derived from LINKAGES, that interactions among demographic, microbial, and geological processes can explain much of the observed variation in ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and cycling. The addition of a disturbance option to the model supported the hypothesis that large‐scale disturbance significantly affects New Zealand forest dynamics.","Hall, Graeme M.

The primary causal agent is Clostridium perfringens type C. The β‐toxin plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of this disease. A toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials. The European Pharmacopoeia Monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits, the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti‐toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin. The vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 IU of β‐anti‐toxin per ml of rabbit serum. We have established a range of 17.14–98.23 IU β‐anti‐toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of C. perfringens toxoid vaccine. The vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time, mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease. The outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses.

64439,House modifications for preventing malaria.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND Examining social networks, characterized by interpersonal interactions across family, peer, school, and neighborhoods, offer alternative explanations to suicidal behaviors and shape effective suicide prevention. This study examines adolescent social networks predicting suicide ideation and attempt trajectories transitioning to adulthood, while revealing differences across racial/ethnic, sex, sexual identity, and socioeconomic status. METHODS Participants included 9421 high school students (Mage = 15.30 years; 54.58% females, baseline) from Waves I-IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, 1994-2008. Latent class growth analyses were conducted to identify suicide ideation and attempt trajectories. Multivariate multinomial logistic regressions examined the relationships between social network characteristics during adolescence and suicidal trajectories. Interaction terms between social networks and sociodemographic characteristics were included to test moderation effects. RESULTS Three suicidal ideation trajectories (low-stable, high-decreasing, moderate-decreasing-increasing) and two suicide attempt trajectories (low-stable, moderate-decreasing) were identified. Greater family cohesion significantly reduced the probability of belonging to high-decreasing (Trajectory 2) and moderate-decreasing-increasing (Trajectory 3) suicidal ideation trajectories, and moderate-decreasing (Trajectory 2) suicide attempt trajectory. Race/ethnicity, sex, and sexual identity significantly moderated the associations between social networks (household size, peer network density, family cohesion, peer support, neighborhood support) and suicidal trajectories. CONCLUSIONS Social networks during adolescence influenced the odds of belonging to distinct suicidal trajectories. Family cohesion protected youth from being in high-risk developmental courses of suicidal behaviors. Social networks, especially quality of interactions, may improve detecting adolescents and young adults at-risk for suicide behaviors. Network-based interventions are key to prevent suicidal behaviors over time and suicide intervention programming.","Xiao, Yunyu; Lindsey, Michael A",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721000465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653436/,442

METHODS Eleven subjects in the HSCT group and seven age-matched non-training controls (CON) were recruited. The HSCT group trained 3 times per week for 8 weeks, while CON performed no formal training. One eye of each subject in both groups was imaged at baseline and at an 8-week follow-up, using a Retinal Function Imager to measure retinal blood flow (RBF). Retinal tissue perfusion (RTP) was calculated as RBF divided by the corresponding tissue volume. Cognitive function was assessed during both visits using the NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Battery. RESULTS RTP was 2.99 ± 0.91 nl·s-1·mm-3 (mean ± SD) at baseline and significantly increased to 3.77 ± 0.86 nl·s-1·mm-3 after training (P < 0.001) in the HSCT group, reflecting an increase of 26%. In the HSCT group, the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (PAT) and Fluid Cognition Composite Score (FCS) were significantly increased after HSCT (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the changes in Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (FLNK) were positively correlated to increases in RTP (r = 0.80, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that the increased RTP after HSCT was related to improved cognition in cognitively-normal elders, indicating RTP could be an imaging marker for monitoring cognitive changes due to physical activity in the elderly.","Zhang, Juan; Strand, Keri; Totillo, Matthew; Chen, Qi; Signorile, Joseph F; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Jianhua",Experimental gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2020.111210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385483/,442
65328,Immediate versus deferred delivery of the preterm baby with suspected fetal compromise for improving outcomes.,2012,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Direct closure (DC) of eyelid defects has been retrospectively shown to give excellent outcomes. We present prospective outcome data as further evidence to promote its wider use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A consecutive, unselected, series of patients undergoing eyelid tumour resection was studied prospectively. DC was attempted at the time of biopsy in all of them. If DC proved impossible, delayed reconstruction using other techniques was later performed. Defect size, pre- and post-operative palpebral aperture (PA) measurements and the final visit patients' and surgeons' satisfaction scores for function and appearance were recorded. RESULTS Seventy-three eyelids of 70 patients were studied. Mean resected specimen width was 16.4 mm (4-26 mm) in the DC group, versus 23.9 mm (11-42 mm) for other, non-DC reconstructions. Primary DC was achieved in 74% of this cohort. Mean final post-operative PA measurements in the DC group were 0.7 mm vertically (p = 0.003) and 0.8 mm horizontally (p = 0.009) less than preoperatively, but there was no statistical difference (p = 0.1) in the final horizontal measurements between the operated and un-operated sides in the DC group. DC satisfaction scores were excellent for both eyelid function and appearance. CONCLUSIONS DC of eyelid defects, irrespective of per-operative PA distortion, gives excellent late post-operative outcomes. We recommend that DC, aligning the closure tension parallel to the lid margin, is attempted whenever wound margin approximation is possible in preference to alternative reconstruction techniques, regardless of any temporary PA distortion and globe displacement that this may cause. Eyelid function and appearance recover to near normal within 2 months.","Thaller, Vladimir T; Madge, Simon N; Chan, W; Vujic, I; Jazayeri, F",Eye,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-019-0414-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944462/,442
66778,Editor's Picks September 2020.,2020-09-01,"Cancer has become the leading cause of human death worldwide. There are many challenges in the treatment of cancer and the rapidly developing area of nanotechnology has shown great potential to open a new era in cancer therapy. This article, rather than being exhaustive, focuses on the striking progress in the drug delivery nanosystems (DDNS) for cancer therapy and selects typical examples to point out the emerging mode of action of DDNS from our perspective. Among the outstanding advances in DDNS for cancer therapy is the development of ""multicomponent delivery systems"", ""multifunctional nanocarriers"" and ""multistage delivery systems"". However, these represent only one aspect of DDNS research. In addition, nature is the best teacher and natural evolution pressure has meant that virions conform to the ""multitarget, multistage and multicomponent"" (3M) mode of action. Amazingly, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), used for over 4000 years in China, also displays the same mode of action. Integrating the previous notable progress in nanoparticle technology, learned from the building mode of natural virions and the action concept of TCM, we propose an integrity-based 3M mode DDNS for cancer therapy: multitarget, multistage and multicomponent, which are not fragmented parts but an interconnected integrity. Based on the physiological multitarget and the pharmacokinetic multistage, multicomponent DDNS are rationally designed, where different components with individual specific functions act in a synergistic manner against each target at each disposition stage to maximize the targeted delivery effectiveness. In this article, we introduce each component of 3M DDNS in detail and describe some typical cases to realize the tumor-homing purposes.","Sun, Jin; Luo, Cong; Wang, Yongjun; He, Zhonggui",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/c2nr32867d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292001/,442
67430,Coronavirus infection in neonates: a systematic review.,2020-09-17,"The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of a globular domain of residues 1071 to 1178 within the previously annotated nucleic acid-binding region (NAB) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has been determined, and N- and C-terminally adjoining polypeptide segments of 37 and 25 residues, respectively, have been shown to form flexibly extended linkers to the preceding globular domain and to the following, as yet uncharacterized domain. This extension of the structural coverage of nsp3 was obtained from NMR studies with an nsp3 construct comprising residues 1066 to 1181 [nsp3(1066-1181)] and the constructs nsp3(1066-1203) and nsp3(1035-1181). A search of the protein structure database indicates that the globular domain of the NAB represents a new fold, with a parallel four-strand beta-sheet holding two alpha-helices of three and four turns that are oriented antiparallel to the beta-strands. Two antiparallel two-strand beta-sheets and two 3(10)-helices are anchored against the surface of this barrel-like molecular core. Chemical shift changes upon the addition of single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) identified a group of residues that form a positively charged patch on the protein surface as the binding site responsible for the previously reported affinity for nucleic acids. This binding site is similar to the ssRNA-binding site of the sterile alpha motif domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vts1p protein, although the two proteins do not share a common globular fold.","Serrano, Pedro; Johnson, Margaret A; Chatterjee, Amarnath; Neuman, Benjamin W; Joseph, Jeremiah S; Buchmeier, Michael J; Kuhn, Peter; Wüthrich, Kurt",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01253-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828617/,442

The resource provides an informative and efficient setting for collecting data on the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In early March 2020, a questionnaire was developed in collaboration with other longitudinal population studies to ensure cross-cohort comparability. It targeted retrospective and current COVID-19 infection information (exposure assessment, symptom tracking and reported clinical outcomes) and the impact of both disease and mitigating measures implemented to manage the COVID-19 crisis more broadly. Data were collected on symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal flu, travel prior to the pandemic, mental health and social, behavioural and lifestyle factors. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 9 th April and 15 th May 2020. 6807 participants completed the questionnaire (2706 original mothers, 1014 original fathers/partners, 2973 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 114 partners of offspring). Eight (0.01%) participants (4 G0 and 4 G1) reported a positive test for COVID-19, 77 (1.13%; 28 G0 and 49 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 865 (12.7%; 426 G0 and 439 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19. Using algorithmically defined cases, we estimate that the predicted proportion of COVID-19 cases fell between 1.03% - 4.19% depending on timing of measurement during the period of reporting. Data from this first questionnaire will be complemented with at least two more follow-up questionnaires, linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Data has been released as: 1) a standard dataset containing all participant responses with key sociodemographic factors and 2) as a composite release coordinating data from the existing resource, thus enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.","Northstone, Kate; Howarth, Simown; Smith, Daniel; Bowring, Claire; Wells, Nicholas; Timpson, Nicholas John",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16020.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628949/,442

74286,Dermatology and JEADV on the rise - gaining more scientific awareness.,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND Ischemic conditioning of the gastric conduit is considered as a possible approach to improve perfusion of the gastric tube after esophagectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of ischemic conditioning on gastric microcirculation in a clinical setting. METHODS Nineteen patients with an esophageal carcinoma were included. In a first laparoscopic procedure, the stomach was devascularized by complete gastric mobilization including ligation of the left gastric artery (""laparoscopic gastrolysis""). After a delay of 4 to 5 days, all patients underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy and reconstruction with the prepared gastric conduit (Ivor-Lewis). Mucosal oxygen saturation (MOS, sulfur dioxide in %) was quantitatively measured from the endoluminal side in well-defined areas of the antrum, corpus, and fundus using a tissue spectrometer located at the tip of a microprobe (LEA, Medizintechnik, Giessen, Germany). Under general anesthesia, sulfur dioxide measurement I was taken before, and measurement II after laparoscopic gastric mobilization; measurement III was done before esophagectomy and reconstruction 4 to 5 days later. RESULTS Before laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach the median MOS of the fundus was 72% (range, 49% to 86%). The MOS significantly decreased after devascularization of the stomach (median MOS, 38%; range, 9% to 86%). After 4 to 5 days, MOS almost recovered to values observed before gastric mobilization (median MOS, 62%; range, 48% to 85%). Compared with the fundus, no significant sulphur dioxide changes were detected in the corpus and antrum. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that ischemic conditioning influences microcirculation of the gastric conduit and improves MOS in the anastomotic region at the time of reconstruction.","Bludau, Marc; Hölscher, Arnulf H; Vallböhmer, Daniel; Gutschow, Christian; Schröder, Wolfgang",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20868800/,442

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Thoracoscopic surgery has become a routine operation for esophageal atresia repair. However, large studies comparing the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopy to thoracotomy are scarce. Current reviews are obscured with institutional experiences or pool small samples. METHODS PRISMA-compliant search in Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library (PROSPERO #CRD42019121862) for original studies comparing thoracoscopy to thoracotomy for esophageal atresia. Quality assessments were performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Meta-analyses were presented as odds ratios and standardized mean differences. RESULTS This is the largest published meta-analysis, including 17 studies and 1043 patients. Thoracoscopy produce shorter hospital stay [standardized mean differences (SMD) -11.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.49-6.10; P = 0.0440], time until extubation (SMD -3.22; 95% CI 5.93-0.51; P = 0.0198), time until first oral feeding (SMD -2.84; 95% CI 4.62-1.07; P = 0.0017), and fewer musculoskeletal complications [odds ratio (OR) 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.58; P = 0.0133). Thoracoscopy is as safe as thoracotomy regarding leakage (OR -1.92; 95% CI 0.97-3.80; P = 0.0622), stricture formation (OR 2.66; 95% CI 0.86-3.23; P = 0.1339), stricture dilatation (OR 1.90; 95% CI 0.16-3.88; P = 0.0767), and mortality (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.34-4.16; P = 0.7934). However, thoracoscopy take longer (SMD +27.69; 95% CI 12.06-43.32; P = 0.0005) and necessitate more antireflux surgery (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.06-4.24; P = 0.0343). CONCLUSION Thoracoscopy is effective and safe, with similar or better outcomes than thoracotomy for patients and providers. The only significant drawback is the need for antireflux surgery in the first years of life. Comparative randomized long-term studies are needed.","Drevin, Gustaf; Andersson, Björn; Svensson, Jan F",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002943/,442
80254,Telehealth Is a Sustainable Population Health Strategy to Lower Costs and Increase Quality of Health Care in Rural Utah.,2020-05-28,"INTRODUCTION Emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often have a psychological impact on the well-being of the general population, including survivors and caregivers. Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. METHODS We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. CONCLUSION Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self- care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.","Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Chua, Hong Choon; Sim, Kang",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241071/,442

85281,Growth restriction and gender influence cerebral oxygenation in preterm neonates.,2016,"SARS-CoV-2 has recently caused an epidemic in humans and poses a huge threat to global public health. As a primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) exists in different hosts that are in close contact with humans, especially cats and dogs. However, the underlying mechanism of how the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 cooperates with human ACE2 (hACE2), cat ACE2 (cACE2) and dog ACE2 (dACE2) and the variation in binding remains largely unsolved. Therefore, we explored the binding behavior of the spike RBD with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2 via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. In accordance with the binding free energies and residue interactions, the spike RBD has respective binding specificities with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2, and the binding affinities decrease in the order of hACE2, cACE2, dACE2, mainly due to changes in the amino acids Q24L, H34Y, and M82T in cACE2 or dACE2. Furthermore, alanine scanning analysis results validated some key residues of the spike RBD interact with ACE2 and provided clues to the variation of amino acid that could influence the transmissibility or immune responses of SARS-CoV-2. Decreasing dynamic correlations strengths of ACE2 with the RBD were found in all hACE2-RBD, cACE2-RBD and dACE2-RBD systems. The ACE2 protein shows variable motion modes across the zinc metallopeptidase domain, which induces different interactions between ACE2 and the RBD. Our studies reveal that the motion pattern of the zinc metallopeptidase domain is critical to the binding behavior of RBD with ACE2. These findings could aid our understanding of selective recognition involving various ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and shed further light on the binding mechanisms.","Zang, Yongjian; Li, Xuhua; Zhao, Yizhen; Wang, He; Hao, Dongxiao; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Zhiwei; Yuan, Xiaohui; Zhang, Shengli",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp01611c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132301/,442

Given the unknown incidence of adverse cardiac sequelae after COVID-19 infection in athletes, these leagues implemented a conservative return-to-play (RTP) cardiac testing program aligned with American College of Cardiology recommendations for all athletes testing positive for COVID-19. Objective To assess the prevalence of detectable inflammatory heart disease in professional athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, using current RTP screening recommendations. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study reviewed RTP cardiac testing performed between May and October 2020 on professional athletes who had tested positive for COVID-19. The professional sports leagues (Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football League, and the men's and women's National Basketball Association) implemented mandatory cardiac screening requirements for all players who had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to resumption of team-organized sports activities. Exposures Troponin testing, electrocardiography (ECG), and resting echocardiography were performed after a positive COVID-19 test result. Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis. Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or stress echocardiography. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process. Results The study included 789 professional athletes (mean [SD] age, 25 [3] years; 777 men [98.5%]). A total of 460 athletes (58.3%) had prior symptomatic COVID-19 illness, and 329 (41.7%) were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (minimally symptomatic). Testing was performed a mean (SD) of 19 (17) days (range, 3-156 days) after a positive test result. Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes (3.8%; troponin, 6 athletes [0.8%]; ECG, 10 athletes [1.3%]; echocardiography, 20 athletes [2.5%]), necessitating additional testing; 5 athletes (0.6%) ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis, 3; pericarditis, 2) that resulted in restriction from play. No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation. Conclusions and Relevance This study provides large-scale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations. While long-term follow-up is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved.","Martinez, Matthew W; Tucker, Andrew M; Bloom, O Josh; Green, Gary; DiFiori, John P; Solomon, Gary; Phelan, Dermot; Kim, Jonathan H; Meeuwisse, Willem; Sills, Allen K; Rowe, Dana; Bogoch, Isaac I; Smith, Paul T; Baggish, Aaron L; Putukian, Margot; Engel, David J",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.0565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662103/,442
87697,"A machine learning-based, decision support, mobile phone application for diagnosis of common dermatological diseases.",2020-09-29,"INTRODUCTION Differentiated service delivery (DSD) for antiretroviral therapy (ART) maintenance embodies the client-centred approach to tailor services to support people living with HIV in adhering to treatment and achieving viral suppression. We aimed to assess the preferences for HIV care and attitudes towards DSD for ART maintenance among ART clients and providers at healthcare facilities in Thailand. METHODS A cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires was conducted in September-November 2018 at five healthcare facilities in four high HIV burden provinces in Thailand. Eligible participants who were ART clients aged ≥18 years and ART providers were recruited by consecutive sampling. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics, preferences for HIV services and expectations and concerns towards DSD for ART maintenance. RESULTS Five hundred clients and 52 providers completed the questionnaires. Their median ages (interquartile range; IQR) were 38.6 (29.8 to 45.5) and 37.3 (27.3 to 45.1); 48.5% and 78.9% were females, 16.8% and 1.9% were men who have sex with men, and 2.4% and 7.7% were transgender women, respectively. Most clients and providers agreed that ART maintenance tasks, including ART refill, viral load testing, HIV/sexually transmitted infection monitoring, and psychosocial support should be provided at ART clinics (85.2% to 90.8% vs. 76.9% to 84.6%), by physicians (77.0% to 94.6% vs. 71.2% to 100.0%), every three months (26.7% to 40.8% vs. 17.3% to 55.8%) or six months (33.0% to 56.7% vs. 28.9% to 80.8%). Clients agreed that DSD would encourage their autonomy (84.9%) and empower responsibility for their health (87.7%). Some clients and providers disagreed that DSD would lead to poor ART retention (54.0% vs. 40.4%), increased loss to follow-up (52.5% vs. 42.3%), and delayed detection of treatment failure (48.3% vs. 44.2%), whereas 31.4% to 50.0% of providers were unsure about these expectations and concerns. CONCLUSIONS Physician-led, facility-based clinical consultation visit spacing in combination with multi-month ART refill was identified as one promising DSD model in Thailand. However, low preference for decentralization and task shifting may prove challenging to implement other models, especially since many providers were unsure about DSD benefits. This calls for local implementation studies to prove feasibility and governmental and social support to legitimize and normalize DSD in order to gain acceptance among clients and providers.","Lujintanon, Sita; Amatavete, Sorawit; Sungsing, Thanthip; Seekaew, Pich; Peelay, Jitsupa; Mingkwanrungruang, Pravit; Chinbunchorn, Tanat; Teeratakulpisarn, Somsong; Methajittiphan, Pornpen; Leenasirima, Prattana; Norchaiwong, Amarin; Nilmanat, Ampaipith; Phanuphak, Praphan; Ramautarsing, Reshmie A; Phanuphak, Nittaya",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792192/,442
88868,Current evidence for prenatal and postnatal corticosteroids in preterm infants.,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND Following its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, affecting millions of lives. Although every specialty of medicine has been affected, the field of allergy/immunology holds a special place in the battle against this modern-day plague. Because of the specialized training in allergy and clinical immunology, and the familiarity with comorbid contributing conditions, the allergist/immunologist is uniquely poised to play a major role both in the delivery of specialized therapeutic procedures and practices that can improve the health of patients with COVID-19 as well as in the use of forthcoming vaccines for the prevention of its spread. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this report is to examine the current body of evidence supporting the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to provide a classification of COVID-19 disease presentations and potential therapeutic targets with which the allergist/immunologist has particular expertise. METHODS This article was based on a literature review of articles published in PubMed related to COVID-19 and the immune response, and the author's own research and clinical experiences in the field of immunology. RESULTS Currently, the management of COVID-19 disease is being directed by a preventive strategy based on social distancing, quarantine, and facemasks to reduce the spread of the virus. Numerous clinical trials are being initiated to identify effective treatments for COVID-19 and are directed toward treatment of the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19. An important resource for the allergist/immunologist is the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (COVID-19 TGP), a National Institutes of Health sponsored panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts, which has developed a set of continuously updated treatment guidelines intended for clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is unique among other infectious diseases because, in many cases, the host immune inflammatory response can cause greater harm to the individual who is infected than the pathogen itself. In this report, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the influence it has on COVID-19 presentations is reviewed, together with recommended potential therapeutic targets and treatment recommendations.","Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2020.41.200072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797762/,442
91410,Wishes and Needs at the End of Life.,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND Cervical cancer has become a major public health challenge in developing countries with a reported age-standardised incidence rate of about 17.9/100,000/year and lifetime risks approaching 1 in 20 in some settings. Evidence indicates that HIV-seropositive women are 2 to 12 times more likely to develop precancerous lesions that lead to cervical cancer than HIV-negative women. There is a lack of rigorous evidence on which treatment methods are being utilised for HIV-positive women, and this review aims to synthesise available evidence on treatment modalities for both cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women in developing countries. METHODS A systematic review guided by a published protocol was conducted. Online databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Emerald (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and health databases, which cover developing countries (3ie Systematic Reviews, WHO library and databases, World Bank website), were searched for published articles. Additional articles were found through citation, reference list tracking, and grey literature. Study design, treatment category, geographic country/region, and key outcomes for each included article were documented and summarised. RESULTS Thirteen research articles from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America were included. Eight (61.5%) articles focused on the treatment of cervical cancer with the remaining five (38.5%) assessed cervical neoplasia treatment. The available cervical cancer treatments, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and surgery are effective for HIV-seropositive patients, and these are the same treatments for HIV-negative patients. Both cryotherapy and LEEP are effective in reducing CIN2+ among HIV-seropositive women, and a choice between the treatments might be based on available resources and expertise. Radiation, chemotherapy, concurrent treatment using radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and surgery have shown the possibility of effectiveness among HIV-seropositive women. Cervical cancer stage, immunosuppressive level including those on HAART, and multisystem toxicities due to treatment are associated with treatment completion, prognostic, and survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of cervical cancer is based on the stage of cancer, and poor outcomes in most developing countries might be due to a lack of optimal treatment regimen. Those infected with HIV were younger and had advanced cervical cancer as compared to those who were HIV-negative. Facilitation and putting HIV-infected people on life-long ART is of importance and has been found to have a positive impact on cervical cancer treatment response. Research on precancerous lesions and cervical cancer management of HIV-seropositive patients focusing on the quality of life of those treated; the effectiveness of the treatment method considering CD4+ count and ART is required.

Our aim was to report our single-center experience in patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas who were treated with transarterial liquid embolization in combination with transvenous balloon-assisted protection of the affected venous sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data base was performed. Demographic and clinical data, angiographic features of the dural arteriovenous fistulas, procedural parameters, complications, treatment success, follow-up imaging, and clinical outcome were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were treated in 25 procedures. All patients were symptomatic, of whom 81.8% presented with tinnitus; 9.1%, with ocular symptoms; and 9.1%, with headache. Most fistulas were located at the transverse and/or sigmoid sinus. The most frequent fistula type was Cognard IIa+b (40.9%), followed by Cognard I (31.8%) and Cognard IIa (27.3%)/Borden I (59.1%), followed by Borden II (40.9%). The affected sinus could be preserved in all except for 1 patient in whom it was sacrificed in a second treatment procedure by coil embolization. The overall complete occlusion rate was 86.4%. The overall complication rate was 20%, with transient and permanent morbidity and mortality of 8%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 18 months, most patients (68.2%) achieved complete symptom remission, 27.3% showed symptom relief, and 4.6% had stable symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial liquid embolization of dural arteriovenous fistulas in combination with transvenous balloon-assisted protection of the venous sinus is feasible and safe and offers high rates of occlusion and of symptom remission.","Vollherbst, D F; Ulfert, C; Neuberger, U; Herweh, C; Laible, M; Nagel, S; Bendszus, M; Möhlenbruch, M A",AJNR.

CASE REPORT A 52-year-old woman with severe resistant hypertension underwent RDN. A transient spasm occurred in the left renal artery immediately after radiofrequency energy delivery, with subsequent complete resolution without any additional therapy. At 6-month follow-up, the blood pressure increased, and imaging revealed a tight stenosis in the left renal artery, which was successfully treated with a stent. In the next days, there was an immediate significant blood pressure reduction. CONCLUSION Renal denervation can be complicated by local tissue injury at the ablation sites that could be a possible trigger of late arterial disease.","Versaci, Francesco; Trivisonno, Antonio; Olivieri, Carlo; Magri, Gianludovico; Caranci, Fiorella; Prati, Francesco",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/13-4574mr.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754277/,442

In this study, we designed 1D fiber-shaped multi-synapses comprising ferroelectric organic transistors fabricated on a 100-μm Ag wire and used them as multisynaptic channels in an e-textile neural network for wearable neuromorphic applications. The device mimics diverse synaptic functions with excellent reliability even under 6000 repeated input stimuli and mechanical bending stress. Various NOR-type textile arrays are formed simply by cross-pointing 1D synapses with Ag wires, where each output from individual synapse can be integrated and propagated without undesired leakage. Notably, the 1D multi-synapses achieved up to ~90 and ~70% recognition accuracy for MNIST and electrocardiogram patterns, respectively, even in a single-layer neural network, and almost maintained regardless of the bending conditions.","Ham, Seonggil; Kang, Minji; Jang, Seonghoon; Jang, Jingon; Choi, Sanghyeon; Kim, Tae-Wook; Wang, Gunuk",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba1178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937532/,442
97540,How up to date was this information?,2010,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Sulcal effacement with preserved underlying gray-white matter junction (isolated sulcal effacement [ISE]) in acute ischemic stroke may not represent irreversible parenchymal injury. We aimed to evaluate the frequency and significance of ISE in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with middle cerebral artery M1 or internal carotid artery terminus occlusions who underwent computed tomography angiogram/perfusion followed by intra-arterial therapy were screened for ISE. RESULTS Out of the 568 patients who underwent intra-arterial therapy between March 2011 and September 2014, 108 fulfilled inclusion criteria. ISE was present in 8 (7.4%) patients (age 55.7±10.5 years, 6 female, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 16.1±3.8, 5 middle cerebral artery-M1, and 3 internal carotid artery terminus occlusions). Computed tomography angiogram revealed engorged/dilated leptomeningeal vessels obliterating the sulci within the areas of effacement, whereas computed tomography perfusion indicated normal-to-increased cerebral blood volume and prolonged Tmax in all patients. Modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) 2b-3 reperfusion was achieved in all patients. Follow-up imaging confirmed no infarct in the ISE area in all patients, and 5 (62%) had modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Sulcal effacement with preserved gray-white delineation is occasionally visualized in patients with proximal occlusion strokes, relates to robust leptomeningeal collaterals, and indicates preserved underlying parenchyma. ISE should not be used to exclude patients from thrombectomy.","Haussen, Diogo C; Lima, Andrey; Frankel, Michael; Anderson, Aaron; Belagaje, Samir; Nahab, Fadi; Rangaraju, Srikant; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.009304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931460/,442

102188,Clinical Symptoms of Hyperandrogenic Women Diagnosed with COVID-19.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND The obstetrics and gynecology literature has expanded in recent years to include clinical trials assessing the use of barbed sutures. The difficulty of intracorporeal suturing continues to be a barrier to a wider use of laparoscopy. Although the use of barbed sutures has been shown to ease the process of laparoscopic suturing considerably, concerns have been raised regarding a potentially increased risk of adhesions or inflammation as a result of their use. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine whether differences in surface textures, resulting from the variations in the geometric configurations of barbs, lead to differences in intra-abdominal adhesion formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 27 non-pregnant female Wistar Hannover rats, weighing 200-250 g, with intact uteri were used as an adhesion formation model. The rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: barbed suture group 1, barbed suture group 2 and control group (no intracorporeal suture). A 2-centimeter vertical incision was performed on the anti-mesosalpingeal side of one of the uterine horns. The incision on the uterine horn was reapproximated with a running suture, entailing 3 needle punctures and left untied at one end. Six weeks after the operation, intra-abdominal adhesion formations were investigated both clinically and histopathologically. RESULTS Clinical adhesion scores and histopathological parameters in both the barbed suture groups were statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the barbed suture groups regarding the adhesion scores. CONCLUSIONS The 2 types of barbed sutures with different surface textures, used for myometrial closure, form a similar profile with respect to postoperative adhesion formation.","Karacan, Tolga; Ozyurek, Eser; Türkgeldi, Lale Susan; Kıyak, Hüseyin; Pesen, Simge; Yasti, Merve; Usta, Taner",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/92172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712336/,442

107660,Nasal injury in preterm infants receiving non-invasive respiratory support: a systematic review.,2018,"OBJECTIVE Exploring the use of forecasting models and simulation tools to estimate demand and reduce the waiting time of patients in Emergency Departments (EDs). METHODS The analysis was based on data collected in May 2013 in the ED of Recanto das Emas, Federal District, Brasil, which uses a Manchester Triage System. A total of 100 consecutive patients were included: 70 yellow (70%) and 30 green (30%). Flow patterns, observed waiting time, and inter-arrival times of patients were collected. Process maps, demand, and capacity data were used to build a simulation, which was calibrated against the observed flow times. What-if analysis was conducted to reduce waiting times. RESULTS Green and yellow patient arrival-time patterns were similar, but inter-arrival times were 5 and 38 minutes, respectively. Wait-time was 14 minutes for yellow patients, and 4 hours for green patients. The physician staff comprised four doctors per shift. A simulation predicted that allocating one more doctor per shift would reduce wait-time to 2.5 hours for green patients, with a small impact in yellow patients' wait-time. Maintaining four doctors and allocating one doctor exclusively for green patients would reduce the waiting time to 1.5 hours for green patients and increase it in 15 minutes for yellow patients. The best simulation scenario employed five doctors per shift, with two doctors exclusively for green patients. CONCLUSION Waiting times can be reduced by balancing the allocation of doctors to green and yellow patients and matching the availability of doctors to forecasted demand patterns. Simulations of EDs' can be used to generate and test solutions to decrease overcrowding.","Amorim, Fábio Ferreira; Almeida, Karlo Jozefo Quadros de; Barbalho, Sanderson Cesar Macedo; Balieiro, Vanessa de Amorim Teixeira; Machado Neto, Arnaldo; Dias, Guilherme de Freitas; Santana, Levy Aniceto; Aguiar, Cristhiane Pinheiro Teixeira Gico de; Silva, Cláudia Cardoso Gomes da; Dasu, Sriram",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.65.12.1476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31994629/,442

110402,Effect of therapeutic touch on brain activation of preterm infants in response to sensory punctate stimulus: a near-infrared spectroscopy-based study.,2013,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious threat to public health and the economy. Importantly, there was a stock price crash on Monday, March 9, 2020, followed by a similar crash one week later. Leading global indices substantially dropped. Based on previous research indicating that the news media may elicit effects on stock prices, we hypothesized that the amount of news coverage about COVID-19 within a given country would predict the size of the stock price drop in that country. Using data for N = 58 nations from five continents, we observed average stock price drops of 6.57% (week 1) and 6.43% (week 2). Using a cross-national correlational approach, we found a positive relationship between the amount of news coverage about COVID-19 and the extent of the stock price drop. Actual severity within a given country (indicated by the number of confirmed cases and deaths, based on data provided by the World Health Organization) and public attention (indicated by COVID-19-related Internet search engine volume) did not predict the extent of the stock price drop in multivariate analyses. Correlational evidence is consistent with the idea that intensive media reporting on a threatening pandemic with uncertain negative consequences on health, social life, and the economy may provoke substantial reactions in the market, with as yet unknown indirect effects on public health. However, the causal order of media attention and stock price drops should be assessed with caution.","Arendt, Florian; Mestas, Manina",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467942/,442

The serum levels of LRG and proinflammatory cytokines were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Serum LRG levels increased concomitantly with s-JIA disease flare-up and macrophage activation syndrome development. Furthermore, even in the clinically inactive phase, serum LRG levels were well above normal values. There were no correlations between serum LRG levels and indicators of s-JIA disease activity other than aspartate aminotransferase. There were significant positive correlations between serum LRG levels and proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS Serum LRG levels might be a unique and potential biomarker of s-JIA disease activity during IL-6 blockade treatment.","Shimizu, Masaki; Nakagishi, Yasuo; Inoue, Natsumi; Mizuta, Mao; Yachie, Akihiro",Modern rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14397595.2016.1270795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094589/,442
113974,In Reply.,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND Early antibiotic exposure may be contributing to the onset of childhood allergies. The main objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the relationship between early life antibiotic exposure and childhood asthma, eczema and hay fever. METHODS Pubmed and Embase were searched for studies published between 01-01-2008 and 01-08-2018, examining the effects of (1) prenatal antibiotic exposure and (2) infant antibiotic administration (during the first 2 years of life) on childhood asthma, eczema and hay fever from 0 to 18 years of age. These publications were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and analysed narratively. RESULTS (1) Prenatal antibiotics: Asthma (12 studies): The majority of studies (9/12) reported significant relationships (range OR 1.13 (1.02-1.24) to OR 3.19 (1.52-6.67)). Three studies reported inconsistent findings. Eczema (3 studies): An overall significant effect was reported in one study and in two other studies only when prenatal antibiotic exposure was prolonged. (2) Infant antibiotics: Asthma (27 studies): 17/27 studies reported overall significant findings (range HR 1.12 (1.08-1.16) to OR 3.21 (1.89-5.45)). Dose-response effects and stronger effects with broad-spectrum antibiotic were often reported. 10/27 studies reported inconsistent findings depending on certain conditions and types of analyses. Of 19 studies addressing reverse causation or confounding by indication at least somewhat, 11 reported overall significant effects. Eczema (15 studies): 6/15 studies reported overall significant effects; 9 studies had either insignificant or inconsistent findings. Hay fever (9 studies): 6/9 reported significant effects, and the other three insignificant or inconsistent findings. General: Multiple and broad-spectrum antibiotics were more strongly associated with allergies. The majority of studies scored a 6 or 7 out of 9 based on the NOS, indicating they generally had a medium risk of bias. Although most studies showed significant findings between early antibiotic exposure and asthma, the actual effects are still unclear as intrapartum antibiotic administration, familial factors and confounding by maternal and child infections were often not addressed. CONCLUSIONS This review points to a moderate amount of evidence for a relationship between early life antibiotics (especially prenatal) and childhood asthma, some evidence for a relationship with hay fever and less convincing evidence for a relationship with eczema. More studies are still needed addressing intra-partum antibiotics, familial factors, and possible confounding by maternal and childhood infections. Children exposed to multiple, broad-spectrum antibiotics early in life appear to have a greater risk of allergies, especially asthma; these effects should be investigated further.","Baron, Ruth; Taye, Meron; der Vaart, Isolde Besseling-van; Ujčič-Voortman, Joanne; Szajewska, Hania; Seidell, Jacob C; Verhoeff, Arnoud",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02042-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593308/,442
118117,In Reply.,2021-04-09,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Birnaviridae family, causes immunosuppression in chickens. In this study, we defined the localization of IBDV replication complexes based on colocalization analysis of VP3, the major protein component of IBDV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Our results indicate that VP3 localizes to vesicular structures bearing features of early and late endocytic compartments located in the juxtanuclear region. Interfering with the endocytic pathway with a dominant negative version of Rab5 after the internalization step leads to a reduction in virus titer. Triple-immunostaining studies between VP3, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed a well-defined colocalization, indicating that the three critical components of the RNPs colocalize in the same structure, likely representing replication complexes. Interestingly, recombinant expressed VP3 also localizes to endosomes. Employing Golgi markers, we found that VP3-containing vesicles were closely associated with this organelle. Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole caused a profound change in VP3 localization, showing a punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, these VP3-positive structures remained associated with Golgi ministacks. Similarly, brefeldin A (BFA) treatment led to a punctate distribution of VP3, scattered throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, analysis of intra- and extracellular viral infective particles after BFA treatment of avian cells suggested a role for the Golgi complex in viral assembly. These results constitute the first study elucidating the localization of IBDV replication complexes (i.e., in endocytic compartments) and establishing a role for the Golgi apparatus in the assembly step of a birnavirus.","Delgui, Laura R; Rodríguez, José F; Colombo, María I",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03152-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23741000/,442

This article provides an overview of how a scenario approach was used to prioritize key categories of drivers for the future demand of red blood cells and the organizational implications thereof for Sanquin, the Dutch national blood establishment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Based on previously identified drivers from interviews and a literature review (Step 1), we conducted scenario sessions and a survey to rank a list of drivers (""themes"") with its related opportunities and threats (Step 2), to identify mitigating measures per theme through focus groups (Step 3). RESULTS In Step 2, 10 themes were found that were classified in terms of importance and uncertainty. These were plotted on a two-dimensional graph with an ellipse to indicate the interquartile ranges per theme. Experts rated the top three most important themes to be the blood supply organization, precision medicine, and red blood cell replacements. In Step 3, focus groups identified specific mitigating measures per theme. These measures had parallel ideas, such as the need for an innovative mentality, internal and external communication and collaboration, and building Sanquin's reputation and trust with the public.

With increasing reports from clinical observations and autopsy findings, it became clear that the disease causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as a broad spectrum of systemic and multiorgan pathologies, including angiopathy, endothelialitis, and thrombosis. Coagulopathy is associated with the activity of megakaryocytes, which play crucial roles in modulating the platelet homeostasis. Only a few autopsy reports include findings on thrombosis formation and the presence of megakaryocytes. Here we review and summarize the possible involvement and the pathophysiology of the thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients based on post-mortem reports. We reviewed post-mortem reports from March 2020 to September 2020. Eleven autopsy reports that demonstrated thromboembolic involvement findings, either macroscopically or microscopically, were included in this review. All studies reported similar pulmonary gross findings. Not all studies described thrombi formation and megakaryocyte findings. Pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, severe endothelial injury, and widespread thrombosis are frequent in COVID-19 patients, following many patients with high-level D-Dimer, increased fibrinogen, abnormal prothrombic coagulation, and thrombocytopenia. Reports showed that thrombus was also found in the lower extremities' deep veins and the prostatic venous plexus. In conclusion, a complex interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion with platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, inflammation, immune response, and the possible involvement of megakaryocytes may increase the cumulative risk of thrombosis by a yet unclear cellular and humoral interaction.","Dwiputra Hernugrahanto, K; Novembri Utomo, D; Hariman, H; Budhiparama, N C; Medika Hertanto, D; Santoso, D; Hogendoorn, P C W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_24878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629337/,442

There is increasing evidence for p57 to control cellular processes in addition to cell cycle and CDK regulation including transcription, apoptosis, migration or development. In order to obtain molecular insights to unknown functions of p57, we performed a protein interaction screen. We identified the transcription regulator four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel p57-binding protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays were used to elucidate the physiological and functional relevance of p57/FHL2 interaction. We found in cancer cells that endogenous p57 and FHL2 are in a complex. We observed a substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters by p57 in reporter gene experiments and detected strong induction of the intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and binding of exogenous FHL2 to HDACs indicated repression of FHL2 transcription activity by HDACs. In the presence of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2 by p57 is abrogated suggesting that p57 shares a common pathway with HDAC inhibitors. p57 competes with HDACs for FHL2 binding which might partly explain the mechanism of FHL2 activation by p57. These results suggest a novel function of p57 in transcription regulation.","Kullmann, Michael Keith; Podmirseg, Silvio Roland; Roilo, Martina; Hengst, Ludger",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62641-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346031/,442

A systematic review.,2021-06-19,"BACKGROUND Incisional hernias (IH) after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) are challenging due to their concurrent midline and subcostal defects adjacent to bony prominences in the context of lifelong immunosuppression. To date, no studies evaluated the posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release (TAR) to repair complex IH after OLT. We aim to report the outcomes of TAR in this scenario. STUDY DESIGN OLT patients who underwent open, elective IH repair with TAR performed at two centers and with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified in the Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC). Outcomes included 30-day surgical site infections (SSI), surgical site occurrences requiring procedural intervention (SSOPI), unplanned readmissions, reoperations, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS Forty-four patients were identified (mean age 60 ± 8, 75% male, median BMI 30.7 kg/m2) at two centers. Median hernia width was 20 cm [IQR 15-28] and 98% (43) were clean cases. Retromuscular synthetic mesh was used in all cases, and 93% (41) achieved fascial closure with no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, there were 5 SSIs (4 deep, 1 superficial), 6 SSOPIs (4 wound opening, 1 debridement, 1 seroma drainage), four (9%) readmissions, and 3 (7%) reoperations. One patient developed a mesh infection that did not require mesh excision. After a median follow-up of 13 months [IQR 12-17], there were 11 (25%) recurrences; 8 due to central mesh fractures (CMF).

METHODS This phase 2, open-label, dose-response study randomized patients with AP, accompanying SIRS, and hypoxemia (n = 21) to receive low-dose or high-dose Auxora plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. All patients received pancreatic contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans at screenings, day 5/discharge, and as clinically required 90 days postrandomization; scans were blinded and centrally read to determine AP severity using computed tomography severity index. Solid food tolerance was assessed at every meal and SIRS every 12 hours. RESULTS The number of patients experiencing serious adverse events was not increased with Auxora versus SOC alone. Three (36.5%) patients with moderate AP receiving low-dose Auxora improved to mild AP; no computed tomography severity index improvements were observed with SOC. By study end, patients receiving Auxora better tolerated solid foods, had less persistent SIRS, and had reduced hospitalization versus SOC. CONCLUSIONS The favorable safety profile and patient outcomes suggest Auxora may be an appropriate early treatment for patients with AP and SIRS. Clinical development will continue in a randomized, controlled, blinded, dose-ranging study.","Bruen, Charles; Miller, Joseph; Wilburn, John; Mackey, Caleb; Bollen, Thomas L; Stauderman, Kenneth; Hebbar, Sudarshan",Pancreas,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0000000000001793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938507/,442

Twenty patients underwent robotic single port hysterectomy and 25 patients underwent laparoscopic single port hysterectomy. All hysterectomies were successfully performed via a single port and there were no conversions to conventional multi-port laparoscopy, multi-port robotic, open surgery, or vaginal surgery. The median operative time and hysterectomy time in robotic and laparoscopic groups were 90 vs. 90 min (P 0.74), 57.5 vs. 60 min (P 0.17), respectively. The median estimated blood loss was 40 ml in the robotic group and 50 ml in the laparoscopic group (P 0.77). No operative and post-operative complications were observed in the two groups. The median time to discharge from the hospital was one day for both techniques (P 0.17). Robotic and laparoscopic single port systems are feasible and safe for hysterectomy operation in terms of operative time, conversion to laparotomy or multiport laparoscopy/robotic rates, complication rates, and postoperative results in the hands of experienced surgeons. The possible benefits of robotic single port surgery compared with conventional laparoscopy should be evaluated in further randomized controlled studies.","Gungor, Mete; Kahraman, Korhan; Dursun, Polat; Ozbasli, Esra; Genim, Canan",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-017-0699-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429119/,442

As we and others have demonstrated, infection by this virus depends on cathepsin proteases present in endosomal compartments of the target cell, suggesting that the spike protein acquires its fusion competence by cleavage during cell entry rather than during virion biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that cathepsin L indeed activates the membrane fusion function of the spike protein. Moreover, cleavage was mapped to the same region where, in coronaviruses carrying furin-activated spikes, the receptor binding subunit of the protein is separated from the membrane-anchored fusion subunit.","Bosch, Berend Jan; Bartelink, Willem; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00415-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562523/,442

This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. CONCLUSION Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Yan, Xiangbin; Qayyum, Abdul; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Shah, Syed Jamal",International journal of medical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667929/,442

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02). There were no differences in major bleeding (p=0.69) or overt thrombosis (p=0.82) between aspirin users and non-aspirin users. CONCLUSIONS Aspirin use may be associated with improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial is needed to assess whether a causal relationship exists between aspirin use and reduced lung injury and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Chow, Jonathan H; Khanna, Ashish K; Kethireddy, Shravan; Yamane, David; Levine, Andrea; Jackson, Amanda M; McCurdy, Michael T; Tabatabai, Ali; Kumar, Gagan; Park, Paul; Benjenk, Ivy; Menaker, Jay; Ahmed, Nayab; Glidewell, Evan; Presutto, Elizabeth; Cain, Shannon; Haridasa, Naeha; Field, Wesley; Fowler, Jacob G; Trinh, Duy; Johnson, Kathleen N; Kaur, Aman; Lee, Amanda; Sebastian, Kyle; Ulrich, Allison; Peña, Salvador; Carpenter, Ross; Sudhakar, Shruti; Uppal, Pushpinder; Fedeles, Benjamin T; Sachs, Aaron; Dahbour, Layth; Teeter, William; Tanaka, Kenichi; Galvagno, Samuel M; Herr, Daniel L; Scalea, Thomas M; Mazzeffi, Michael A",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093359/,442

Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2017. Patients with BSIs caused by CR-GNB confirmed by in vitro susceptibility tests were enrolled, and patient medical record data on antimicrobial agents and microbiological and clinical outcomes were extracted. Results A total of 175 individuals were included; 127 individuals (72.6%) received combination therapy (two or more antibiotics), while 48 individuals (27.4%) received monotherapy (single antibiotic). The all-cause 28-day mortality was 20.0%. Treatment success or presumed success rates were very similar between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups (58.3% versus 59.1%; P = 0.931). Combination therapy had a higher success rate trend than monotherapy in septic shock patients (40.7% versus 18.2%; P = 0.268). Improved therapeutic effects were observed in the active agent-containing group, although the differences were not significant. Conclusion Combination therapy likely has better therapeutic effects on critical BSIs caused by CR-GNB than monotherapy. Choosing a proper active agent in an antimicrobial regime is relatively crucial to the ultimate treatment outcome.","Tan, Jiaying; Yu, Wenjin; Wu, Gang; Shen, Jun; Fang, Yong; Zhu, Hechen; Xiao, Qianyi; Peng, Weixia; Lan, Yukun; Gong, Ye",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s247378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765019/,442

The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) blocks autophagy and promotes apoptosis of the prostate after castration. METHODS Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12): control group (sham operation), castration group, and HCQ group (castrated and treated with HCQ). On day 7, all mice were executed and prostates were isolated. The morphological changes of prostates were observed by light microscope, and the ultrastructure changes were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The protein expression of Beclin-l, P62, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. The mRNA expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS Prostates of castration group shrank remarkably and prostates of HCQ group shrank more remarkably than castration group. Cytolysosomes were visible in the prostates of the castration group under SEM. Immunohistochemistry showed that the protein of Beclin-1 increased in the castration group compared to the control group, while decreased in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. While P62 protein moderately dyed in the control group and weakly dyed in the castration group, it strongly dyed in the HCQ group. Caspase-3 and Bax protein were weakly dyed in the control group but moderately dyed in the castration group and strongly dyed in the HCQ group. The expressions of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 were reduced in the castration group and further reduced in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA of LC3 and Atg5 in the castration group increased compared to the control group, while decreased after treated with HCQ. CONCLUSION Autophagy increased after castrated in prostates, while decreased after treated with HCQ; all these indicated that HCQ blocked autophagy and then promoted prostate apoptosis of castrated mice.","Ling, Sheng-Tao; Deng, Chun-Lei; Huang, Li; Yao, Qi-Sheng; Liu, Cui; Sun, Chuan-Tao; Wang, Li; Yang, Yong; Gong, Xiao-Xin; Chen, Cong-Bo",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937616/,442

How occupational therapy practice educators experienced fieldwork supervision during this rapid redesign of service delivery is not widely understood. This study aimed to explore the experiences of practice educators who supervised occupational therapy students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS Fifteen occupational therapy practice educators participated in focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to understand the experiences of the participants and explore the barriers and facilitators to providing practice education in this context. FINDINGS The experiences of the occupational therapy practice educators were interpreted into three themes: (1) Opportunities lost and then created (as two subthemes); (2) The relationship between the student and practice educator (comprising subthemes of practicing self-care and connection and support); and (3) Signing-off of students' competencies. While digital platforms were initially viewed as limiting, they also were used to create new opportunities for student learning. Participants spoke of being mindful of their and students' wellbeing and finding ways to provide connection and support. Participants were challenged by the need to adapt how they evaluated students in the context of a pandemic. CONCLUSION The findings of this study highlight the complexities of occupational therapy practice education in the rapidly shifting context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The outcomes highlight the importance of creating new ways of using digital platforms during practice education while focussing on the relationships with students.","Peart, Annette; Wells, Nathanael; Yu, Mong-Lin; Brown, Ted",Australian occupational therapy journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1630.12767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490904/,442

This meta-analysis examined the neurocognitive rationale for combined physical and cognitive training and synthesised the rapidly growing body of evidence examining combined paradigms to enhance inhibitory control. Across the research to date, there was a small positive effect (n studies = 16, n participants = 832) of combined training on improving inhibitory control. Sub-group analyses showed small-moderate positive effects when the physical component of the combined training was moderately intense, as opposed to low or vigorous intensities; moderate positive effects were found in older adults, as compared to adolescents and adults; and healthy individuals and those with vascular cognitive impairment, as compared to ADHD, ASD, mild cognitive impairment and cancer survivors. This is the first meta-analysis to provide evidence that combined physical, specifically when moderately intense, and cognitive training has the capacity to improve inhibitory control, particularly when delivered to healthy individuals and those experiencing age-related decline.","Dhir, Sakshi; Teo, Wei-Peng; Chamberlain, Samuel R; Tyler, Kaelasha; Yücel, Murat; Segrave, Rebecca A",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256070/,442

Payments made to orthopedic surgery (OS) physicians are reported as a historical control. MATERIALS AND METHODS For each group, the total payment number, amount, and mean and median numbers and amounts were calculated. The data were then reanalyzed after correcting for statistical outliers. For IR, VS, and IC, leading industry sponsors, payment amount, and differences in payments from 2013 to 2014 were highlighted. Payments to IR were grouped by category and geographic location. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS A total of $26,857,622 went to 1,831 IR physicians, representing 70.9% of active IR physicians, and the corrected mean payment was $597 ± 832.2 (standard deviation). The respective values were $18,861,041, 3,383, 80.6%, and $851.59 for VS; $32,008,213, 7,939, 78.6%, and $417.16 for IC; and $357,528,020, 21,829, 77.8%, and $598.48 for OS. OS had the largest number of payments (295,465 vs 24,246 for IR, 84,635 for VS, and 160,443 for IC) and greatest total payment amount. VS had a significantly higher corrected median payment amount ($463; P < .0001) than IR ($214) and IC ($99). Covidien and Sirtex Medical were the leading industry sponsors to IR, and 64.6% of IR payments were compensation for services other than consulting. There was no significant difference in median payment received per geographic region (P = .32). CONCLUSIONS OS received the largest number and total payment amount, and VS received a significantly greater corrected median payment amount, versus IR and IC.

LPN can be particularly challenging for more complex tumors. OBJECTIVE To compare the perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing LPN or RPN for a single renal mass of moderate or high complexity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis was performed for 381 consecutive patients who underwent either LPN (n = 182) or RPN (n = 199) between 2005 and 2011 for a complex renal mass (RENAL score ≥ 7). Perioperative outcomes were compared. Predictors of postoperative renal function were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. INTERVENTION LPN or RPN. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Perioperative outcomes were compared. Predictors of postoperative renal function were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to patient age, gender, side, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), or tumor size. Patients undergoing LPN had a slightly lower body mass index (29.2 kg/m(2) compared with 30.7 kg/m(2), p = 0.02) and preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (81.1 compared with 86.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), p = 0.02). LPN was associated with an increased rate of conversion to radical nephrectomy (RN) (11.5% compared with 1%, p<0.001) and a higher decrease in percentage of eGFR (-16.0% compared with -12.6%, p = 0.03). There were no significant differences with respect to warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, or postoperative complications. WIT, preoperative eGFR, and CCI were found to be predictors of postoperative eGFR in multivariable analysis. No difference in perioperative outcomes was found between moderate and high RENAL score subgroups. The retrospective study design was the main limitation of this study. CONCLUSIONS RPN provides functional outcomes comparable to those of LPN for moderate- to high-complexity tumors, but with a significantly lower risk of conversion to RN. This situation is likely because of the technical advantages offered by the articulated robotic instruments. A prospective randomized study is needed to confirm these findings.","Long, Jean-Alexandre; Yakoubi, Rachid; Lee, Byron; Guillotreau, Julien; Autorino, Riccardo; Laydner, Humberto; Eyraud, Remi; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H; Haber, Georges-Pascal",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22464543/,442

Recent advances in diagnostic technology have introduced newer methods that have greatly improved the ability to identify respiratory pathogens. However, determining the microbial etiology of pneumonia remains a challenge, especially in children. This is largely because of the inconsistent use of assays between studies, difficulties in specimen collection, and problems in interpreting the presence of pathogens as being causally related to the pneumonia event. The laboratory testing strategy for the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study aims to incorporate a broad range of diagnostic testing that will be standardized across the 7 participating sites. We describe the current status of laboratory diagnostics for pneumonia and the PERCH approach for specimen testing. Pneumonia diagnostics are evolving, and it is also a priority of PERCH to collect and archive specimens for future testing by promising diagnostic methods that are currently under development.","Murdoch, David R; O'Brien, Katherine L; Driscoll, Amanda J; Karron, Ruth A; Bhat, Niranjan",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir1073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22403229/,442

The increasing numbers of mastectomy procedures and improved patient survival have placed an increasing emphasis on the aesthetic and psychosocial outcomes, prompting surgeons to develop more sophisticated methods to reconstruct the breast mound. Significant improvements have been made to existing implant and autologous methods of PMBR in recent decades in an effort to reduce donor site morbidity and complication rates and improve cosmesis. The limitations of contemporary methods of PMBR have directed research toward more novel techniques such as autologous fat grafting and adipose tissue engineering. The present review discusses recent advances in the evolution of contemporary approaches to breast reconstruction and the future directions of PMBR using adipose tissue engineering strategies.","O'Halloran, Niamh; Potter, Shirley; Kerin, Michael; Lowery, Aoife",Clinical breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2018.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572079/,442
155941,Complementary Study.,2021-03-12,"INTRODUCTION Learning one's HIV status through HIV testing services (HTS) is an essential step toward accessing treatment and linking to preventive services for those at high HIV risk. HTS may impact subsequent sexual behaviour, but the degree to which this varies by population or is true in the setting of contemporary HIV prevention activities is largely unknown. As part of the 2019 World Health Organization Consolidated Guidelines on HTS, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of HTS on sexual behaviour. METHODS We searched nine electronic databases for studies published between July 2010 and December 2019. We included studies that reported on at least one outcome (condom use [defined as the frequency of condom use or condom-protected sex], number of sex partners, HIV incidence, STI incidence/prevalence). We included studies that prospectively assessed outcomes and that fit into one of three categories: (1) those evaluating more versus less-intensive HTS, (2) those of populations receiving HTS versus not and (3) those evaluating outcomes after versus before HTS. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Of 29 980 studies screened, 76 studies were included. Thirty-eight studies were randomized controlled trials, 36 were cohort studies, one was quasi-experimental and one was a serial cross-sectional study. There was no significant difference in condom use among individuals receiving more-intensive HTS compared to less-intensive HTS (relative risk [RR]=1.03; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.07). Condom use was significantly higher after receiving HTS compared to before HTS for individuals newly diagnosed with HIV (RR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.36 to 1.99) and marginally significantly higher for individuals receiving an HIV-negative diagnosis (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.62). Individuals receiving more-intensive HTS reported fewer sex partners at follow-up than those receiving less-intensive HTS, but the finding was not statistically significant (mean difference = -0.28; 95% CI: -3.66, 3.10). CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the importance of using limited resources towards HTS strategies that focus on early HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention services rather than resources dedicated to supplementing or enhancing HTS with additional counselling or other interventions.","Tiwari, Ruchi; Wang, Jiayu; Han, Hannah; Kalu, Ngozi; Sims, Lee B; Katz, David A; Burke, Barbara; Tsegaye, Adino T; Carter, Kayla A; Freije, Sophie; Guo, Boya; Albirair, Mohamed; Barr-DiChiara, Magdalena; Baggaley, Rachel; Jamil, Muhammad S; Senya, Kafui; Johnson, Cheryl; Khosropour, Christine M",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161636/,442

159355,Liver Involvement.,2020-10-16,"The genomes of the Tomato mosaic virus and many other plant and animal positive-strand RNA viruses of agronomic and medical importance encode superfamily 1 helicases. Although helicases play important roles in viral replication, the crystal structures of viral superfamily 1 helicases have not been determined. Here, we report the crystal structure of a fragment (S666 to Q1116) of the replication protein from Tomato mosaic virus. The structure reveals a novel N-terminal domain tightly associated with a helicase core. The helicase core contains two RecA-like α/β domains without any of the accessory domain insertions that are found in other superfamily 1 helicases. The N-terminal domain contains a flexible loop, a long α-helix, and an antiparallel six-stranded β-sheet. On the basis of the structure, we constructed deletion mutants of the S666-to-Q1116 fragment and performed split-ubiquitin-based interaction assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with TOM1 and ARL8, host proteins that are essential for tomato mosaic virus RNA replication. The results suggested that both TOM1 and ARL8 interact with the long α-helix in the N-terminal domain and that TOM1 also interacts with the helicase core. Prediction of secondary structures in other viral superfamily 1 helicases and comparison of those structures with the S666-to-Q1116 structure suggested that these helicases have a similar fold. Our results provide a structural basis of viral superfamily 1 helicases.","Nishikiori, Masaki; Sugiyama, Shigeru; Xiang, Hongyu; Niiyama, Mayumi; Ishibashi, Kazuhiro; Inoue, Tsuyoshi; Ishikawa, Masayuki; Matsumura, Hiroyoshi; Katoh, Etsuko",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00118-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573863/,442
159847,Grade of Stenosis Was Not Explained.,2021-04-23,"OBJECTIVES Latinos are disproportionately vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to workplace exposure, multigenerational households, and existing health disparities. Rolling out COVID-19 vaccines among vulnerable Latinos is critical to address disparities. This study explores vaccine perceptions of Latino families to inform culturally centered strategies for vaccine dissemination. METHOD Semistructured telephone interviews with Latino families (22 mothers and 24 youth, 13-18 years old) explored COVID-19 vaccine perceptions including (1) sources of information, (2) trust of vaccine effectiveness and willingness to get vaccinated, and (3) access to the vaccine distribution. We identified thematic patterns using immersion-crystallization. RESULTS We found that (1) 41% expressed optimism and willingness to receive the vaccine coupled with concerns about side effects; (2) 45% expressed hesitancy or would refuse vaccination based on mistrust, myths, fear of being used as ""guinea pigs,"" and the perceived role of politics in vaccine development; (3) families ""digested"" information gathered from social media, the news, and radio through intergenerational communication; and (4) participants called for community-led advocacy and ""leading by example"" to dispel fear and misinformation. Optimistic participants saw the vaccine as a way to protect their families, allowing youth to return to schools and providing safer conditions for frontline essential workers. CONCLUSIONS Culturally centered vaccine promotion campaigns may consider the Latino family unit as their target audience by providing information that can be discussed among parents and youth, engaging a range of health providers and advocates that includes traditional practitioners and community health workers, and disseminating information at key venues, such as schools, churches, and supermarkets.","Garcia, Jonathan; Vargas, Nancy; de la Torre, Cynthia; Magana Alvarez, Mario; Clark, Jesse Lawton",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211045937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596462/,442

However, the specific role of overall hospital size in open esophagectomy morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Materials and Methods: Patients aged >18 years who underwent open esophagectomy for primary malignant neoplasia of the esophagus between 2002 and 2014 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample. Minimally invasive procedures were excluded. Discharges were stratified by hospital size (large, medium, and small) and analyzed using trend and multivariable regression analyses. Results: Over a 13-year period, a total of 69,840 open esophagectomy procedures were performed nationally. While the proportion of total esophagectomies performed did not vary by hospital size, in-hospital mortality trends decreased for all hospitals (large (7.2% to 3.7%), medium (12.8% vs. 4.9%), and small (12.8% vs. 4.9%)), although this was only significant for large hospitals (P < 0.01). After controlling for patient demographics, comorbidities, admission, and hospital-level factors, hospital length of stay (LOS), total inflation-adjusted costs, in-hospital mortality, and complications (cardiac, respiratory, vascular, and bleeding) did not vary by hospital size (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: After risk adjustment, patient morbidity and in-hospital mortality appear to be comparable across all institutions, including small hospitals. While there appears to be an increased push for referring patients to large hospitals, our findings suggest that there may be other factors (such as surgeon type, hospital volume, or board status) that are more likely to impact the results; these need to be further explored in the current era of episode-based care.","Hirji, Sameer A; Shah, Rohan M; Fields, Adam; Orhurhu, Vwaire; Bhulani, Nizar; White, Abby; Mody, Gita N; Swanson, Scott J",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55100669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623325/,442

If hepatic venous outflow obstruction occurs, hepatic vein stenting is considered to restore the patency. PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and patency of primary hepatic vein stenting for hepatic venous outflow obstruction (HVOO) after LDLT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous interventions, including hepatic vein stent placement with or without balloon angioplasty, were performed in 21 patients who had undergone LDLT and had HVOO confirmed through hepatic venography or manometry, including the patients who had a structural abnormality. Two stents each were inserted in four patients; therefore, the total number of treated anastomoses was 25. Technical success, patency rates, and pressure gradients between hepatic veins and the right atrium were evaluated in 19 patients each. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 25 of 26 vessels (96%). The mean interval between operation and stenting was 43 days. After the procedure, the follow-up period was a mean 530 days. The mean pressure gradient decreased from 8.5 mmHg to 2.1 mmHg after treatment (P < 0.01). The patency rates of the 25 vessels were 80% at 1, 2, and 3 years after stent placement. However, middle hepatic vein stenting revealed a low patency rate (all were 36%). Three of seven stents (43%) in the middle hepatic vein occluded during follow-up. CONCLUSION Percutaneous primary hepatic vein stent replacement is an effective treatment for HVOO after LDLT.","Jang, Joo Yeon; Jeon, Ung Bae; Park, Jung Hwan; Kim, Tae Un; Lee, Jun Woo; Chu, Chong Woo; Ryu, Je Ho",Acta radiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012279/,442
192307,"Daily Situation Report on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran; March 14, 2020.",2020,"One of the most striking and dramatic genomic changes observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) isolated from humans soon after its zoonotic transmission from palm civets was the acquisition of a characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion. This occurred in open reading frame 8 (ORF8), one of the accessory genes unique to the SARS-CoV. The function of ORF8 and the significance of the deletion are unknown. The intact ORF8 present in animal and some early human isolates encodes a 122-amino-acid polypeptide (8ab(+)), which we expressed in cells using the vaccinia virus T7 expression system. It was found to contain a cleavable signal sequence, which directs the precursor to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates its translocation into the lumen. The cleaved protein became N-glycosylated, assembled into disulfide-linked homomultimeric complexes, and remained stably in the ER. The 29-nucleotide deletion splits ORF8 into two ORFs, 8a and 8b, encoding 39- and 84-residue polypeptides. The 8a polypeptide is likely to remain in the cytoplasm, as it is too small for its signal sequence to function and will therefore be directly released from the ribosome. However, we could not confirm this experimentally due to the lack of proper antibodies. ORF8b appeared not to be expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells or when expressed from mRNA's mimicking mRNA8. This was due to the context of the internal AUG initiation codon, as we demonstrated after placing the ORF8b immediately behind the T7 promoter. A soluble, unmodified and monomeric 8b protein was now expressed in the cytoplasm, which was highly unstable and rapidly degraded. Clearly, the 29-nucleotide deletion disrupts the proper expression of the SARS-CoV ORF8, the implications of which are discussed.","Oostra, Monique; de Haan, Cornelis A M; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928347/,442

DESIGN Prospective observational study. ANIMALS 45 unweaned crias with diarrhea. PROCEDURE Fecal samples were evaluated for Eimeria spp, Giardia spp, Cryptosporidium spp, enteric viruses, and Salmonella spp. A questionnaire yielded information concerning herd management and presence of other affected camelids. RESULTS 28 crias were < or = 31 days old, 11 were 32 to 62 days old, and 6 were 63 to 210 days old. Potential pathogens were isolated from feces from 32 of the 45 crias. A total of 39 potential pathogens were obtained, including coronavirus (n = 19 crias; 42%), Giardia spp (8; 18%), Eimeria spp (6; 13%), Cryptosporidium spp (4; 9%), rotavirus (1; 2%), and nematode ova (1; 2%). Salmonella spp were not isolated. Most crias from which potential pathogens were isolated were identified during outbreaks of diarrhea involving other camelids, although only coronavirus was isolated from crias identified during outbreaks involving adult camelids. Coronavirus was detected throughout the year, whereas protozoa were most commonly isolated during the fall and winter. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that a variety of potential pathogens may be isolated from young crias with diarrhea. Many crias shed coronavirus, which may also have been affecting older camelids. Protozoa were isolated most often during wetter months, suggesting that crias born during these months may have greater exposure to protozoal pathogens.","Cebra, Christopher K; Mattson, Donald E; Baker, Rocky J; Sonn, Robert J; Dearing, Peggy L",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14690211/,442

Compared to Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 had lower occurrence of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.58; aHR 0.36; 95% CI 0.33-0.38; respectively) and COVID-19 hospitalization (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66; aHR 0.30; 0.25-0.35; respectively). Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization were associated with younger age, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, number of comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regional proportion of delta variant and county-level COVID-19 incidence were predictors of vaccine breakthrough events; county-level vaccine coverage was inversely associated. ConclusionsVaccine breakthrough was rare among fully vaccinated persons. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were more protective against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization compared to Ad26.COV2.S. Efforts to limit COVID-19 transmission and bolster vaccine coverage would also curtail vaccine breakthrough.","Sharma, Aditya; Oda, Gina; Holodniy, Mark",,,442
213697,How the use of surgical masks during COVID-19 pandemic can induce skin effects,2020,"The role of viruses in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been largely underestimated in the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 age. However, during flu seasonal early identification of viral infection in CAP is crucial to guide treatment and in-hospital management. Though recommended, the routine use of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) to detect viral infection has been poorly scaled-up, especially in the emergency department (ED). This study sought to assess the prevalence and associated clinical outcomes of viral infections in patients with CAP during peak flu season. In this retrospective, observational study adults presenting at the ED of our hospital (Rome, Italy) with CAP from January 15th to February 22th, 2019 were enrolled. Each patient was tested on admission with Influenza rapid test and real time multiplex assay. Seventy five consecutive patients were enrolled. 30.7% (n = 23) tested positive for viral infection. Of these, 52.1% (n = 12) were H1N1/FluA. 10 patients had multiple virus co-infections. CAP with viral infection did not differ for any demographic, clinic and laboratory features by the exception of CCI and CURB-65. All intra-ED deaths and mechanical ventilations were recorded among CAP with viral infection. Testing only patients with CURB-65 score &#8805;2, 10 out of 12 cases of H1N1/FluA would have been detected saving up to 40% tests. Viral infection occurred in one-third of CAP during flu seasonal peak 2019. Since not otherwise distinguishable, NPS is so far the only reliable mean to identify CAP with viral infection. Testing only patients with moderate/severe CAP significantly minimize the number of tests.","Spagnolello, Ornella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Cedrone, Maria Civita; Di Biagio, Valentina; Gentile, Massimo; Leonardi, Annalisa; Valeriano, Camilla; Innocenti, Giuseppe Pietro; Santinelli, Letizia; Borrazzo, Cristian; Russo, Alessandro; Oliveto, Giuseppe; Viscido, Agnese; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Bertazzoni, Giuliano; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo",J Med Virol,,442
213940,"Update Alert 2: Ventilation Techniques and Risk for Transmission of Coronavirus Disease, Including COVID-19",2020,"This study characterizes vape shop closings, openings, and changes in product mix in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas with different tobacco and marijuana policies. With concern for higher rates of marijuana use among those who vape nicotine, the presence of marijuana-related terms in store names was also assessed. A census of stores that were classified online as vape shops/stores or vaporizer stores were telephoned in April-May 2018 (n=739) and July-September 2019 (n=919) to verify whether vape products and other tobacco products (OTP) were sold. We computed the percent of stores that closed, opened, and started/stopped selling OTP. Multilevel models tested whether these events varied by store type and by neighborhood demographics. Within 16 months, 11.5% of 739 stores had closed and 29.8% of 919 stores at follow-up had opened. Closings were more likely among vape-only than vape+OTP stores (AOR=2.51, 95% CI=1.47,4.29);vape-only stores were less likely to open (AOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.34,0.62). Regardless of store type, the odds of a store opening increased as the proportion of non-Hispanic/Latino White residents in the census tract increased (AOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.18,1.85). Overall, 2.0% of stores (vape-only and vape+OTP) had marijuana-related names at baseline and 3.5% at follow-up. The observed change (1.6% to 5.8%) was greatest in Oklahoma City, where the state legalized medical marijuana between baseline and follow-up. More stores were opening than closing in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas before statewide sales restrictions on flavored tobacco and COVID-19. Uniform licensing is recommended to define vape shops and track their location and sales practices.","Barker, Dianne C.; Henriksen, Lisa Voelker David H.; Ali, Amna Raskind Ilana G.; Schleicher, Nina C.; Johnson, Trent O.; Berg, Carla J.",Preventive Medicine Reports,,442
223230,Reduction in the number of early melanomas diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-centre cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread rapidly over the world. Little is known about the outcomes of infections in pregnant women. The management and characteristics of preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers need to be clarified. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we describe the clinical courses of 6 preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers, the management protocol, and related outcomes. RESULTS: Six preterm infants were admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 23 and March 19, 2020. Gestational age ranged from 28+5 to 36+3 weeks. One late preterm infant was delivered early due to maternal dyspnea from COVID-19. Five infants were delivered by Caesarean section. None had perinatal asphyxia. Two infants required respiratory support due to respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity. All infants did not develop severe complications of prematurity and are negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION: With an expedited and adequate delivery protocol, less invasive treatment principle, and active infection precautious, we found a limited impact of COVID-19 mothers on preterm delivery and neonatal short-term outcomes. The risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low in preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers if appropriate management is implemented.","Hu, Xiaolin; Gao, Jinzhi; Wei, Ying; Chen, Hui; Sun, Xuan; Chen, Juan; Luo, Xiaoping; Chen, Ling",Neonatology,,442

226224,Drug-induced vasculitis in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic became a global threat in a matter of weeks, with its future implications yet to be defined. New York City was swiftly declared the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States as case numbers grew exponentially in a matter of days, quickly threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the health care system. This burgeoning crisis led practitioners across specialties to adapt and mobilize rapidly. Plastic surgeons and trainees within the New York University Langone Health system faced uncertainty in terms of future practice, in addition to immediate and long-term effects on undergraduate and graduate medical education. The administration remained vigilant and adaptive, enacting departmental policies prioritizing safety and productivity, with early deployment of faculty for clinical support at the front lines. The authors anticipate that this pandemic will have far-reaching effects on the future of plastic surgery education, trends in the pursuit of elective surgical procedures, and considerable consequences for certain research endeavors. Undoubtedly, there will be substantial impact on the physical and mental well-being of health care practitioners across specialties. Coordinated efforts and clear lines of communication between the Department of Plastic Surgery and its faculty and trainees allowed a concerted effort toward the immediate challenge of tempering the spread of coronavirus disease of 2019 and preserving structure and throughput for education and research. Adaptation and creativity have ultimately allowed for early rebooting of in-person clinical and surgical practice. The authors present their coordinated efforts and lessons gleaned from their experience to inform their community's preparedness as this formidable challenge evolves.","Berman, Zoe P; Diep, Gustave K; Alfonso, Allyson R; Ramly, Elie P; Bluebond-Langner, Rachel; Bernstein, G Leslie; Rodriguez, Eduardo D",Plast Reconstr Surg,,442

240771,Optimizing clinical productivity in the otolaryngology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Testing plays a critical role in treatment and prevention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. METHODS: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a 'hospital' setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a 'community' setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for 'contextual' parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters. RESULTS: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.","Ricks, Saskia; Kendall, Emily A; Dowdy, David W; Sacks, Jilian A; Schumacher, Samuel G; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan",BMC Med,,442
241735,Palmoplantar erythrodysestesia: a diagnostic sign of COVID-19,2020,"Accurate prediction of the transmission of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 is crucial for implementing effective mitigation measures. In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.","Kargas, N.; Qian, C.; Sidiropoulos, N.

Our aim was to conduct a PubMed search for autopsy studies on influenza and coronavirus to investigate the contribution of autopsies during pandemics, focussing on autopsy methods and procedures and the role of autopsy findings in pandemics. The retrieved autopsy studies generally relied on microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunostaining and electron microscopy. Most were small and reported on lung effects, including diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pneumonia and tracheobronchitis. Antibiotic therapy has diminished a role for bacterial pneumonia, whereas obesity is an emerging risk factor. Autopsy studies have provided new insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatments like anti-coagulative therapy.

We turn to this body of feminist scholarship as it enables us to attune to what is happening, what remains unspoken and to pay attention to “the little things” that may be lost in a big crisis. Writing through the complexity of embodied affects (fear, loss, hope), we focus on the challenge to humanist notions of “agency” posed by these shifting timespace relations of home confinement, restricted movement and altered work-leisure routines.

The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

271605,Concerns and perceptions of patients with psoriatic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a two-wave survey by the National Psoriasis Foundation,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government took security measures to try to limit infections. Restrictive measures included social distancing, home confinement and the closure of all public structures like gyms and swimming pools. The impact of these limitations on health and lifestyle was inevitably negative. The purpose of this study was to establish the level of physical activity (PA), expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) in a Southern Italian population before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was published on the official website of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS S. de Bellis, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy and on several social media in May 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred ten replies (72% women) from Apulia (60%), Calabria (28%), Campania (11%) and Sicily (1%) were included in the study. The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on the vigorous PA intensity level and on walking, but not on the moderate PA intensity level. Additionally, daily time spent sitting down increased by more than 12% during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation changed PA behaviors. The decreased energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) during the lockdown had a negative impact in both genders, especially on the young adults and adults' groups.","Franco, Isabella; Bianco, Antonella; Bonfiglio, Caterina; Sorino, Paolo; Mirizzi, Antonella; Campanella, Angelo; Buongiorno, Claudia; Liuzzi, Rosalba; Osella, Alberto R",J Sports Med Phys Fitness,,442

Challenges in testing can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise, and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), the most robust, sensitive, and specific assay currently available. Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can replicate commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test kits and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group, composed of faculty, staff, and trainees across the biotechnology quad at Georgia Institute of Technology, synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. Our in-house kit compares favorably with a commercial product used for diagnostic testing. We also developed an environmental testing protocol to readily monitor surfaces for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Our blueprint should be readily reproducible by research teams at other institutions, and our protocols may be modified and adapted to enable SARS-CoV-2 detection in more resource-limited settings.","Mascuch, Samantha J; Fakhretaha-Aval, Sara; Bowman, Jessica C; Ma, Minh Thu H; Thomas, Gwendell; Bommarius, Bettina; Ito, Chieri; Zhao, Liangjun; Newnam, Gary P; Matange, Kavita R; Thapa, Hem R; Barlow, Brett; Donegan, Rebecca K; Nguyen, Nguyet A; Saccuzzo, Emily G; Obianyor, Chiamaka T; Karunakaran, Suneesh C; Pollet, Pamela; Rothschild-Mancinelli, Brooke; Mestre-Fos, Santi; Guth-Metzler, Rebecca; Bryksin, Anton V; Petrov, Anton S; Hazell, Mallory; Ibberson, Carolyn B; Penev, Petar I; Mannino, Robert G; Lam, Wilbur A; Garcia, Andrés J; Kubanek, Julia; Agarwal, Vinayak; Hud, Nicholas V; Glass, Jennifer B; Williams, Loren Dean; Lieberman, Raquel L",J Biol Chem,,442

Analysis of the monomer/dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of Kd =0.14±0.03â µM, indicating MPro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. We characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme-substrate complexes, and screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by &#8776;35 %.

However, the plurality of advanced sequencing datasets-such as short and long reads-presents a formidable computational challenge to uniformly perform quantitative, variant or phylogenetic analysis, thus limiting its application in public health laboratories engaged in studying epidemic outbreaks. We present a computational tool, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD), to perform integrated analysis of diverse genomic datasets, with a customized analytical module for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The IPD pipeline quantitates individual occurrences of 1060 pathogens and performs mutation and phylogenetic analysis from heterogeneous sequencing datasets. Using IPD, we demonstrate a varying burden (5.055-999655.7 fragments per million) of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts across 1500 short- and long-read sequencing SARS-CoV-2 datasets and identify 4634 SARS-CoV-2 variants (~3.05 variants per sample), including 449 novel variants, across the genome with distinct hotspot mutations in the ORF1ab and S genes along with their phylogenetic relationships establishing the utility of IPD in tracing the genome isolates from the genomic data (as accessed on 11 June 2020). The IPD predicts the occurrence and dynamics of variability among infectious pathogens-with a potential for direct utility in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to help automate the sequencing-based pathogen analysis and in responding to public health threats, efficaciously.

302665,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on change in sleep patterns in an exploratory, cross-sectional online sample of 79 countries",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel viral illness that has rapidly spread worldwide. While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","Rajan, Anjana; Sharaf, Ravi; Brown, Robert S; Sharaiha, Reem Z; Lebwohl, Benjamin; Mahadev, SriHari",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,442

Patent searches have been carried out in Espacenet and the ORBIT database. Different search strings were used by the author, based on his own background knowledge.Expert opinion: SARS-CoV 2 was for the first time fully described on 10 January 2020, so it is so far not possible to determine if, and by whom, patent applications were filed for respective vaccines. On that background, allegations that patents would be responsible for insufficient access to the vaccine in particular in developing countries are baseless. Even the key players are facing contraints caused by third-party patents, and legal disputes are already ongoing. Anyway, the bigger obstacle for worldwide equitable vaccine distribution seems to reside in know how transfer and production capacities, as ramping up production requires considerable efforts.","Storz, Ulrich",Expert Opin Ther Pat,,442
326339,Recurrent injection-site reactions after incorrect subcutaneous administration of a COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"Liberty-restricting measures have been implemented for centuries to limit the spread of infectious diseases. This article considers if and when it may be ethically acceptable to impose selective liberty-restricting measures in order to reduce the negative impacts of a pandemic by preventing particularly vulnerable groups of the community from contracting the disease. We argue that the commonly accepted explanation-that liberty restrictions may be justified to prevent harm to others when this is the least restrictive option-fails to adequately accommodate the complexity of the issue or the difficult choices that must be made, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce a dualist consequentialist approach, weighing utility at both a population and individual level, which may provide a better framework for considering the justification for liberty restrictions. While liberty-restricting measures may be justified on the basis of significant benefits to the population and small costs for overall utility to individuals, the question of whether it is acceptable to discriminate should be considered separately. This is because the consequentialist approach does not adequately account for the value of equality. This value may be protected through the application of an additional proportionality test. An algorithm for making decisions is proposed. Ultimately whether selective liberty-restricting measures are imposed will depend on a range of factors, including how widespread infection is in the community, the level of risk and harm a society is willing to accept, and the efficacy and cost of other mitigation options.","Cameron, James; Williams, Bridget; Ragonnet, Romain; Marais, Ben; Trauer, James; Savulescu, Julian",J. med. ethics,,442

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of what is known about the dissemination and effectiveness of sex education programs and thereby to inform better public policy making in this area. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review based on international scientific literature, in which only peer-reviewed papers were included. To identify reviews, we carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Database Reviews, ERIC, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO. This paper provides a narrative review of reviews of the literature from 2015 to 2020. Results: 20 reviews met the inclusion criteria (10 in school settings, 9 using digital platforms and 1 blended learning program): they focused mainly on reducing risk behaviors (e.g., VIH/STIs and unwanted pregnancies), whilst obviating themes such as desire and pleasure, which were not included in outcome evaluations. The reviews with the lowest risk of bias are those carried out in school settings and are the ones that most question the effectiveness of sex education programs. Whilst the reviews of digital platforms and blended learning show greater effectiveness in terms of promoting sexual and reproductive health in adolescents (ASRH), they nevertheless also include greater risks of bias. Conclusion: A more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of sexual education programs is necessary, especially regarding the opportunities offered by new technologies, which may lead to more cost-effective interventions than with in-person programs. Moreover, blended learning programs offer a promising way forward, as they combine the best of face-to-face and digital interventions, and may provide an excellent tool in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lameiras-Fernández, María; Martínez-Román, Rosana; Carrera-Fernández, María Victoria; Rodríguez-Castro, Yolanda",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,442

Participants were asked to compare the pandemic with an animal and with a color, and to provide contextual sensemaking about their metaphors. A metaphor analysis revealed four convergent mental models of participants' pandemic experiences (i.e., uncertainty, danger, grotesque, and misery) as well as four primary emotions associated with those mental models (i.e., grief, disgust, anger, and fear).

A nivel mundial, las universidades han planteado diversas iniciativas en el pregrado y el internado medico como la virtualización parcial de su contenido curricular, la modificación de su currículo y las actividades educativas y la incorporación de estudiantes de los últimos años a las actividades asistenciales. En el residentado médico, las especialidades quirúrgicas y las que basan su aprendizaje en procedimientos son las más afectadas. Se ha incorporado residentes de distintas especialidades a labores asistenciales diferentes a su especialidad y se ha virtualizado algunas de sus actividades de aprendizaje.

Bulk of research on this virus are carried out to unveil its multivariate pathology. Surprisingly, men are reportedly more vulnerable to COVID-19 even with higher fatality rate compared to women. Thus, it is crucial to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can even affect male fertility as an immediate or long-term consequence of the disease. Among the discrete data available, an important finding is that angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) receptor, that aids the SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is profoundly expressed in testicular cells. In addition, the endogenous androgen milieu and its receptors are associated with ACE2 activation reflecting that enhanced testosterone levels may trigger the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In contrary, hypogonadism has also been reported in the acute phase of some COVID-19 cases. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to systemic oxidative stress (OS), whose severe disruptive effects on testicular functions are well-documented. This article aims to precisely present the possible impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive functions, and to highlight the speculations that need in-depth research for the exact underlying mechanisms how COVID-19 is associated with men's health and fertility.","Dutta, Sulagna; Sengupta, Pallav",Reprod. sci,,442

This almost makes conventional facial recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces. Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95% accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry.

359965,COVID-19 and its implications for Dermatology and Venereology,2020,"The increased risk of harm from COVID-19 infection in pregnancy highlights the importance of including pregnant people in COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment. Promising vaccines being developed include replication-competent platforms, which are typically contraindicated during pregnancy because of theoretical risk. However, replicating vaccines are administered in and around pregnancy, either inadvertently because of unknown pregnancy status or when recommended.The historical cases of Ebola virus, yellow fever, and rubella demonstrate that contradictory messages around the safety of live vaccines in pregnancy have critical public health costs. First, restricting study or use of replicating vaccines in pregnancy may delay or deny access to the only available protection against deadly diseases. Additionally, not vaccinating pregnant people may slow epidemic control. Finally, uncertainty and worry around the safety of live vaccines may lead to terminations of otherwise desired pregnancies after inadvertent vaccination in pregnancy.If one of the vaccines deployed to combat the current global COVID-19 pandemic is replication competent, historical cases offer important lessons for ethical and effective protection for pregnant populations.","Jaffe, Elana; Goldfarb, Ilona Telefus; Lyerly, Anne Drapkin",Am J Public Health,,442

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in pandemic conditions around the globe. We are in the battleground to fight against the virus by rapidly developing therapeutic strategies in tackling SARS-CoV-2 and saving human lives from COVID-19. Scientists are evaluating several known drugs either for the pathogen or the host; however, many of them are reported to be associated with side effects. In the present study, we report the molecular binding mechanisms of the natural alkaloid, noscapine, for repurposing against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme involved in its reproduction. We performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent to investigate the molecular mechanisms of noscapine for stable binding and conformational changes to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The drug repurposing study revealed the high potential of noscapine and proximal binding to the Mpro enzyme in a comparative binding pattern analyzed with chloroquine, ribavirin, and favipiravir. Noscapine binds closely to binding pocket-3 of the Mpro enzyme and depicted stable binding with RMSD 0.1-1.9 Å and RMSF profile peak conformational fluctuations at 202-306 residues, and a Rg score ranging from 21.9 to 22.4 Å. The MM/PB (GB) SA calculation landscape revealed the most significant contribution in terms of binding energy with &#916;PB -19.08 and &#916;GB -27.17 kcal/mol. The electrostatic energy distribution in MM energy was obtained to be -71.16 kcal/mol and depicted high free energy decomposition (electrostatic energy) at 155-306 residues (binding pocket-3) of Mpro by a MM force field. Moreover, the dynamical residue cross-correlation map also stated that the high pairwise correlation occurred at binding residues 200-306 of the Mpro enzyme (binding pocket-3) with noscapine. Principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms with a high number of static hydrogen bonds. The obtained binding results of noscapine were also well correlated with the pharmacokinetic parameters of antiviral drugs.","Kumar, Neeraj; Sood, Damini; van der Spek, Peter J; Sharma, Hari S; Chandra, Ramesh",J Proteome Res,,442

METHODS: Patients with foot complications attending the diabetic foot clinic prior to lockdown who sought teleconsultations during COVID-19 lockdown underwent virtual triage to include clinical history, visual inspection of feet, domiciliary wound care (community nurse assisted dressings) and offloading instructions. The subsequent ulcer, limb and mortality outcomes during the following 24 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (April-September 2020, group 1) were assessed and compared with those who attended foot clinic during the same period in 2019 (April-September, group 2). RESULTS: Group 1 included 561 participants with foot complications provided with teleconsultations, median age 57 (51 to 63) years and diabetes duration of 10 (5 to 16) years. Twelve patients with severe DFU were excluded and 549 patients [357 (65%) neuropathic foot, 104 (18.9%) ischemic foot and 88 (16%) chronic Charcot foot with deformities] were evaluated. There were 227 (41.3%) participants with active DFU at start of lockdown, 32 (5.8%) with new onset ulcer during lockdown (47.1%) and 290 patients without ulcers. Group 2 included 650 participants; active foot ulcer was present in 366 patients. Wound closed or reduced in area in 78.4% of participants of group 1 compared to 76.0% (p = 0.318) in group 2.

The latter may vary in different geographic areas according to prescription profiles and vaccination programs. Beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are the most commonly used antimicrobials during the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia. In their prescription, different aspects such as intrinsic activity, bactericidal effect or their ability to prevent the development of resistance must be taken into account. The latter is related to the PK/PD parameters, the mutant prevention concentration and the so-called selection window. More recently, the potential ecological impact has grown in importance, not only on the intestinal microbiota, but also on the respiratory one. Maintaining the state of eubiosis requires the use of antimicrobials with a low profile of action on anaerobic bacteria. With their use, the resilience of the bacterial populations belonging to the microbiota, the state of resistance of colonization and the collateral damage related to the emergence of resistance to the antimicrobials in pathogens causing the infections and in the bacterial populations integrating the microbiota.","Cantón, R",Rev Esp Quimioter,,442

393117,Longitudinal Analyses Suggest Genomic and Psychological Origins of Disordered Eating and Comorbidities,2020,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious respiratory disease that results from infection with a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not only a short-term infection but that patients (pts) recovering from SARS-CoV2 infection complain of persisting symptoms including: fatigue, diffuse myalgia and weakness, which may lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. There is currently no evidence that nutritional supplements and/or physical exercise can assist in the recovery of pts with chronic fatigue syndrome. 1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when nicotinic acid is metabolized. 1-MNA demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Therefore, we investigated whether 1-MNA supplements could improve exercise tolerance and decrease fatigue among patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThe study population was composed of pts after COVID-19, expressing subjective feelings of limited tolerance to exercise. The selected pts were randomized into two groups: GrM0 - without supplementation; GrM1 - with 1-MNA supplementation. At the beginning of the study (Phase 0), in both groups, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was carried out and fatigue assessment with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was performed. After 1 month (Phase 1), a follow up FSS and 6MWT once more were performed in both groups. ResultsA significant improvement in the mean distance covered in the 6MWT was noted among the pts in GrM1, compared to those in GrM0. We also noted that in GrM1 the 6MWT distance was significantly higher after 1 month of supplementation with 1-MNA, compared to the beginning of the study (515.18 m in Phase 0 vs 557.8m in Phase 1; p = 0.000034). In GrM1, significantly more pts improved their distance in the 6MWT (23 out of 25 pts, equal to 92%), by a mean of 47 meters, compared to GrM0 (15 of 25 pts, equal to 60%) (p = 0.0061). After one month, significantly more patients in the group without 1-MNA had severe fatigue (FSS [≥] 4) compared to the group with supplementation (GrM1 = 5 pts (20%) vs GrM0 = 14pts (56%); p = 0.008). Conclusions1-MNA supplementation significantly improved physical performance in a 6-minute walk test and reduced the percentage of patients with severe fatigue after COVID-19. The comprehensive action of 1-MNA, including anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, as well as activation of the SIRT1 enzyme, may be beneficial for the recovery of patients with persistent symptoms of fatigue and low tolerance to exercise after COVID-19.","Chudzik, Michal; Kapusta, Joanna; Burzynska, Monika",,,442

Although short-term prognosis could be considered benign in the majority of our patients, we should carefully monitor these individuals in order to detect early sign of clinical deterioration and graft dysfunction in the next few months.","Morlacchi, Letizia Corinna; Rossetti, Valeria; Gigli, Lorenzo; Amati, Francesco; Rosso, Lorenzo; Aliberti, Stefano; Nosotti, Mario; Blasi, Francesco",Transpl Infect Dis,,442

406972,Exanthema and eosinophilia in COVID-19 patients: has viral infection a role in drug induced exanthemas?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Individuals infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have experienced different psychiatric manifestations during the period of infectivity and post-COVID-19 infection. Fatigue and anhedonia are among the frequently reported manifestations after recovery from this novel viral pandemic, leading to early evaluation of those patients and proper management of their complaints which have a drastic burden on different domains of life. Also, the period after recovery might have an effect on the severity of these two psychiatric presentations. AIM OF THE WORK: This cross-sectional observational study aimed to investigate the occurrence of post-COVID-19 fatigue and anhedonia and whether the duration after 2 consecutive PCR-negative tests has an implication on the severity of the above-mentioned psychiatric manifestations. METHODS: Socio-demographic characteristics of 200 post-COVID-19 patients were collected, and also, the self-assessment anhedonia scale was used to evaluate the degree of anhedonia. Fatigue assessment scale used to investigate this domain. The study targeted to find a possible correlation between the period after recovery and the other variables including anhedonia and fatigue. RESULTS: The study revealed high scores of different subtypes of self-assessment anhedonia scale (including total intensity, total frequency, and total changes scores) in the studied group, also high score of fatigue assessment scale in those patients. Positive statistically significant correlation between anhedonia and fatigue in post-COVID-19 group, also negative statistically significant correlation between duration after recovery and the other 2 variables(anhedonia and fatigue) in the examined patients. CONCLUSION: Post-COVID-19 fatigue and anhedonia were prevalent and commonly reported in the post-COVID-19 period, also the duration after 2 consecutive negative PCR tests has an implication on the severity rating scale of both anhedonia and fatigue. These findings directed our attention to those reported manifestations which affected the socio-occupational functioning of the individuals during this whole world pandemic.","El Sayed, Samir; Shokry, Doaa; Gomaa, Sarah Mohamed",Neuropsychopharmacol. rep,,442

408691,Are SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies in paediatric patients with chilblain-like lesions indicative of COVID-19 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infection?,2020,"Prevention of infectious diseases through immunisation of the growing ageing adult population is essential to improve healthy ageing. However, many licenced and recommended vaccines for this age group show signs of waning of the protective effect due to declining immune responses (immuno-senescence) and decreasing vaccine uptake. Today's major challenge is to improve vaccine effectiveness and uptake and to deploy efficient vaccination strategies for this age group. The Vaccines and InfecTious diseases in the Ageing popuLation (VITAL) project, with partners from 17 academic & research groups and public institutes as well as seven industry collaborators, aims to address this challenge. The ambition is to provide evidence-based knowledge to local decision makers. Using a holistic and multidisciplinary approach and novel analytical methods, VITAL will provide tools that allow the development of targeted immunisation programs for ageing adults in European countries. The project is based on four pillars focussing on the assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in ageing adults, the dissection of the mechanisms underlying immuno-senescence, the analysis of the clinical and economic public health impact of vaccination strategies and the development of educational resources for healthcare professionals. By the end of the project, a clear, detailed, and integrated program should be available for implementing a consistent, affordable, and sustainable vaccination strategy for ageing adults with regular evaluations of its impact over time.","Van Baarle, Debbie; Bollaerts, Kaatje; Del Giudice, Giuseppe; Lockhart, Stephen; Luxemburger, Christine; Postma, Maarten J; Timen, Aura; Standaert, Baudouin",Vaccine,,442

While multiple inflammatory cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that only the combination of TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ induced inflammatory cell death characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. Mechanistically, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ protected mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases by limiting tissue damage/inflammation.","Karki, Rajendra; Sharma, Bhesh Raj; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Williams, Evan Peter; Zalduondo, Lillian; Samir, Parimal; Zheng, Min; Sundaram, Balamurugan; Banoth, Balaji; Malireddi, R K Subbarao; Schreiner, Patrick; Neale, Geoffrey; Vogel, Peter; Webby, Richard; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Cell,,442

435542,Editor's picks,2021,"The first case of COVID-19 in Japan was reported on 16 January 2020. The total number of the infected has reached 313,844 and the number of deaths has reached 4,379 as of 16 January 2021. This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again. Although Japan has been preparing its medical system since the first wave, maintaining that system has imposed a large economic burden on medical facilities, hence stronger measures and additional support are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 in the coming few months.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei; Kokudo, Norihiro",Biosci Trends,,442

It has also been shown to colocalize to the transcriptase-replicase complex, where many copies of N decorate the viral genome, thereby protecting it from the host immune system. N has also been shown to phase separate upon interaction with viral RNA. N is a 419 amino acid multidomain protein, comprising two folded, RNA-binding and dimerization domains spanning residues 45-175 and 264-365 respectively. The remaining 164 amino acids are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, but there is currently no atomic resolution information describing their behaviour. Here we assign the backbone resonances of the first two intrinsically disordered domains (N1, spanning residues 1-44 and N3, spanning residues 176-263).

This disease has been announced as pandemic by WHO. So far, there has been not much progress in terms of drug development for fighting against this deadliest virus, also no existing drugs has been reported completely effective for COVID-19 treatment owing to lack of effective therapeutic targets and a broad understanding of the viral behavior in target cell. Some reports have found and confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 like others SARS-CoVs utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor for making entry into target cell by binding to the receptor with its S1 subunit and employing host cell proteases for cleaving S2 subunit at S2' in order to fuse with cell membrane. Thus, simultaneous blocking of S1 subunit and inactivation of proteases seem to be promising therapeutic targets for the development of effective novel drugs.

Unprecedented progress made in global health over the past 20 years has reverted and economic growth has already evaporated, giving rise to a global recession, the likes of which we may not have experienced since the Second World War. Our aim is to draw the attention of the neglected tropical disease (NTD) community towards some of the major emerging economic opportunities which are quickly appearing on the horizon as a result of COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: This scoping review relied on a literature search comprised of a sample of articles, statements, and press releases on initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while supporting economic recovery. Of note, the donor scenario and economic development agendas are highly dynamic and expected to change rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, as are donor and lender priorities. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD community, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), will need to work quickly, diligently, and in close collaboration with decision-makers and key stakeholders, across sectors at national and international level to secure its position. Doing so might enhance the odds of grasping potential opportunities to access some of the massive resources that are now available in the form of contributions from corporate foundations, trust funds, loans, debt relieve schemes, and other financial mechanisms, as part of the ongoing and future economic development agendas and public health priorities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper should serve as a starting point for the NTD community to seek much needed financial support in order to sustain and revitalize control and elimination efforts pertaining to NTDs in LMICs.","Ehrenberg, John P; Utzinger, Jürg; Fontes, Gilberto; da Rocha, Eliana Maria Mauricio; Ehrenberg, Nieves; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Steinmann, Peter",Infect Dis Poverty,,442

The model considers the major phenomena taking place in raceway reactors, especially heat absorption by radiation and heat losses by evaporation among others. The characteristic parameters of the model have been calibrated using genetic algorithms, next being validated with a long set of more than 50 days covering different weather conditions. It is worth to highlight the use of the developed model as a tool to analyze the influence of the temperature on the performance of microalgae cultures at large scale. As example, the annual variation of the performance of up to five different microalgae strains has been determined by computing the temperature index, thus the normalized value of performance of whatever microalgae at the real temperature with respect to that achievable at optimal temperature can be established. Results confirm that only strains tolerant to wide ranges of temperature can be efficiently produced all the year around in large scale outdoor raceway reactors without additional temperature control systems.","Rodríguez-Miranda, Enrique; Acién, Francisco G; Guzmán, Jose L; Berenguel, Manuel; Visioli, Antonio",Biotechnol. bioeng,,442

474340,COVID-19 lockdown induced acral dermatosis in children,2020,"Interventional radiology plays a key role in the treatment of symptomatic herniations of intervertebral discs. Through image-guided techniques, it is possible to use minimally invasive procedures with a percutaneous approach that are usually proposed before classic surgery. Thanks to imaging guidance, it is possible to significantly increase accuracy and decrease complication rates. The pivotal principle of these mini-invasive techniques is to remove a small amount of volume of the nucleus of the intervertebral disc which results in a significant reduction in intradiscal pressure; allowing for a consequent reduction in compression of the nervous structures that generate spinal pain. However, it must be considered that this type of treatment is only addressed to contained disc herniations previously diagnosed with a suitable neuroimaging examination. There are different types of treatment using a variety of chemical, thermal or mechanical processes that result in partial removal of the nucleus pulposus. The purpose of this technical note is to illustrate mechanical disc decompression treatment via a percutaneous approach using the DISKOM device (DISKOM percutaneous discectomy probe, Biopsybell, Mirandola, Italy). Indications, complications and various methods of use are described in relation to the different levels of the spine to be treated.","Liguori, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Marco; Gurgitano, Martina; Arrichiello, Antonio; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Di Meglio, Letizia; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Paolucci, Aldo; Galli, Federica; Stellato, Elvira; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta Biomed,,442
476676,Cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19: a first perspective,2020,"In this paper a Bayesian SEIR model is studied to estimate the proportion of the population infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. To capture heterogeneity in the population and the effect of interventions to reduce the rate of epidemic spread, the model uses a time-varying contact rate, whose logarithm has a Gaussian process prior. A Poisson point process is used to model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 and the model is calibrated using data of daily death counts in combination with a snapshot of the the proportion of individuals with an active infection, performed in Stockholm in late March. The methodology is applied to regions in Sweden. The results show that the estimated proportion of the population who has been infected is around 13.5% in Stockholm, by 2020-05-15, and ranges between 2.5% - 15.6% in the other investigated regions. In Stockholm where the peak of daily death counts is likely behind us, parameter uncertainty does not heavily influence the expected daily number of deaths, nor the expected cumulative number of deaths. It does, however, impact the estimated cumulative number of infected individuals. In the other regions, where random sampling of the number of active infections is not available, parameter sharing is used to improve estimates, but the parameter uncertainty remains substantial.","Hult, Henrik; Favero, Martina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13519v1.pdf,442
476677,Cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19: a first perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Restrictions on movement and lockdown are measures taken in many nations, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. University students are additionally burdened by the transition to distance e-learning. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression in university students and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 2,009 students in the University of Patras, Greece, during the national lockdown. Socio-demographic, academic data, and the forced disruption of daily life were assessed along with the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression prevalence was 35.8% and 51.2% respectively. Age, school of study, financial status, self-perceived health status, level of satisfaction with the state's and university's response and specific aspects in the daily routine were associated with both anxiety and depression scores. At higher odds of both depression and anxiety were students with low income, bad health status, annoyed at staying home and those who encountered difficulties with the online education system. Additional risk factors for depression were studies in humanities and social sciences, and low satisfaction with the university's response, while for anxiety were studies in agricultural sciences and absence of information about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Greek students showing depression and anxiety, during the restrictive measures, is alarming. Mental health in university students should be monitored. Mitigation strategies should focus on specific personal, academic and social variables that have been identified as protective factors.","Sazakli, Eleni; Leotsinidis, Michalis; Bakola, Maria; Kitsou, Konstantina Soultana; Katsifara, Amalia; Konstantopoulou, Ariadni; Jelastopulu, Eleni",,,442
478788,In Reply,2020,"DNA strand breaks are a common form of DNA damage that can contribute to chromosomal instability or gene mutations. Such strand breaks may be caused by exposure to heavy metals. The aim of this study was to assess the level of DNA strand breaks caused by µm-scale solid particles of known chemical composition with elevated heavy metals/metalloids, notably arsenic, using an in vitro cell-free DNA plasmid scission assay. These samples were incubated with and without H2O2 to see whether damage occurs directly or indirectly through the Fenton reaction. Levels of DNA damage in the absence of H2O2 were < 10%, but in the presence of H2O2, all samples showed higher levels of damage ranging from 10 to 100% suggesting that damage was being incurred through the Fenton reaction. Using bivariate correlation analysis and multiple linear regression, manganese oxide (MnO), sulphur (S), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the particulates were found to be the most significant predictors of DNA damage. The mechanism of this DNA damage formation has yet to be thoroughly investigated but is hypothesised to be due to reactive oxygen species formation. Further work is required to assess the extent of contribution of reactive oxygen species to this DNA damage, but this study highlights the potential role of chemistry and/or mineralogy to the extent and/or nature of DNA damage caused by particulates.","Badri, Hatim; Polya, David A; Povey, Andrew C",,,442

However, Cu is also a potentially toxic metal, especially to unicellular microbes that are in direct contact with their environment. Since 400 BCE, Cu toxicity has been leveraged for its antimicrobial properties and even today, Cu based materials are being explored as effective antimicrobials against human pathogens spanning bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. Given that Cu has the double-edged property of being both highly toxic and an essential micronutrient, it plays an active and complicated role at the host-pathogen interface. Humans have evolved methods of incorporating Cu into innate and adaptive immune processes and both sides of the penny (Cu toxicity and Cu as a nutrient) are employed. Here we review the evolution of Cu in biology and its multi-faceted roles in infectious disease, from the viewpoints of the microbial pathogens as well as the animal hosts they infect.","Culbertson, Edward M; Culotta, Valeria C",Semin. cell dev. biol,,442

Our previous study reported a discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 antibody response between male and female coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the duration and discrepancy between ages as well as sexes of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in convalescent COVID-19 patients have not been clarified. In this study, a total of 538 health-examination individuals who were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection a year ago were enrolled. Blood samples were collected and detected for IgM and IgG antibodies. Among these convalescent patients, 12.80% were detected positive for IgM antibodies. The positive rates for IgM antibody were close between sexes: for males, this is 9.17% and for females 13.75%. However, the IgG antibody was detected positive in as much as 82.90% convalescent patients and the positive rates were nearly the same between males (82.57%) and females (82.98%). Besides this, the level of IgM and IgG antibodies showed no difference between male and female convalescent patients. The level of IgG antibodies showed a significant difference between ages. The elder patients (over 35 years old) maintained a higher level of IgG antibody than the younger patients (under or equal 35 years old) after recovering for 1 year. In addition, IgG antibody was more vulnerable to disappear in younger patients than in elder patients. Overall, our study identified over 1-year duration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody and age difference of IgG antibody response in convalescent COVID-19 patients. These findings may provide new insights into long-term humoral immune response, vaccines efficacy and age-based personalized vaccination strategies.","Zeng, Fanfan; Wu, Mengjun; Wang, Jinbiao; Li, Jianyu; Hu, Guoyun; Wang, Lin",J. med. virol,,442
495347,International Registry of Otolaryngologist - Head and Neck Surgeons with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the incidence of new onset hepatic steatosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and its impact on outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. METHODS: Retrospective review identified patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy from 2013 to 2018. Preoperative computed tomography scans were evaluated for the development of hepatic steatosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Hypoattenuation included liver attenuation greater than or equal to 10 Hounsfield units less than tissue density of spleen on noncontrast computed tomography and greater than or equal to 20 Hounsfield units less on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a median of 5 cycles (interquartile range (IQR), 4-6). FOLFIRINOX was the regimen in 78% of patients. Hepatic steatosis developed in 36 (24%) patients. The median time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion to pancreatoduodenectomy was 40 days (IQR, 29-51). Preoperative biliary stenting was performed in 126 (86%) patients. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to 23 (15%) patients. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged exposure to chemotherapy were identified as risk factors for chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis. Compared with control patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis, patients developing steatosis had similar rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (8% (control) vs. 4%, p = 0.3), delayed gastric emptying (8% vs. 14%, p = 0.4), and major morbidity (11% vs. 15%, p = 0.6). Ninety-day mortality was similar between groups (8% vs. 2%, p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Hepatic steatosis developed in 24% of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy but was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy.","Flick, K F; Al-Temimi, M H; Maatman, T K; Sublette, C M; Swensson, J K; Nakeeb, A; Ceppa, E P; Nguyen, T K; Schmidt, C M; Zyromski, N J; Tann, M A; House, M G",J Gastrointest Surg,,442

However, poor face-fit is almost universally present in pleated multilayer disposable face masks, severely limiting both individual and community respiratory protection. We developed a set of simple mask modifications to mass-manufactured disposable masks, the most common type of mask used by the public, that dramatically improves both their personalized fit and performance in a low-cost and scalable manner. These modifications comprise a user-moldable full mask periphery wire, integrated earloop tension adjusters, and an inner flange to trap respiratory droplets. We demonstrate that these simple design changes improves quantitative fit factor by 320%, triples the level of protection against aerosolized droplets, and approaches the model efficacy of N95 respirators in preventing the community spread of COVID-19, for an estimated additional cost of less than 5 cents per mask with automated production. TeaserA personalizable, low-cost mask improves facial fit, reduces user exposure, and decreases spread of contagious aerosols.","Hyun, Chulho; Jensen, Mark Martin; Yang, Kisuk; Weaver, James C; Wang, Xiaohong; Kudo, Yoshimasa; Gordon, Steven J; Karp, Jeffrey M; Samir, Anthony E",,,442
505711,Dermoscopy features of COVID-19-related chilblains in children and adolescents,2020,"Late 2019 saw the outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly turned into a pandemic, killing more than 2.77 million people and infecting more than 126 million as of late March 2021. Daily collected data on infection cases and hospitalizations informed decision makers on the ongoing pandemic emergency, enabling the design of diversified countermeasures, from behavioral policies to full lockdowns, to curb the virus spread. In this context, mechanistic models could represent valuable tools to optimize the timing and stringency of interventions, and to reveal non-trivial properties of the pandemic dynamics that could improve the design of suitable guidelines for future epidemics. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Italian epidemic evolution up to mid-December 2020 to gain insight into the main characteristics of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, prior to the emergence of new mutations and the vaccination campaign. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to calibrate a refined version of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model and hence accurately reconstruct the epidemic trajectory. We then derived additional features of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy not directly retrievable from reported data, such as the estimate of the day zero of infection in late November 2019 and the estimate of the spread of undetected infection. The present analysis contributes to a better understanding of the past pandemic waves, confirming the importance of epidemiological modeling to support an informed policy design against epidemics to come.","Fochesato, A.; Simoni, G.; Reali, F.; Giordano, G.; Domenici, E.; Marchetti, L.",Biology,,442

591202,Characteristics of facial skin problems and microbiome variation during wearing masks for fighting against COVID‐19,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND: Effective risk communication about the outbreak of a newly emerging infectious disease in the early stage is critical for managing public anxiety and promoting behavioral compliance. China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on an analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame. RESULTS: The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people (χ(2)(1)=13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government (χ(2)(1)=28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic (χ(2)(1)=32.1, P<.001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support (χ(2)(1)=32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations (χ(2)(1)=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, χ(2)(1)=19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, χ(2)(1)=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, χ(2)(1)=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, χ(2)(1)=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.","Liao, Qiuyan; Yuan, Jiehu; Dong, Meihong; Yang, Lin; Fielding, Richard; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/18796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412414/,442

622386,The crucial role of clinicopathological correlation in COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic challenged health sanitary systems worldwide. 1.65 million cases have been reported in Argentina with 43.635 deaths. CPT emerged as a possible and feasible treatment. Transfusion cardiovascular overload (TACO), acute lung injury (TRALI) and anaphylactic reactions (AR) have raised safety concerns; in the other hand, it is still unknown its efficacy but preliminary reports have claimed that if it is delivered early, mortality or morbidity could be decreased. Pediatric use of CPT is emerging from adults’ studies. OBJECTIVE: To review clinical outcomes, laboratory parameters and side effects of CPT in a single center in Argentina and determine the mortality rate. METHODS: This is a single-center single-arm exploratory-descriptive prospective study, starting on May 1, 2021 until October 31, 2021. A protocol developed for donation of CPT included those individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RT- PCR positive in respiratory secretions and SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive by immunochromatography o chemiluminescence, with a titer by ELISA (Covidar®) > 1:400 and 200 – 250 mL were considered 1 Unit. Recipients weighing <70 kg received 1 unit, and those recipients weighing >70kg received 2 units. CPT was prescribed within 14 days of starting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. All patients received dexamethasone and standard support measures. We used percentages and frequencies for reporting the results of this study. Categorical variables were compared with Chi2 and numeric Fisher/Mann Whitney. Time dependent survival variables were calculated with Kaplan Meier method. SPPS 20 software was used for data processing. RESULTS: The CPT recipients median age (IQR) was 47 years of age (range 43–59 years); 65.5 % were; 12,5% had either hypertension or obesity, 3.1% chronic obstructive lung disease; 30% had diabetes. The median temperature at diagnosed was (IQR) 37.7°C (range 36.6°C - 38.9°C). A total of 39 CPT units were infused in 32 patients. 25 patients (78%) received 1 unit, 6 patients (19%) received 2 units and 1 patient (3%) received 3 units (3%). Donor median (IQR), SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer was 1:400 (range 400–1600); median time (IQR) to transfusion was 1 day (range 1–4). Coverage was 100%. OUTCOMES: 29 patients (91%) survived and 3 (9%) died for COVID-19. Only 3 patients (8%) developed moderate/reversible side effects: allergic reaction (2 pts) and TRALI(1pt) At a median time of 100 days, the median survival was 85% (0.5) and the mortality rate was 19 % (0.6). Laboratory features: CONCLUSION: CPT was feasible to deliver and could be implemented in a less resourced country in a timely fashion. All our patients could afford plasma therapy. No severe adverse events were reported. Pediatric studies can be based on the results of this type of study. Research should focus now on a control case cohort study to determine efficacy of CPT.","Gómez, Sergio Miguel",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab031.044,442
626934,Erythema multiforme after CoronaVac vaccination,2021-07-21,"Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries worldwide have put lockdowns in place to prevent the virus from spreading. Evidence shows that lockdown measures can affect mental health; it is, therefore, important to identify the psychological characteristics making individuals more vulnerable. The present study aimed, first, to identify, through a cluster analysis, the psychological attributes that characterize individuals with similar psychological responses to the COVID-19 home confinement; second, to investigate whether different psychological characteristics, such as personality traits, alexithymia, and resilience, specifically influence anxiety, stress, and depression, depending on the scope of the confinement. We analyzed data from 393 participants who completed an online survey on their experiences during two different phases of the Italian lockdown, characterized by more or less strict measures of confinement. Two clusters were identified which included participants reporting a better (+ER) and worse (−ER) emotional response to the lockdown, respectively. Individuals in the −ER group showed lower emotional stability, resilience, and higher alexithymia. Moreover, even if lifting part of the restrictions decreased psychological distress among all participants, a reduction in perceived stress was observed only among individuals with high resilience. Finally, personality traits, alexithymia, and resilience differently affected depression, anxiety, and stress. Our results suggest that different psychological interventions should be planned depending on the context: mental health professionals should focus on enhancing the individuals’ coping strategies to alleviate stress in emergencies, while long-term intervention aiming at alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms should focus on alexithymic tendencies and personality constructs.","Osimo, Sofia Adelaide; Aiello, Marilena; Gentili, Claudio; Ionta, Silvio; Cecchetto, Cinzia",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716896/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630751,442

Viral sequencing can address key questions about SARS-CoV-2 evolution and may support reconstruction of viral transmission networks by integration of molecular epidemiology into classical contact tracing. METHODS: In collaboration with local public health authorities, we set up an integrated system of genomic surveillance in an urban setting, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and d) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. RESULTS: Application of the integrated system from August to December 2020 enabled a characterization of viral population structure, analysis of 4 outbreaks at a maximum care hospital, and genetically based identification of 5 putative population infection clusters, all of which were confirmed by contact tracing. The system contributed to the development of improved hospital infection control and prevention measures and enabled the identification of previously unrecognized transmission chains, involving a martial arts gym and establishing a link between the hospital to the local population. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated systems of genomic surveillance could contribute to the monitoring and, potentially, improved management of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population.","Walker, Andreas; Houwaart, Torsten; Finzer, Patrick; Ehlkes, Lutz; Tyshaieva, Alona; Damagnez, Maximilian; Strelow, Daniel; Duplessis, Ashley; Nicolai, Jessica; Wienemann, Tobias; Tamayo, Teresa; Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Hülse, Lisanna; Hoffmann, Katrin; Lübke, Nadine; Hauka, Sandra; Andree, Marcel; Däumer, Martin P; Thielen, Alexander; Kolbe-Busch, Susanne; Göbels, Klaus; Zotz, Rainer; Pfeffer, Klaus; Timm, Jörg; Dilthey, Alexander T",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181711/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab588,442

The present study aimed to explore the impact of the psychological symptoms on the occurrence of cognitive failures in a large sample of home-dwelling Italian individuals during quarantine/self-isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We employed an online questionnaire using a virtual platform of Google Moduli. The questionnaire included an assessment of cognitive failures evaluated by the Perceived Memory and Attentional Failures Questionnaire (PerMAFaQ) and of resilience, coping style, depression, anger, and anxiety. RESULTS: The online questionnaire was completed by 4175 participants revealing that about 30% of participants complained of cognitive failures at least sometimes during quarantine/self-isolation, whereas some respondents reported very frequent cognitive failures. Moreover, resilience was found to mediate the relationships between depressive and anger symptoms and cognitive failures. Although no difference was found on PerMAFaQ among smart-workers, non-smart-workers, and those currently not at work, people not working at the moment complained of more frequent cognitive failures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the need to implement psychological support intervention, particularly for vulnerable groups, to reduce anxiety, depression, and anger, and of psychoeducational interventions to enhance resilience reducing possible long-term cognitive consequences of the quarantine.

With this objective, this study applied a transversal, descriptive and analytical design in a sample of 1377 Spaniards during the confinement of COVID-19 from March 14 to June 20, 2020. The results report that music has been an essential generalized support for living with isolation and a powerful instrument for emotional self-regulation and relief from loneliness. Although an increase of 56% in the daily use of music for self-regulation of emotions was detected, higher frequencies of consumption, mainly in solitude, and a better conception of this artistic expression are identified in the population over 51 years old. However, young people between 18 and 40 years old stood out in the use of music as a resource to alleviate loneliness. These results confirm that music seems to have arisen as one of the most used artistic expressions to cope with loneliness, to relate to the outside or as a tool to endure psychological and emotional states catalogued as negative such as anxiety, anguish and depression, among others. Likewise, they evidence its role in personal and social wellbeing in distant age ranges, and the relational influence of music and age in contexts of isolation and loneliness.","Martín, Javier Centeno; Ortega-Sánchez, Delfín; Miguel, Ignacio Nieto; Gil Martín, Gracia María",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665439/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,442

Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured throughout in the experiment. No clinical signs of FIP were evident in the experimental cats after immunization. After challenge, the immunized cats demonstrated one of four clinical outcomes: (1) classical effusive FIP; (2) accelerated FIP; (3) non-effusive FIP, or (4) resistance to challenge. Only minor cytokine changes were observed following immunization, however, several cytokine changes occurred following challenge-exposure. The most noteworthy changes were in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Our preliminary findings suggest that immunity against FIP is associated with TNF-α and IFN-γ response imbalance, with high TNF-α/low IFN-γ mRNA responses favouring disease and low TNF-α/high IFN-γ mRNA responses being indicative of immunity.","Kiss, I.; Poland, A.M.; Pedersen, N.C.",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123153/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X04000051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X04000051,442

Given the accessibility of running as exercise, gaining information on running behaviors, motivations, and running-related injury (RRI) risk during the pandemic is warranted. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on running volume, behaviors, motives, and RRI changes from the year prior to the pandemic to the timeframe during social isolation restrictions. Runners of all abilities were recruited via social media to complete a custom Qualtrics survey. Demographics, running volume, behaviors, motivations, and injury status were assessed for the year prior to the pandemic, and during social isolation measures. Descriptive statistics and Student’s t-tests were used to assess changes in running outcomes during the pandemic. Logistic regressions were used to assess the influence of demographics on running behaviors and injury. Adjusted RRI risk ratios were calculated to determine the odds of sustaining an injury during the pandemic. Alpha was set to.05 for all analyses. A total of 1147 runners (66% females, median age: 35 years) across 15 countries (96% United States) completed the survey. Runners reported increased runs per week (Mean Difference with Standard Error [MD]: 0.30 [0.05], p < .001), sustained runs (MD: 0.44 [0.05], p < .001), mileage (MD: 0.87 [0.33], p = .01), and running times of day (MD: 0.11 [0.03], p < .001) during the pandemic, yet reported less workouts (i.e. sprint intervals; MD: -0.33 [0.06], p < .001), and less motives (MD [SE]: -0.41 [0.04], p < .001). Behavior changes were influenced by running experience and age. There was 1.40 (CI: 1.18,1.61) times the RRI risk during the pandemic compared to prior to the social isolation period. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced runners’ behaviors with increased training volume, decreased intensity and motivation, and heightened injury risk.

We present a risk assessment framework for assessing risks of further worldwide spread of this pathogen. This framework first requires identification of potential vehicles of introduction, including international transfers of hospital patients, international tourism and migration, and trade in livestock, associated commodities, and foodstuffs. It then calls for assessment of the risks of pathogen release, of exposure of individuals if release happens, and of resulting outbreaks. Health departments in countries unaffected by outbreaks should assess the risk of introduction or reintroduction of C difficile PCR ribotype 027 using a structured risk-assessment approach.","Clements, Archie CA; Magalhães, Ricardo J Soares; Tatem, Andrew J; Paterson, David L; Riley, Thomas V",Lancet Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309910700803; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309910700803; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(10)70080-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20510280/,442

Specifically, business cycles have a different influence on health expenditure before and after the financial crisis in 2008. Our findings also show that income inequality can moderate the impact of business cycles on health expenditure in China.

E1 is a transmembrane protein spanning the lipid bilayer several times. It is synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence, localized intracellularly, and not transported to the cell surface. It thus represents a model intracellular protein. We found that the synthesis of E1 is specifically and stably blocked by the addition of signal recognition particle to the wheat germ system. Subsequent addition of salt-extracted pancreatic microsomes resulted in the full release of this arrest as well as the completion and the correct membrane integration of E1. Such signal recognition particle-induced arrests failed to produce shorter peptides of a defined length. Addition of signal recognition particle to a synchronized translation at any time during the synthesis of about the first two thirds of E1 (150 amino acids) blocked further translation, suggesting that the most C-terminal of the three internal hydrophobic domains of E1 could function as its signal sequence.","Rottier, P; Armstrong, J; Meyer, D I",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818891190; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925818891190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2985561/,442

Social distancing and avoidance of unnecessary movements are preventive strategies that are being advocated to prevent the spread of the causative virus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2]. It is known that epileptic children need long term treatments (antiepileptic drugs and/or immunosuppressive agents) as well as close follow up due to the nature of the disease. In addition, it is clear that epilepsy can concur with other chronic illnesses which can lower body immunity. As a result, epileptic children have high risk of acquiring this novel disease due to weak/immature immune system. Of concern, the management of children with epilepsy has become more challenging during this outbreak due to the prevention measures that are being taken. Although children with controlled seizures can be managed at home, it is challenging for pediatricians when it comes to cases with uncontrolled seizures/severe cases. To this end, we provide recommendations for the management of epileptic children at home, outpatient and inpatient settings.","Chen, Baiyu; Kessi, Miriam; Chen, Shimeng; Xiong, Juan; Wu, Liwen; Deng, Xiaolu; Yang, Lifen; He, Fang; Yin, Fei; Peng, Jing",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984209/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00495,442

METHODS A total of 345 women, of whom 267 experienced breast cancer and 78 experienced a gynecological cancer, were enrolled. Specific questionnaires about their experiences and feelings about telemedicine in the COVID-19 era were collected. RESULTS In the breast group, ""Enhanced care"" showed moderate positive perception (mean 4.40) among less-educated women that was slightly lower among better-educated women (mean 4.14) with a significant difference (P=0.034). ""Satisfaction"" had an opposite pattern: a mean of 3.99 for a lower level of education and 4.78 for a higher level of education, with a strong significant difference (P<0.001). ""Privacy and discomfort"" approached neutrality for less-educated women, while for higher-educated women the lower mean of 2.93 indicted a more positive perception (P=0.007).

It has not only infected human, but also been reported interspecies transmission from humans to other animals, such as pigs, poultry, dogs and cats. However, prevalence of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus infections in cats in northeastern China is unknown. Therefore, the prevalence of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus infections was performed among cats in northeastern China in this study. FINDINGS: Of all samples in this study, the overall seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in cats was 21% (240/1140). It also showed a higher prevalence rate of pandemic(H1N1) 2009 infection in pet cats (30.6%) than roaming cats (11%) based on NT. In addition, the results also showed a trend of difference in term of species of cats and it was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first survey on the seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection among cats in northeastern China. This study has observed a relatively high seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among different cat populations in northeastern China, similar seroprevalence studies should be conducted elsewhere.","Zhao, Fu-Rong; Liu, Chun-Guo; Yin, Xin; Zhou, Dong-Hui; Wei, Ping; Chang, Hui-Yun",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624924/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-49,442

Remote sensing-based assessment is performed to analyze before and during the lockdown amid COVID-19 lockdown in the cities. Air pollution and mobility data of each city (Bangkok, Beijing, Busan, Dhaka, Delhi, Ho Chi Minh, Hong Kong, Karachi, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, Wuhan, and few others) have been collected and analyzed for 2019 and 2020. Results indicated that almost every city was impacted positively regarding environmental emissions and visible reduction were found in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) concentrations before and during lockdown periods of 2020 as compared to those of 2019. The highest NO(2) emission reduction (~ 50%) was recorded in Wuhan city during the lockdown of 2020. AOD was highest in Beijing and lowest in Colombo (< 10%). Overall, 90% movement was reduced till mid-April, 2020. A 98% reduction in mobility was recorded in Delhi, Seoul, and Wuhan. This analysis suggests that smart mobility and partial shutdown policies could be developed to reduce environmental pollutions in the region.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide register‐based cohort study in Sweden, February through May, 2020, to assess whether ongoing direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use was associated with reduced risk of hospital admission for laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19, or a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death due to laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. RESULTS: DOAC use (n = 103 703) was not associated with reduced risk of hospital admission for COVID‐19 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] [95% confidence interval] 1.00 [0.75–1.33] vs. nonuse atrial fibrillation comparator [n = 36 875]; and aHR 0.94 [0.80–1.10] vs. nonuse cardiovascular disease comparator [n = 355 699]), or ICU admission or death due to COVID‐19 (aHRs 0.76 [0.51–1.12], and 0.90 [0.71–1.15], respectively). CONCLUSION: Ongoing DOAC use was not associated with reduced risk of severe COVID‐19, indicating that prognosis would not be modified by early outpatient DOAC initiation.","Flam, B.; Wintzell, V.; Ludvigsson, J.

This editorial is aimed at increasing awareness of mental issues amongst healthcare professionals, identifying perceived barriers to seeking help, and suggesting ways in which to seek help. Mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, are prevalent from medical school, leading to increased burnout and suicide risks at later stages of a clinician’s career. There is often a reluctance to seek help, particularly amongst the surgical specialties, caused by self-criticism, lack of convenient access and the potential negative impact on medical licensure. This editorial has been written in loving memory of our colleague, friend and board member Dr. Nikolaus Veit-Rubin, who sadly passed away at the beginning of the year. It is written in the hope of highlighting the importance of maintaining mental wellbeing amongst the medical team, supporting help-seeking behaviour and changing attitudes toward mental health disorders amongst clinicians.","Patel, Mittal; Swift, Steven; Digesu, Alex",Int Urogynecol J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04805-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938962/,442

Countermeasures adopted thus far to curb these informational disorders have had limited success because these did not account for the diversity of informational contexts on social media, focusing instead almost exclusively on curating the factual content of user’s posts. However, content-focused measures do not address the primary causes of the infodemic itself, namely the user’s need to post content as a way of making sense of the situation and for gathering reactions of consensus from friends. This paper describes three types of informational context—weak epistemic, strong normative and strong emotional—which have not yet been taken into account by current measures to curb down the informational disorders. I show how these contexts are related to the infodemic and I propose measures for dealing with them for future global crisis situations.","Marin, Lavinia",Ethics Inf Technol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09550-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868972/,442

669215,Comment on “Cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19: a first perspective ” by Recalcati S,2020-04-21,"Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) operating in the food retailing sector encounter two main concerns with respect to their perishable inventory management system, i.e., the product’s shelf life and investment in warehouse monitoring systems. New technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), automated inventory control platforms, and automatic storage and retrieval systems offer effective solutions to these issues. However, MSMEs are reluctant to adopt these technologies due to their prior perception of higher implementation costs and the expected benefits. The present study aims to optimize IoT implementation in MSMEs’ inventory management systems and to provide tangible proof of its feasibility and usefulness. In so doing, we propose a mathematical model and analyze the impact of IoT through two case studies. The model provides a cost–benefit analysis of IoT investments that aim to increase products’ shelf life. We adopted the fractional program method, solved by particle swarm optimization on MATLAB software. The findings demonstrate the positive correlation between adopting IoT and reduced inventory costs supporting IoT deployment for improved perishability performance in MSMEs. The study offers several insights and practical guidelines in considering IoT deployment in MSMEs.","Maheshwari, Pratik; Kamble, Sachin; Pundir, Ashok; Belhadi, Amine; Ndubisi, Nelson Oly; Tiwari, Sunil",Ann Oper Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04277-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642526/,442

Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients. Methods: 647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD related and Covid-19 related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of normal population consist of 1215 individuals. Results: Prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. Prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients undergone DBS was 18.18%. No significant association was found between duration of disease and prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patient who had a direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders including anxiety and sleeping disorders and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status. Conclusion: PD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols which leads to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.","Salari, M.; Etemadifar, M.; Zali, A.; Aminzade, Z.; Farsinejad, P.; Tehrani Fateh, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252464; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252464v1?rss=1,442

A total of 3609 individuals were included in this analysis. Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) class antibodies] at three private laboratories (Istituto Diganostico Varelli, Medical Center, and Casa della Salute di Genova). Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0% [398/3609; confidence interval (CI) 10.0%–12.1%]. Seroprevalence was higher in female inmates than in male inmates (12.5% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), with the highest rate observed among adults aged >55 years (13.2%). A generalized estimating equations model showed that the main risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were the following: an occupational exposure to the virus [Odd ratio (OR) = 2.36; 95% CI 1.59–3.50, p = 0.001], being a long-term care facility resident (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 3.19–6.45, p = 0.001), and reporting previous symptoms of influenza-like illness (OR = 4.86; 95% CI 3.75–6.30, p = 0.001) or loss of sense of smell or taste (OR = 41.00; 95% CI 18.94–88.71, p = 0.001). In conclusion, we found a high prevalence (11.0%) of SARS-CoV-2 infection that is significantly associated with residing in long-term care facilities or occupational exposure to the virus.

Studies and application of nanotechnology was explored very extensively in the human medical field and also studies undertaken in rodents extensively, still either studies or applications in veterinary medicine is not up to the level when compared to applications to human beings. The application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively innovative. Recently, in the era of health care technologies, Veterinary Medicine also entered into a new phase and incredible transformations. Nanotechnology has tremendous and potential influence not only the way we live, but also on the way that we practice veterinary medicine and increase the safety of domestic animals, production, and income to the farmers through use of nanomaterials. The current status and advancements of nanotechnology is being used to enhance the animal growth promotion, and production. To achieve these, nanoparticles are used as alternative antimicrobial agents to overcome the usage alarming rate of antibiotics, detection of pathogenic bacteria, and also nanoparticles being used as drug delivery agents as new drug and vaccine candidates with improved characteristics and performance, diagnostic, therapeutic, feed additive, nutrient delivery, biocidal agents, reproductive aids, and finally to increase the quality of food using various kinds of functionalized nanoparticles, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, micellar nanoparticles, and metal nanoparticles.

688965,Comment on: Cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19: a first perspective. Safety concerns of clinical images and skin biopsies,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydiae induce persistent infections, which have been associated with a wide range of chronic diseases in humans and animals. Mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established. RESULTS: Infected cultures were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and re-infection experiments. By IF, Chlamydia-infected cells showed normal inclusions after 39 hpi. Dual infections with Chlamydia abortus revealed a heterogenous mix of inclusion types including small inclusions consisting of aberrant bodies (ABs), medium-sized inclusions consisting of ABs and reticulate bodies and normal inclusions. Only aberrant inclusions were observable in dual infection experiments with Chlamydia pecorum and PEDV. TEM examinations of mixed infections with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum revealed aberrant chlamydial inclusions containing reticulate-like, pleomorphic ABs, which were up to 2 μm in diameter. No re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) was detected. In re-infection experiments, co-infected cells produced fewer EBs than monoinfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirm that PEDV co-infection alters the developmental cycle of member species of the family Chlamydiaceae, in a similar manner to other well-described persistence induction methods. Interestingly, this effect appears to be partially species-specific as Chlamydia pecorum appears more sensitive to PEDV co-infection than Chlamydia abortus, as evidenced by TEM and IF observations of a homogenous population of aberrant inclusions in PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections.","Borel, Nicole; Dumrese, Claudia; Ziegler, Urs; Schifferli, Andrea; Kaiser, Carmen; Pospischil, Andreas",BMC Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663197/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-10-201,442

Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more. Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world’s COVID-19 death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of confirmed deaths.","Karlinsky, Ariel; Kobak, Dmitry",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250604v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532789/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604,442
