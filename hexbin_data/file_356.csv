622,Dominating Biological Networks,2011-08-26,"Proteins are essential macromolecules of life that carry out most cellular processes. Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one would expect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPI networks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of “biologically central (BC)” genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drug-targeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its “spine” that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.","Milenković, Tijana; Memišević, Vesna; Bonato, Anthony; Pržulj, Nataša",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3162560/,356
2432,A Computer-Aided Detection System for Digital Chest Radiographs,2016-05-31,"Computer-aided detection systems aim at the automatic detection of diseases using different medical imaging modalities. In this paper, a novel approach to detecting normality/pathology in digital chest radiographs is proposed. The problem tackled is complicated since it is not focused on particular diseases but anything that differs from what is considered as normality. First, the areas of interest of the chest are found using template matching on the images. Then, a texture descriptor called local binary patterns (LBP) is computed for those areas. After that, LBP histograms are applied in a classifier algorithm, which produces the final normality/pathology decision. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposal, with success rates above 87% in the best cases. Moreover, our technique is able to locate the possible areas of pathology in nonnormal radiographs. Strengths and limitations of the proposed approach are described in the Conclusions.","Carrillo-de-Gea, Juan Manuel; García-Mateos, Ginés; Fernández-Alemán, José Luis; Hernández-Hernández, José Luis",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5058572/,356
4134,An Exploration of Machine Learning Methods for Robust Boredom Classification Using EEG and GSR Data,2019-10-20,"In recent years, affective computing has been actively researched to provide a higher level of emotion-awareness. Numerous studies have been conducted to detect the user’s emotions from physiological data. Among a myriad of target emotions, boredom, in particular, has been suggested to cause not only medical issues but also challenges in various facets of daily life. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants’ questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781). It also revealed the correlation between boredom and the combined features of EEG and GSR. These results can be useful for building accurate affective computing systems and understanding the physiological properties of boredom.","Seo, Jungryul; Laine, Teemu H.; Sohn, Kyung-Ah",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832442/,356

9513,El dengue,2009-01-06,"Isothermal amplification assays, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), show great utility for the development of rapid diagnostics for infectious diseases because they have high sensitivity, pathogen-specificity and potential for implementation at the point of care. However, elimination of non-specific amplification remains a key challenge for the optimization of LAMP assays. Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA. By differentiating true and false positives, HRM enables determination of the optimal assay and analysis parameters that leads to the lowest limit of detection (LOD) in a digital isothermal amplification assay.","Rolando, Justin C; Jue, Erik; Barlow, Jacob T; Ismagilov, Rustem F",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144905/,356
10500,Uncertainty Assisted Robust Tuberculosis Identification With Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks,2020-01-28,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a multi-host pathogen that can cause significant mortality in domestic, wild terrestrial and marine mammals. It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a life-threatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3(™) qPCR thermocycler. Biomeme’s extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.","Tomaszewicz Brown, Ania; McAloose, Denise; Calle, Paul P.; Auer, Angelika; Posautz, Annika; Slavinski, Sally; Brennan, Robin; Walzer, Chris; Seimon, Tracie A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176111/,356
13053,Detection of Focal and Non-Focal Electroencephalogram Signals Using Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform and Artificial Neural Network,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: The impact of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia has not been well established due to the inclusion of the three phenotypically indistinguishable Acinetobacter species and confounding factors including underlying diseases and severity of infection. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of appropriate antimicrobial therapy on 14-day mortality in A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia patients after adjusting for risk factors. METHODS: This study was conducted at five medical centers in Taiwan between July 2012 and June 2016. A. baumannii species identification was performed using reference molecular methods. Risk factors for 14-day mortality were analyzed via logistic regression. The interaction between the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and appropriate antimicrobial therapy was assessed using the logistic model. RESULTS: A total of 336 patients with monomicrobial A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia were included in this study. The overall 14-day mortality rate was 47.3%. The crude mortality of appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 35.9% (57 of 151 patients). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with a lower mortality after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–0.97; p = 0.04), and the effect was influenced by APACHE II score (OR for interaction term, 0.0098; 95% CI, 0.0005–0.1885; p = 0.002). Further analysis demonstrated that appropriate antimicrobial therapy significantly reduced 14-day mortality among the patients with an APACHE II score > 35 (OR 0.0098; 95% CI 0.0005–0.1885). CONCLUSION: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy decreases 14-day mortality of the most severely ill patients with A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia.","Kang, Fang-Yu; How, Chorng-Kuang; Wang, Yung-Chih; Cheng, Aristine; Yang, Ya-Sung; Kuo, Shu-Chen; Liu, Chang-Pan; Liu, Yuag-Meng; Chen, Te-Li; Lee, Yi-Tzu",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523485/,356
14172,Deep-learning-assisted detection and segmentation of rib fractures from CT scans: Development and validation of FracNet,2020-11-10,"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is rare and associated with a suboptimal prognosis. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify prognostic factors, with a particular focus on the dynamics of serum AFP levels during treatment, in AFPGC patients. Data of patients with pathologically diagnosed primary gastric cancer treated with various modalities electronically collected in the medical management systems of 2 hospitals (ie, Shihezi People's Hospital and Shihezi Hospital) in Shihezi city, northwest China, from January 2007 to October 2018 were reviewed. Patients with AFPGC were identified based on serum AFP levels. Associations of the change in serum AFP levels and clinicopathological parameters with treatment response, including the overall response rate and disease control rate, and outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were compared among different groups. Of 2354 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, 96 patients with AFPGC were identified. The objective response rate and disease control rate were significantly higher in patients whose AFP level decreased by ≥50% than in patients whose AFP level decreased by <50% (68.8% vs. 40.6%, and 87.5% vs. 53.1%, respectively, both P < .05). The median OS and PFS were 32.0 (4-74) and 24.0 (1-66) months, respectively, in patients with a ≥50% decline in AFP, and 12.5 (0-69) and 9.0 (0-63) months, respectively, in those with a <50% decline in AFP (both P < .05). On univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor, node, metastasis staging classification stage, liver metastasis, curable surgery, and the decline in the serum AFP level were associated with OS and PFS. A significant decline in the serum AFP level was associated with good treatment response and prognosis in AFPGC. Along with a decline in the serum AFP level, tumor, node, metastasis staging classification stage, liver metastasis, and curable surgery were also independent factors associated with prognosis.","Wang, Ruhan; Li, Jing; Xu, Dan; Li, Ruiyang; Gong, Ping",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676545/,356
14223,Convolutional Neural Network Classifies Pathological Voice Change in Laryngeal Cancer with High Accuracy,2020-10-25,"The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a tumor-associated antigen and a potential target for tumor vaccine. The EpCAM is a cell-surface glycoprotein highly expressed in colorectal carcinomas. The objective of the present study is to develop an edible vaccine system through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa). For the transformation, two plant expression vectors containing genes encoding for the EpCAM recombinant protein along with the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Joining (J)-chain tagged with the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (J-chain K) were constructed. The vectors were successfully transformed and expressed in the Chinese cabbage individually using Agrobacterium. The transgenic Chinese cabbages were screened using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in T(0) transgenic plant lines generated from both transformants. Similarly, the immunoblot analysis revealed the expression of recombinant proteins in the transformants. Further, the T(1) transgenic plants were generated by selfing the transgenic plants (T(0)) carrying EpCAM–IgM Fc and J-chain K proteins, respectively. Subsequently, the T(1) plants generated from EpCAM–IgM Fc and J-chain K transformants were crossed to generate F(1) plants carrying both transgenes. The presence of both transgenes was validated using PCR in the F(1) plants. In addition, the expression of Chinese cabbage-derived EpCAM–IgM Fc × J-chain K was evaluated using immunoblot and ELISA analyses in the F(1) plants. The outcomes of the present study can be utilized for the development of a potential anti-cancer vaccine candidate using Chinese cabbage.","Lee, Ye-Rin; Lim, Chae-Yeon; Lim, Sohee; Park, Se Ra; Hong, Jong-Pil; Kim, Jinhee; Lee, Hye-Eun; Ko, Kisung; Kim, Do-Sun",Plants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693566/,356
14654,A Blockchain-Based Multi-Mobile Code-Driven Trust Mechanism for Detecting Internal Attacks in Internet of Things,2020-12-22,"This study examines the current state of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology applications and their impact on the healthcare industry. In addition to a thorough review of the literature, this study analyzed several real-world examples of AI applications in healthcare. The results indicate that major hospitals are, at present, using AI-enabled systems to augment medical staff in patient diagnosis and treatment activities for a wide range of diseases. In addition, AI systems are making an impact on improving the efficiency of nursing and managerial activities of hospitals. While AI is being embraced positively by healthcare providers, its applications provide both the utopian perspective (new opportunities) and the dystopian view (challenges to overcome). We discuss the details of those opportunities and challenges to provide a balanced view of the value of AI applications in healthcare. It is clear that rapid advances of AI and related technologies will help care providers create new value for their patients and improve the efficiency of their operational processes. Nevertheless, effective applications of AI will require effective planning and strategies to transform the entire care service and operations to reap the benefits of what technologies offer.","Lee, DonHee; Yoon, Seong No",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7795119/,356
15235,A Deep Learning Model for Predictive Maintenance in Cyber-Physical Production Systems Using LSTM Autoencoders,2021-02-01,"Enormous progress has been made in global efforts to eradicate poliovirus, using live-attenuated Sabin oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). However, as the incidence of disease due to wild poliovirus has declined, vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) has emerged in areas of low-vaccine coverage. Coordinated global cessation of routine, type 2 Sabin OPV (OPV2) use has not resulted in fewer VDPV outbreaks, and continued OPV use in outbreak-response campaigns has seeded new emergences in low-coverage areas. The limitations of existing vaccines and current eradication challenges warranted development of more genetically stable OPV strains, most urgently for OPV2. Here, we report using codon deoptimization to further attenuate Sabin OPV2 by changing preferred codons across the capsid to non-preferred, synonymous codons. Additional modifications to the 5′ untranslated region stabilized known virulence determinants. Testing of this codon-deoptimized new OPV2 candidate (nOPV2-CD) in cell and animal models demonstrated that nOPV2-CD is highly attenuated, grows sufficiently for vaccine manufacture, is antigenically indistinguishable from Sabin OPV2, induces neutralizing antibodies as effectively as Sabin OPV2, and unlike Sabin OPV2 is genetically stable and maintains an attenuation phenotype. In-human clinical trials of nOPV2-CD are ongoing, with potential for nOPV strains to serve as critical vaccine tools for achieving and maintaining polio eradication.","Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer L.; Campagnoli, Ray; Vincent, Annelet; Shaw, Jing; Wei, Ling; Wynn, Nhien T.; Smithee, Shane E.; Bujaki, Erika; Te Yeh, Ming; Laassri, Majid; Zagorodnyaya, Tatiana; Weiner, Amy J.; Chumakov, Konstantin; Andino, Raul; Macadam, Andrew; Kew, Olen; Burns, Cara C.",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7083942/,356

Hence, many strategies and approaches have been widely developed for cancer treatment. This work prepared and evaluated the antitumor activity of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) loaded chromium nanoparticles (5-FuCrNPs). The green biosynthesis approach using Harpullia (H) pendula aqueous extract was used for CrNPs preparation, which was further loaded with 5-Fu. The prepared NPs were characterized for morphology using scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM). The results revealed the formation of uniform, mono-dispersive, and highly stable CrNPs with a mean size of 23 nm. Encapsulation of 5-Fu over CrNPs, with a higher drug loading efficiency, was successful with a mean size of 29 nm being produced. In addition, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) were also used for the investigation. The drug 5-Fu was adsorbed on the surface of biosynthesized CrNPs in order to overcome its clinical resistance and increase its activity against CRC cells. Box–Behnken Design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to characterize and optimize the formulation factors (5-Fu concentration, CrNP weight, and temperature). Furthermore, the antitumor activity of the prepared 5-FuCrNPs was tested against CRC cells (CACO-2). This in vitro antitumor study demonstrated that 5-Fu-loaded CrNPs markedly decreased the IC50 of 5-Fu and exerted more cytotoxicity at nearly all concentrations than 5-Fu alone.

In Archaea, recoding has been unequivocally determined only for termination codon readthrough events that regulate the incorporation of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, and for −1 programmed frameshifting that allow the expression of a fully functional α-l-fucosidase in the crenarchaeon Saccharolobus solfataricus, in which several functional interrupted genes have been identified. Increasing evidence suggests that the flexibility of the genetic code decoding could provide an evolutionary advantage in extreme conditions, therefore, the identification and study of interrupted genes in extremophilic Archaea could be important from an astrobiological point of view, providing new information on the origin and evolution of the genetic code and on the limits of life on Earth. In order to shed some light on the mechanism of programmed −1 frameshifting in Archaea, here we report, for the first time, on the analysis of the transcription of this recoded archaeal α-l-fucosidase and of its full-length mutant in different growth conditions in vivo. We found that only the wild type mRNA significantly increased in S. solfataricus after cold shock and in cells grown in minimal medium containing hydrolyzed xyloglucan as carbon source.

Apoptosis is a physiological process of cell death that occurs as part of normal development and responds to a variety of physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. The identification of molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of key apoptotic proteins is important. This study aimed to investigate apoptotic related genes in the trachea tissue of infected (IBV variant 2, and APEC serotype O78: K80) SPF chickens group compared to the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty SPF chickens was divided into 2 groups. Differential transcriptional profile in the infected SPF chickens trachea tissue was compared to those of control group in the early stage of infection by Illumina RNA-seq technique paired-end and strand-specific sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of transcriptome profiling of the trachea from the infected group were identified. Gene ontology category, KEGG pathway, and STRING analysis were analyzed to identify relationships among differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: Twenty-eight apoptotic genes were identified. They consisted of six pathways related to cell death: the extrinsic pathway, intrinsic pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and cell death by NFkB and activates mTOR pathway and some regulator and apoptosis inhibitors. CONCLUSION: All of the apoptotic genes in our study were up-regulated.

Alteration of the nuclear pore complex has been observed not only in viruses that replicate in the nucleus but also in viruses with a cytoplasmic replicative cycle. In this last case, the alteration of the NPC can reduce the transport of transcription factors involved in the immune response or mRNA maturation, or inhibit the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, favoring the translation of viral mRNAs or allowing access to nuclear factors necessary for viral replication. In most cases, the alteration of the NPC is mediated by viral proteins, being the viral proteases, one of the most critical groups of viral proteins that regulate these nucleus–cytoplasmic transport changes.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate Computer-Aided Analysis of Risk Yield (CANARY), a validated virtual biopsy and risk-stratification machine-learning tool for lung adenocarcinomas, in a Korean patient population. To this end, a total of 380 GGNs from 360 patients who underwent pulmonary resection in a single institution were reviewed. Based on the Score Indicative of Lung Cancer Aggression (SILA), a quantitative indicator of CANARY analysis results, all of the GGNs were classified as “indolent” (atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinomas in situ, or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma) or “invasive” (invasive adenocarcinoma) and compared with the pathology reports. By considering the possibility of uneven class distribution, statistical analysis was performed on the 1) entire cohort and 2) randomly extracted six sets of class-balanced samples. For each trial, the optimal cutoff SILA was obtained from the receiver operating characteristic curve. The classification results were evaluated using several binary classification metrics. Of a total of 380 GGNs, the mean SILA for 65 (17.1%) indolent and 315 (82.9%) invasive lesions were 0.195±0.124 and 0.391±0.208 (p < 0.0001). The area under the curve (AUC) of each trial was 0.814 and 0.809, with an optimal threshold SILA of 0.229 for both. The macro F1-score and geometric mean were found to be 0.675 and 0.745 for the entire cohort, while both scored 0.741 in the class-equalized dataset. From these results, CANARY could be confirmed acceptable in classifying GGN for Korean patients after the cutoff SILA was calibrated. We found that adjusting the cutoff SILA is needed to use CANARY in other countries or races, and geometric mean could be more objective than F1-score or AUC in the binary classification of imbalanced data.","Lee, Juyoung; Bartholmai, Brian; Peikert, Tobias; Chun, Jaehee; Kim, Hojin; Kim, Jin Sung; Park, Seong Yong",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202915/,356

In India, the influencing factor that promotes dissemination of emerging and re-emerging viral infections is the biogeographical zones: a megadiverse country, characterized by varied geographical, climatic conditions and ever-changing socio-economical and geopolitical issues. These influence the movement of humans and animals and add layers of complexity for the identification and timely management of infectious diseases. This review focuses on two tick-borne infections: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Kyasanur forest disease (KFD). In the last two decades, these viruses have emerged and caused outbreaks in different parts of India. KFD virus was initially identified in 1957 and was known to be endemic in Karnataka State while CCHF virus was first identified during 2010 in Gujarat State, India. These viruses have managed to emerge in new areas within the last decade. With changing epidemiology of these arboviruses, there is a probability of the emergence of these viruses from new areas in future. The investigations on these two diseases under the One Health focus involved early detection, quickly developing diagnostic tools, identifying stakeholders, capacity building by developing collaboration with major stakeholders to understand the epidemiology and geographical spread in domestic animal reservoirs and tick vectors in the affected areas, developing laboratory network, providing diagnostic reagents and biosafety and laboratory diagnosis training to the network laboratories to control these diseases.","Mourya, Devendra T.; Yadav, Pragya D.; Patil, Deepak Y.; Sahay, Rima R.; Rahi, Manju",Indian J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204825/,356
18580,Deep learning for classification of pediatric chest radiographs by WHO’s standardized methodology,2021-06-21,"Nuclear factor 90 (NF90) is a novel virus sensor that serves to initiate antiviral innate immunity by triggering stress granule (SG) formation. However, the regulation of the NF90-SG pathway remains largely unclear. We found that Tim-3, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and inhibits NF90-SG-mediated antiviral immunity. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages, which in turn recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiate a proteasome-dependent degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SG formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of protein kinase R and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, the expression of SG markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protecting mice from VSV challenge. These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between Tim-3 and other receptors in antiviral innate immunity and its related clinical significance.","Dou, Shuaijie; Li, Guoxian; Li, Ge; Hou, Chunmei; Zheng, Yang; Tang, Lili; Gao, Yang; Mo, Rongliang; Li, Yuxiang; Wang, Renxi; Shen, Beifen; Zhang, Jun; Han, Gencheng",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225388/,356
19128,Classification of Space Objects by Using Deep Learning with Micro-Doppler Signature Images,2021-06-25,"Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization can lead to MRSA pneumonia or other infections in compromised hosts, and invasive MRSA infections lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The present observational study elucidated whether administration of hochuekkito (HET) can prevent MRSA colonization in the upper respiratory tract and support recovery in acute stroke patients. Methods: In this retrospective, observational study, 73 acute stroke patients admitted to Kenwakai Hospital between April 2007 and December 2019 who did not require emergency surgery during this period were enrolled. Conventional treatment was provided to all patients, depending on their condition, and 7.5 g/day of HET was administered to the patients who could take the medicine via nasogastric tube or orally in three divided doses for three months. Bacterial cultures from laryngeal swabs and sputum were evaluated every week. We evaluated the presence of MRSA infection or another infectious disease within 30 days of admission; modified Rankin Scale scores, which assesses the independent living skills after stroke at three months after admission; and blood biomarkers (white blood cell count, albumin levels, C-reactive protein levels, and hemoglobin levels). Results: In total, 73 patients (HET group, n = 41; non-HET group, n = 32) were enrolled in the study. MRSA detection was significantly less likely in the HET group than in the non-HET group (p = 0.0497). The incidence of infectious diseases was significantly lower in the HET group than in the non-HET group (p = 0.0096), and the modified Rankin Scale score at three months was also significantly lower in the HET group than in the non-HET group (p = 0.033). The white blood cell count, and serum C-reactive protein levels did not differ between those who were treated with HET and those who were not. However, serum albumin and hemoglobin levels improved slightly between month one and month three after admission only in those who were treated with HET. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the administration of HET may contribute to the prevention of MRSA colonization and promote rehabilitation in stroke patients.","Kitahara, Masakazu; Takayama, Shin; Akaishi, Tetsuya; Kikuchi, Akiko; Ishii, Tadashi",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273298/,356

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eradication-naive H. pylori-infected patients were consecutively enrolled from January to November 2020. Before approval of the P-CAB-based eradication therapy, twice daily administration of a regimen containing lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and bismuth potassium citrate 300 mg was prescribed for 7 days. After approval, lansoprazole was replaced with tegoprazan (50 mg). Clarithromycin resistance was examined in patients who underwent gastroscopic biopsy at our center. Efficacy was assessed via the (13)C-urea breath test. RESULTS: Of the 381 eradication-naive patients, eradication was successful in 88.3% (151/171) treated with tegoprazan and 82.8% (140/169) treated with lansoprazole in per-protocol analysis (p=0.151). In intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates were 78.8% (152/193) in the tegoprazan and 74.5% (140/188) in the lansoprazole group (p=0.323). Clarithromycin resistance was observed in 30 (20.1%) of the 148 patients (74 from each group), and only four of the 16 clarithromycin-resistant patients in the tegoprazan group achieved successful eradication. Clarithromycin resistance [odds ratio (OR)=42.1, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)=12.6–141.0] and poor patient compliance (OR=17.1, 95% CIs=1.6–189.1) were independent risk factors for eradication failure. CONCLUSION: In eradication-naive patients, eradication success rates for 7-day first-line triple therapy regimen exceeded 82% with bismuth administration. In clarithromycin-resistant patients, neither tegoprazan 50 mg nor lansoprazole 30 mg achieved acceptable eradication rates when administered twice daily for 7 days.","Kim, Ji Yeon; Lee, Sun-Young; Kim, Hyobin; Kim, Jeong Hwan; Sung, In-Kyung; Park, Hyung Seok",Yonsei Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8298865/,356
20301,A Method for Optimal Detection of Lung Cancer Based on Deep Learning Optimized by Marine Predators Algorithm,2021-08-11,"Cilia are hairlike organelles involved in both sensory functions and motility. We discuss the question of whether the location of chemical receptors on cilia provides an advantage in terms of sensitivity and whether motile sensory cilia have a further advantage. Using a simple advection-diffusion model, we compute the capture rates of diffusive molecules on a cilium. Because of its geometry, a non-motile cilium in a quiescent fluid has a capture rate equivalent to a circular absorbing region with ∼4× its surface area. When the cilium is exposed to an external shear flow, the equivalent surface area increases to ∼6×. Alternatively, if the cilium beats in a non-reciprocal way in an otherwise quiescent fluid, its capture rate increases with the beating frequency to the power of 1/3. Altogether, our results show that the protruding geometry of a cilium could be one of the reasons why so many receptors are located on cilia. They also point to the advantage of combining motility with chemical reception.","Hickey, David; Vilfan, Andrej; Golestanian, Ramin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387018/,356
20399,Deep Learning Application for Analyzing of Constituents and Their Correlations in the Interpretations of Medical Images,2021-07-30,"B(3) is the most common subtype of blood group B in the Taiwanese population, and most of the B(3) individuals in the Taiwanese population have the IVS3 + 5 G > A (rs55852701) gene variation. Additionally, a typical mixed field agglutination is observed when the B(3) subtype is tested with anti-B antibody or anti-AB antibody. The molecular biology of the gene variation in the B(3) subtype has been identified, however, the mechanism of the mixed field agglutination caused by the type B(3) blood samples is still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the reason for the mixed field agglutination caused by B(3). A micro-droplet platform was used to observe the agglutination of type B and type B(3) blood samples in different blood sample concentrations, antibody concentrations, and at reaction times. We found that the agglutination reaction in every droplet slowed down with an increase in the dilution ratio of blood sample and antibody, whether type B blood or type B(3) blood was used. However, as the reaction time increased, the complete agglutination in the droplet was seen in type B blood, while the mixed field agglutination still occurred in B(3) within 1 min. In addition, the degree of agglutination was similar in each droplet, which showed high reproducibility. As a result, we inferred that there are two types of cells in the B(3) subtype that simultaneously create a mixed field agglutination, rather than each red blood cell carrying a small amount of antigen, resulting in less agglutination.","Chen, Ding-Ping; Chen, Chen; Wu, Pei-Yu; Lin, Yen-Heng; Lin, Wei-Tzu; Yan, Yi-Liang",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393913/,356
20465,IoT and Interpretable Machine Learning Based Framework for Disease Prediction in Pearl Millet,2021-08-09,"Reinforced concrete is used worldwide in the construction industry. In past eras, extensive research has been conducted and has clearly shown the performance of stress–strain behaviour and ductility design for high-, standard-, and normal-strength concrete (NSC) in axial compression. Limited research has been conducted on the experimental and analytical investigation of low-strength concrete (LSC) confinement behaviour under axial compression and relative ductility. Meanwhile, analytical equations are not investigated experimentally for the confinement behaviour of LSC by transverse reinforcement. The current study experimentally investigates the concrete confinement behaviour under axial compression and relative ductility of NSC and LSC using volumetric transverse reinforcement (VTR), and comparison with several analytical models such as Mander, Kent, and Park, and Saatcioglu. In this study, a total of 44 reinforced-column specimens at a length of 18 in with a cross-section of 7 in × 7 in were used for uniaxial monotonic loading of NSC and LSC. Three columns of each set were confined with 2 in, 4 in, 6 in, and 8 in c/c lateral ties spacing. The experimental results show that the central concrete stresses are significantly affected by decreasing the spacing between the transverse steel. In the case of the LSC, the core stresses are double the central stress of NSC. However, increasing the VTR, the capacity and the ductility of NSC and LSC increases. Reducing the spacing between the ties from 8 in to 2 in center to center can affect the concrete column’s strength by 60% in LSC, but 25% in the NSC. The VTR and the spacing between the ties greatly affected the LSC compared to NSC. It was found that the relative ductility of the confined column samples was almost twice that of the unrestrained column samples. Regarding different models, the Manders model best represents the performance before the ultimate strength, whereas Kent and Park represents post-peak behaviour.","Ali, Mujahid; Abbas, Sheraz; Salah, Bashir; Akhter, Javed; Saleem, Waqas; Haruna, Sani; Room, Shah; Abdulkadir, Isyaka",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398666/,356
20812,Improving Generalization of Deep Learning Models for Diagnostic Pathology by Increasing Variability in Training Data: Experiments on Osteosarcoma Subtypes,2021-08-04,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of screening strategies targeting pregnancies at higher risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) is reduced by the low prevalence of severe CHD, the increase in CHD detection rates by second-trimester ultrasound (U/S), and the high proportion of severe CHD in low-risk pregnancies. We aimed to determine situations in which additional screening by fetal echocardiography (FE) would result in a significant increase in sensitivity and a sizable decrease in the false-negative rate of detection of severe CHD. METHODS: We simulated the change in the numbers of detected severe CHD cases when FE is offered to women with a normal second-trimester U/S who have a higher risk of bearing a child with CHD, compared to U/S alone. The primary outcome was the increase in sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were the number needed to screen and the reduction in the rate of missed cases. RESULTS: For an U/S sensitivity of 60%, the addition of FE in pregnancies at high risk of CHD (risk ratio 3.5; range: 2 to 5) increased sensitivity by 2.4 percentage points (1.1 to 7.9). The number needed to screen to detect one additional case of severe CHD was 436 (156 to 952). The rate of additional severe CHD cases detected by FE was 4 per 100,000 pregnancies (2 to 32). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of FE to U/S for severe CHD prenatal screening in pregnancies at high risk of CHD yielded marginal benefits in terms of increased sensitivity and decreased rates of false negatives, at the expense of significant resource utilization.","Bellavance, Samuel; Cardinal, Mikhail-Paul; Gobeil, Laurence; Roy-Lacroix, Marie-Eve; Dallaire, Frédéric",CJC Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8413228/,356

Standard Sets are developed by different working groups, which is inefficient and may lead to inconsistencies in selected PROs and PROMs. We aimed to identify common PROs across ICHOM Standard Sets and examined to what extend these PROs can be measured with a generic set of PROMs: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®). METHODS: We extracted all PROs and recommended PROMs from 39 ICHOM Standard Sets. Similar PROs were categorized into unique PRO concepts. We examined which of these PRO concepts can be measured with PROMIS. RESULTS: A total of 307 PROs were identified in 39 ICHOM Standard Sets and 114 unique PROMs are recommended for measuring these PROs. The 307 PROs could be categorized into 22 unique PRO concepts. More than half (17/22) of these PRO concepts (covering about 75% of the PROs and 75% of the PROMs) can be measured with a PROMIS measure. CONCLUSION: Considerable overlap was found in PROs across ICHOM Standard Sets, and large differences in terminology used and PROMs recommended, even for the same PROs. We recommend a more universal and standardized approach to the selection of PROs and PROMs. Such an approach, focusing on a set of core PROs for all patients, measured with a system like PROMIS, may provide more opportunities for patient-centered care and facilitate the uptake of Standard Sets in clinical practice.","Terwee, Caroline B.; Zuidgeest, Marloes; Vonkeman, Harald E.; Cella, David; Haverman, Lotte; Roorda, Leo D.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420145/,356

Here, we analyze SAMD9L function from the perspective of human mutations causing neonatal-onset severe autoinflammatory disease. Whole-genome sequencing of two children with leukocytoclastic panniculitis, basal ganglia calcifications, raised blood inflammatory markers, neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytopaenia, and almost no B cells revealed heterozygous de novo SAMD9L mutations, p.Asn885Thrfs*6 and p.Lys878Serfs*13. These frameshift mutations truncate the SAMD9L protein within a domain a region of homology to the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) of APAF1, ∼80 amino acids C-terminal to the Walker B motif. Single-cell analysis of human cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SAMD9L fusion proteins revealed that enforced expression of wild-type SAMD9L repressed translation of red fluorescent protein messenger RNA and globally repressed endogenous protein translation, cell autonomously and in proportion to the level of GFP-SAMD9L in each cell. The children’s truncating mutations dramatically exaggerated translational repression even at low levels of GFP-SAMD9L per cell, as did a missense Arg986Cys mutation reported recurrently as causing ataxia pancytopenia syndrome. Autoinflammatory disease associated with SAMD9L truncating mutations appears to result from an interferon-induced translational repressor whose activity goes unchecked by the loss of C-terminal domains that may normally sense virus infection.","Russell, Amanda J.; Gray, Paul E.; Ziegler, John B.; Kim, Yae Jean; Smith, Sandy; Sewell, William A.; Goodnow, Christopher C.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403910/,356

Here, we performed metabolomic analyses of Oxalis leaves from Okinawa to examine the plant metabolites that were upregulated or downregulated in response to low-dose radiation exposure from Fukushima’s contaminated soil. The cumulative dose of radiation to the plants was 5.7 mGy (34 μGy/h for 7 days). The GC-MS analysis revealed a systematic tendency of downregulation among the metabolites, some of which were annotated as caproic acid, nonanoic acid, azelaic acid, and oleic acid. Others were annotated as fructose, glucose, and citric acid, involved in the carbohydrate metabolic pathways. Notably, the peak annotated as lauric acid was upregulated. In contrast, the LC-MS analysis detected many upregulated metabolites, some of which were annotated as either antioxidants or stress-related chemicals involved in defense pathways. Among them, only three metabolite peaks had a single annotation, one of which was alfuzosin, an antagonist of the α(1)-adrenergic receptor. We conclude that this Oxalis plant responded metabolically to low-dose radiation exposure from Fukushima’s contaminated soil, which may mediate the ecological “field effects” of the developmental deterioration of butterflies in Fukushima.","Sakauchi, Ko; Taira, Wataru; Otaki, Joji M.",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472241/,356

Nevertheless, with application expansion, the requirements for material performance also increase. Although the development of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) to achieve these functions is challenging, it has attracted attention because of its excellent performance. This study combined the CFRP electrode with epoxy resin containing potassium sodium niobate piezoelectric nanoparticles and successfully polarized the composite sample. Furthermore, a three-point bending method was applied to compare the bending behavior of the samples. The peak output voltage produced by the maximum bending stress of 98.4 MPa was estimated to be 0.51 mV. Additionally, a conversion efficiency of 0.01546% was obtained. The results showed that the piezoelectric resin with CFRPs as the electrode exhibited stress self-inductance characteristics. This study is expected to be applied in manufacturing self-sensing piezoelectric resin/CFRP composite materials, paving the way for developing stable and efficient self-sensing structures and applications.","Yu, Yaonan; Narita, Fumio",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473170/,356

Of the members of this family, NPM1 is the most studied and is the main focus of this review. NPM2 and NPM3 are less well characterized, and are also discussed wherever appropriate. The structure–function relationship of NPM proteins has largely been worked out. Other than the many processes in which NPM1 takes part, the major interest comes from its involvement in human cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Its significance stems from the fact that AML with mutated NPM1 accounts for ∼30% of all AML cases and usually has good prognosis.

It is the successor infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) named as SARS-CoV-2 causing a disease called as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19). Being one of the most severe diseases in terms of transmission, this disease agitates the immune system of an individual quite disturbingly which at times leads to death, which is why it has become the need of the hour to step forward to extensively involve in understanding the genetics, pathogenesis, and immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design drugs to treat or to design a vaccine to prevent. In this chapter, we have tried to review and summarize the studies done so far to understand the host–pathogen relationship and the host immune response during COVID-19 infection. One of the recent developments regarding the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the mechanism of immune evasion involved during the pathogenesis and cytokine storm syndrome during infection in the patient against which a drug called as Hydroxychloroquine has been designed. Comprehensively, we have tried to give an immunological insight into the SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to understand the possible outcome for any therapeutic advancement.","Kumar, Swatantra; Nyodu, Rajni; Maurya, Vimal K.; Saxena, Shailendra K.",Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189399/,356

We explore different strategies to address variability, one in pure Electrum and another through an annotative language extension. We then show how Electrum and its Analyzer can be used to validate systems of this nature, namely by checking that the reference scenarios are admissible, and to automatically verify whether the established requirements hold. A prototype was developed to translate the provided validation sequences into Electrum and back to further automate the validation process. The resulting ELS model was validated against the provided validation sequences and verified for most of requirements for all variants.","Cunha, Alcino; Macedo, Nuno; Liu, Chong",Rigorous State-Based Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242091/,356

Social distancing saves lives but imposes large costs on society due to reduced economic activity. We use epidemiological and economic forecasting to perform a rapid benefit–cost analysis of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Assuming that social distancing measures can substantially reduce contacts among individuals, we find net benefits of about $5.2 trillion in our benchmark case. We examine the magnitude of the critical parameters that might imply negative net benefits, including the value of statistical life and the discount rate. A key unknown factor is the speed of economic recovery with and without social distancing measures in place. A series of robustness checks also highlight the key role of the value of mortality risk reductions and discounting in the analysis and point to a need for effective economic stimulus when the outbreak has passed.","Thunström, Linda; Newbold, Stephen C.; Finnoff, David; Ashworth, Madison; Shogren, Jason F.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242774/,356

India, the main destination of offshoring contracts, have received particular attention, due to the big cultural differences. Critical analysis of related studies suggests that impeding behaviors are mostly rooted in the hierarchical culture of Indian organizations and related management behavior of command-and-control. But what happens in distributed projects with a more empowering onshore management? In this paper, we present the findings from a multiple-case study of DevOps teams with members from a mature agile company located in Sweden and a more hierarchical offshore vendor from India. Based on two focus groups we list culturally different behaviors of offshore engineers that were reported to impede agile ways of working. Furthermore, we report the findings from surveying 36 offshore team members from five DevOps teams regarding their likely behavior in situations reported to be problematic. Our findings confirm a number of previously reported behaviors rooted in cultural differences that impede the adoption of agile ways of working when collaborating with offshore engineers. At the same time, our survey results suggest that among the five surveyed teams there were teams that succeeded with the cultural integration of the offshore team members. Finally, our findings demonstrate the importance of cultural training especially when onboarding new team members.","Šmite, Darja; Gonzalez-Huerta, Javier; Moe, Nils Brede",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251615/,356

33579,Introduction to Computer Network Vulnerabilities,2020-02-07,"BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy, including asymptomatic infection, has a detrimental impact on foetal development. Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was conducted to compare the association between antimalarial treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including placental malaria, accompanied with the gestational age at diagnosis of uncomplicated falciparum malaria infection. METHODS: A systematic review and one-stage IPD meta-analysis of studies assessing the efficacy of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments for patent microscopic uncomplicated falciparum malaria infection (hereinafter uncomplicated falciparum malaria) in pregnancy was conducted. The risks of stillbirth (pregnancy loss at ≥ 28.0 weeks of gestation), moderate to late preterm birth (PTB, live birth between 32.0 and < 37.0 weeks), small for gestational age (SGA, birthweight of < 10th percentile), and placental malaria (defined as deposition of malaria pigment in the placenta with or without parasites) after different treatments of uncomplicated falciparum malaria were assessed by mixed-effects logistic regression, using artemether-lumefantrine, the most used antimalarial, as the reference standard. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42018104013. RESULTS: Of the 22 eligible studies (n = 5015), IPD from16 studies were shared, representing 95.0% (n = 4765) of the women enrolled in literature. Malaria treatment in this pooled analysis mostly occurred in the second (68.4%, 3064/4501) or third trimester (31.6%, 1421/4501), with gestational age confirmed by ultrasound in 91.5% (4120/4503). Quinine (n = 184) and five commonly used artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) were included: artemether-lumefantrine (n = 1087), artesunate-amodiaquine (n = 775), artesunate-mefloquine (n = 965), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n = 837). The overall pooled proportion of stillbirth was 1.1% (84/4361), PTB 10.0% (619/4131), SGA 32.3% (1007/3707), and placental malaria 80.1% (2543/3035), and there were no significant differences of considered outcomes by ACT. Higher parasitaemia before treatment was associated with a higher risk of SGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14 per 10-fold increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.26, p = 0.009) and deposition of malaria pigment in the placenta (aOR 1.67 per 10-fold increase, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.96, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The risks of stillbirth, PTB, SGA, and placental malaria were not different between the commonly used ACTs. The risk of SGA was high among pregnant women infected with falciparum malaria despite treatment with highly effective drugs. Reduction of malaria-associated adverse birth outcomes requires effective prevention in pregnant women.","Saito, Makoto; Mansoor, Rashid; Kennon, Kalynn; Anvikar, Anupkumar R.; Ashley, Elizabeth A.; Chandramohan, Daniel; Cohee, Lauren M.; D’Alessandro, Umberto; Genton, Blaise; Gilder, Mary Ellen; Juma, Elizabeth; Kalilani-Phiri, Linda; Kuepfer, Irene; Laufer, Miriam K.; Lwin, Khin Maung; Meshnick, Steven R.; Mosha, Dominic; Muehlenbachs, Atis; Mwapasa, Victor; Mwebaza, Norah; Nambozi, Michael; Ndiaye, Jean-Louis A.; Nosten, François; Nyunt, Myaing; Ogutu, Bernhards; Parikh, Sunil; Paw, Moo Kho; Phyo, Aung Pyae; Pimanpanarak, Mupawjay; Piola, Patrice; Rijken, Marcus J.; Sriprawat, Kanlaya; Tagbor, Harry K.; Tarning, Joel; Tinto, Halidou; Valéa, Innocent; Valecha, Neena; White, Nicholas J.; Wiladphaingern, Jacher; Stepniewska, Kasia; McGready, Rose; Guérin, Philippe J.",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7263905/,356
33998,A Resource Usage Efficient Distributed Allocation Algorithm for 5G Service Function Chains,2020-05-15,"Interval prediction often provides more useful information compared to a simple point forecast. For example, in renewable energy forecasting, while the initial focus has been on deterministic predictions, the uncertainty observed in energy generation raises an interest in producing probabilistic forecasts. One aims to provide prediction intervals so that outcomes lie in the interval with a given probability. Therefore, the problem of estimating the quantiles of a variable arises. The contribution of our paper is two-fold. First, we propose to apply the framework of prediction with expert advice for the prediction of quantiles. Second, we propose a new competitive online algorithm Weak Aggregating Algorithm for Quantile Regression (WAAQR) and prove a theoretical bound on the cumulative loss of the proposed strategy. The theoretical bound ensures that WAAQR is asymptotically as good as any quantile regression. In addition, we provide an empirical survey where we apply both methods to the problem of probability forecasting of wind and solar powers and show that they provide good results compared to other predictive models.","Dzhamtyrova, Raisa; Kalnishkan, Yuri",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274329/,356

Proposing adequate products to customers is the issue of the store’s assortment. With tens thousands of products on shelves, designing the ideal assortment is theoretically a thorny combinatorial optimization problem. The approach we propose includes prior knowledge on the hierarchical organization of products by family to formalize the ideal assortment problem into a knapsack problem. The main difficulty of the optimization problem remains the estimation of the expected benefits associated to changes in the product range of products’ families. This estimate is based on the accounting results of similar stores. The definition of the similarity between two stores is then crucial. It is based on the prior knowledge on the hierarchical organization of products that allows approximate reasoning to compare any two stores and constitutes the major contribution of this paper.","Poncelet, Jocelyn; Jean, Pierre-Antoine; Vasquez, Michel; Montmain, Jacky",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274336/,356
34177,Formal Modeling and Analysis of Medical Systems,2020-05-13,"IoT devices are ubiquitous and widely adopted by end-users to gather personal and environmental data that often need to be put into context in order to gain insights. In particular, location is often a critical context information that is required by third parties in order to analyse such data at scale. However, sharing this information is i) sensitive for the user privacy and ii) hard to capture when considering indoor environments. This paper therefore addresses the challenge of producing a new location hash, named IndoorHash, that captures the indoor location of a user, without disclosing the physical coordinates, thus preserving their privacy. This location hash leverages surrounding infrastructure, such as WiFi access points, to compute a key that uniquely identifies an indoor location. Location hashes are only known from users physically visiting these locations, thus enabling a new generation of privacy-preserving crowdsourcing mobile applications that protect from third parties re-identification attacks. We validate our results with a crowdsourcing campaign of 31 mobile devices during one month of data collection.","Meftah, Lakhdar; Rouvoy, Romain; Chrisment, Isabelle",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276256/,356
34183,Quality of Service Ranking by Quantifying Partial Compliance of Requirements,2020-05-13,"The mobile ecosystem is witnessing an unprecedented increase in the number of malware in the wild. To fight this threat, actors from both research and industry are constantly innovating to bring concrete solutions to improve security and malware protection. Traditional solutions such as signature-based anti viruses have shown their limits in front of massive proliferation of new malware, which are most often only variants specifically designed to bypass signature-based detection. Accordingly, it paves the way to the emergence of new approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) technics to boost the detection of unknown malware variants. Unfortunately, these solutions are most often underexploited due to the time and resource costs required to adequately fine tune machine learning algorithms. In reality, in the Android community, state-of-the-art studies do not focus on model training, and most often go through an empirical study with a manual process to choose the learning strategy, and/or use default values as parameters to configure ML algorithms. However, in the ML domain, it is well known admitted that to solve efficiently a ML problem, the tunability of hyper-parameters is of the utmost importance. Nevertheless, as soon as the targeted ML problem involves a massive amount of data, there is a strong tension between feasibility of exploring all combinations and accuracy. This tension imposes to automate the search for optimal hyper-parameters applied to ML algorithms, that is not anymore possible to achieve manually. To this end, we propose a generic and scalable solution to automatically both configure and evaluate ML algorithms to efficiently detect Android malware detection systems. Our approach is based on devOps principles and a microservice architecture deployed over a set of nodes to scale and exhaustively test a large number of ML algorithms and hyper-parameters combinations. With our approach, we are able to systematically find the best fit to increase up to 11% the accuracy of two state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems.","Bromberg, Yérom-David; Gitzinger, Louison",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276263/,356

Previous work relied on Cohesion Network Analysis to model a cohesion graph composed of semantic links between multiple reference texts and student productions. From this graph, a set of features was derived and used to build machine learning models to predict student comprehension scores. In this paper, we build on top of the previous study by: a) extending the CNA graph by adding new semantic links targeting specific sentences that should have been captured within the learner’s productions, and b) cleaning the self-explanations by eliminating frozen expression, as well as entries which seemed nearly identical to the source text. The results are in line with the conclusions of the previous study regarding the importance of both self-explanations and question answers in predicting the students’ reading comprehension level. They also outline the limitations of our feature generation approach, in which no substantial improvements were detected, despite adding more fine-grained features.","Nicula, Bogdan; Perret, Cecile A.; Dascalu, Mihai; McNamara, Danielle S.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334696/,356

Historically, it has been especially prized during times of crisis. This is clearly demonstrated today as the current Coronavirus crisis is unfolding; there are many different dimensions of flexibility, ranging from versatility, agility, and resilience, to hedging, robustness and liquidity. For convenience, we fuse these terms together under the conceptual umbrella of “super-flexibility”. We define super-flexibility as a dynamic capability to simultaneously withstand turbulence AND adapt to fluid reality. Our field research has focused on how companies in Silicon Valley embrace uncertainty and drive adaptation. In this paper, we draw on the experience of a manufacturing firm facing the floods that hit Thailand in October 2011. The crisis enabled us to observe a situation in which the different nuances of flexibility collectively came into play within a compressed time-frame. In this paper, we showcase the practical application of super-flexibility in a crisis. First, we describe the conceptual foundations of flexibility and its different nuances.

36319,Multistage Deep Neural Network Framework for People Detection and Localization Using Fusion of Visible and Thermal Images,2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND: The probability of hospitalization in patients suffering from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with an underlying comorbidity, such as a cardiac pathology, is 73-fold higher than that in CAP patients without a comorbidity. Although previous studies have investigated patients with cardiac events and pneumonia, they have not studied the burden of disease in depth at the population level. The objective of this study is to provide population-level data on patients ≥60 years old who were hospitalized with pneumonia with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spain over a period of 19 years (1997–2015). METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on a minimum basic data set (MBDS). The following variables were collected: age, sex, re-admission (yes/no), hospital stay (days), and other diagnoses. Hospitalization rate (per 100,000 inhabitants), mortality rate (per 100,000 inhabitants), and lethality rate (%) were obtained, and the 95% confidence interval of each rate was calculated. Analyses were stratified by age (categorized into 4-year intervals), sex, and year of admission. Differences were assessed for significance with the chi-squared test for proportions and the Poisson model for rates. Logistic regression was run with in-hospital survival as the dependent variable and sex, age, year of admission, and re-admission (yes/no) as the independent variables. The level of significance was p < 0.005. RESULTS: The total number of patients ≥60 years old hospitalized for pneumonia with comorbid CVD was 99,346. The rates of hospitalization, mortality, and lethality increased significantly with age over the 19 years. Men had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. The probability of a patient with CAP and CVD dying was correlated with male sex, older age, hospital re-admission, and having been hospitalized earlier in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired pneumonia with comorbid cardiovascular disease continues to be a major cause of hospitalization in Spain, especially in the elderly population, making it necessary to develop more preventive strategies for this group of patients.","Arias-Fernández, Loreto; Gil-Prieto, Ruth; Gil-de-Miguel, Ángel",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336298/,356

Among them, 17 patients were asymptomatic at initial clinical assessment. These asymptomatic patients on admission accounted for a small proportion of all patients (5.54%) with relatively weak transmissibility, and the detection rate was 0.35 per 100 close contacts. Moreover, the dynamics of symptoms of the 307 patients showed that the interval from symptom remission to the final negativity of viral nucleic acid was 5.0 days (IQR 2.0 to 11.0 days), with 14 patients (4.56%) having re-detectable viral RNA after discharge. Together, our findings suggested asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Also, the asymptomatic phase in during recovery of COVID-19 urged that negativity in viral RNA is necessary as de-isolation criteria and follow-up is recommended.","Zheng, Xueying; Luo, Sihui; Sun, Yong; Han, Mingfeng; Liu, Jian; Sun, Liangye; Zhang, Liangming; Ling, Ping; Ding, Yu; Jin, Tengchuan; Liu, Zhirong; Weng, Jianping",Natl Sci Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337770/,356

The aim of this nationwide study was to investigate the prevalence of CRAB isolates in Serbia and to characterize underlying resistance mechanisms and their genetic relatedness. METHODS: Non-redundant clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients throughout Serbia were included in the prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from January to June 2018. Samples were initially screened for the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus (Acb) complex using conventional bacteriological techniques. Acb complexes recovered from clinical samples obtained from inpatients with confirmed bacterial infections were further evaluated for the presence of A. baumannii. Identification to the species level was done by the detection of the bla(OXA-51) gene and rpoB gene sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion and broth microdilution method. CRAB isolates were tested for the presence of acquired carbapenemases (bla(OXA-24-like), bla(OXA-23-like,)bla(OXA-58-like), bla(OXA-143-like), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(GIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM), bla(NDM)) by PCR. Clonal relatedness was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Acb complex was isolated in 280 out of 2401 clinical samples (11.6%). Overall, A. baumannii was identified in 237 out of 280 Acb complex (84.6%). CRAB prevalence was found to be 93.7% (237/222). The MIC(50)/MIC(90) for imipenem and meropenem were 8/> 32 μg/mL and 16/> 32 μg/mL, respectively. Although susceptibility was high for colistin (95.7%; n = 227) and tigecycline (75.1%; n = 178), ten isolates (4.3%) were classified as pandrug-resistant. The following carbapenemases-encoding genes were found: 98 (44.2%) bla(OXA-24-like), 76 (34.5%) bla(OXA-23-like), and 7 (3.2%) bla(NDM-1). PFGE analysis revealed six different clusters. MLST analysis identified three STs: ST2 (n = 13), ST492 (n = 14), and ST636 (n = 10). Obtained results evaluated that circulating CRAB clones in Serbia were as follows: bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA23)/ST2 (32.4%), bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA23)/bla(OXA72)/ST2 (2.7%), bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA72)/ST492 (37.8%), and bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA72)/ST636 (27.1%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed extremely high proportions of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii clinical isolates due to the emergence of bla(OXA-72), bla(OXA-23), and bla(NDM-1) genes among CRAB isolates in Serbia and their clonal propagation.","Lukovic, Bojana; Gajic, Ina; Dimkic, Ivica; Kekic, Dusan; Zornic, Sanja; Pozder, Tatjana; Radisavljevic, Svetlana; Opavski, Nataša; Kojic, Milan; Ranin, Lazar",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338125/,356

Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Maps (FGCMs) are an extension of FCMs, intended to surpass the intrinsic uncertainties modeling real-world problems by means of Grey theory. Despite the rising number of studies about FGCM-based models, little has been investigated with regard to the convergence of such networks. In this paper, we build a mathematical basis to uncover the behavior FGCM-based models equipped with transfer F-functions. To do so, we propose sufficient conditions for the existence and unicity of fixed-point attractors. Also, the results reported in the literature on the convergence of FGCMs, are compared with ours. Furthermore, we elucidate the reach and depth of our findings, especially and not exclusive to the prediction of FCMs’ behavior.","Concepción, Leonardo; Nápoles, Gonzalo; Bello, Rafael; Vanhoof, Koen",Rough Sets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338188/,356

39785,Editor’s Introduction to v40(2),2020-09-24,"Abstract: In mammals, the excretion of cortisol can provide energy toward restoring homeostasis and is a major component of the stress response. However, chronically elevated cortisol levels also have suppressive effects on immune function. As mounting an immune response is energetically costly, sick individuals may conserve energy by exhibiting certain sickness behaviors, such as declining activity levels. Due to the complex interplay between immune function and sickness behaviors, endocrinological correlates have received growing attention in the medical community, but so far, this subject was investigated rarely. Furthermore, given the complexities of studying illnesses and immunity in natural settings, correlates of sickness behaviors have yet to be studied in non-human primates in the wild. Methods: We measured urinary cortisol levels using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a group of wild habituated chimpanzees in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, before, during, and after a respiratory disease outbreak (main causative pathogen: human respiratory syncytial virus A, with coinfections of Streptococcus pneumoniae). Changes in cortisol levels were then related to urinary neopterin levels, a biomarker of immune system activation. Results: Urinary cortisol levels were found to be more than 10-fold higher during the outbreak in comparison with levels before and after the outbreak period. Increasing cortisol levels were also associated with increasing neopterin levels. Interestingly, rather atypical patterns in a diurnal decline of cortisol levels were found during infection periods, such that levels remained raised throughout the day. Conclusion: In conclusion, cortisol increase was related to cellular immune response. Our results suggest that cortisol is a mediator of infectious disease pathogenicity through its impact on the immune system and that wild chimpanzees may be facing energetic stress when sick. By monitoring immune challenges in wild-living animals, our study demonstrates that immune defenses have costs and that these costs are context-specific.","Behringer, Verena; Preis, Anna; Wu, Doris F.; Crockford, Catherine; Leendertz, Fabian H.; Wittig, Roman M.; Deschner, Tobias",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472655/,356

The overall findings demonstrate a positive relationship between APCs and journals with high IF for two of the subject areas we examined but not for the third, which could be mediated by the characteristics and market environment of the publishers. We also found significant differences between the analysed research fields in terms of APC policies, as well as differences in the relationship between APCs and the IF across periodicals.

47159,Role of Integrated Information Systems for Modern Organizations,2020-09-12,"Capacity plays a crucial role in a port’s competitive position and the growth of its market share. An investment decision to provide new port capacity should be supported by a growing demand for port services. However, port demand is volatile and uncertain in an increasingly competitive market environment. Also, forecasting models themselves are associated with epistemic uncertainty due to model and parameter uncertainties. This paper applies a Bayesian statistical method to forecast the annual throughput of the multipurpose Port of Isafjordur in Iceland. Model uncertainties are thus taken into account, while parameter uncertainties are handled by selecting influencing macroeconomic variables based on mutual information analysis. The presented model has an adaptive capability as new information becomes available. Our method results in a range of port throughput forecasts, in addition to a point estimate, and it also accounts for epistemic uncertainty, thus increasing the reliability of forecasts. Our results provide support for informed decision-making in capacity planning and management. Our forecasts show a constant linear growth of containerized throughput the period 2020–2025. Noncontainerized throughput declines rapidly over the same period.","Eskafi, Majid; Kowsari, Milad; Dastgheib, Ali; Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F.; Stefansson, Gunnar; Taneja, Poonam; Thorarinsdottir, Ragnheidur I.",Marit Econ Logist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968410/,356

Given the importance that catastrophe equity put options (CatEPuts) have in this context, we introduce a pricing approach that provides not only a theoretical contribution whose applicability remains confined to purely numerical examples and experiments, but which can be implemented starting from real data and applied to the evaluation of real CatEPuts. We propose a calibration framework based on historical log-returns, market capitalization and option implied volatilities. The calibrated parameters are then considered to price CatEPuts written on the stock of the main Italian insurance company over the high volatile period from January to April 2020. We show that the ratio between plain-vanilla put options and CatEPuts strictly depends on the shape of the implied volatility smile and it varies over time.","Arnone, Massimo; Bianchi, Michele Leonardo; Quaranta, Anna Grazia; Tassinari, Gian Luca",Comput Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969350/,356

(SO) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), commonly applied to treat complex diseases, such as anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and hemostatic effects. Especially, it has been reported to exert anti-tumor effect in various human cancers. However, its effect and pharmacological mechanism on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods: In this study, network pharmacology approach was applied to characterize the underlying mechanism of SO on HCC. Active compounds and potential targets of SO, as well as related genes of HCC were obtained from the public databases, the potential targets and signaling pathways were determined by protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses. And the compound-target and target-pathway networks were constructed. Subsequently, in vitro experiments were also performed to further verify the anticancer effects of SO on HCC. Results: By using the comprehensive network pharmacology analysis, 41 ingredients in SO were collected from the corresponding databases, 12 active ingredients screened according to their oral bioavailability and drug-likeness index, and 258 potential targets related to HCC were predicted. Through enrichment analysis, SO was found to show its excellent therapeutic effects on HCC through several pathways, mainly related to proliferation and survival via the EGFR, PI3K/AKT, NFκB and MAPK signaling pathways. Additionally, in vitro, SO was found to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and down-regulate cell migration and invasion in various HCC cells. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that SO treatment down-regulated the expression of p-EGFR, p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-NFκB and p-MAPK proteins in HepG2 cells. These results validated that SO exerted its therapeutic effects on HCC mainly by the regulation of cell proliferation and survival via the EGFR/MAPK and EGFR/PI3K/AKT/NFκB signaling pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, this study, revealed the anti-HCC effects of SO and its potential underlying therapeutic mechanisms in a multi-target and multi-pathway manner.","Jiang, Nan; Li, Hong; Sun, Yueshan; Zeng, Jing; Yang, Fei; Kantawong, Fahsai; Wu, Jianming",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969657/,356
47179,A Method for Malware Detection in Virtualization Environment,2020-06-08,"India’s coronavirus lockdown forced low-wage migrant workers to return from the city to the home towns and villages from which they came. Pre-pandemic living and working conditions were already stressful and difficult for these migrants. The lockdown became an additional burden, since it shut down sources of income with no assurance about when, or if, work and earning to support families could be resumed. This article draws on the lens of the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA) to understand how workers engaged with and navigated these difficult times. A total of 54 migrant workers locked-down at home across the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal were interviewed for this qualitative study. Financial worries were found to be endemic, with rising debt a major source of stress, and educational qualifications becoming an obstacle to earning. Returning migrants were suspected of bringing the virus from the city, and so stigmatized in their home towns and villages. However, the pandemic lockdown also showed some unexpected healthful consequences. It provided these marginalized, and always busy workers the time and space to stop working for a while, to stay home, eat home food, and take walks in the comparatively green and clean spaces of their home environments. In this, the pandemic lockdown may be seen to have enabled a measure of agency and health in the lives of these workers, an oasis albeit temporary, and ultimately subject to the demands of the globalized cities of India.","Mookerjee, Devalina; Chakravarty, Sujoy; Roy, Shubhabrata; Tagat, Anirudh; Mukherjee, Shagata",Am Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969851/,356

The racial inequities under COVID-19 via the neoliberal approach to the crisis puts home care workers at more risk. We come to this analysis through Critical Immigration Studies framing Filipino labor migration as it is produced by neoliberalism and Racial Capitalist constructs.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, type, and cost of comorbidities occurring in older T2DM patients versus older non-T2DM patients, and the factors associated with high cost (HC) T2DM patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using information from the Campania Region healthcare database. People aged ≥65 years who received ≥2 prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs were identified as “T2DM patients.” Comorbidities among T2DM and non-T2DM groups were assessed through the RxRiskV Index (modified version). T2DM individuals were classified according to the total cost distribution as HC or “non-high cost.” Two sub-cohorts of HC T2DM patients were assessed: above 90th and 80th percentile of the total cost. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models were created. Results: Among the T2DM cohort, concordant and discordant comorbidities occurred significantly more frequently than in the non-T2DM cohort. Total mean annual cost per T2DM patient due to comorbidities was €7,627 versus €4,401 per non-T2DM patient. Among T2DM patients identified as being above 90th and 80th percentiles of cost distribution, the total annual costs were >€19,577 and >€2,563, respectively.

This study conducted a topic model dynamic analysis of the articles on information literacy studies in the Web of Science core collection database that were published from 2005 to 2019. The global topics and their popularities, topical similarities and correlations, along with the evolution of temporal local topics and the diffusion of subject local topics were analyzed and presented. Nine global topics differed in terms of their temporal and subject characteristics, and this study focused on ability, technology, field, people, place and application of information literacy. For the temporal local topics, crossing was the main evolutionary mechanism; hence, the core topic words were relatively stable, but few new research directions have been explored in recent years. For the subject local topics, absorbing with division and absorbing were the main mechanisms, which supported the diffusion progress of information literacy studies among subjects. However, it is necessary to promote the development of future research through the innovative development of multidisciplinary integration. Researchers and practitioners should focus on the impact of information technology, increase the breadth and depth of the research field, and develop innovative evaluation methods that are based on data to promote the comprehensive, sustainable and effective improvement in information literacy.","Li, Yating; Chen, Ye; Wang, Qiyu",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970783/,356

This article investigates their connection to aspects of life such as democratic and human rights, privacy, and individual and community protection as well as their impact on environmental and social resilience. Concerning the latter, it questions institutional unpreparedness or unresponsiveness in the face of the pandemic and the role economic development and mass production have played in causing it. In light of this, it additionally explores states’ expectation for individual accountability, as a means to contain the virus and identifies a shared pattern of dependence on individual behavioural change found in both COVID-19 and climate change responses. Reflecting on all of the above, the last part of the article evaluates the rescuing ability of individualisation, nominates a critical view of the current psycho-behavioural context and puts forward the pursue of a psychological turn driven by existing alternative models of production and consumption.","Kalantidou, Eleni",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970805/,356

In contrast, KBEs that rely on endogenous factors harmonize with the enlightened anthropocentrism for sustainable development with scientific and technical abilities to design the ecological system for infusing human values into nature. For example, the Quintuple Helix Model of Innovation. In this exploratory research, it was found that the conventional structure of universities in Botswana is unable to produce glocal green knowledge and innovation in their mainstream knowledge production process due to bureaucratism, rationalism, myths and ceremonies, isomorphism, and legitimacy whereas institutional logics and agency of social actors support for Paris Climate Agreement and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, the Quintuple Helix Model with Mode 3-Knowledge production is used to redesign universities’ conventional structures. This study perused two sources of data, document analysis, and interviews. Data collected from documents were analyzed by axial coding. After that, interview data from five internal stakeholders were collected based on priori codes, themes, and concepts developed with document analysis. They were thematically analyzed for triangulation. Finally, the theory was developed by induction underpinning with interpretive philosophy when redesigning universities’ conventional structure. The proposed model designed is called “Green University System” to facilitate the production of glocal green knowledge and innovation for sustainable development with Mode 3 and Quintuple Helix model of innovation.","Liyanage, Shantha Indrajith Hikkaduwa; Netswera, Fulu Godfrey",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970815/,356

First, obstacles relating to the production, availability, and interpretation of pertinent data across jurisdictions. Second, contrary pressures towards, on the one hand, broader criminalisation of phenomena deemed to be social harms, and on the other hand, towards the decriminalisation and cross-sectoral management of such phenomena by agents and institutions beyond the ‘law and order’ arena. Third, challenges to academic freedoms.

These changes have inspired entrepreneurs to create a new kind of commercial workplace, called coworking spaces, part office with advanced technology and part social setting, available for short- or longer-term rental. To appeal to potential customers, founder-entrepreneurs of such spaces have created, in text and images, virtual representations of their enterprises on their websites. What counts as data in this study are the websites of five coworking spaces. A mixed-methods approach incorporating material culture studies, design thinking, and rhetoric was used to analyze the persuasive structure of these virtual representations. More than mere real-estate, coworking has become a values-driven culture. In an aesthetically pleasing environment, that culture fosters community, mutual support among members of the space, and a bias toward innovation and creativity. This sample, while admittedly small, represents different regions internationally and different customer demographics. The analysis demonstrates the power of a rhetorical persona, the founder-entrepreneur, who speaks for the enterprise, and the continuing importance of well-tested rhetorical strategies of persuasion—logical, ethical, and emotional—in building an argument in virtual space for the spatial experience a customer will find on the ground.","Andrews, Deborah C.",Good Data in Business and Professional Discourse Research and Teaching,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971570/,356

Even though the process of digital transformation of higher education (including law schools) was launched before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was the coronavirus that acted as a catalyst for digitalization of almost all spheres of public life. Universities were faced with the need to create a comfortable and high-quality digital information and educational environment as soon as possible, and many enterprises (including their legal departments) decided to switch for remote work due to the self-isolation regime, which triggered further digitalization of the legal profession. In turn, digitalization of the legal profession can affect the labor market, and, therefore, higher education, as universities must consider the needs of future employers. The authors applied both general methods and methodological techniques (analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, etc.) and special legal methods (formal legal and comparative legal). While analyzing, the authors conclude that the potential digitalization of legal education is widespread, since it is not only about the use of digital technologies in education, but changing the content of legal education due to digital transformation of the legal profession.","Osina, D.

It has suddenly become complicated to provide a comprehensive overview detailing the specificity of each of them. In the absence of therapeutic drugs or vaccines specific for COVID-19, these tests are essential to detect patients at an early stage and to immediately isolate infected patients from the healthy population. Among the most commonly used tests are chest CT and laboratory tests (such as PCR) in the diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Analysis of imaging and laboratory test data from more than 1,000 patients shows that chest CT surpasses biological tests in the diagnosis of the epidemic associated with the new coronavirus, COVID-19. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans provide the best diagnosis for COVID-19 pneumonia, conclude these researchers from Huazhong University of Science (Wuhan, China) and Leiden University Medical Center (Netherlands). The researchers concluded that CT scans should be used as the primary screening tool for COVID-19. However, these techniques have the disadvantage of being slow and expensive, causing many patients to avoid screening if it is not free. In this paper, we propose an automatic decision model based on artificial intelligence to assist the physician during the screening for this pandemic in order to lighten the workload in hospitals. For this purpose, the main objective of our study is to build and test predictive diagnostic models based on machine learning that can analyze patient data in depth in order to separate coronavirus types. Thus, we can save time during the diagnostic process of this Covid-19 pandemic.

By focusing on Spain, the paper examines how subnational elections strengthen subnational identity, disseminate views in favour of further decentralization and may potentially cultivate secessionist preferences.","Dinas, Elias; Skoutaris, Nikos",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981436/,356
49835,Trusted Client-Side Encryption for Cloud Storage,2021-03-23,"When Cyprus became an independent state, newly-drafted constitutional provisions sought to safeguard the rights of the different communities that made up its population – Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians and Latins. Nevertheless, most political power since then has been concentrated in the hands of the Greek Cypriot majority, with the other groups remaining largely marginalised. This hegemony of the Greek Cypriot political elite has been the result of a dual, and rather contradictory approach. On the one hand, the constitutional protections for the different groups have been eroded through the application of the doctrine of necessity, a mechanism intended to keep the Constitution up to date with the political developments in the country. Conversely, in cases where the doctrine could be used to safeguard the minorities’ rights, the government has highlighted the unamendable nature of the Constitution and relied on the obsolete constitutional provisions that the doctrine of necessity was designed to avoid.","Hadjigeorgiou, Nasia; Kyriakou, Nikolas",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981439/,356

These automatons now play a key role in the dissemination of information around the globe. Political bots, social bots built to look like people but used in attempts to manipulate public opinion, are of particular concern for the researchers concerned with the role of social media during times of both conflict and peace. This chapter accesses known news articles on social and political bot usage around the world to build a preliminary typology of usage. Ultimately, we argue that political bots in a variety of forms are now crucial mechanisms for political communication.","Woolley, Samuel; Kumleben, Mark",Social Media as a Space for Peace Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981442/,356

The writers capture the extent to which the operation of constitutional settlements in divided, heterogeneous multinational European states can be affected by no small degree of political contingency. The timing of this thoughtful analysis is particularly auspicious given the development of a range of constitutional ruptures across Europe over the past few years. More specifically, the authors offer an account, through an eclectic and innovative array of methodological style, of how legal devices that often operate at the subterranean may in fact entrench communal division in a crisis. Read together, then, these chapters offer an innovative exploration of a range of legal responses to acute constitutional stress in several divided European nation states.","Graham, Patrick",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981445/,356

To this end, we model the dynamics of the returns for these markets and test the effect of oil market volatility on their dynamics. Through different econometric investigations, we show, in the context of Covid‐19, that oil price has experienced significant effects on the US stock market and the US dollar exchange rate, while it has no significant impact on the US real estate market. In particular, we highlight, first, a positive and significant reaction of the stock market toward an oil price shock, which might be explained by the effect of high oil financialization over the last decade. Second, we show an adverse effect of the oil price change on the US dollar, suggesting a negative relationship between the oil price and the US dollar.

The risky behaviours that predict whether individuals vaccinate for seasonal influenza can help policymakers fashion plans to improve vaccination rates and more reliably establish herd immunity. To this end, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data were employed to determine how an individual’s choice to engage in various risky behaviours relates with the likelihood that the same individual gets the seasonal influenza vaccine. Controls were included for demographic, geographic, and health insurance factors. In addition to controlling for these factors, regressions were further stratified based upon gender, the presence of children in the home, and age. I found that excess sun exposure, poor oral hygiene, smoking, and unhealthy diet choices correlated with reduced vaccination probability—both over the subsequent year and for that individual’s lifetime. These results have important implications for properly targeting individuals for widespread vaccinations.","Neymotin, Florence",J Bioecon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8046576/,356

With phased resumption of University teaching, remote delivery via online platforms has seen increased implementation to prevent overcrowding and comply with social distancing measures. This study explores the efficacy of a nationally delivered online surgical education programme to facilitate undergraduate surgical education. METHODS: An undergraduate surgical society in collaboration with two Core Surgical Trainees designed and organised an online surgical teaching programme. The syllabus was constructed in accordance with the Royal College of Surgeons England’s (RCSEng) National Undergraduate Curriculum in Surgery. Remote delivery was facilitated by Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc.). Multiple-choice questionnaires were used to evaluate knowledge during the sessions and Likert scales were utilised to assess subjective improvement of knowledge. RESULTS: The average attendance for the lectures was 100. The average increase in correct answers between pre- and post-lecture multiple choice questions was +55.87% (+72.4, +18.6, +76.6). Likert scale analysis demonstrated 100% improvement of knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a positive outcome to remote, extra-curricular surgical education in the time of COVID-19. The methodology outlined herein has the potential to be adopted by other Universities to facilitate undergraduate surgical education.","Zaver, V; Ahari, D; Jayawardena, P; Sayed, Md A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135894/,356

METHODS: Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews with LAR owners and staff (n = 12). Interviews were conducted via Zoom, lasting between 30 and 90 minutes. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed by two independent coders using Dedoose following an iterative approach for organizing results using emergent themes. RESULTS: COVID-19 led to initial closures, decrease in clientele and interrupted food supply. LAR adjusted by switching to outdoor dining and/or delivery/takeout, reducing hours and staff, increasing social media presence, and making changes to the menus. Menus were reduced, decreasing items not well-suited for takeout/delivery, (notably salads), while keeping customer favorites, such as high-energy “comfort foods.” Menu changes were more prevalent in full-service restaurants, compared with fast casual LAR. The results also include experiences with delivery companies and government assistance during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced drastic changes in LARs, with potential implications for future health promoting interventions. The results from this study contribute to informing how restaurants are adapting in response to COVID-19 and the potential implications on community health and nutrition, as well as what restaurants can do to prepare for future crises. This will need to be considered for the survival of the industry and the communities that they serve. Future research is needed to examine long-term effect of changes in community food environments and customers’ diets.

With the uncertainty and unpredictability of this pandemic, surgical oncology residents find themselves at a crossroads. The need to keep abreast with COVID-19 treatment guidelines and recommendations comes at the expense of their surgical training.

We developed a clinic screening tool (CST-HIV) for the purpose of identifying these issues in routine specialist clinical care in Spain. METHODS: We used the following established instrument development procedures: (1) a literature review; (2) four focus group discussions (FGDs), two that convened 16 expert HIV care providers, and two that convened 15 PLHIV; (3) prioritisation, selection and definition of constructs (health-related issues) to include in the CST-HIV and drafting of initial item pool; and (4) a pilot study to analyse psychometric properties and validity of items and to determine which to retain in the final CST-HIV. The FGD interview scripts incorporated an exercise to prioritise the health-related issues perceived to have the greatest negative effect on HRQoL. The online questionnaire used for the pilot study included the pool of CST-HIV items and validated measures of each construct. RESULTS: We identified 68 articles that reported on factors associated with the HRQoL of PLHIV. The most burdensome health-related issues identified in the FGDs related to stigma, socioeconomic vulnerability, sleep/fatigue, pain, body changes, emotional distress, and sexuality. Based on the literature review and FGD findings, we selected and defined the following constructs to include in the initial CST-HIV: anticipated stigma, emotional distress, sexuality, social support, material deprivation, sleep/fatigue, cognitive problems, and physical symptoms. Two researchers wrote six to eight items for each construct. Next, 18 experts rated 47 items based on their clarity, relevance, and representativeness. Pilot testing was carried out with 226 PLHIV in Spain. We retained 24 items based on empirical criteria that showed adequate psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the eight-factor structure with a good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.035, AGFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.99). We found strong positive correlations between the instrument’s eight dimensions and validated measures of the same constructs. Likewise, we found negative associations between the dimensions of the CST-HIV and HRQoL. CONCLUSION: The CST-HIV is a promising tool for use in routine clinical care to efficiently identify and address health-related issues undermining the HRQoL of PLHIV.","Fuster-RuizdeApodaca, Maria José; Safreed-Harmon, Kelly; Pastor de la Cal, Marta; Laguia, Ana; Naniche, Denise; Lazarus, Jeffrey V.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219862/,356

For network pharmacological analysis, network construction and gene enrichment analysis were conducted and further verified by molecular docking. RESULTS: A total of 476 target genes of ZSYTP were obtained from 205 active compounds. 13 herbs of ZSYTP overlapped on 8 active compounds based on the compound-target-disease network (C-T network). 20 biological processes and 9 pathways were strongly connected to the targets of ZSYTP in treating POI, including negative regulation of gene expression, mRNA metabolic process, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, and gluconeogenesis. Finally, molecular docking was visualized. CONCLUSION: Intriguingly, the signal pathways and biological processes uncovered in this study implicate inflamm-aging and glucose metabolism as potential pathological mechanisms of POI. The therapeutic effect of ZSYTP could be mediated by regulating glucose metabolism and HIF-1 signal pathway. Collectively, this study sheds light on the therapeutic potential of ZSYTP on POI.","Feng, Yihui; Chai, Xinyi; Chen, Yingyin; Ning, Yan; Zhao, Ying",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357500/,356

However, excessive use may have adverse health effects, possibly partially mediated by disruptions to sleep. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the social predictors of digital technology use and their cross-sectional association with BMI z scores and being overweight in a large sample of adolescents. METHODS: We used baseline data from a subset of a large adolescent cohort from 39 schools across Greater London who participated in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (n=1473). Digital technology use included phone calls, internet use on mobile phones, and video gaming on any device. Multilevel regression was used to assess the associations between digital technology use and age-specific and sex-specific BMI z scores and being overweight (including obesity). Measurements were derived from height and weight, obtained by the Tanita BC-418 Body Composition Analyzer. We examined whether these associations were mediated by insufficient sleep. RESULTS: Generally, participants with lower socioeconomic status reported more use of digital technology. Controlling for socioeconomic status, internet use on mobile phones for more than 3 hours per day was associated with higher BMI z scores (adjusted β=.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.48) and greater odds of being overweight (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.09-2.34), compared with low use (≤30 minutes). Similar associations were found between video gaming and BMI z scores and being overweight. The BMI z score was more strongly related to weekday digital technology use (internet use on mobile phones and video gaming) than weekend use. Insufficient sleep partly mediated the associations between digital technology use and BMI z scores (proportion of mediation from 8.6% to 17.8%) by an indirect effect. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between digital technology use and BMI in adolescents, partly mediated by insufficient sleep, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be multifactorial.

However, longitudinal research is needed to test changes in mental health and determine factors that contribute to change. The purpose of this study was to compare anxiety, depression, and stress pre-pandemic to during the pandemic within the same sample and identify predictors of change (i.e., disease threat, changes to daily life, social isolation, financial worries). METHOD Three national samples of U.S. adults were recruited through an online platform (Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Participants completed online surveys pre-pandemic (September - December 2019) and during the pandemic(April - June 2020). RESULTS Across the three samples, mini-meta analyses revealed significant increases in anxiety and stress (Cohen's ds = 0.17, 0.16, respectively; ps < 0.01). Financial concern and effects of COVID-19 on daily life predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic across all three samples (ds = 0.24, 0.40, and 0.40, respectively; ps < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS Significant increases in anxiety and stress were observed across three samples of U.S. adults from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial concern and effects of the pandemic on daily life emerged as the most consistent predictors of psychological distress across these samples.","Haliwa, Ilana; Wilson, Jenna; Lee, Jerin; Shook, Natalie J",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087628/,356

The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long-lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic reorganization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas carbon dioxide (CO2). We confirm that when coupled to CO2 presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states. Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2 but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.","Lesar, Amanda; Tahir, Javan; Wolk, Jason; Gershow, Marc",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.70317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636720/,356

This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of TRP-stimulating compounds to reduce swallowing reflex time in the elderly. We searched the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Central, Scopus, ISI, CINALH, LILACS, CRD database, and Open grey until June 1st, 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared swallowing time between TRP-stimulating compounds and placebo or no treatment in population aged more than 60 years old. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Three authors independently screened and selected studies. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by two authors independently. Of 363 reviews, we included four RCTs. Two RCTs used black pepper, one RCT used capsaicinoids, and the other one used capsaicin ointment to stimulate the TRPV1 receptor. All of the studies were assessed at unclear bias except the study, which used capsaicin ointment with assessed as low risk of bias. Meta-analysis could not be done in this study due to the different baseline characteristics and definition of swallowing reflex time. This review demonstrates the potential effect of TRPV1-stimulating compounds to reduce swallowing response time in the elderly were remains unclear. Most studies had an unclear bias.

We performed gastrojejunostomy via the magnetic compression anastomosis (MCA) technique because her situation was not improved by conservative therapy and because the operative risk was high. We prepared two neodymium magnets: a flat plate-shaped magnet (15 × 3 mm) and a ring-shaped magnet of the same size. The ring-shaped magnet which passed through a guidewire was pushed to the duodenum by an endoscope over the guidewire. The duodenal stricture was balloon-dilated in front of the magnet, and the magnet was pushed all together beyond the stricture and placed at the duodenojejunal junction. Subsequently, the flat plate-shaped magnet was delivered endoscopically to the stomach using a biopsy forceps. The magnets were attracted towards each other transmurally after one more flat plate-shaped magnet was added to the gastric-side magnet. Completion of gastrojejunostomy was confirmed while retrieving the magnets 10 days after starting compression. She has been asymptomatic for 1 month since anastomosis. Endoscopic gastrojejunostomy using MCA was an effective, low-invasive treatment for SMAS.","Kawabata, Hideaki; Sone, Daiki; Yamaguchi, Katsutoshi; Inoue, Naonori; Okazaki, Yuji; Ueda, Yuki; Hitomi, Misuzu; Miyata, Masatoshi; Motoi, Shigehiro",Gastroenterology research,https://doi.org/10.14740/gr1229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803313/,356
72270,Timing estimation for gait in water from inertial sensor measurements: Analysis of the performance of 17 algorithms.,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) carries a high rate of failure and reoperation. Laparoscopic conversion of failed LAGB to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been shown to be safe and feasible, but long-term follow-up data is still limited. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RYGB after failed LAGB in our patient population. SETTING The setting was the University Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon. METHODS Using a prospectively collected database, we retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent LAGB revision to RYGB at our institution between 2006 and 2014. RESULTS A total of 58 patients underwent RYGB after failed LAGB in our institution between 2006 and 2014. Of those, 20 patients (34.5%) had concomitant band removal while the rest underwent a two-stage RYGB after a mean of 30 months after band removal. A follow-up was achieved in 84.5, 82, 83, 95, and 76% of patients at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after RYGB. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 62.8, 68.1, 64.2, 63.8, and 61.3% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 28.4, 30.7, 29.4, 28.9, and 28.6% at the corresponding time periods. The most common short-term complications were abscesses/leaks (5.2%) while the most common long-term complications were symptomatic gallstones necessitating laparoscopic cholecystectomy (5.2%), incisional hernias (5.2%), and small-bowel obstruction (3.4%). No surgery-related mortality was recorded. CONCLUSIONS RYGB is a safe procedure with favorable weight loss outcomes at 5 years and can be considered a good rescue procedure after failed LAGB.","Dakour Aridi, Hanaa N; Wehbe, Mohammad-Rachad; Shamseddine, Ghassan; Alami, Ramzi S; Safadi, Bassem Y",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2529-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108969/,356
73725,Deep convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of thoracic organs-at-risk in radiation oncology - use of non-domain transfer learning.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. MAIN RESULTS Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","Burns, Jacob; Movsisyan, Ani; Stratil, Jan M; Biallas, Renke Lars; Coenen, Michaela; Emmert-Fees, Karl Mf; Geffert, Karin; Hoffmann, Sabine; Horstick, Olaf; Laxy, Michael; Klinger, Carmen; Kratzer, Suzie; Litwin, Tim; Norris, Susan; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Stadelmaier, Julia; Verboom, Ben; Voss, Stephan; Wabnitz, Katharina; Rehfuess, Eva",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013717.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763851/,356

Little is known about the prevalence of self-reported halitosis in adolescents in Nigeria and the extent to which self-reported halitosis impairs their oral health related quality of life. Objectives To determine the prevalence and impact of self-reported halitosis on the oral health related quality of life of adolescent students in a suburban community in Nigeria. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study. Pre-tested self-administered pro-forma was used to obtain the adolescents' demographic data and their self-perception of halitosis. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) was used to assess the adolescents' OHRQoL. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the median OHIP-14 scores between adolescents who reported halitosis and those who did not. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Results A total of 361 adolescents aged 10 - 19 years (mean age 14.1 ± 1.79 years) took part in the study. Of these, 32.7% (n=118) had self-reported halitosis. The median OHIP-14 score among adolescents with self-reported halitosis was 3 (0-9) while those who did not report halitosis had a median OHIP-14 score of 0 (0 - 5). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Self-reported halitosis significantly impaired the oral health related quality of life of the adolescents.","Alade, Omolola; Ajoloko, Ebenezer; Dedeke, Aderonke; Uti, Omolara; Sofola, Oyinkansola",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.62; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394270/,356

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Hungary on 4 March 2020, and the first patient infected with a new type of coronavirus died on 15 March. At the time of the deceased's death, there was no central, uniform directive clarifying the range of precautions required or providing a clear description of the safe handling of the corpse. Transporting the dead to a pathology department, storing them, possibly dissecting them, and then placing them in their final resting place, how these raise countless questions. The current legislation on communicable diseases and actions on the dead does not provide sufficient information on the performance of tasks after the death of a COVID-19 infected patient. On March 19, the national chief medical officer suspended the autopsies, except for forensic autopsies, but transportation and storage remained a problem. Although on March 21, 2020, the Department of Pathology of the Health Professional College of the Ministry of Human Resources issued a formal procedure, the recommendations contained therein represent a narrower spectrum of literature and need to be supplemented in several places. Unfortunately, data on post-mortem procedures are also under-represented in the international literature, given their importance. Another problem is that in the articles written for the treatment of the victims of crisis situations caused by epidemics, the available algorithms take into account different organizational and resource possibilities in addition to the legal environment different from Hungary, which circumstances make domestic adaptation significantly more difficult.

The aim of the review is to discuss common features of these risk factors and the impact of vitamin D. RECENT FINDINGS The recently discovered relationship between vitamin D and the infection pathway of the virus via the renin--angiotensin system (RAS) and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin play an important role. The frequency of studies showing a relationship between a low vitamin D status in comorbidities and severe COVID-19 courses makes an impact of vitamin D effects likely. SUMMARY There is a direct relationship between vitamin D, body fat and age in COVID-19 courses. With age, the ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D decreases, and leads to vitamin D-deficits. If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes. Treatment with vitamin D supplements should be based on severity of the vitamin D deficiency.","Biesalski, Hans K",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mco.0000000000000700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941186/,356

In patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tubes cannot be placed, single-incision laparoscopic surgery gastrostomy is an alternative method. This minimally invasive approach is a new technique performed through a single umbilical incision and without the need for additional laparoscopic ports. CASE PRESENTATION In this article we present a case of single-incision laparoscopic surgery gastrostomy performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments in a 10-year-old girl of Caucasian ethnicity who was not a candidate for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube because of esophageal varices due to her advanced-stage cystic fibrosis with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. She also had an umbilical hernia, which was repaired during the same procedure through the same incision. Access and pneumoperitoneum were obtained through the umbilicus with the single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. The selected site for the feeding tube in the stomach was exteriorized through this incision and a feeding tube was placed. The stomach was returned into the abdomen. The fascial defect, and thus also the hernia, was repaired, and the 2cm umbilical incision was closed with endocutaneous sutures. The total operative time was 25 minutes. Our patient's intra-operative and post-operative course was uneventful. We were able to use the feeding tube on the first post-operative day with good intestinal function. Our patient and her parents were pleased with the cosmetic result. CONCLUSIONS The single-incision laparoscopic surgery procedure seems to be a less invasive alternative to open placement of gastrostomy. This approach has the possible advantages of reduced post-operative pain, faster return to normal function, reduced port site complications, improved cosmesis and better patient satisfaction.","Vanderlinden, Kim; Van De Winkel, Nele; De Backer, Antoine; Delvaux, Georges; De Vogelaere, Kristel",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-6-375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23130674/,356
82880,Novel Analgesic Index for Postoperative Pain Assessment Based on a Photoplethysmographic Spectrogram and Convolutional Neural Network: Observational Study.,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND The vascular endothelium plays a key role in sepsis pathophysiology and the associated organ dysfunction. METHODS We evaluated endothelial function in an experimental in-vitro model of sepsis, using endothelial cells grown in the presence of serum from patients with septic syndromes (sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock), non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS) and healthy volunteers. Experiments were performed in the absence and presence of defibrotide (DF) (100µg/mL) to evaluate its potential protective effect. RESULTS After exposure to patients' sera, there was a progressive endothelial cell activation in correlation with sepsis severity, with a proinflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype, exhibiting significantly increased expression of adhesion receptors at the surface (ICAM-1, p< 0.05 and VCAM-1, p< 0.05); higher production and release to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of Von Willebrand factor (p< 0.001); augmented thrombogenicity of the ECM towards platelets (p< 0.001); and increased phosphorylation of intracellular p38MAPK. DF prevented these changes in all groups. CONCLUSIONS Markers of endothelial damage increased progressively in association with the severity of septic syndromes. The endothelium is therefore an important therapeutic target to prevent complications of sepsis. DF shows promising potential to modulate the endothelial damage associated with sepsis and may constitute a pharmacological tool to decrease its sequelae including multiorgan failure.","Fernández, Sara; Palomo, Marta; Molina, Patricia; Díaz-Ricart, Maribel; Escolar, Ginés; Tellez, Adrián; Seguí, Ferran; Ventosa, Helena; Torramade-Moix, Sergi; Rovira, Montserrat; Carreras, Enric; Nicolás, Josep M; Castro, Pedro",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872468/,356

We measured the prevalence of burnout and assessed wellbeing and quality of life (QoL) in HCWs at a single UK neuroscience center after the first pandemic surge. METHODS A 38-item electronic questionnaire was disseminated through local team email lists between May 22 and June 7, 2020, to HCWs in a university neurosciences center. Burnout was measured using the single-item Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization scales, and wellbeing and QoL assessed using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale and the EuroQol-5 Dimension instrument. RESULTS The response rate was 57.4% (n=234); 58.2% of respondents were nurses, 69.4% were women and 40.1% were aged 25 to 34 years. Overall, 21.4% of respondents reported burnout assessed by the Emotional Exhaustion scale; burnout was higher for nurses (23.5%) and allied health care professionals (22.5%) compared with doctors (16.4%). HCWs from ethnic minority groups reported a higher rate of burnout (24.5%) compared with white HCWs (15.0%). There were no differences in reported wellbeing or QoL between professional groups, or HCW age, sex, or race. Nurses (36.8%) and staff from ethnic minority groups (34.6%) were more fearful for their health than others. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the prevalence of HCW burnout after the first surge of the pandemic, with an increased risk of burnout among nurses and staff from ethnic minority groups. Both nursing and staff from ethnic minority groups were also more fearful for their health. With ongoing pandemic surges, the impact on HCW wellbeing should be continuously assessed to ensure that local strategies to support staff wellbeing are diverse and inclusive.","Douglas, Deborah R; Choi, David; Marcus, Hani J; Muirhead, Will; Reddy, Ugan; Stewart, Trudy; Luoma, Astri M V",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782373/,356

85995,Frequency of detection of upper respiratory tract viruses in patients tested for pandemic H1N1/09 viral infection.,2010,"While rates of opioid overdose deaths in North American have increased exponentially in recent years, most overdoses are not fatal, especially when witnesses are present and can intervene. Previous research has found that some people who use drugs [PWUDs] trained in overdose response might cut social ties with frequent overdosers, leading to more solitary opioid use and risk of death if someone overdoses alone. To examine the phenomenon of social distancing of people who overdose frequently, we used data from fifty-two in-depth qualitative interviews collected in Southern California with PWUDs who had recently witnessed an opioid overdose. Transcripts were reviewed and coded thematically, using the Integrated Threat Theory (ITT) to conceptualize the observed phenomenon. ITT outlines how realistic and symbolic threats are experienced by a group. We found that while some participants acknowledged the role of adulterated street drugs in overdoses, individualized blame was nonetheless imposed. Accusations of careless drug use practices fostered negative stereotyping towards frequent overdosers. This was attributed to the need to summon 911 for rescue, which often resulted in police dispatch. The intergroup relationship between police and PWUDs is precarious as police pose realistic threats onto PWUDs - such as incarceration, eviction, and manslaughter - leading to intragroup anxiety among PWUDs about future overdose events, and labeled frequent overdosers as liabilities. These threats, and inter/intra-group conflict, explained one reason how and why non-fatal overdoses led to social distancing events. People who overdose frequently were also accused of breaking the norm of drug user surreptitiousness; a symbolic threat that endangered the group due to police exposure. Social distancing might dampen exposure to the protective effect of peer-led interventions such as take-home naloxone programs, increasing risk of overdose death. This phenomenon highlights how intergroup dynamics are driving intragroup processes. Suggestions for tailoring public health interventions are discussed.","Bowles, J M; Smith, L R; Verdugo, S R; Wagner, K D; Davidson, P J",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673794/,356

The rationale for the use of these techniques is to provide modes of minimally invasive diagnosis and/or therapy for a subset of patients whose lesions are not approachable by the traditional modes of interventional radiology and to introduce methods to mark subtle and infiltrative lesions to improve the outcomes of subsequent surgery or radiation therapy. These techniques build on the inherent attributes of MRI, particularly the high soft tissue contrast that made MRI the current mainstay diagnostic modality to identify and characterize musculoskeletal soft tissue lesions. The application of MRI technology to the musculoskeletal system, particularly for lesions related to the appendicular skeleton, does not typically suffer from the complexity related to involuntary organ motion. In addition, MRI-compatible versions of most of the needed instruments and devices for these interventions are currently available on commercial basis. Although musculoskeletal applications were not adopted early during the development of interventional MRI technology, we are likely to observe an increasing use of this technology for musculoskeletal soft tissue applications in the future.","Nour, Sherif G; Monson, David K",Topics in magnetic resonance imaging : TMRI,https://doi.org/10.1097/rmr.0b013e31828291c0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23514927/,356

Despite the widespread influence of generalization on healthy and pathological behavior, insight into the underlying mechanisms is lacking. It remains unclear whether a failure to notice situational changes contributes to the generalization of learned behavior. We combined a fear conditioning and generalization procedure with a perceptual decision task in humans and found that a failure to perceive a novel stimulus as different from the initial fear-evoking stimulus was associated with increased conditioned responding. These findings demonstrate the potential of a perception-centered approach to better understand (pathological) behavior and its underlying mechanism and are a promising avenue for the development of refined generalization protocols.","Zaman, J; Struyf, D; Ceulemans, E; Beckers, T; Vervliet, B",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46176-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296943/,356

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING Online survey. PARTICIPANTS Clinicians who self-identified as infant care providers, that is, neonatal clinicians (N = 158). METHODS We sent an online survey invitation to neonatal clinicians through neonatal websites, conferences, and social media sites in the United States and used snowball recruitment. We used a risk management framework to analyze qualitative data. We used descriptive statistics and the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to determine if opinions differed based on clinician and organizational characteristics. RESULTS Respondents' support of parent sleep during skin-to-skin care (yes/no) did not differ on the basis of whether the clinician had taken a formal course on skin-to-skin care, facilitated skin-to-skin care more than 100 times, or frequently promoted skin-to-skin care in current practice. Respondents who supported parent sleep (n = 93, 59% of respondents) reported greater implementation of risk control strategies than nonsupporters (n = 53 [57%] vs. n = 3 [5%]; p < .001), such as frequent monitoring of vital signs (n = 33 [35%] vs. n = 2 [3%]; p < .001), use of devices to support skin-to-skin care (n = 49 [53%] vs. n = 19 [29%]; p = .003), and proper positioning (n = 20 [22%] vs. n = 0 [0%]; p < .001). Nonsupporters more frequently reported that parent sleep during skin-to-skin care violates safe sleep recommendations, is habit forming for home, poses a fall risk, and jeopardizes the infant's airway. CONCLUSION Most respondents supported parent sleep during skin-to-skin care, but concerns regarding safety for the infant remained a barrier. The use of a risk management framework may help facilitate a systematic approach to improve the implementation of safe skin-to-skin practices.","Weber, Ashley; Elder, Mason; Voos, Kristin C; Lambert, Joshua W; Kaplan, Heather C; Jackson, Yamile C","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogn.2020.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726581/,356
95911,PAM-DenseNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Computer-Aided COVID-19 Diagnosis.,2021-08-24,"Minilaparoscopy was introduced already 20 years ago. In spite of reduced diameter, technical performance of modern trocars and instruments has improved substantially. While carrying out a minilaparoscopic procedure, the required position of the trocars and the surgical strategy remain the same. The most important step towards minilaparoscopy is reduction of the diameter of the laparoscopes from 10 to 5 mm. The 5 mm laparoscopes show high resolution and transport enough energy to properly illuminate the surgical field. Minilaparoscopic procedures help to improve cosmetic results and reduce postoperative pain, but postoperative complication rates are not affected. Use of one 5 mm trocar causes higher tissue tension than two 3 mm trocars and an additionally placed 3 mm trocar will not increase the complication rate. Therefore, a reduced risk of trocar hernia formation may be expected when a minilaparoscopic approach is used. Efficiency has been proven for minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hernioplasty (TAPP/TEP) whereas overall available evidence across the literature remains poor. Further miniaturization is linked directly to video editing: physical limitations in classic optic systems have already been reached; therefore, reduction of optical chip systems could be a possible alternative.","Schmidt, J",Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-017-0437-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484787/,356

METHODS Stable infants who were monitored with an electrocardiograph were included. Three sensor application techniques were studied: (i) sensor connected to cable, then applied to infant; (ii) sensor connected to cable, applied to investigator's finger, and then to infant; (iii) sensor applied to infant, then connected to cable. The order of techniques tested was randomized for each infant. Time taken to apply the PO sensor, to display data and to display accurate data (HR(PO) = HR(ECG) ± 3 bpm) were recorded using a stopwatch. RESULTS Forty infants were studied [mean (SD) birthweight, 1455 (872) g; gestational age, 31 (4) weeks; post-menstrual age, 34 (4) weeks]. Method 3 acquired any data significantly faster than methods 1 (p = 0.013; CI, -9.6 to -3.0 sec) and 2 (p = 0.004; CI, -5.9 to -1.2 sec). Method 3 acquired accurate data significantly faster than method 1 (p = 0.016; CI, -9.4 to -1.0 sec), but not method 2 (p = 0.28).

In this report we describe our initial experience with SILS for both right hemicolectomies and anterior resections. METHODS Between June 2009 and May 2010, SILS was performed for 32 consecutive cases with benign and malignant pathology. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, postoperative data, and pathologic data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-one SILS right hemicolectomies, ten ARs, and one abdominal perineal resection (APR) were performed. For SILS right hemicolectomies, one case required full ""conversion"" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 85 min (range 45-150 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-10.0 cm). Median number of lymph nodes extracted in malignant cases was 17(range 10-30) and the overall median length of stay was 6 days (range 5-11). For left-sided lesions, ten cases of ARs (7 high ARs, 2 low ARs, 1 ultralow AR) and one APR were performed. Three cases were completed successfully via the SILS procedure, four cases required one additional port, and four cases required full ""conversion"" to a laparoscopic procedure. The median operating time was 120 min (range 65-235 min) and the median wound length was 5.0 cm (range 3.0-7.0 cm). Overall median length of stay was also 6 days (range 5-21). There was one case of anastomotic leak and one case of postoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, SILS for right hemicolectomies is safe and effective with reproducible oncologic results. SILS AR, however, requires greater modifications in current devices and techniques. SILS AR can be performed for both malignant and benign diseases but additional ports may be necessary for the safe completion of the procedure.","Chew, Min-Hoe; Wong, Mark Te-Ching; Lim, Bernard Yon-Kuei; Ng, Kheng-Hong; Eu, Kong-Weng",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-0989-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21318430/,356

OBJECTIVES To describe the revision of two National Institutes of Health funded community-based palliative-focused clinical trials serving underserved populations to accommodate remote subject enrollment and examine its impact. METHODS Transitioning to remote processes required multiple protocol and procedural changes including: altering informed consent processes; reducing the number of surveys administered; adding internet access as an inclusion criterion. To understand technological challenges, a screening tool was developed for one study to identify potentially eligible subjects' technology abilities and accessibility. RESULTS Subjects' limited access to the internet and internet-enabled devices and discomfort with technology led to changes in recruitment patterns. Lack of familiarity with technology increased the amount of time it took research team members and subjects to connect remotely. Patients with significant cognitive and/or sensory deficits were at higher risk of experiencing fatigue during remote study visits leading to streamlining of data collection. A researcher-developed technology screening tool found that potential subjects were not comfortable with videoconferencing through Zoom® expressing a preference for phone visits. Reduced travel time made scheduling remote study visits more efficient. CONCLUSION Future community- and home-based palliative care trials must consider the best way to utilize remote recruitment, enrollment, and data collection processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Researchers should consider technology accessibility and train staff to ensure the greatest possible opportunity to recruit underserved populations who have traditionally been underrepresented in research studies.","Brody, Abraham A; Convery, Kimberly A; Kline, Danielle M; Fink, Regina M; Fischer, Stacy M",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161811/,356

Although the etiology of KD remains unidentified, epidemiological features point to the role of infection and genetic predisposition. Recent studies revealed endothelial damage and resultant thrombin generation, as well as B-cell activation during the acute phase of KD. Several anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies (AECAs) have been identified in KD patients. Taken together with the recently developed concept of immunothrombosis, a potential pathogenic mechanism for KD emerges. First, some polyclonal antibodies generated against invading microorganisms would exhibit cross-reactivity toward endothelial cell components and become dominant during affinity maturation. AECA binding to endothelial cells would cause endothelial activation or damage, with proinflammatory cytokine release, fostering a hypercoagulable state by leukocyte activation by proinflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, would lead to coronary artery lesions. KD vasculitis might be initiated upon AECA binding to the vasa vasorum and progress to panvasculitis and a vulnerable vessel wall, resulting in an aneurysm. The aneurysm would cause flow recirculation and alteration of wall shear stress. Consequently, platelets activated by shear stress, along with ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) released by endothelial cells, would cause platelet-driven arterial thrombosis. Autoimmunity-associated thrombosis initiated by AECA binding to endothelial cells might play a major role in the pathogenesis of certain subtypes of KD. The notion of KD consisting of subtypes, the major one of which is AECA-associated vasculitis, will help facilitate a better understanding of KD and further promote early and accurate diagnosis, which remains challenging.","Sakurai, Y",Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.18176/jiaci.0300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183655/,356

Transareolar pulmonary bullectomy rarely has been attempted. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this novel minimally invasive technique in managing primary spontaneous pneumothorax. METHODS From January 2013 to December 2014, a total of 112 male patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax underwent transareolar pulmonary bullectomy by use of a 5-mm thoracoscope. RESULTS All procedures were performed successfully, with a mean operating time of 26.5 minutes. The mean length of transareolar incision for the main operation was 2.0 ± 0.2 cm, the mean length of incision for the camera port was 0.6 ± 0.1 cm, and the mean postoperative cosmetic score was 3.0 ± 0.8. All patients regained consciousness rapidly after surgery. One hundred seven patients (95.5%) were discharged on postoperative day 2 or 3, with the remainder discharged on postoperative day 4 or 5. Postoperative complications were minor. At 6 months postoperatively, there was no obvious surgical scar on the chest wall, and no patient complained of postoperative pain. No recurrent symptoms were observed. One-year follow-up revealed an excellent cosmetic result and degree of satisfaction.

METHODS A simulation training exercise was designed as a departmental initiative to improve competency performing nasopharyngeal swabs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-one health care workers attended teaching sessions led by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology on proper nasopharyngeal swab technique. After a brief lecture, participants practiced their swab technique using a high-fidelity airway simulation model. Pre- and postintervention self-evaluations were measured via standardized clinical competency questionnaires on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""No knowledge, unable to perform"" up to ""Highly knowledgeable and confident, independent."" RESULTS Forty-six participants in this study submitted pre- and postintervention self-assessments. Postintervention scores improved on average 1.41 points (95% CI, 1.10-1.73) out of 5 from a mean score of 3.13 to 4.54 (P < .0001). This reflects a large effect size with a Glass's delta value of 1.3. DISCUSSION Lecture coupled with simulation-based teaching can significantly improve health care workers' confidence in performing nasopharyngeal swabs. Proper training for frontline workers performing swabs for COVID-19 is essential to improving testing accuracy and can be achieved in a simple and timely manner. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE To meet the testing needs of the growing pandemic, many health care workers who are unfamiliar with nasopharyngeal swabs have been asked to perform this test. Simulation-based teaching sessions may improve health care workers' confidence and help prevent false-negative results.

110516,Organ-focused mutual information for nonrigid multimodal registration of liver CT and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI.,2014,"Influenza virus infection is a respiratory infectious disease that can seriously affect human health. Influenza viruses can have frequent antigenic variation and changes, which can result in rapid and widespread transmission resulting in annual epidemics and outbreaks in places of public gathering such as schools, kindergartens and nursing homes. According to WHO estimation, seasonal influenza epidemics have caused an annually 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290 000 to 650 000 deaths globally. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic illnesses are at high risk for severe illness and death associated with influenza virus infection. Especially, COVID-19 pandemic might co-circulate with other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza in the coming winter-spring season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from infection. Currently, China has licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) which includes split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) which is split, and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) which was newly licensed. Except for a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a category Ⅱ vaccine, which means influenza vaccination is voluntary, and recipients must pay for it. In 2018 and 2019, the China CDC issued the ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China"" . In the past year, new research evidences home and abroad have been published, and new seasonal influenza vaccine has been licensed in China. To strengthen the technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and operational research on influenza vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group (TWG), updated the 2019-2020 technical guidelines and compiled the ""Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2020-2021)"" . The main updates in this version include the following: First, new research evidences especially studies of China, including disease burden, effectiveness, Vaccine-avoidable disease burden, vaccine safety monitoring, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit. Second, policies and measures for influenza prevention and control issued by National Health Commission (PRC) in the past year. Thirdly, new type seasonal influenza vaccine licensed and issued in 2020-2021 in China. Fourth, northern hemisphere influenza vaccination composition for the 2020-2021 season which included trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Fifth, Influenza vaccination recommendations for 2020-2021 influenza season. The recommendations described in this report include the following: Points of Vaccination clinics (PoVs) should provide influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available. Considering the situation of globally pandemic of COVID-19, to decrease the risk of influenza virus infection and minimize the impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following priority for seasonal influenza vaccination: healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, quarantine professionals; vulnerable groups living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staffs who take care those vulnerable groups; people work or stay in high population density places, such as teachers and students in kindergartens, primary and secondary school, prisoners and staffs of prisons; other high risk group of influenza, including adults ≥60 years of age, children aged 6-59 months, persons with specific chronic diseases, the family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season. Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection. People whoever get IIV or LAIV all apply to the principle. If they were vaccinated in 2019-2020 influenza season or a prior season, 1 dose is recommended. People more than 8 years old require 1 dose of influenza vaccine. It is recommended that people receive their influenza vaccination by the end of October. Influenza vaccination should be offered as soon as the vaccination is available. For the people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccination will continue to be offered for the whole season. Influenza vaccine is also recommended for use in pregnant women during any trimester. These guidelines are intended for use by staff members of the CDCs at all levels who work on influenza control and prevention, PoVs staff members, healthcare workers from the departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases, and staff members of maternity and child care institutions at all levels.

To determine the impact of remote proctoring on the academic performance of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students.Methods. This was a retrospective, observational study that compared first professional year (P1) and second professional year (P2) pharmacy students' scores on eight composite examinations administered in spring 2020 (n = 387), the final three of which were proctored remotely, to that of a historical cohort of pharmacy students who took the same examinations in spring 2019 (n = 368). To assess whether remote proctoring affected academic performance, spring 2020 scores for examinations 6, 7, and 8 were compared to those of a historical cohort who took the same examinations in person with a proctor present in spring 2019. Academic performance on examinations 1 through 4 was also compared between the two cohorts to evaluate any possible year-to-year variation in academic performance during non-remote circumstances. Mann Whitney tests were used to compare scores between the two cohorts.Results. The median scores of students in the spring 2020 cohort were significantly lower than the scores of the historical cohort on the first composite examination administered to P1 students after the implementation of remote proctoring. In contrast, median scores were significantly higher on two of the three examinations administered to P2 students using remote proctoring.Conclusion. Remote proctoring has minimal impact on pharmacy students' examination performance and its use should be considered to ensure academic honesty and security of testing content in a distance learning environment.","Hall, Elizabeth A; Spivey, Christina; Kendrex, Hailey; Havrda, Dawn E",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34615623/,356

However, the dominant conceptualizations of support have been heavily influenced by Western family norms. The consequence, at best, has been to stifle our understanding of the nature and consequences of support for mothers and children. At worst, it has led to systematic discrimination negatively impacting maternal-child health. To fully engage with the complexities of social support, we must take multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary approaches spanning diverse cultural and geographical perspectives. However, multidisciplinary knowledge-processing can be challenging, and it is often unclear how different studies from different disciplines relate. To address this, we outline two epistemological frameworks-the scientific approach and Tinbergen's four questions-that can be useful tools in connecting research across disciplines. In this theme issue on 'Multidisciplinary perspectives on social support and maternal-child health', we attempt to foster multidisciplinary thinking by presenting work from a diverse range of disciplines, populations and cultures. Our hope is that these tools, along with papers in this issue, help to build a holistic understanding of social support and its consequences for mothers and their children. Overall, a multidisciplinary perspective points to how the responsibility of childrearing should not fall solely onto mothers. Indeed, this multidisciplinary issue demonstrates that successful childrearing is consistently an activity shared beyond the mother and the nuclear family: an insight that is crucial to harnessing the potential of social support to improve maternal-child health.

114469,2D Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Multi-scale Contextual Dependencies.,2021-05-21,"θ-Defensins are cyclic octadecapeptides found in nonhuman primates whose broad antiviral spectrum includes HIV-1, HSV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and influenza A virus (IAV). We previously reported that synthetic θ-defensins called retrocyclins can neutralize and aggregate various strains of IAV and increase IAV uptake by neutrophils. This study describes two families of peptides, hapivirins and diprovirins, whose design was inspired by retrocyclins. The goal was to develop smaller partially cyclic peptides that retain the antiviral activity of retrocyclins, while being easier to synthesize. The novel peptides also allowed for systemic substitution of key residues to evaluate the role of charge or hydrophobicity on antiviral activity. Seventy-two hapivirin or diprovirin peptides are described in this work, including several whose anti-IAV activity equals or exceeds that of normal α- or θ-defensins. Some of these also had strong antibacterial and antifungal activity. These new peptides were active against H3N2 and H1N1 strains of IAV. Structural features imparting strong antiviral activity were identified through iterative cycles of synthesis and testing. Our findings show the importance of hydrophobic residues for antiviral activity and show that pegylation, which often increases a peptide's serum t(1/2) in vivo, can increase the antiviral activity of DpVs. The new peptides acted at an early phase of viral infection, and, when combined with pulmonary surfactant protein D, their antiviral effects were additive. The peptides strongly increased neutrophil and macrophage uptake of IAV, while inhibiting monocyte cytokine generation. Development of modified θ-defensin analogs provides an approach for creating novel antiviral agents for IAV infections.","Doss, Mona; Ruchala, Piotr; Tecle, Tesfaldet; Gantz, Donald; Verma, Anamika; Hartshorn, Alex; Crouch, Erika C; Luong, Hai; Micewicz, Ewa D; Lehrer, Robert I; Hartshorn, Kevan L",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1101335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22345650/,356

The present study assessed the impact of the policy change by transplant center volume. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for all adults undergoing isolated heart transplantation from November 2016 to September 2020. Era 1 was defined as the period before the policy change and Era 2 afterwards. Hospitals were divided into low-(LVC) medium-(MVC) and high-volume (HVC) tertiles based on annual transplant center volume. Competing-risks regressions were used to determine changes in waitlist death/deterioration, while post-transplant mortality was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models. A total of 3,531 (47.0%) patients underwent heart transplantation in Era 1 and 3,988 (53.0%) in Era 2. At LVC, Era 2 patients were less likely to experience death/deterioration on the waitlist (subhazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88), while MVC and HVC patients experienced similar waitlist death/deterioration across eras. After adjustment, transplantation in Era 2 was associated with worse 1-year mortality at MVC (hazard ratio, HR, 1.42 95% CI 1.02-1.96) and HVC (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.98) but not at LVC.

There are many potential natural products for drug discovery and development to tackle this disease. One of these candidates is the Ganoderma lucidum fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP-glu). In the present study, we clarify the influences of N-linked glycans on the improvement of anti-inflammatory activity and the potential mechanisms of action. Four proteins, including FIP-glu (WT) and its mutants N31S, T36N and N31S/T36N, were successfully expressed in P. pastoris, of which T36N and N31S/T36N were glycoproteins. After treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F, the results of SDS-PAGE and Western blot showed that the glycan moiety was removed completely, indicating that the glycan moiety was N-linked. This was also demonstrated by UPLC-qTOF-MS. The cytotoxicity assay showed that N-linked glycans decreased the cytotoxicity of WT; while, the RT-qPCR assay showed that N-glycosylated WT regulated the mRNA expression of IL-6 and TGF-β1. The Western blot results showed that N-glycosylated WT reduced the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, our findings revealed a novel mechanism by which N-glycosylation of FIP-glu improved its anti-inflammatory activity through the regulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 via inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. It was proved that N-glycosylation significantly improved the functional properties of FIP-glu, providing theoretical and technical support for expanding the application of FIPs in the food and pharmaceutical industries.","Li, Qi-Zhang; Chen, Xin; Mao, Pei-Wen; Jin, Meng-Yuan; Wu, Qin; Zhou, Xuan-Wei",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fo00178g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900328/,356

Traditional coil embolization as the primary means of carotid sacrifice can be expensive, with high radiation exposure. We investigated the feasibility of a novel hybrid coil, the Penumbra occlusion device (POD), for carotid sacrifice in a swine model. METHODS A total of eight common carotid artery sacrifices were performed in fully heparinized pigs under fluoroscopic guidance. A single POD device was deployed within each vessel, and intermittent follow-up angiography was performed to assess flow. RESULTS Complete carotid occlusion was achieved in all cases with a single POD (time range 2-15 min) without any coil migration or intraprocedural complications. Once the anchor zone was stable, no distal migrations were observed during either proximal soft coil packing or during hand injected angiography. Complete occlusion was verified between 2 and 15 min following POD deployment. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery sacrifice using a novel POD device is safe and effective, allowing for reduced radiation and material costs compared with any other described endovascular technique.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; Turner, Raymond D; Chaudry, M Imran; Turk, Aquilla S; Hui, Ferdinand K; Schonholz, Claudio",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25404407/,356
119858,Generating diagnostic report for medical image by high-middle-level visual information incorporation on double deep learning models.,2020-08-11,"Cadmium (Cd) presents severe risks to human health and environments. The present study proposed a green option to reduce bioavailable Cd. Rice pot experiments were conducted under continuous flooding with three treatments (T1: intercropping azolla with rice; T2: incorporating azolla into soil before rice transplantation; CK: no azolla). The results showed that azolla incorporation reduced soluble Cd by 37% compared with the CK treatment, which may be explained by the decreased soil redox potential (Eh) (r = 0.867, P < 0.01). The higher relative abundance of Methylobacter observed in azolla incorporation treatment may account for dissolved organic carbon increase (r = 0.694; P < 0.05), and hence decreased the Cd availability for rice. Azolla incorporation increased the abundance of Nitrospira, indicating the potentially prominent role of nitrogen mineralization in increasing rice yields. Further, lower soluble Cd decreased the expression of OsNramp5, but increased OsHMA3 levels in rice roots, which decreased Cd accumulation in grains. Through these effects, azolla incorporation decreased Cd concentrations in rice grains by 80.3% and increased the production by 13.4%. The negligible amount of Cd absorbed by azolla would not increase the risk of long-term application. Thus, intercropping azolla with early rice and incorporating azolla into soil before late rice transplantation can contribute to safe production at large scales of double rice cultivation.","Liu, Chen; Guo, Bin; Li, Hua; Fu, Qinglin; Li, Ningyu; Lin, Yicheng; Xu, Guozhong",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85648-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737581/,356

This study analyses three phenomena: causes attributed to unemployment; processes for coping with unemployment; and the emotional impact of joblessness. Using an SEM approach, a model is created in which unemployment normalization acts as a mediator between locus of control and emotions. Method: questionnaires from 260 unemployed people in Luxembourg provided data on perceived control, coping, and emotions. Participants who attribute their situation to bad luck, believe more strongly that unemployment is due to external factors beyond their control, and recognize unemployment as being a common occurrence in life. Such cognitive attribution of unemployment has effects on job seekers' emotions. Those who perceive unemployment in a more positive light experience more positive emotions and fewer negative affects. Negative perceptions of unemployment have no effect on the generation of positive emotion, but have an influence on negative affects. Finally, the influence of perceived-control on emotion is not direct, but is mediated by processes of unemployment normalization. Understanding how unemployed people perceive and experience their situations could help them be more effective in their search for new employment.","Houssemand, Claude; Rosato, Valeria; Thill, Steve; Pignault, Anne","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1908540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834895/,356

Given the rapidly growing evidence base, we implemented a living guideline model to provide guidance on the management of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. METHODS The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. We used the World Health Organization's definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials. When appropriate, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, then used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. RESULTS The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued nine statements (three new and six updated) related to ICU patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. For severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the panel strongly recommends using systemic corticosteroids and venous thromboprophylaxis but strongly recommends against using hydroxychloroquine. In addition, the panel suggests using dexamethasone (compared with other corticosteroids) and suggests against using convalescent plasma and therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel suggests using remdesivir in nonventilated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and suggests against starting remdesivir in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 outside clinical trials. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel did not issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning. CONCLUSION The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued several recommendations to guide healthcare professionals caring for adults with critical or severe coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.","Alhazzani, Waleed; Evans, Laura; Alshamsi, Fayez; Møller, Morten Hylander; Ostermann, Marlies; Prescott, Hallie C; Arabi, Yaseen M; Loeb, Mark; Ng Gong, Michelle; Fan, Eddy; Oczkowski, Simon; Levy, Mitchell M; Derde, Lennie; Dzierba, Amy; Du, Bin; Machado, Flavia; Wunsch, Hannah; Crowther, Mark; Cecconi, Maurizio; Koh, Younsuck; Burry, Lisa; Chertow, Daniel S; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Greco, Massimiliano; Bala, Malgorzata; Zarychanski, Ryan; Kesecioglu, Jozef; McGeer, Allison; Mermel, Leonard; Mammen, Manoj J; Nainan Myatra, Sheila; Arrington, Amy; Kleinpell, Ruth; Citerio, Giuseppe; Lewis, Kimberley; Bridges, Elizabeth; Memish, Ziad A; Hammond, Naomi; Hayden, Frederick G; Alshahrani, Muhammed; Al Duhailib, Zainab; Martin, Greg S; Kaplan, Lewis J; Coopersmith, Craig M; Antonelli, Massimo; Rhodes, Andrew",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555780/,356

It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an ""unpurposed space"" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into ""purposed space"" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.","Wald, Hedy S; Monteverde, Settimio",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020976188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427018/,356

This medicine is called the genus epidemicus. This study aims to demonstrate the reasoning used to propose the homeopathic medicine Antimonium tartaricum (Ant-t) as a genus epidemicus in the COVID-19 epidemic. It was decided to develop the reasoning based on the respiratory symptoms described in the epidemiological bulletins presented by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, as these symptoms are the most serious of the disease. After repertorization, it was confirmed in the Materia Medica that Ant-t has a high degree of similarity with these respiratory symptoms, including the most serious situations, of COVID-19.

Among the various intra-operative complications, double-stapled anastomotic complications are more serious and complicated to manage. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of intra-operative double-stapled colorectal or coloanal anastomotic complications on short-term surgical outcomes and persistent leak, and risk factors of intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complication. METHODS Consecutive 363 cases of laparoscopic low anterior resection from August 2004 to November 2012 were analyzed in this study. We retrospectively reviewed intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications and compared patient characteristics, surgical data, post-operative clinical data, and pathological data between groups with and without intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications. And we analyzed risk factors for double-stapled anastomotic complication. RESULTS There were 20 intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications among the patients (5.5 %). Operation time was longer (304.8 ± 122.0 vs. 197.1 ± 87.5 min, p = 0.001) and more diversion ileostomy were made (75 vs. 34.7 %, p < 0.001) in the group with double-stapled anastomotic complications. There were no differences in terms of surgical morbidity, conversion rate, anastomotic leakage, and hospital stay. However, there was more persistent anastomotic leakage (15 vs. 0.9 %, p = 0.003) in the group with double-stapled anastomotic complications. In univariate analysis, risk factors for double-stapled anastomotic complications were male, T4 stage lesion, and three or more stapler firings. CONCLUSIONS The double-stapled anastomotic complications during laparoscopic low anterior resection increased operation time and rate of diversion ileostomy. Although these factors did not adversely affect short-term surgical outcome including post-operative morbidity and anastomotic leakage, double-stapled anastomotic complications could increase persistent anastomotic leakage rate.","Kim, Ji Hoon; Kim, Ho Young; Lee, In Kyu; Oh, Seung Teak; Kim, Jun Gi; Lee, Yoon Suk",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-4035-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25519426/,356

Following the structural systematization given in Part I, Part II focuses on revealing the driving factors for certain structure types, in particular, the electronic structure. Here, concepts of different complexity are presented, including molecular orbital theory, the principle of hard and soft acids and bases, and a Bader analysis based on Density Functional Theory calculations for representatives of the reported structure types. The potential Si/T ordering in different structures is discussed. Additionally, the influences from intrinsic and extrinsic properties (e.g. elemental size and electronics as well as lattice parameters and structure type) are investigated on each other using correlation plots. Thermal treatment is identified as an important factor for the ordering of Si/T atoms.","Nentwich, M; Zschornak, M; Sonntag, M; Gumeniuk, R; Gemming, S; Leisegang, T; Meyer, D C","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620003893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831258/,356

In this paper, we discuss critical insights from the home and community care sector, which shed light on pre-pandemic fault lines that have widened. The paper, however, takes a positive look at how a better future can be built, particularly for those most vulnerable in society. We offer three key insights and analyses as well as examples of how one national homecare organization in Canada, SE Health, is facing the pandemic. We discuss the following key insights: (1) pre-pandemic systemic biases and barriers were exasperated during the pandemic, which impacted the most vulnerable; (2) nurse leaders were faced with unprecedented fear and anxiety from both patients and their staff colleagues; and (3) the pandemic provided an opportunity for significant learning, innovation and capacity development. The pandemic is far from over - we are in a marathon, not a sprint.

A novel astaxanthin-based natural antioxidant nanosystem, namely AST-GLU-LIP, with preferential renal uptake and bioavailability were prepared and applied for treatment of diabetic nephropathy in rats. Our results of kidney-targeted evaluation showed that glucose-PEG600-DSPE ligand modified AST liposomes could be specifically transported by overexpressed GLUT1 on the membrane of glomerular mesangial cells and achieved excellent kidney-targeted drug delivery. In addition, the results of pharmacodynamics and therapeutics in DN rats demonstrated that AST-GLU-LIP could improve the bioavailability and antioxidant capacity of AST to scavenge redundant ROS induced by oxidative stress. AST-GLU-LIP could also significantly improve the renal pathological morphology to protect the kidney as a therapeutic drug for diabetic nephropathy.","Chen, Zhong; Li, Wenhua; Shi, Liwang; Jiang, Lei; Li, Minghui; Zhang, Changmei; Peng, Haisheng",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937179/,356

140393,The mental health and wellbeing survey of Australian optometrists.,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND The main requirements when performing laparoscopic local resection for early mucosal tumors of the stomach are a clearly defined cancer-free margin and precise tumor localization. In this study, a novel method for precise intraoperative tumor localization and appropriate resection in a porcine model is introduced: endoscopic submucosal cutting and light transmission (ESCLT). METHODS A total of 15 cases of laparoscopic local resection were performed in 6 pigs. The size of the target lesions was approximately 20 mm. The imaginary lesions were located in the high body anterior wall, posterior wall, lower body posterior wall, angle, and antrum anterior wall of the stomach. Mucosal marking around the lesions, mucosal precutting surrounding the marking, and submucosal cutting along the precutting line using white light endoscopy were sequentially performed. Next, an endoscopic light source was placed directly in front of the lesion. Exact oval-shaped submucosal cutting margins were identified via laparoscopy. Laparoscopic local resection was performed after the minimal distance from the stapler line to the submucosal cutting line was confirmed. The sizes of the mucosal marking, submucosal cutting line, and the entire resected mucosa and serosa were measured. RESULTS The procedure was completed successfully in all pigs. Local resection was completed on all of the lesions. The mean endoscopic and laparoscopic procedure times were 26.1 and 12.7 min, respectively. The mean size of the resected specimens was: (i) marking lesion, 22 × 19.5 mm; (ii) submucosal cutting line, 26.7 × 23.2 mm; (iii) entire resected mucosa, 37 × 31 mm; and (iv) entire resected serosa, 41.7 × 33.1 mm. There was no intraoperative morbidity. CONCLUSION ESCLT provides a precise and useful method of intraoperative tumor localization during laparoscopic local resection of the stomach in terms of minimizing the resection of normal stomach tissue and guaranteeing adequate mucosal safety margins.","Lee, Young-Joon; Park, Ji-Ho; Jeong, Sang-Ho; Ha, Chang Yoon; Kwag, Seung-Jin; Kim, Ju-Yeon; Park, Taejin; Jeong, Chi-Young; Ju, Young-Tae; Jung, Eun-Jung; Hong, Soon-Chan; Choi, Sang-Kyung; Ha, Woo-Song",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3858-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277479/,356

We evaluated the short and long-term results of R1 resection. METHODS Between 2006 and 2016, 202 patients underwent liver resection for CRLM. R1 resection was defined as a distance of less than 1 mm between tumor cells and the transection plain. Patient and tumor characteristics, perioperative, and long-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS In 161 (79.7%) and 41 (20.3%) patients, an R0 and R1 resections were achieved, respectively. Patients that underwent an R1 resection had higher rates of disease progression while on chemotherapy (12.1% vs 5.5%, P = 0.001), need for second-line chemotherapy (17% vs 6.2%, P < 0.001), increased use of preoperative volume manipulation (14.6% vs 5.5%, P = 0.001), and inferior vena-cava involvement (21.9% vs 8.7%, P < 0.001). These patients had higher rates of major postoperative complications (19.5% vs 6.8%, P < 0.001) and reoperations (7.3% vs 2.4%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that R1 resections were not associated with decreased recurrence-free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Although R1 resection is associated with worse disease behavior and postoperative complications, the long-term outcome of patients following an R1 resection is non-inferior to those who underwent an R0 resection.","Pencovich, Niv; Houli, Rotem; Lubezky, Nir; Goykhman, Yaacov; Nakache, Richard; Klausner, Joseph M; Nachmany, Ido",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.25321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548552/,356

Ninety six barrows (~25 kg, 4 pigs/pen) were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets (n = 6) for 7 weeks. The diets were control, corn-, and soybean meal-based diet or control plus 2.5%, 3.75%, or 5.0% P. kudriavzevii. Diets were formulated to be isocaloric and iso nitrogenous. Feed intake and body weight (BW) were recorded weekly for calculation of average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F). Fecal scores were taken 3 d/wk to assess incidence and severity of diarrhea. One pig/pen close to pen average was bled for plasma metabolites on days 7 and 49 and subsequently euthanized for spleen and liver weight, ileal and cecum digesta samples for concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The concentration of crude protein, crude fat, and non-fiber carbohydrates in P. kudriavzevii biomass was 36.4%, 9.6%, and 50.8% DM, respectively. Inclusion of P. kudriavzevii tended (P = 0.06) to linearly reduce ADG from days 8 through 49 resulting in a trend (P = 0.06) for linear reduction in the final BW. The final BW was 79.0, 79.2, 76.8, and 75.5 kg for the 0%, 2.5%, 3.75%, and 5.0% P. kudriavzevii, respectively. Diets had no effect (P > 0.10) on ADFI, G:F, spleen, and liver weight throughout the entire experiment. On day 7, there was cubic (P = 0.03) decrease and quadratic (P = 0.02) increase in plasma concentration of creatinine and urea N, respectively. However, there were no (P > 0.10) diet effects on plasma metabolites on day 49. There was a tendency (P = 0.08) for linear increase in cecum digesta concentration of acetic acid. There were no diet effects (P > 0.10) on fecal score in the first 4 wk of feeding. In conclusion, feeding P. kudriavzevii yeast tended to depress growth and stimulate cecum fermentation at higher dose and had no detrimental effects on organ weights or plasma metabolites in growing pigs.","Kiarie, Elijah G; Voth, Conor; Wey, Doug; Zhu, Cuilan; Huber, Lee-Anne; Squires, E James",Translational animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txaa152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904991/,356
149879,Nonnegative Blind Source Separation for Ill-Conditioned Mixtures via John Ellipsoid.,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this randomized study was to determine whether intervention based on additional capnographic monitoring reduces the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation during propofol sedation for colonoscopy. METHODS Patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA) 1-3) scheduled for colonoscopy under propofol sedation were randomly assigned to either a control arm with standard monitoring (standard arm) or an interventional arm in which additional capnographic monitoring (capnography arm) was available. In both study arms, detection of apnea or altered respiration induced withholding propofol administration, stimulation of the patient, chin lift maneuver, or further measures. The primary study end point was the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation (defined as a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) of ≥5% or <90%); secondary end points included the occurrences of hypoxemia (SaO(2) <90%), severe hypoxemia (SaO(2) ≤85%), bradycardia, hypotension, and the quality of sedation (patient cooperation and patient satisfaction). RESULTS A total of 760 patients were enrolled at three German endoscopy centers. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction of the incidence of oxygen desaturation in the capnography arm in comparison with the standard arm (38.9% vs. 53.2%; P<0.001). The numbers of patients with a fall in SaO(2) <90% and ≤85% were also significantly different (12.5% vs. 19.8%; P=0.008 and 3.7 vs. 7.8%; P=0.018). There were no differences regarding the rates of bradycardia and hypotension. Quality of sedation was similar in both groups. Results of statistical analyses were maintained for the per-protocol population. CONCLUSIONS Additional capnographic monitoring of ventilatory activity reduces the incidence of oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia during propofol sedation for colonoscopy.","Beitz, Analena; Riphaus, Andrea; Meining, Alexander; Kronshage, Tim; Geist, Christoph; Wagenpfeil, Stefan; Weber, Andreas; Jung, Andreas; Bajbouj, Monther; Pox, Christian; Schneider, Gerhard; Schmid, Roland M; Wehrmann, Till; von Delius, Stefan",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2012.136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22641306/,356

The national testing approach has been insufficient to correctly use this tool in the support of containing the epidemic in the country. In this communication, we discuss efforts and challenges to scale-up COVID-19 testing at the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). This communication presents the initial results of the research project created to investigate the political, industrial, technological, and regulatory aspects that may affect the diagnostic and testing capacity for COVID-19 in Brazil. The paper draws on the review of academic literature, media publication, and collection of public data on tests purchase and regulation. It enlists initiatives to enhance PCR testing, national production and development of technologies, as well as regulatory measures to fast-track new tests. Our analysis indicates some points of reflection. Firstly, the lack of a consistent national strategy to fight COVID-19 exarcebated supply problems of diagnostic components. If the country was eventually able to circumvent this situation, it still faces a more structural dependency on the importation of diagnostic components. Secondly, the discontinued funding and distribution of tests may have implied health policy fragmentation and the growing importance of local governments and non-state actors to fighting the epidemics within SUS. Finally, initiatives established since the second semester of 2020 have expanded the testing capacity at SUS. However, it has not been sufficient to control the progress of the epidemic in the country.","Kameda, Koichi; Barbeitas, Mady Malheiros; Caetano, Rosângela; Löwy, Ilana; Oliveira, Ana Claudia Dias de; Corrêa, Marilena Cordeiro Dias Villela; Cassier, Maurice",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00277420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852667/,356

Hence, we aimed to explore the changes in the number of peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs), and the relationship between these changes and susceptibility to pulmonary infection among children with BPD. METHODS Firstly, the gene expression of lung tissues and the number of PBNs were respectively detected by RNA sequencing and complete blood count in the 85% O2-induced BPD model rats. Then it was analyzed the number of PBNs after birth and the incidence of pneumonia within 6 months of corrected age (CA) after discharge among full-term infants (FTIs: gestational age [GA] between 370/7 and 416/7 weeks, n = 88), preterm infants with (PTIs-BPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 35) or without BPD (PTIs-nBPD: GA <32 weeks, n = 41). RESULTS The levels of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs were significantly decreased in the lungs of BPD rats. Moreover, the number of PBNs was also decreased in BPD rats. The number of PBNs at birth in FTIs was significantly greater than that in PTIs-BPD or in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001), while those between PTIs-BPD and PTIs-nBPD showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Although the peripheral blood neutrophils decreased overall after birth in both PTIs-nBPD and PTIs-BPD groups, only the reduction in the PTIs-BPD group was significant (p < 0.001). Importantly, at 36-37 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA), the number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD was significantly fewer than that in PTIs-nBPD (p < 0.001). In addition, PTIs-BPD had a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia than PTIs-nBPD within 6 months of CA after discharge (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION The number of PBNs in PTIs-BPD decreased progressively when compared to that in PTIs-nBPD, which might contribute to their susceptibility to pulmonary infection.","Li, Xingchao; Wang, Qian; Luo, Ting; Li, Tao",Pediatrics and neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2020.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863167/,356

It is known that several viral infections can increase oxidative stress, which is mainly facilitated by viral-induced imbalances in the antioxidant defence mechanisms of the cell. While the exact role of ROS in certain viral infections (adenovirus and dengue virus) remains unknown, other viruses can use ROS for enhancement of pathogenesis (SARS coronavirus and rabies virus) or replication (rhinovirus, West Nile virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) or both (hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus). While several viral proteins (mainly for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus) have been identified to play a role in ROS formation, most mediators of viral ROS modulation are yet to be elucidated. Treatment of viral infections, including hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus, with ROS inhibitors has shown a decrease in both pathogenesis and viral replication both in vitro and in animal models.

There is however a need for greater coordination, with limited resources and the shifting global nature of the pandemic resulting in a proliferation of research projects underpowered and unable to achieve their aims. Methods: The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), two funder coordination groups have collaborated to develop a live database of funded research projects across the world relating to COVID-19. Drawing data continually from their members and further global funding bodies, as of 15 th January 2021 the database contains 7,778 projects, funded by 101 funders, taking place across 136 countries representing an investment of at least $3.8 billion. To our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive databases. The database is aligned to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus. It is being used by the WHO, governments and multi-lateral policy makers, research funders and researchers.

Three databases were searched and independently screened. Studies were included if they were undertaken in Australia and objectively measured the food retail environment. Sixty papers were included. The broad range of methodological approaches used across studies limited the ability to synthesize the evidence and draw conclusions. Results indicated that there is some evidence that disparities exist in food retail environments across measures of socioeconomic position and geographic area in parts of Australia. Overall, there were inconsistent findings regarding the association between the healthiness of food retail environments and diet or people with obesity.

Efforts to leverage the connection between diet, insects, and gut microbiome primarily focus on how diet alters insect's phenotype or gut microbial composition and relatively few studies have illuminated the link between the diet-induced insect phenotypic difference and variation of gut microbiota. Mirids bugs, Adelphocoris suturalis, are plant sap-feeding omnivores that sometimes complementarily prey on other insects, like aphids (the dietary regime is referred to hereafter as balanced diet). In this study, we found that an imbalanced diet (exclusive ingestion of aphids) induced significantly higher mortality in A. suturalis (86.66%). Further gut microbial community analysis showed that the dietary difference significantly changed both the abundance and composition of the bug's gut microbiome. Most notably, an abundance of entomopathogenic Serratia bacteria in the A. suturalis gut was positively correlated with the proportion of aphids in A. suturalis diet, and Serratia marcescens was found to transfer into the hemocoels of carnivorous bugs. Injection of S. marcescens to the hemocoels further confirmed its detrimental effect to the bugs.

This chapter tackles the shared concerns of artists during the pandemic, particularly on the disruption of their everyday life and their experienced financial loss. Their situation is more deep-seated than just a right to earn a living wage. Herein, this analysis is couched in an understanding of the precarious working conditions of artists in general and within the creative sector, which are more accentuated during such uncertain times. This chapter draws data from an online survey addressed to artists, conducted in March 2020, during a period of increased restrictions on mass events, the normalization of physical distances and imposed lockdown on various sectors of Maltese society. This survey is used here to inform the recommendations made in this chapter - specifically to secure the right for equitable income. Based on these recommendations, which were publicized in the media and discussed with public agencies, including Malta’s economic development agency, this chapter traces the sector’s immediate response on the impact of COVID-19. Subsequently this led to the implementation of “Covid Wage Supplement” - an emergency support to assist workers, including artists, to stay afloat and help the culture sector to withstand the crisis. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

One possible source of sexually dimorphic immunity is sex-specific costs of immune activity or pathology, but little is known about the independent effects of immune-induced versus microbe-induced pathology, and whether these may differ for the sexes. Here, through measuring metabolic and physiological outputs in wild-type and immune-compromised Drosophila melanogaster, we test whether the sexes are differentially impacted by these various sources of pathology and identify a critical regulator of this difference. We find that the sexes exhibit differential immune activity but similar bacteria-derived metabolic pathology. We show that female-specific immune-inducible expression of PGRP-LB, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, enables females to reduce immune activity in response to reductions in bacterial numbers. In the absence of PGRP-LB, females are more resistant of infection, confirming the functional importance of this regulation and suggesting that female-biased immune restriction comes at a cost.","Vincent, Crystal M.; Dionne, Marc S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.247965,356

Unfortunately, it is often a computationally expensive procedure. As the quantity of data and wealth of different assays and applications continue to grow, the need for accurate and fast alignment tools persists. Results In this paper, we introduce PuffAligner, a fast, accurate and versatile aligner built on top of the Pufferfish index. PuffAligner is able to produce highly-sensitive alignments, similar to those of Bowtie2, but much more quickly. While exhibiting similar speed to the ultrafast STAR aligner, PuffAligner requires considerably less memory to construct its index and align reads. PuffAligner strikes a desirable balance with respect to the time, space, and accuracy tradeoffs made by different alignment tools, and provides a promising foundation on which to test new alignment ideas over large collections of sequences. Availability PuffAligner is a free and open-source software.

Because physical contact that occurs daily critically accelerates the spread of this disease, a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was specially designed to control civilians' outdoor social activities through large-scale social distancing methods. Individuals who violate the order will be fined with a compound of not more than RM 1,000 or a jail term of not more than six months or both. This paper presents a mobile application which aims to help civilians control their physical distance towards other individuals, to accelerate social distancing and flatten the curve of increasing cases. In this era where smart devices are largely accessible by people of all backgrounds and age groups, this project can make use of the modern technology that found in the smartphones to notify users and also enable them to monitor the other individuals to avoid physical contact from each other. This project also provides two different types of mediums in order to monitor the distances of users, first mediums is by utilizing the Bluetooth sensor as a beacon that allows users to know if there are other Bluetooth-enabled devices which are too close in contact. Another medium is visually enabling the users to monitor their distance in the physical location based on the camera module through the Augmented Reality.

169132,Identifying regions most likely to contribute to an epidemic outbreak in a human mobility network,2021,"Schools were largely closed in 2020-2021 to counter COVID-19 spread, impacting students' education and well-being. With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe while vaccine hesitancy persists, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school. We used empirical contact data measured in a primary and a secondary school in France, and field estimates for adherence to screening from 683 schools during the spring 2021 wave. Examining different screening protocols, we performed a cost-benefit analysis for varying epidemic conditions and vaccination scenarios. In a partially immunized school population, weekly screening would reduce the number of cases on average by 24% in the primary and 53% in the secondary school compared to symptom-based testing alone, if R=1.3 and 50% adhered to screening. This adherence was met in primary schools (53% (95% confidence interval 21-85%)), but insufficient participation was recorded in secondary schools (10% (1-38%) in middle schools, 6% (2-12%) in high schools). Regular screening would also reduce by 90% the number of student-days lost compared to reactive class closure. No difference was predicted when fully vaccinating teachers, due to their limited number and mixing. Partially vaccinating adolescents would still require regular screening for additional control (20% case reduction with 50% vaccinated students). In the upcoming fall, COVID-19 epidemic will likely continue to pose a risk to the safe opening of schools. Increasing vaccination coverage in adolescents and implementing regular testing while largely incentivizing adherence are essential steps to keep schools open.","Colosi, E.; Bassignana, G.; Contreras, D.

CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and neutralizing antibodies all contribute to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, heterogeneity is a major factor in disease severity and in immune innate and adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2. We performed a deep analysis by flow cytometry of lymphocyte populations of 125 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients on the day of hospital admission. Five clusters of patients were identified using hierarchical classification on the basis of their immunophenotypic profile, with different mortality outcomes. Some characteristics were observed in all the clusters of patients, such as lymphopenia and an elevated level of effector CD8+CCR7- T cells. However, low levels of T cell activation are associated to a better disease outcome; on the other hand, profound CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia, a high level of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation and a high level of CD8+ T-cell senescence are associated with a higher mortality outcome. Furthermore, a cluster of patient was characterized by high B-cell responses with an extremely high level of plasmablasts. Our study points out the prognostic value of lymphocyte parameters such as T-cell activation and senescence and strengthen the interest in treating the patients early in course of the disease with targeted immunomodulatory therapies based on the type of adaptive response of each patient.","Clavarino, G.; Leroy, C.; Epaulard, O.; Raskovalova, T.; Vilotitch, A.; Pernollet, M.; Dumestre-Perard, C.; Defendi, F.; Le Marechal, M.; Le Gouellec, A.; Audoin, P.; Bosson, J.-L.; Poignard, P.; Roustit, M.; Jacob, M.-C.; Cesbron, J.-Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.31.21262538v1?rss=1,356

A natural way of producing the secreted proteins of a cell (secretome) is by culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under starvation or serum deprivation condition. This research was performed to measure the level of Fibroblast Growth Factor-7 (FGF-7), antibacterial protein LL-37 (LL-37), interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1ra), respectively, in the secretome of hWJMSCs. The secretome levels at: non-starvation, 24-, 48-, and 72-hours starvation periods were measured using ELISA method.

Asides transportation of oxygen, fish erythrocytes are capable of several immune defence processes. Nucleated fish erythrocytes represent prime candidates for carrying out ETotic responses. ETosis is an evolutionary conserved innate immune defence process found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, which involves the extrusion of DNA studded with antimicrobial proteins into the extracellular space serving to trap and kill microorganisms. In this report, we demonstrate that fish erythrocytes isolated from Danio rerio (zebrafish) produce ETotic-like responses when exposed to chemical and physiological stimuli. Furthermore, we found Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon) erythrocytes produce similar ETotic responses. We have termed these ET-like formations Fish Erythrocyte Extracellular Traps (FEETs). Interestingly, we discovered that mammalian inducers of NETosis, such as the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, induced FEETs. Moreover, we found that FEETs are dependent upon activation of PKC and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Thus, this brief report represents the first demonstration that fish erythrocytes can exhibit ETotic-like responses, unveiling a previously unknown function of nucleated erythrocytes, which sheds new light on the innate immune arsenal of erythrocytes.","Rinaldi, Giulia; de Haro, Neila Álvarez; Desbois, Andrew P.; Robb, Calum T.; Rossi, Adriano G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455826,356

We identified 45 eligible trials (20,650 patients), 36 (19,350 patients) of which could be included in the network meta-analysis. 27 of 36 trials were rated at high risk of bias, primarily due to lack of blinding. Tocilizumab (20 more per 1000, 15 fewer to 59 more; low certainty) and sarilumab (11 more per 1000, 38 fewer to 55 more; low certainty) alone may not reduce the risk of death. Tocilizumab, in combination with corticosteroids, probably reduces the risk of death compared to corticosteroids alone (35 fewer per 1000, 52 fewer to 18 more; moderate certainty) and sarilumab, in combination with corticosteroids, may reduce the risk of death compared to corticosteroids alone (43 fewer, 73 fewer to 12 more; low certainty). Tocilizumab and sarilumab, both in combination with corticosteroids, may have similar effects (8 more per 1000, 20 fewer to 35 more; low certainty). Conclusion: IL-6 receptor blockers, when added to standard care that includes corticosteroids, in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, probably reduce mortality. Tocilizumab and sarilumab may have similar effectiveness.","Zeraatkar, D.; Cusano, E.; Diaz Martinez, J. P.; Qasim, A.; Mangala, S. O.; Kum, E.; Bartoszko, J.

Success in the battle against COVID-19 depends on public adherence to control measures. Their adherence is greatly affected by their knowledge, perceptions, and practices;therefore, the aim of this study was to assess and understand the knowledge, perceptions, practices, and trusted information sources of COVID-19 among Irish residents. A quantitative survey was performed by means of an online questionnaire, which comprised five sections to collect data regarding demographics, knowledge, perceptions, practices, and information sources. A total of 1007 participants completed the online survey between February and March 2021. The majority of respondents (69.4% female and 30.3% male) had a correct rate of knowledge (88%) and practices (68.1%), with health organisations being the most trusted information source (70.7%);87.4% understand good mask etiquette. Only 53.7% agreed that closing schools or mass gathering events are an effective way to reduce the spread of the virus, while 81.3% are aware that COVID-19 is more severe than the flu;64% of respondents said that the pandemic has negatively affected their mental health. It was observed that a higher level of knowledge is positively correlated with good practices. The study concludes that most of the respondents have shown a good level of knowledge and right practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the higher the level of knowledge of individuals, the better the COVID-19 safety practices are that they perform. It has been observed that the continuous improvement on an individual’s level of knowledge of COVID-19 is essential to maintain good safety practices and reduce the spread.","Temple, Emma Jaiswal Amit K.; Jaiswal, Swarna",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010015,356

Patients and methods: A systematic literature search was conducted from inception until May 15, 2021. Patients with a validated diagnosis of COVID-19 and receiving PP were included. Various factors, including intensive care unit (ICU) or non-ICU setup, mode of oxygen therapy, outcome, duration of proning, and limitations, were noted. Results: We retrieved 36 articles with a total of 1,385 patients for qualitative analysis. Out of 36 articles, there were 17 original articles, 09 case series, and 10 case reports. Out of 1,385 participants, 78.9% (n = 1,093) and 21.0% (n = 292) of patients were managed in ICU and non-ICU setup, respectively. Awake PP with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was found to be a promising technique;however, the result was inconclusive with helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). No study has evaluated the optimal duration of awake PP and the associated long-term outcomes. Conclusion: We encourage the use of early awake self-proning in the management of COVID19 disease. However, the evidence in terms of its use in non-ICU setup, the optimal duration of PP, and various oxygenation devices are insufficient, thereby mandating further well-designed multicentric studies to evaluate its efficacy as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia in context to the aforementioned factor.","Chilkoti, G.

Child health experts have stated that school closures may have profound psychosocial consequences for students and need further study. Hypothesis/Purpose: To identify how COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations impacted the health of adolescent athletes. Methods: Adolescent athletes in Wisconsin were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in May 2020 while schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PHQ-9, PFABS and PedsQL scores were compared with historical data (HD) of Wisconsin adolescent athletes (N = 5,231) collected during normal school and sport operations in the years 2016-2018. Results: A total of 3,243 (58% female, Age = 16.1+1.2 yrs., grades 9 - 12) participated in the study. May 2020 participants reported higher (worse) PHQ-9 scores than the HD participants (mean: 8.0 (95%CI: 7.8, 8.2) vs 3.3 (3.1, 3.5), p < 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depression (32.9% vs 9.7%, p < 0.001). May 2020 Participants also reported lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean: 12.2 (95%CI: 11.9, 12.5) vs 24.7 (24.5, 24.9) p < 0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to athletes in the HD group (78.4 (78.0, 78.8) vs. 90.9 (90.5, 91.3) p < 0.001). Females in May 2020 reported increased moderate and severe anxiety percentages than the males in May 2020 (27.7% vs 22.3%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations in Wisconsin were associated with increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased physical activity and quality of life in adolescent athletes. The potential negative health impacts of prolonged school closures and sport cancellations should be taken into account when evaluating steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.","Mc Guine, T.; Biese, K.; Hetzel, S.; Kliethermes, S.; Reardon, C.; Bell, D.; Brooks, M.

To analyse the effect of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular disease, a systematic search of studies published between 2009–2019 was conducted. All the studies that evaluated the effect of vaccination against influenza on cardiovascular events and their outcome were considered. Finally, 30 of the 1147 identified studies were included. These studies show a protective effect of the influenza vaccine on the development of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) and on the worsening of these conditions. Furthermore, the data showed that vaccinated patients have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular pathologies. Influenza vaccination is therefore an effective measure in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases both in patients with established cardiovascular disease and in the population without previous coronary pathology.

176171,Distributed Deep Learning Using Volunteer Computing-Like Paradigm,2021-03-16,"Purpose: Introducing immunity or vaccine passports is one non-pharmaceutical intervention that governments are considering to exempt immune, vaccinated or otherwise risk-free individuals from lockdowns and other public health restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. The primary objective of these documents would be to begin reopening societies, restarting economies and returning to a pre-pandemic normalcy. This article aims to present the start of a conceptual documentary analysis of (proposed and existing) COVID-19 immunity passports in order to more fully center their documentary status within research, considerations and conversations about their potential roles, impacts and implications. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by Paula A. Treichler's argument for the importance of theoretical thought for untangling the socio-cultural phenomena of epidemics, and drawing upon interdisciplinary theories of documentation, identity and public health, combined with recent news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, this article provides a contemporary overview and conceptual analysis of emerging documentary regimes of COVID-19 immunity verification involving immunity or vaccine passports. Findings: Three major interconnected objectives could be fulfilled by immunity passports. First, they would establish and materialize an official identity of COVID-19 immune for people possessing the formal document. Second, they would serve as material evidence establishing and verifying individuals' immunity, vaccination or risk-free status from the coronavirus that would, in term, determine and regulate their movements and other privileges. Third, they would create tangible links between individuals and governments' official or recognized identity category of COVID-19 immune. Immunity passports would, therefore, help enable and enforce governmental authority and power by situating individuals within documentary regimes of COVID-19 immunity verification. Research limitations/implications: In the expanding interdisciplinary literature on COVID-19 immunity passports, sometimes also called certificates, licenses, or passes, there appears to be only minimal reference to their documentary instantiations, whether physical, digital, and/or hybrid documents. As yet, there is not any specific documentary approach to or analysis of immunity passports as kinds of documentation. A documentary approach helps to illuminate and emphasize the materiality of and ontological considerations concerning the coronavirus pandemic and its associated kinds of immunity or vaccination. Social implications: By beginning an exploration of what makes immunity passports thinkable as a public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, this article illuminates these health and identity documents' material implications for, and effects on, individuals and societies. This article, therefore, helps shed light on what immunity passports reveal about the complicated and contested intersections of identity, documentation, public health and socio-political control and discipline. Originality/value: This article contributes the start of a documentary analysis of (proposed and existing) COVID-19 immunity passports in order to more fully center their documentary status within research and conversations about them. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Kosciejew, M.

176262,IATC_deep-mISF: a multi-label classifier for predicting the classes of anatomical therapeutic chemicals by deep learning,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, has a propensity for genetic evolution owing to the low fidelity of its viral polymerase. This evolution results in the emergence of novel variants with different characteristics than their ancestral strain. Several recent reports have described a series of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Some of these have been identified as variants of concern (VOCs), including alpha (B.1.1.7, Clade GRY), beta (B.1.351, Clade GH), gamma (P.1, Clade GR), and delta (B.1.617.2, Clade G). VOCs are likely to have some effect on transmissibility, antibody evasion, and changes in therapeutic or vaccine effectiveness. However, the physiological and virological understanding of these variants remains poor. We demonstrated that these four VOCs exhibited differences in plaque size, thermal stability at physiological temperature, and replication rates. The mean plaque size of beta was the largest, followed by those of gamma, delta, and alpha. Thermal stability, evaluated by measuring infectivity and half-life after prolonged incubation at physiological temperature, was correlated with plaque size in all variants except alpha. However, despite its relatively high thermal stability, alpha’s small plaque size resulted in lower replication rates and fewer progeny viruses. Our findings may inform further virological studies of SARS-CoV-2 variant characteristics, VOCs, and variants of interest. These studies are important for the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPORTANCE The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to persist, due in part to mutations that have resulted in the emergence of different variants. Many of these variants have become more virulent and infectious than their ancestral strain, resulting in an ever-increasing spread. However, our virological understanding of these variants remains poor. Here, we directly compared the plaque size, stability, and replication kinetics of four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern following prolonged incubation at physiological temperatures. Our observations may help to characterize each variant in terms of their interactions with host factors and responses to environmental conditions. We also believe that our evaluations will improve understanding of the emergence of new variants and contribute to controlling their spread.","Jeong, Gi Uk; Yoon, Gun Young; Moon, Hyun Woo; Lee, Wooseong; Hwang, Insu; Kim, Hae Soo; Kim, Kyun-Do; Kim, Chonsaeng; Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Kim, Bum-Tae; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kwon, Young-Chan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462687,356

177607,Improving Sentiment Classification of Restaurant Reviews with Attention-Based Bi-GRU Neural Network,2021,"Health outcomes are frequently shaped by difficult to dissect inter-relationships between biological, behavioral, social, and environmental factors. DNA methylation patterns reflect such multi-variate intersections, providing a rich source of novel biomarkers and insight into disease etiologies. Recent advances in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) enable investigation of DNA methylation over all genomic CpGs, but existing bioinformatic approaches lack accessible system-level tools. Here, we develop the R package Comethyl, for weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of user-defined genomic regions that generates modules of comethylated regions, which are then tested for correlations with sample traits. First, regions are defined by CpG genomic location or regulatory annotation and filtered based on CpG count, sequencing depth, and variability. Next, correlation networks are used to find modules of interconnected nodes using methylation values within the selected regions. Each module containing multiple comethylated regions is reduced in complexity to a single eigennode value, which is then tested for correlations with experimental metadata. Comethyl has the ability to cover the noncoding regulatory regions of the genome with high relevance to interpretation of genome-wide association studies and integration with other types of epigenomic data. We demonstrate the utility of Comethyl on a dataset of male cord blood samples from newborns later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) versus typical development. Comethyl successfully identified an ASD-associated module containing gene regions with brain glial functions.

177864,Automated classification of bat echolocation call recordings with artificial intelligence,2021-06-24,"Background Protein or peptide-based subunit vaccines are promising platforms for combating human cancers and infectious diseases. However, one primary concern regarding subunit vaccines is the relatively weak immune responses induced by proteins or peptides. Therefore, developing novel and effective vaccine adjuvants is critical for the success of subunit vaccines. Modified vaccinia virus (MVA) is a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. In this study, we explored the potential of heat-inactivated MVA (heat-iMVA) as a novel vaccine adjuvant. Methods We co-administered heat-iMVA with a model antigen, chicken ovalbumin (OVA), either intramuscularly or subcutaneously twice, two weeks apart, and analyzed anti-OVA specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleens and skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and serum anti-OVA IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies. We also compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with several known vaccine adjuvants, including complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax, an MF59-like preclinical grade nano-emulsion. In addition, we tested whether co-administration of heat-iMVA plus tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells improves antitumor efficacy in a B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination model. Using Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) or Batf3-deficient mice, we evaluated the contribution of the STING pathway and Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8α DCs in heat-iMVA-induced immunity. Results Co-administration of protein- or peptide-based immunogens with heat-iMVA dramatically enhances Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses. This adjuvant effect of heat-iMVA is dependent on the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response requires Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs). Heat-iMVA infection of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) promoted antigen cross-presentation, whereas live MVA infection did not. RNA-seq analyses revealed that heat-iMVA is a more potent activator of the STING pathway than live MVA. Additionally, combining tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells with heat-iMVA delayed tumor growth and extended the median survival in B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination models. Conclusions Heat-iMVA induces type I interferon (IFN) production and antigen cross-presentation via a STING-dependent mechanism in DCs. Co-administration of heat-iMVA with peptide antigen generates strong Th1-biased cellular and humoral immunity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that heat-iMVA is a safe and potent vaccine adjuvant.","Yang, Ning; Garzia, Aitor; Meyer, Cindy; Tuschl, Thomas; Merghoub, Taha; Wolchok, Jedd D.; Deng, Liang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453449,356

Here, we analyse an ethnically diverse cohort of National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (UK) to assess the association between variants in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 risk. Methods We analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 6,274 participants who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from the UK's 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) for the presence of ACE2 variants and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Findings We identified a splice site variant (rs2285666) associated with increased ACE2 expression with an overrepresentation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to 100KGP controls (p = .015), and in hospitalised European patients relative to outpatients in intra-ethnic comparisons (p = .029). We also compared the prevalence of 288 eQTLs, of which 23 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. The eQTL rs12006793 had the largest effect size (d = 0.91), which decreases ACE2 expression and is more prevalent in controls, thus potentially reducing risk of COVID-19. We identified three novel nonsynonymous variants predicted to alter ACE2 function, and showed that three variants (p.K26R, p.H378R, p.Y515N) alter receptor affinity for the viral Spike (S) protein. Variants p.K26R and p.N720D are more prevalent in the European population (p < .001), but Y497H is less prevalent compared to East Asians (p = .020). Interpretation Our results demonstrate that the spectrum of genetic variants in ACE2 may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and could partially explain the differences in disease susceptibility and severity among different ethnic groups.

Of these events, four were finally classified (if real) as binary black hole (BH) triggers, six as binary neutron star (NS) events, two each of NSBH and Mass Gap triggers, one an unmodelled (Burst) trigger, and the remaining three were subsequently retracted. Thus far, four of these O3 triggers have been formally confirmed as real gravitational wave events. While no likely electromagnetic counterparts to any of these GW events have been identified in the X-ray data (to an average upper limit of 3.60 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} over 0.3-10 keV), or at other wavelengths, we present a summary of all the Swift-XRT observations performed during O3, together with typical upper limits for each trigger observed.

179275,Development of Real-time Diagnosis Framework for Angular Misalignment of Robot Spot-welding System Based on Machine Learning,2020-12-31,"Introduction: Nightmares have been defined as bad dreams that produce awakenings and have content which can be recalled upon awakening. Frequent nightmares have been linked to many negative outcomes, such as depression and suicide. Research has demonstrated that stress can impact the likelihood and frequency of nightmare occurrences. Furthermore, extreme stress (such as trauma) can produce chronically recurring nightmares. Given the rise in societal stress as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, one could expect an increase in nightmares within the general population. With this in mind, our project sought to examine if nightmares are occurring more frequently during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Our project measured sleep quality and disordered symptoms in N = 2,126 undergraduate college students from the years 2017 to 2020 via online surveys. Data from 2020 was only gathered after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic (which was defined as March 11th 2020). Nightmares were assessed with a self-report questionnaire which asked, “have you experienced a nightmare within the past month”, to which respondents could respond with “yes”, “no”, or “unsure”. Prior to this question participants were told a nightmare is being defined as a bad dream that wakes one up and has remembered dream content upon awakening. Frequencies between years were compared using ANOVA techniques. Results: In regard to the percentage of our sample that reported a nightmare during the previous month, the year 2020 was significantly higher (41.1%;F = 10.27, p < 0.001) than all other years assessed (2017 = 27.0%;2018 = 25.3%;2019 = 31.7%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between any of the pre-Covid-19 years. Conclusion: In 2020, A higher percentage of students reported experiencing a nightmare within the past month than any of our other captured years. Given our 2020 data only assessed students post the start of the pandemic, the significant increase of nightmares experienced by our sample could be related to stress produced by the Covid- 19 pandemic. Considering that nightmares have been found related to several negative outcomes, such as depression and suicide, both assessment of, and treatments for nightmares may be especially needed during our current climate.","Youngren, W.; Gratton, M.; Hamilton, N.",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.719,356

Given the high social and economic cost of these viruses, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection. Viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Lysosome delivery is facilitated by non-canonical autophagy pathways that conjugate LC3 to endo-lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal IAV infection of the airways. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.","Wang, Yingxue; Zhang, Weijiao; Jefferson, Matthew; Sharma, Parul; Bone, Ben; Kipar, Anja; Coombes, Janine L.; Pearson, Timothy; Man, Angela; Zhekova, Alex; Bao, Yongping; Tripp, Ralph A; Yamauchi, Yohei; Carding, Simon R.; Mayer, Ulrike; Powell, Penny P.; Stewart, James P.; Wileman, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.15.907873,356

Despite having been central to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for several decades now, Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) seem to only have had limited success in preserving biodiversity and providing environmental benefits due, among other, to farmer-related factors. This paper systematically reviews and quantifies, for the first time, the body of evidence that explores these factors with respect to their influence on land managers’ willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the delivery of biodiversity and environmental features’ protection. Our analysis shows a complex and nuanced picture. Farmers appear generally willing to enrol in AES, with average payment per hectare being around 327 Euros. However, the current evidence base provides few clues on how best that willingness is matched by contract design formats and features more generally. Providing support to farmers and exploring new ways of monitoring compliance emerge as issues worth considering as means of determining compensation in AES. Further, the broader evidence base seems to suggest that wealthier land managers stand to gain more than less wealthy in enroling in AES. However, this alone seems, in the overall, like a quite modest contribution from the body of evidence to inform policy design more broadly. It indeed does seem that we (academia and/or policy) are not yet hitting the right key on how to best match farmers preferences for enroling in AES for the delivery of biodiversity/environmental features A significant leap forward would not simply require an increased quantity of primary studies, but a deeper reflexion on how the complexity of farmers’ preferences is best captured in the design of policy instruments that have to both share common features while being adaptable to context dependent characteristics at the landscape level.

The fact that some individuals contract and clear the SARS-CoV-2 virus without apparent symptoms stands in sharp contrast to the damage that this virus has brought upon more vulnerable populations, including the elderly and patients with chronic conditions or cancer. While the differences in severity of infection between these populations are multifactorial, it is likely that innate immunity provides the underpinning, given its central role in the early response to viral infections. Within two decades, there have been three known coronavirus zoonoses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2), all of which have taken a devastating toll on the human and economic health of affected societies. Unfortunately, with the frequency and diffusion of novel zoonoses, this is unlikely to be our last battle. As we begin the long and daunting recovery from this pandemic, we must take the opportunity to think about how to exploit our innate immune system to better prepare us to fight the next virus.","Angka, Leonard Market Marisa Ardolino Michele Auer Rebecca C.",Journal of Clinical Investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jch40530,356

Although some countries have achieved very swift and successful vaccination campaigns, on a global scale the vast majority of the population is unvaccinated and new variants are proving more resistant to the current set of vaccines.

We show that rapid vaccine updates to target new strains are more effective than slow updates and containing spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions is vital whilst these vaccines are delivered. Finally when measuring the key model inputs, e.g. the rate at which new mutations and variants of concern emerge, is difficult we show how an observable model output, the number of new variants which have been seen, is strongly correlated with the probability the virus is eliminated.","Hughes, E.; Binny, R.

We used the conceptual framework of prosocial behavior during an emergency - behaviors whose primary focus is benefiting others - to examine volunteering during COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an in-depth, mixed-methods cross-sectional survey, from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, of medical students studying at UK medical schools. Data analysis was informed by Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency and aimed to understand students' decision-making processes. Results: A total of 1145 medical students from 36 medical schools completed the survey. While 947 (82.7%) of students were willing to volunteer, only 391 (34.3%) had volunteered. The majority (92.7%) of students understood that they may be asked to volunteer; however, we found that deciding one's responsibility to volunteer was mitigated by a complex interaction between the interests of others and self-interest. Further, concerns revolving around professional role boundaries influenced students' decisions over whether they had the required skills and knowledge to volunteer. Deciding to volunteer depended not only on possession of necessary skills, but also seniority and identification with the nature of volunteering roles offered. Conclusions: We propose two additional domains to Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency that students consider before making their final decision to volunteer. These are 'logistics' - whether it is logistically feasible to volunteer - and 'safety' - whether it is safe to volunteer. This study highlights a number of modifiable barriers to prosocial behavior that medical students encounter and provides suggestions regarding how Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior can be operationalized within educational strategies to address these barriers. Optimizing the process of volunteering can aid healthcare provision and may facilitate a safer volunteering process for all.","Byrne, M. H. V.; Ashcroft, J.; Wan, J. C.

Firstly, we compare the performance of several word-based or alignment-based methods. Secondly, we give a general guideline for choosing the window size and determining the optimal word sizes for several word-based measures at different window sizes. Thirdly, we use a large-scale simulation method to simulate data from the distribution of SK-LD (symmetric Kullback-Leibler discrepancy). These simulated data can be used to estimate the degree of dissimilarity beta between any pair of DNA sequences. RESULTS Our study shows (1) for whole sequence similiarity/dissimilarity identification the window size taken should be as large as possible, but probably not >3000, as restricted by CPU time in practice, (2) for each measure the optimal word size increases with window size, (3) when the optimal word size is used, SK-LD performance is superior in both simulation and real data analysis, (4) the estimate beta of beta based on SK-LD can be used to filter out quickly a large number of dissimilar sequences and speed alignment-based database search for similar sequences and (5) beta is also applicable in local similarity comparison situations. For example, it can help in selecting oligo probes with high specificity and, therefore, has potential in probe design for microarrays.

Methods The SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database and screened, and the sequences with antigenicity ≥0.5 and amino acid number ≥100 were used for epitopes prediction. The Phyre2 server was used to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure, the GalaxyRefine system to optimize the 3D structure, and the SWISS-MODEL system to evaluate the accuracy of the optimized structure. The CTL, Th cells, and sequential B-cell antigen peptide prediction was based on the sequences of proteins, and the structural B-cell antigen peptide prediction on the 3D structures of proteins. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Th cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted by the IEDB database. The sequential B-cell antigen peptide prediction and the structural B-cell antigen peptide prediction were performed by BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B-Cell Epitope Predictor and ElliPro-a structure-based tool for the prediction of epitopes, respectively. Results Twenty seven SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI database. After removing the proteins with antigenicity <0.5 and amino acid number <100, nine proteins were selected for antigen peptide prediction. Finally, 24 epitopes from CTLs, 20 epitopes from Th cells, and 12 sequential epitopes and 16 structural epitopes from B cells were obtained. Conclusion The epitopes obtained can be used for developing multi-epitope SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

This study investigated (i) the rate of HF during the pre-hospital management of patients with multiple injuries and (ii) the effects of pre-hospital tranexamic acid (TxA) administration on the coagulation system. METHODS From 27 trauma patients with pre-hospital an estimated injury severity score (ISS) ≥16 points blood was obtained at the scene and on admission to the emergency department (ED). All patients received 1 g of TxA after the first blood sample was taken. Rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) was performed for both blood samples, and the results were compared. HF was defined as a maximum lysis (ML) >15 % in EXTEM. RESULTS The median (min-max) ISS was 17 points (4-50 points). Four patients (15 %) had HF diagnosed via ROTEM at the scene, and 2 patients (7.5 %) had HF diagnosed via ROTEM on admission to the ED. The median ML before TxA administration was 11 % (3-99 %) vs. 10 % after TxA administration (4-18 %; p > 0.05). TxA was administered 37 min (10-85 min) before ED arrival. The ROTEM results before and after TxA administration did not significantly differ. No adverse drug reactions were observed after TxA administration. DISCUSSION HF can be present in severely injured patients during pre-hospital care. Antifibrinolytic therapy administered at the scene is a significant time saver. Even in milder trauma fibrinogen can be decreased to critically low levels. Early administration of TxA cannot reverse or entirely stop this decrease. CONCLUSIONS The pre-hospital use of TxA should be considered for severely injured patients to prevent the worsening of trauma-induced coagulopathy and unnecessarily high fibrinogen consumption.

Incidence, mortality, and case fatality of SARS were 1.77/100,000, 0.07/100,000, and 3.84% respectively. The mean incubation period was 4.5 days. CONCLUSION The most effective way to control SARS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons-early identification, prompt and effective isolation, and vigorous close contact tracing. Hospital infections among health care workers is critical. Several observations support the hypothesis of an animal origin for the disease.","He, Jian-feng; Xu, Rui-heng; Yu, De-wen; Peng, Guo-wen; Liu, Yong-ying; Liang, Wen-jia; Li, Ling-hui; Guo, Ru-ning; Fang, Yan; Zhang, Xian-chang; Zheng, Hui-zhen; Luo, Hui-ming; Lin, Jin-yan",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12930668/,356
195097,Establish a Real-time Responsible Home Quarantine and Monitoring Management mHealth Platform.,2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected all facets of everyday life including the practice of medicine. Hospital systems and medical practices have evolved to protect patients, physicians, and staff and conserve personal protective equipment and resources. Orthopaedic practices have been specifically affected by social distancing and stay at home guidelines, limiting in-office practice and elective surgery restrictions. This, in turn, has had an effect on resident education. Previous literature has been published regarding how academic programs have adjusted to these changes. However, the effects on smaller orthopaedic residencies with nonacademic faculty has not been discussed. The orthopaedic residency at Baylor University Medical Center of Dallas is a fifteen-resident program with a combination of hospital employed and private practice faculty. We adjusted our resident education in mid-March 2020 to keep residents safe while trying to maximize surgical and clinical education and outside research. GOALS Our goals were to come up with a plan allowed for continuing high-level patient care and resident education while protecting residents and limiting burnout. MODEL We devised a four-team system with five-day call periods. Interactions between teams were strictly minimized. We also moved to a web-based academic curriculum and devised a system for safe resident participation in surgical cases. The model has been adjusted based on attending and resident feedback. CONCLUSION Until we develop effective treatments or vaccination for COVID-19, there is a possibility that it will be an ongoing threat. Resident education must also adapt to the changing environment while continuing to provide residents safe opportunities for patient care, didactic education, and research. We believe we have come up with a sustainable, adaptable model for resident education during this challenging time.","Oguayo, Chris C; Chu, Jennifer; Jones, Alan L",Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

195508,Watch out for measles.,2003,"Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the ileal mucosae from 12 calves infected with Cryptosporidium sp. showed cryptosporidia free in the lumen and attached to epithelium. The attached parasites were interpreted to be extracellular and adherent to the microvillous border of epithelial cells. Stages of the organism included crescentic-free merozoites, trophozoites, schizonts, gametes and oocysts. Attached parasites were detected chiefly at villous tips and all stages were present on a single villus. Attachment sites were characterized by absence or disintegration of microvilli, disorganization of the terminal web and development of a specialized attachment zone. There were increased numbers of lysosomes and irregularities in the nuclear membrane of parasitized epithelial cells. It was concluded that cryptosporidia exist in bovine intestine as extracellular parasites and cause epithelial changes that in turn probably cause or contribute to diarrheal disease.","Pohlenz, J; Bemrick, W J; Moon, H W; Cheville, N F",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/98896/,356

196405,Genomic analysis and geographic visualization of H5N1 and SARS-CoV.,2007,"The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike glycoprotein, S, has been implicated as a major determinant of viral pathogenesis. In the absence of a full-length molecular clone, however, it has been difficult to address the role of individual viral genes in pathogenesis. By using targeted RNA recombination to introduce the S gene of MHV4, a highly neurovirulent strain, into the genome of MHV-A59, a mildly neurovirulent strain, we have been able to directly address the role of the S gene in neurovirulence. In cell culture, the recombinants containing the MHV4 S gene, S4R22 and S4R21, exhibited a small-plaque phenotype and replicated to low levels, similar to wild-type MHV4. Intracranial inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with S4R22 and S4R21 revealed a marked alteration in pathogenesis. Relative to wild-type control recombinant viruses (wtR13 and wtR9), containing the MHV-A59 S gene, the MHV4 S gene recombinants exhibited a dramatic increase in virulence and an increase in both viral antigen staining and inflammation in the central nervous system. There was not, however, an increase in the level of viral replication in the brain. These studies demonstrate that the MHV4 S gene alone is sufficient to confer a highly neurovirulent phenotype to a recombinant virus deriving the remainder of its genome from a mildly neurovirulent virus, MHV-A59. This definitively confirms previous findings, suggesting that the spike is a major determinant of pathogenesis.","Phillips, J J; Chua, M M; Lavi, E; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438865/,356

In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine Fellows conducted a pilot project among CDC veterinarians to identify national veterinary public health workforce concerns and potential policy strategies. METHODS Fellows surveyed a convenience sample (19/91) of public health veterinarians at CDC to identify veterinary workforce recruitment and retention problems faced by federal agencies; responses were categorized into themes. A focus group (20/91) of staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to most important. Participants identified activities to address the three recruitment concerns with the highest combined weight. RESULTS Participants identified the following three highest prioritized problems faced by federal agencies when recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1) lack of awareness of veterinarians' contributions to public health practice, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) employment and training opportunities. Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of public health practice veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary qualifications, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary and human public health. CONCLUSIONS Findings identified multiple barriers that can affect recruitment and retention of veterinarians engaged in public health practice. Next steps should include replicating project efforts among a national sample of public health veterinarians. A committed and determined long-term effort might be required to sustain initiatives and policy proposals to increase U.S. veterinary public health capacity.","Jarman, Dwayne W; Liang, Jennifer L; Luce, Richard R; Wright, Jennifer G; Stennies, Gail M; Bisgard, Kristine M",Public health reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043103/,356

197900,Artificial Intelligence Decision Support for Medical Triage.,2020,"A respiratory variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), designated PRCV-Ind/89, was isolated from a swine breeding stock herd in Indiana. The virus was readily isolated from nasal swabs of pigs of different ages and induced cytopathology on primary porcine kidney cells and and on a swine testicular (ST) cell line. An 8-week-old pig infected oral/nasally with the respiratory variant and a contact pig showed no signs of respiratory or enteric disease. These pigs did not shed virus in feces but did shed the agent from the upper respiratory tract for approximately 2 weeks. Baby pigs from 2 separate litters (2 and 3 days old) also showed no clinical signs following oral/nasal inoculation with PRCV-Ind/89. In a third litter, 5 of 7 piglets (5 days old) infected either oral/nasally or by stomach tube developed a transient mild diarrhea with villous atrophy. However, virus was not isolated from rectal swabs or ileal homogenates of these piglets, and viral antigen was not detected in the ileum by fluorescent antibody staining even though the virus was easily recovered from nasal swabs and lung tissue homogenates. Swine antisera produced against PRCV-Ind/89 or enteric TGEV cross-neutralized either virus. In addition, an anti-peplomer monoclonal antibody, 4F6, that neutralizes TGEV also neutralized the PRCV-Ind/89 isolate. Radioimmunoassays with a panel of monoclonal antibodies indicated that the Indiana respiratory variant and the European PRCV are antigenically similar.","Wesley, R D; Woods, R D; Hill, H T; Biwer, J D","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1965638/,356

202443,Nonlinear control of infection spread based on a deterministic SEIR model,2021,"SRCEK, is a technique for selecting useful channels for affine modeling of a response by PLS. The technique embeds the discrete channel selection problem into the continuous space of predictor preweighting, then employs a Quasi-Newton (or other) optimization algorithm to optimize the preweighting vector. Once the weighting vector has been optimized, the magnitudes of the weights indicate the relative importance of each channel. The relative importances are used to construct n different models, the kth consisting of the k most important channels. The different models are then compared by means of cross validation or an information criterion (e.g. BIC), allowing automatic selection of a `good' subset of the channels. The analytical Jacobian of the PLS regression vector with respect to the predictor weighting is derived to facilitate optimization of the latter. This formulation exploits the reduced rank of the predictor matrix to gain some speedup when the number of observations is fewer than the number of predictors (the usual case for e.g. IR spectroscopy). The method compares favourably with predictor selection techniques surveyed by Forina et. al.","Pav, Steven E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2557v1.pdf,356

The morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are elevated in AD due to multiple pathological changes in AD patients such as the excessive expression of viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and pro-inflammatory molecules, various AD complications including diabetes, lifestyle alterations in AD, and drug-drug interactions. Meanwhile, COVID-19 has also been reported to cause various neurologic symptoms including cognitive impairment that may ultimately result in AD, probably through the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, COVID-19-induced inflammation, long-term hospitalization and delirium, and post-COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis also worsens behavioral symptoms in uninfected AD patients and poses new challenges for AD prevention. In this review, we first introduce the symptoms and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AD. Next, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the aggravating effects of AD on COVID-19 and the underlying mechanisms from molecular to social levels. We also highlight the influence of COVID-19 on cognitive function, and propose possible routes of viral invasion into the brain and potential mechanisms underlying the COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment. Last, we summarize the negative impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on uninfected AD patients and dementia prevention.","Xia, Xiaohuan; Wang, Yi; Zheng, Jialin",Transl Neurodegener,,356

213542,A Logic for Monitoring Dynamic Networks of Spatially-distributed Cyber-Physical Systems,2021-05-24,"A few months ago, the availability of a reliable and cost-effective testing capacity for COVID-19 was a concern for many countries. With the emergence and circulation of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, another layer of challenge can be added for COVID-19 testing at both molecular and serological levels. This is particularly important for the available tests principally designed to target the S gene/protein where multiple mutations have been reported. Herein, the SARS-CoV-2 NP recombinant protein was utilized to develop a simple and reliable COVID-19 NP human IgG ELISA. The optimized protocol was validated against a micro-neutralization (MN) assay, in-house S-based ELISA, and commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The developed assay provides 100% sensitivity, 98.9% specificity, 98.9% agreement, and high overall accuracy with an area under curve equal to 0.9998 ± 0.0002 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.99 to 1.00. The optical density values of positive samples significantly correlated with their corresponding MN titers. The assay specifically detects IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 NP protein and does not cross-detect IgG to the viral S protein. Moreover, it does not cross-react with antibodies related to other coronaviruses (e.g., the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or human coronavirus HKU1). The availability of this reliable COVID-19 NP IgG ELISA protocol is highly valuable for its diagnostic and epidemiological applications.","Faizo, Arwa A.; Alandijany, Thamir A.; Abbas, Ayman T.; Sohrab, Sayed S.; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Tolah, Ahmed M.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Azhar, Esam I.",Diagnostics,,356
213956,"Exploring the Variation of Black and Brown Carbon During COVID-19 lockdown in Megacity Wuhan and its Surrounding Cities, China",2021,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that emerged from Wuhan, China. Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver, and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy, and chicken-pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT-PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over-activated humoral immunity that culminates in end-organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti-platelets, and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.","Garg, Suruchi; Garg, Mandeep; Prabhakar, Nidhi; Malhotra, Pankaj; Agarwal, Ritesh",Dermatol Ther,,356

The most common path - ogens are viruses (47% rotavirus, 29% norovirus, and 14% adenovirus). METHODS: This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed employing the terms ""acute gastro - enteritis children"" AND ""dehydration"" OR ""rehydration"" OR ""prevention,"" and by manual searching (based, for example, on reference lists and expert knowledge), with subsequent evaluation including consideration of the relevant guidelines. RESULTS: The degree of dehydration can be judged from weight loss and other clinical findings. In 17 randomized controlled trials conducted on a total of 1811 children with mild or moderate dehydration, oral rehydration with oral rehydration solution was just as effective as intravenous rehydration with respect to weight gain, duration of diarrhea, and fluid administration, and was associated with shorter hospital stays (weighted mean difference, -1.2 days; 95% confidence interval [-2.38; -0.02]). Oral rehydration therapy failed in 4% of patients [1; 7]. In children who are vomiting or who refuse oral rehydration solution, continuous nasogastric application is just as effective as intravenous rehydration and is the treatment of first choice. CONCLUSION: In Germany, children with mild or moderate dehydration are often hospitalized for intravenous rehydration therapy, despite the good evidence supporting ambulatory oral rehydration. Obstacles to intersectoral care, the nursing shortage, and inadequate reimbursement must all be overcome in order to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and thereby lessen the risk of nosocomial infection.","Posovszky, Carsten; Buderus, Stephan; Classen, Martin; Lawrenz, Burkhard; Keller, Klaus-Michael; Koletzko, Sibylle",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,356

Articles were retrieved until January 8, 2021, by searching in seven electronic databases. The main outcome was all-cause mortality occurred during hospitalization. Data were combined using the general variance-based method on the effect estimate for each study. Separate meta-analyses according to type of COVID-19 patients (hospitalized or intensive care unit [ICU] patients), anticoagulants (mainly heparin), and regimens (therapeutic or prophylactic) were conducted. A total of 29 articles were selected, but 23 retrospective studies were eligible for quantitative meta-analyses. No clinical trial was retrieved. The majority of studies were of good quality; however, 34% did not distinguish heparin from other anticoagulants. Meta-analysis on 25,719 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that anticoagulant use was associated with 50% reduced in-hospital mortality risk (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.62; I 2: 87%). Both anticoagulant regimens (therapeutic and prophylactic) reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality, compared with no anticoagulation. Particularly in ICU patients, the anticoagulant therapeutic regimen was associated with a reduced in-hospital mortality risk (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60; I 2: 58%) compared with the prophylactic one. However, the former was also associated with a higher risk of bleeding (RR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.60-4.00; I 2: 65%). Anticoagulant use, mainly heparin, reduced all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. Due to the higher risk of bleeding at therapeutic doses, the use of prophylactic dosages of anticoagulant is probably to be preferred in noncritically ill COVID-19 patients.","Parisi, Roberta; Costanzo, Simona; Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; de Gaetano, Giovanni; Donati, Maria Benedetta; Iacoviello, Licia",Semin. thromb. hemost,,356

217401,Artificial Intelligence-Based Classification of Chest X-Ray Images into COVID-19 and Other Infectious Diseases,2020,"COVID-19 infection is growing in a rapid rate. Due to unavailability of specific drugs, early detection of (COVID-19) patients is essential for disease cure and control. There is a vital need to detect the disease at early stage and instantly quarantine the infected people. Many research have been going on, however, none of them introduces satisfactory results yet. In spite of its simplicity, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has proven high flexibility in complex classification problems. However, it can be easily trapped. In this paper, a new COVID-19 diagnose strategy is introduced, which is called COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS). The novelty of CPDS is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new hybrid feature selection Methodology (HFSM), which elects the most informative features from those extracted from chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 peoples. HFSM is a hybrid methodology as it combines evidence from both wrapper and filter feature selection methods. It consists of two stages, namely; Fast Selection Stage (FS 2) and Accurate Selection Stage (AS 2). FS 2relies on filter, while AS 2uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a wrapper method. As a hybrid methodology, HFSM elects the significant features for the next detection phase. The second contribution is an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN) classifier, which avoids the trapping problem of the traditional KNN by adding solid heuristics in choosing the neighbors of the tested item. EKNN depends on measuring the degree of both closeness and strength of each neighbor of the tested item, then elects only the qualified neighbors for classification. Accordingly, EKNN can accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on those significant features selected by HFSM technique. Extensive experiments have been done considering the proposed detection strategy as well as recent competitive techniques on the chest CT images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed detection strategy outperforms recent techniques as it introduces the maximum accuracy rate.","Shaban, Warda M.; Rabie, Asmaa H.; Saleh, Ahmed I.; Abo-Elsoud, M.

219853,Efficient and Visualizable Convolutional Neural Networks for COVID-19 Classification Using Chest CT,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) can present with symptoms ranging from none to severe. Thrombotic events occur in a significant number of patients with COVID-19, especially in critically ill patients. This apparent novel form of coagulopathy is termed COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and endothelial derived von Willebrand factor (vWF) may play an important role in its pathogenesis. CONTENT: vWF is a multimeric glycoprotein molecule that is involved in inflammation, primary and secondary hemostasis. Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 have significantly elevated levels of vWF antigen and activity, likely contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis seen in CAC. The high levels of both vWF antigen and activity have been clinically correlated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, the severity of a COVID-19 infection appears to reduce molecules that regulate vWF level and activity such as ADAMT-13 and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, studies have suggested that patients with blood group O (a blood group with lower than baseline levels of vWF) have a lower risk of infection and disease severity compared to other blood groups; however, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of vWF. SUMMARY: CAC is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction with the release of pro-thrombotic factors, such as vWF, needs further examination as a possible important component in the pathogenesis CAC.","Mei, Zhen W; van Wijk, Xander M R; Pham, Huy P; Marin, Maximo J",,,356
219983,Transfer learning approach to Classify the X-ray image that corresponds to corona disease Using ResNet50 pretrained by ChexNet,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems worldwide have implemented telemedicine technologies to respond to the growing need for health care services during these unprecedented times. In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","Alhajri, Noora; Simsekler, Mecit Can Emre; Alfalasi, Buthaina; Alhashmi, Mohamed; AlGhatrif, Majd; Balalaa, Nahed; Al Ali, Maryam; Almaashari, Raghda; Al Memari, Shammah; Al Hosani, Farida; Al Zaabi, Yousif; Almazroui, Shereena; Alhashemi, Hamed; Baltatu, Ovidiu C",JMIR Med Inform,,356

AIMS: This study focuses on socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two-hundred and fourteen residents of Wandsworth, a South West London Borough in the United Kingdom completed an online cross-sectional survey on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. Data were analysed using independent samples t-tests and multiple regression. RESULTS: Middle-aged people reported a less strong social network and more loneliness, anxiety and depression than younger people. People with a long-term health condition reported a less strong social network, more loneliness, more general practitioner (GP) and hospital visits, and poorer mental health than those with no long-term health conditions. People receiving State financial benefits reported less use of public spaces, a less strong social network, more loneliness, more GP and hospital visits and poorer mental health than those not receiving benefits. Greater neighbourhood identification was associated with a stronger social network and better mental health outcomes. Multiple regression analyses showed that, over and above loneliness, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 constitutes an additional precipitant for both depression and anxiety when controlling for other variables. CONCLUSION: As a novel stressor associated with the pandemic, the situational and involuntary perception of being at risk of COVID-19 may be stimulating anxiety and depressive symptomatology, which will need to be managed effectively as resurgences of the disease are predicted and communicated to the general public under growing mistrust and uncertainty.","Jaspal, Rusi; Breakwell, Glynis M",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,356
223140,Filtering DDoS Attacks from Unlabeled Network Traffic Data Using Online Deep Learning,2020-12-12,"The world is currently experiencing the worst health pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918-the COVID-19 pandemic-caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic is the world's third wake-up call this century. In 2003 and 2012, the world experienced two major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing major respiratory tract infections. At present, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for COVID-19. The severe COVID-19 symptoms of hyperinflammation, catastrophic damage to the vascular endothelium, thrombotic complications, septic shock, brain damage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and acute neurological and psychiatric complications are unprecedented. Many COVID-19 deaths result from the aftermath of hyperinflammatory complications, also referred to as the ""cytokine storm syndrome"", endotheliitus and blood clotting, all with the potential to cause multiorgan dysfunction. The sphingolipid rheostat plays integral roles in viral replication, activation/modulation of the immune response, and importantly in maintaining vasculature integrity, with sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) and its cognate receptors (SIPRs: G-protein-coupled receptors) being key factors in vascular protection against endotheliitus. Hence, modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), S1P, and the S1P receptor pathway may provide significant beneficial effects towards counteracting the life-threatening, acute, and chronic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review provides a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease, prospective vaccines, and current treatments. We then discuss the evidence supporting the targeting of SphK/S1P and S1P receptors in the repertoire of COVID-19 therapies to control viral replication and alleviate the known and emerging acute and chronic symptoms of COVID-19. Three clinical trials using FDA-approved sphingolipid-based drugs being repurposed and evaluated to help in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms are discussed.","McGowan, Eileen M; Haddadi, Nahal; Nassif, Najah T; Lin, Yiguang",Int. j. mol. sci.

225036,Hybrid deep learning for detecting lung diseases from X-ray images,2020,"Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively throughout the world, with more than 117 million reported cases and 2.6 million deaths (Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Detecting the virus is the first step in diagnosing the infection, followed by quarantine to prevent transmission. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NP/OP) and saliva are two specimen types that are most often analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by molecular tests that detect viral RNA or by antigen/antibody tests that detect viral proteins and/or the host immune response against the virus. Compared to antigen/antibody tests, molecular tests are highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus. A significant drawback is that specimen collection requirements are specific to each test and cannot be interchanged with another test. Some tests are qualified to be used on NP swabs or saliva, but not both specimen types. Even with NP swabs, a test may be qualified to detect the virus only with swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) but not in other media. These restrictive pre-analytic steps are disadvantageous in that a lab would have to develop and validate different tests for SARS-CoV-2 depending on the specimen type and collection media, with added setup cost, infrastructure, and training requirements. To overcome these problems, we developed and validated a cost-effective multiplex reverse-transcription real-time PCR assay that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in different specimen types. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, can be used to detect the virus in saliva as well as NP swabs collected in different media such as VTM, saline, and commercial preservative fluid, and serves as one test for all applications. The protocol also describes an optimal laboratory setup and unidirectional workflow for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. © 2021 The Authors. Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

225496,Hand Hygiene Video Classification Based on Deep Learning,2021-08-18,"Purpose: The present study examines the linkage between financial literacy and financial fragility during COVID-19. It further examines if financial literacy has a differential impact on financial fragility based on psychological (financial confidence), economic (wealth) and social (race) factors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used nationally representative data of the American working age-group. They collated six different datasets collected at different time-periods to conduct the present study. Based on 2,202 observations, they conducted logistic regression analyses to test the proposed relationships. Findings: The authors find that financial literacy reduces the odds of being financially fragile by 9.1%. Furthermore, they find that financially literate consumers having high financial confidence are less financially fragile during COVID-19. Besides, the adverse impact of financial literacy on financial fragility is more for consumers having more than less wealth. The interaction with race is not significant, suggesting that financial literacy cuts across racial boundaries. Practical implications: Financial fragility is an important factor having numerous deleterious consequences. The authors’ study found that financial confidence, psychological factor and wealth economic factor enhances the negative effect of financial literacy on financial fragility. Banks and financial institutes can develop mechanisms to infuse confidence in individuals during the pandemic to reduce their financial fragility. Policymakers and governments may increase awareness related to debt management practices and design financial literacy interventions to reduce financial fragility among individuals. Originality/value: The study is one of the initial studies to examine the antecedents of financial fragility. Based on a time-lagged data, the authors’ study examines the linkage between financial literacy and financial fragility. Though scholars have investigated financial literacy and its implications, scholarly work in this domain during COVID-19 is at best limited. The study contributes to the literature by testing the effects of boundary conditions that can change financial literacy's impact on financial fragility. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chhatwani, M.; Mishra, S.

227893,Heterogeneous Graph based Deep Learning for Biomedical Network Link Prediction,2021-01-28,"We have shown previously that transplanted bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC), which are a cell fraction rich in hematopoietic stem cells, can activate cerebral endothelial cells via gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction. In the present study, we investigated such cell-cell interaction between mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and cerebral endothelial cells. In contrast to BM-MNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro. The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophage/microglia in stroke mice. The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC. Furthermore, gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC. Our findings indicate that gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSC-mediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the blood-brain barrier in injured brain. Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).","Kikuchi-Taura, Akie; Okinaka, Yuka; Saino, Orie; Takeuchi, Yukiko; Ogawa, Yuko; Kimura, Takafumi; Gul, Sheraz; Claussen, Carsten; Boltze, Johannes; Taguchi, Akihiko",Stem Cells,,356

230105,CovidXrayNet: Optimizing data augmentation and CNN hyperparameters for improved COVID-19 detection from CXR,2021,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) plays a crucial role in the development of adaptive immune response in vertebrates. MHC molecules are cell surface protein complexes loaded with short peptides and recognized by the T-cell receptors (TCR). Peptides associated with MHC are named immunopeptidome. The MHC I immunopeptidome is produced by the proteasome degradation of intracellular proteins. The knowledge of the immunopeptidome repertoire facilitates the creation of personalized antitumor or antiviral vaccines. A huge number of publications on the immunopeptidome diversity of different human and mouse biological samples-plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and solid tissues, including tumors-appeared in the scientific journals in the last decade. Significant immunopeptidome identification efficiency was achieved by advances in technology: the immunoprecipitation of MHC and mass spectrometry-based approaches. Researchers optimized common strategies to isolate MHC-associated peptides for individual tasks. They published many protocols with differences in the amount and type of biological sample, amount of antibodies, type and amount of insoluble support, methods of post-fractionation and purification, and approaches to LC-MS/MS identification of immunopeptidome. These parameters have a large impact on the final repertoire of isolated immunopeptidome. In this review, we summarize and compare immunopeptidome isolation techniques with an emphasis on the results obtained.","Kuznetsov, Alexandr; Voronina, Alice; Govorun, Vadim; Arapidi, Georgij",Molecules (Basel),,356

232206,Using Fractals and Turtle Geometry to Visually Explain the Spread of a Virus to Kids: A STEM Multitarget Activity,2021,"OBJECTIVES: An artificial intelligence model was adopted to identify mild COVID-19 pneumonia from computed tomography (CT) volumes, and its diagnostic performance was then evaluated. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, an atrous convolution-based deep learning model was established for the computer-assisted diagnosis of mild COVID-19 pneumonia. The dataset included 2087 chest CT exams collected from four hospitals between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2020. The true positive rate, true negative rate, receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC) and convolutional feature map were used to evaluate the model. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning model was trained on 1538 patients and tested on an independent testing cohort of 549 patients. The overall sensitivity was 91.5% (195/213; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 89.2-93.9%), the overall specificity was 90.5% (304/336; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 88.0-92.9%) and the general AUC value was 0.955 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and serve as an important supplement to the COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. KEY POINTS: â¢ The implementation of a deep learning model to identify mild COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed to be effective and feasible. â¢ The strategy of using a binary code instead of the region of interest label to identify mild COVID-19 pneumonia was verified. â¢ This AI model can assist in the early screening of COVID-19 without interfering with normal clinical examinations.","Yao, Jin-Cao; Wang, Tao; Hou, Guang-Hua; Ou, Di; Li, Wei; Zhu, Qiao-Dan; Chen, Wen-Cong; Yang, Chen; Wang, Li-Jing; Wang, Li-Ping; Fan, Lin-Yin; Shi, Kai-Yuan; Zhang, Jie; Xu, Dong; Li, Ya-Qing",Eur. radiol,,356

To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory ""cytokine-storm"", a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1ß, and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.","Mills, Richard J; Humphrey, Sean J; Fortuna, Patrick R J; Lor, Mary; Foster, Simon R; Quaife-Ryan, Gregory A; Johnston, Rebecca L; Dumenil, Troy; Bishop, Cameron; Rudraraju, Rajeev; Rawle, Daniel J; Le, Thuy; Zhao, Wei; Lee, Leo; Mackenzie-Kludas, Charley; Mehdiabadi, Neda R; Halliday, Christopher; Gilham, Dean; Fu, Li; Nicholls, Stephen J; Johansson, Jan; Sweeney, Michael; Wong, Norman C W; Kulikowski, Ewelina; Sokolowski, Kamil A; Tse, Brian W C; Devilée, Lynn; Voges, Holly K; Reynolds, Liam T; Krumeich, Sophie; Mathieson, Ellen; Abu-Bonsrah, Dad; Karavendzas, Kathy; Griffen, Brendan; Titmarsh, Drew; Elliott, David A; McMahon, James; Suhrbier, Andreas; Subbarao, Kanta; Porrello, Enzo R; Smyth, Mark J; Engwerda, Christian R; MacDonald, Kelli P A; Bald, Tobias; James, David E; Hudson, James E",Cell,,356

Untargeted use of rapid testing is associated with high direct and indirect costs and will have limited impact on the pandemic if resources are used inefficiently. We suggest using a risk-stratified testing strategy, based on targeted testing directly integrated with the Public Health Service's case and contact tracing management. According to the proposed targeted testing strategy stratified by risk of infection, all persons with acute symptoms of a respiratory infection as well as other population groups with an elevated probability of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be specifically tested to identify ""hidden"" infection networks. The strategy should include a uniform communication strategy for dealing with positive and negative test results, a targeted expansion of access to low-threshold testing opportunities, ensuring timely and free access to the results of confirmatory tests, and integration into an overarching documentation system for evaluation. This integration of a risk-stratified targeted testing strategy into case and contact tracing management embedded in a comprehensive strategy can help to reduce infection rates in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner.","Arnold, Laura; Stratil, Jan",Gesundheitswesen,,356

238300,STELAR: Spatio-temporal Tensor Factorization with Latent Epidemiological Regularization,2021,"INTRODUCTION: An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across the globe since the end of 2019. Shenzhen confirmed its first imported case from Wuhan on 19 January 2020. However, little is known regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in these imported cities. METHODOLOGY: Data of all 417 confirmed cases diagnosed in Shenzhen before 29 February were collected. The epidemiological characteristics of imported and local cases were compared. The resilience to COVID-19 was evaluated by discharge density. RESULTS: All ten districts reported COVID-19 cases by 29 February, including 331 imported and 86 local cases. The Pearson linear correlation model showed the number of confirmed cases (r = 0.990, p < 0.001) as well as incidence of COVID-19 (r = 0.766, p = 0.010) was positively correlated with the gross domestic product of district. Family clusters were more commonly found in local cases. Imported patients had earlier onset (p < 0.001) and diagnosis (p < 0.001), but longer interval from onset to admission (p = 0.030), diagnosis (p = 0.003) and discharge (p = 0.016). Older and severe cases had lower discharge density (0.024 and 0.018, respectively); while cases with subclinical symptoms exhibited higher discharge density (0.052). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients were predominantly imported cases in Shenzhen and the spatial distribution was closely related to district GDP. Imported and local cases differed in the intervals from onset to admission, diagnosis and discharge. Moreover, family-based transmission should not be ignored, especially in local cases.","Li, Zhihui; Wang, Jin; Huang, Jingyi; Lu, Jiahai",J Infect Dev Ctries,,356

METHODS: We reviewed published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, serological studies, and studies of infections in schools. RESULTS: Compared to younger/middle aged adults, susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10y is estimated to be significantly lower, while estimated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y is higher. Serological studies suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. There is some evidence that given limited control measures, SARS-CoV-2 may spread robustly in secondary/high schools, and to a lesser degree in primary schools, with class size possibly affecting that spread. There is also evidence of more limited spread in schools when some mitigation measures are implemented. Several potential biases that may affect these studies are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Mitigation measures should be implemented when opening schools, particularly secondary/high schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish mixing in younger adults, particularly individuals aged 18-35y to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the community.","Goldstein, E; Lipsitch, M; Cevik, M",J. infect. dis,,356

Materials and Methods: After the approval of study protocol by the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed voluntary consent, salivary samples were collected from 96 participants in each group of tobacco chewers with OSCC, tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion, and healthy controls. Salivary protein-bound SA (PBSA) and salivary-free SA (FSA) were measured by Yao et al.'s method of acid ninhydrin reaction, and the data were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. Results: The salivary PBSA and FSA levels in the Groups 1, 2, and 3 participants were 31.17 ± 7.6 mg/dL and 63.45 ± 9.8 mg/dL, 25.45 ± 16.61 mg/dL and 33.18 ± 11.38 mg/dL, and 22.73 ± 3.01 mg/dL and 21.62 ± 8.86 mg/dL, respectively. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased among the tobacco chewers with OSCC patients (Group 1) and tobacco chewers with no premalignant lesions of the oral cavity (Group 2) compared to the healthy controls (Group 3) with P < 0.05 being statistically significant. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. The salivary PBSA was high among Group 1 as compared to the control Group 3; there was however no significant difference in the levels of salivary PBSA between Group 1 and Group 2. There was no significant difference in the PBSA levels between OSCC patients of Group 1 and the tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion in the oral cavity of Group 2. Conclusion: Salivary PBSA and FSA are significantly raised in both tobacco chewers with OSCC and in tobacco chewers with no precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. SA should therefore be used cautiously while considering it as a marker for the early detection of oral cancer. Tobacco can be a crucial confounding factor when SA is used as a biomarker in OSCC since their levels are elevated to some extent even in tobacco chewers without any clinically obvious precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity.","Azeem, Mahnaaz Sultana; Yesupatham, Susanna Theophilus; Mohiyuddin, S M Azeem; Sumanth, V; Ravishankar, S",J Cancer Res Ther,,356
241229,Going virtual,2020,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some medical students devoted themselves to volunteer activities, but it was the first time that they had been exposed to such an infectious disease and they might have experienced fear in the face of the epidemic. We aimed to conduct a timely assessment of the psychological burden and experience on medical student volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales to survey the psychology burden of students in April 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine medical students who signed up for volunteer activities in Chinese from February to April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Results: The detection of depression, anxiety and stress of medical student volunteers were 26.8%, 20.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The volunteer's negative emotions were more pronounced before work and diminished gradually. Most participants expressed no concern about being infected themselves, but worry about family infection. Participant 's motivations for volunteering were primarily their duties as medical students and encouragement from their families/teachers. The vast majority of medical students said they would be willing to work as medical assistants again and this experience would not affect their career choice. Conclusions: Chinese medical student volunteers tended to show negative emotions at the beginning of their work, and then gradually declined, while positive emotions emerged. Most medical students were willing to volunteer as medical assistants when their country needed them due to their sense of responsibility as medical students. This study on the psychological and experiential aspects were derived from Chinese medical student volunteers and might have a significant impact on future public health emergencies in similar settings.","Zhang, K.; Peng, Y.; Zhang, X.; Li, L.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,356

However, the large number of errors in Nanopore genome assembly affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Polishing is a procedure to correct the errors in genome assembly and can improve the reliability of the downstream analysis. However, the performances of the existing polishing methods are still not satisfactory. RESULTS: We developed a novel polishing method, NeuralPolish, to correct the errors in assemblies based on alignment matrix construction and orthogonal Bi-GRU networks. In this method, we designed an alignment feature matrix for representing read-to-assembly alignment. Each row of the matrix represents a read, and each column represents the aligned bases at each position of the contig. In the network architecture, a bi-directional GRU network is used to extract the sequence information inside each read by processing the alignment matrix row by row. After that, the feature matrix is processed by another bi-directional GRU network column by column to calculate the probability distribution. Finally, a CTC decoder generates a polished sequence with a greedy algorithm. We used five real data sets and three assembly tools including Wtdbg2, Flye and Canu for testing, and compared the results of different polishing methods including NeuralPolish, Racon, MarginPolish, HELEN and Medaka. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralPolish achieves more accurate assembly with fewer errors than other polishing methods and can improve the accuracy of assembly obtained by different assemblers.

243773,Classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images using multi-objective differential evolution-based convolutional neural networks,2020,"The rotator cuff is theorized to contribute to force couples required to produce glenohumeral kinematics. Impairment in these force couples would theoretically result in impaired ball-and-socket kinematics. Although less frequently used than traditional kinematic descriptors (e.g., Euler angles, joint translations), helical axes are capable of identifying alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics by quantifying the variability (i.e., dispersion) in axis orientation and position during motion. Consequently, assessing glenohumeral helical dispersion may provide indirect evidence of rotator cuff function. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the extent to which rotator cuff pathology is associated with alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics. Fifty-one participants were classified into one of five groups based on an assessment of the supraspinatus using diagnostic imaging: asymptomatic healthy, asymptomatic tendinosis, asymptomatic partial-thickness tear, asymptomatic full-thickness tear, symptomatic full-thickness tear. Glenohumeral kinematics were quantified during coronal plane abduction using a biplane x-ray system and described using instantaneous helical axes. The degree to which glenohumeral motion coincided with ball-and-socket kinematics was described using the angular and positional dispersion about the optimal helical axis and pivot, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups in angular dispersion. However, symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear had significantly more positional dispersion than asymptomatic individuals with a healthy supraspinatus or tendinosis.

This study aimed to evaluate the demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador by estimating individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine, and by assessing the effect of vaccine attributes (duration of protection and efficacy) and individuals' characteristics on this valuation. The sample used (N = 1,050) was obtained through an online survey conducted from April 2 to April 7, 2020. Two levels of vaccine efficacy (70% and 98%) and two levels of vaccine duration of protection (1 and 20 years) were considered. The willingness to pay estimates were obtained using a double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation format. Survey results show that a very large proportion of individuals (at least 97%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and at least 85% of individuals were willing to pay a positive amount for that vaccine. Conservative estimates of the average WTP values ranged from USD 147.61 to 196.65 and the median WTP from USD 76.9 to 102.5. Only the duration of protection was found to influence individuals' WTP for the vaccine (p < 0.01). On average, respondents were willing to pay 30% more for a COVID-19 vaccine with 20 years of protection relative to the vaccine with 1 year of protection. Regression results show that WTP for the vaccine was associated with income, employment status, the perceived probability of needing hospitalization if contracting the virus causing COVID-19, and region of residence.","Sarasty, Oscar; Carpio, Carlos E; Hudson, Darren; Guerrero-Ochoa, Patricia A; Borja, Ivan",Vaccine,,356

The AM is one of the most well-suited manufacturing technologies for the aerospace industry where lightweight and unique-shaped components are demanded as this technology produces lightweight and cost-efficient aircraft components with unique geometries. The AM also allows manufacturers to release products with a smaller number of components onto the market;enabling rapid prototyping with less material waste compared to subtractive manufacturing processes. Therefore, during the last two decades, this technology has received research interest and has been adopted by the aerospace industry, resulting in a significant AM market share compared to other sectors. The aerospace industry has been one of the dominant sectors of the global AM market and is forecasted to be one of the leading contributors to the rapidly changing and competitive global AM market. This study reviews the assessment of the recent and forecasted future global aerospace AM market, linked with the historic and forecasted data, and the adoption of this technology, historic and forecasted global aerospace AM market trends, and the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the current state of the global aerospace sector. Related charts based on historic and forecasted data are given to summarise the global AM market trends and assessment of AM potential for the aerospace industry in this study.","Altıparmak, Sadettin Cem Xiao Bowen",Journal of Manufacturing Processes,,356

Methods: We have explored the potential role of estrogens in this COVID-19 gendered impact. Results: Estrogens stimulate the humoral response to viral infections, while testosterone and progesterone give an immune suppression of both innate and cell-mediated immune responses. We hypothesise that estrogens, in particular estradiol but also synthetic estrogen such as ethinylestradiol, could protect women from the most serious complications of COVID-19. The use of medications that keep hormonal levels high and stable, such as combined hormonal contraceptive, could therefore play a protective role. These potential benefits overtake the thrombotic risk in healthy women.

The search for newer and better vaccines for TB is an ongoing endeavor and latest results from trials of candidate TB vaccines such as M72AS01 look promising. However, recent encouraging data from BCG revaccination trials in adults combined with studies on mucosal and intravenous routes of BCG vaccination in non-human primate models have renewed interest in BCG for TB prevention. In addition, several well-demonstrated non-specific effects of BCG, for example, prevention of viral and respiratory infections, give BCG an added advantage. Also, BCG vaccination is currently being widely tested in human clinical trials to determine whether it protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or death with detailed analyses and outcomes from several ongoing trials across the world awaited. Through this review, we attempt to bring together information on various aspects of the BCG-induced immune response, its efficacy in TB control, comparison with other candidate TB vaccines and strategies to improve its efficiency including revaccination and alternate routes of administration. Finally, we discuss the future relevance of BCG use especially in light of its several heterologous benefits.","Ahmed, Asma; Rakshit, Srabanti; Adiga, Vasista; Dias, Mary; Dwarkanath, Pratibha; D039,; Souza, George; Vyakarnam, Annapurna",Immunol Rev,,356

254575,A Deep-Learning Diagnostic Support System for the Detection of COVID-19 Using Chest Radiographs: A Multireader Validation Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global health emergency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented challenge to health care workers, who are facing heavy workloads under psychologically difficult situations. Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features, despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness-based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial in Spain. Health care workers providing face-to-face health care to patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (an app targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control app (general recommendations about mental health care) for 2 weeks. The participants were blinded to their group allocation. Data were collected telephonically at baseline and after 2 weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary outcome was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (overall score on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 [DASS-21]). Secondary outcomes were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and DASS-21 individual scale scores. Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). The outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of the treatment allocation. RESULTS: Between May 14 and July 25, 2020, 482 health care workers were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control app (n=234). At 2 weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436/482 participants (90.5%). No significant differences were observed between the groups at 2 weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference -0.04; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.04; P=.15) or in the other outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among health care workers consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (-0.29; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among health care workers receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (-0.25; 95% CI -0.49 to -0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. The mean usability score of PsyCovidApp was high (87.21/100, SD 12.65). After the trial, 208/221 participants in the intervention group (94.1%) asked to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: In health care workers assisting patients with COVID-19 in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control app, reduced mental health problems at 2 weeks only among health care workers receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

Recent publications show that IMID patients and its treatments do not worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with IMID who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection with IMID and those who were not affected. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study, including admitted patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated according to medical criteria and local protocols based on the best available scientific evidence. Clinical data were collected from their electronical clinical history. Statistical analysis determined the differences in the characteristics and clinical outcome of the infection in IMID patients. RESULTS: Of a total number of 612 revised patients, 23 had an IMID and 9 of them were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not observe a correlation between these two disorders. There was a higher frequency of obesity and cardiovascular disease among IMID patients, but without statistical significance. The clinical outcomes were no different between hospitalized IMID and non IMID patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media following of the Public Health Departments of the 50 States of the U.S. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected by visiting the Public Health Department web page for each social media platform. State-level demographics were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention was utilized to collect information regarding the Governance of each State's Public Health Department. Health rankings were collected from ""America's Health Rankings"" 2019 Annual report from the United Health Foundation. The U.S. News and World Report Education Rankings were utilized to provide information regarding the public education of each State. EXPOSURE: Data were pulled on 3 separate dates: first on March 5th (baseline and pre-national emergency declaration (NED) for COVID-19), March 18th (week following NED), and March 25th (2 weeks after NED). In addition, a variable identifying the total change across platforms was also created. All data were collected at the State level. MAIN OUTCOME: Overall, the social media following of the state Public Health Departments was very low. There was a significant increase in the public interest in following the Public Health Departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: With the declaration of National Emergency, there was a 150% increase in overall public following of the State Public Health Departments in the U.S. The increase was most noted in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. The overall following in the pandemic ""hotspots,"" such as New York, California, and Florida, was significantly lower. Interesting correlations were noted between various demographic variables, health, and education ranking of the States and the social media following of their Health Departments. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Social media following of Public Health Departments across all States of the U.S. was very low. Though, the social media following significantly increased during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it still remains low. Significant opportunity exists for Public Health Departments to improve social media use to engage the public better.","Khokhar, Areej; Spaulding, Aaron; Niazi, Zuhair; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Manochakian, Rami; Chanan-Khan, Asher; Niazi, Shehzad; Sher, Taimur",J Prim Care Community Health,,356

Sixty-four Cambodian individuals with laboratory-confirmed infection with asymptomatic or mild/moderate clinical presentation were evaluated for humoral immune response to the viral spike protein and antibody effector functions during acute phase of infection and at 6-9 months follow-up. Antigen-specific B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were characterized, and T cells were interrogated for functionality at late convalescence. Anti-spike (S) antibody titers decreased over time, but effector functions mediated by S-specific antibodies remained stable. S- and nucleocapsid (N)-specific B cells could be detected in late convalescence in the activated memory B cell compartment and are mostly IgG+. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity was maintained to S and membrane (M) protein. Asymptomatic infection resulted in decreased ADCC and frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at late convalescence. Whereas anti-S antibodies correlated with S-specific B cells, there was no correlation between T cell response and humoral immunity.

The rapidly increasing numbers of infected patients and deaths due to COVID-19 disease necessitated declaring it as a global pandemic. Efforts were combined since then to rapidly develop a treatment and/or a vaccine to combat the deadly virus. Drug repurposing approach has been pursued as a temporary management tactic to treat COVID-19 patients. However, reports about the efficacy of many of the used drugs had been controversial with a dire need to keep the ongoing efforts for rapid development of new treatments. Promising data came out pointing to a possible hidden liaison between prostate cancer (PCa) and COVID-19, where androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) used in PCa had been shown to instigate a protective role against COVID-19.

Despite the multiple public health problems in refugee camps and the need to build local capacities to prevent and combat them, University level courses in public health are largely unavailable for refugees. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an innovative two-module blended-learning programme on One Health in Kakuma refugee camp (Kenya). This programme combines: (I) Interdisciplinary and multi-expert MOOC on ""Global Health at the Human-Animal-Ecosystem interface""; (II) peer-to-peer learning involving students from University of Geneva Master of science in Global Health and research collaborations around specific and locally-relevant problems; (III) online mentoring and lecturing by experts from the Institute of Global Health in Kakuma. A total of 67 refugees applied to Module 1; 15 started the Module 1 in October 2017, of these 14 completed it and 6 passed the exams, finally five students started the Module 2 in October 2018 which they all passed in February 2019. Five student-led collaborative projects were developed focusing on the conception of a community-based monitoring system for prevalent diseases in the camp. With such a pedagogic approach, the programme provides an overview on Global Health challenges at the human-animal-ecosystem interface and the importance of the One Health approach, and introduces students to scientific research through interdisciplinary and international collaborations and innovation. The high number of applicants and positive feedback from students in Kakuma show the interest in One Health education in the camp. This learning experience ultimately aims at building local knowledge and capacity fostering ""One Health"" champions to reinforce local and national health system. This framework for One Health education could be potentially scaled up to other camps in Africa and the world.","Bolon, Isabelle; Mason, Jade; O039,; Keeffe, Paul; Haeberli, Philippe; Adan, Hassan Abdi; Karenzi, Joel Makamba; Osman, Ali Abdirahman; Thumbi, Samuel Mwangi; Chuchu, Veronicah; Nyamai, Mutono; Martins, Sara Babo; Wipf, Nadja C; de Castañeda, Rafael Ruiz",One Health,,356
270619,Sensitivity assessment and optimal economic evaluation of a new COVID-19 compartmental epidemic model with control interventions,2021,"During health emergencies, neglect of gender experiences and needs can compromise the outbreak response. Ebola in West Africa and Zika in Latin America had gendered effects that were evident during the crises, yet governments and international organizations failed to prioritize a gender-inclusive response. There is the same risk that gender-inclusive responses and knowledge will continue to be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we examine the drivers of gender exclusion in health emergency response. We ask: where can we locate institutional responsibility for taking gender seriously to inform and improve sustainable disease control? The article addresses this question by turning to feminist institutional theory to explain why gender inclusion in decision-making processes is vital for effective response and post-crisis recovery. We argue that the institutional responsibility to recognize gender within the global health emergency regime lies with the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has neglected to mainstream gender in the policies and practices that it promotes for the prevention and detection of, and response to, infectious disease outbreaks. WHO is in a position to support gender-inclusive practices, but this requires the technical agency to recognize the value of having a gender-inclusive framework to inform outbreak response, financial models, and recovery.

This has caused problems in current facial recognition systems, motivating the development of this research. This manuscript describes the development of a system for recognizing people, even when they are using a face mask, from photographs. A classification model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture and the OpenCv’s face detector is used. Thus, using these stages, it can be identified where the face is and it can be determined whether or not it is wearing a face mask. The FaceNet model is used as a feature extractor and a feedforward multilayer perceptron to perform facial recognition. For training the facial recognition models, a set of observations made up of 13,359 images is generated;52.9% images with a face mask and 47.1% images without a face mask. The experimental results show that there is an accuracy of 99.65% in determining whether a person is wearing a mask or not. An accuracy of 99.52% is achieved in the facial recognition of 10 people with masks, while for facial recognition without masks, an accuracy of 99.96% is obtained.","Talahua, Jonathan S.; Buele, Jorge Calvopiña P.; Varela-Aldás, José",Sustainability,,356

The aim of this review was to analyze the COVID-19 literature with respect to nutritional status and nutrition management in older adults. No studies only on people aged 65+ years were found, and documentation on those 80+ was rare. Age was found to be strongly associated with worse outcomes, and with poor nutritional status. Prevalence of malnutrition was high among severely and critically ill patients. The studies found a need for nutrition screening and management, and for nutrition support as part of follow-up after a hospital stay. Most tested screening tools showed high sensitivity in identifying nutritional risk, but none were recognized as best for screening older adults with COVID-19. For diagnosing malnutrition, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria are recommended but were not used in the studies found. Documentation of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in relation to nutritional status is missing in older adults. Other COVID-19-associated factors with a possible impact on nutritional status are poor appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms. Vitamin D is the nutrient that has attracted the most interest.

Oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible is difficult to reconstruct and ideally, requires free fibular osteomyocutaneous flap. During this time of resource constraint situation, these free flaps are not a great choice, as it increases exposure of both patient and surgical team to the deadly virus. We are describing a novel method of reconstruction after resection of oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible. In this new technique, we have reconstructed central arch defect by hanging bipaddle pectoralis major myocutaneous flap with orbicularis oris muscle using ethylene terephthalate suture. Operative time, early postoperative complications and early cosmetic and functional outcome were assessed. We have used this novel technique in eight patients of T4a oral cancer involving anterior arch of mandible and skin over chin. Mean operative time was 180 min. One patient had minor flap loss with surgical site infection (Clavien-Dindo grade I). In all patients, we were able to discharge all patients on eighth postoperative day. Cosmetic outcome and functional outcomes were mostly satisfactory. All patients were able to oppose their lips without any oral incompetence and drooling. Tongue mobility was good. There was no incidence of 'Andy Gump deformity'. This is a feasible option for reconstructing anterior arch defect in resource- and time-limited setting of COVID 19 pandemic. This technique can also be used in comorbid conditions where it is not advisable to do very long surgery.","Rajan, Shiv; Akhtar, Naseem; Kumar, Vijay; Gupta, Sameer; Misra, Sanjeev; Chaturvedi, Arun; Prakash, Puneet; Azhar, Tashbihul",Indian J Surg Oncol,,356
277574,Adaptive Waveform Design for Interference Mitigation in SAR,2020,"The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the testing of significant numbers of patients. Modeled after those used during a previous bioterrorism disaster and influenza pandemic, the authors present a descriptive report of their drive-through screening center and processes. The authors recommend use of a large parking lot geographically removed from large population centers. Additionally, they recommend either a tent or temporary building to be used for work space and shelter from weather. They utilized a four-step process: Entrance → Registration → Examination → Specimen collection → Instructions → Exit. Patients do not leave their cars during this process. To minimize contact and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), communication is performed either by mobile phone or electronic medical record whenever possible. Temperature is obtained with a contactless thermometer. If the physician strongly suspects COVID-19 during the examination step, the patient is transported to a designated hospital after specimen collection. Test specimens were collected with the car window opened the minimum amount necessary and car ventilation mode on internal circulation. Patients are provided with information about obtaining test results, home quarantine, and anticipatory guidance. Healthcare workers (HCWs) who had direct contact with patients wore the following PPE: N95 respirator, eye shield/face shield/goggles, hooded coverall/gown, and inner and outer gloves. To decrease viral spread and minimize the possibility of specimen contamination, HCWs wore two gowns and two pairs of gloves for patients who required testing; the external gloves/gown were removed and hands disinfected after each patient contact. The authors reported that this process took approximately ten minutes per test, allowing them to screen 100 people per day with a staff of 4-8 HCWs. This is estimated to be 1/3 the amount of time that a typical screening process would take. The authors recommended rotating staff every 1-2 hours if possible, and to ensure that no HCW wore an N95 respirator for longer than four consecutive hours. They also noted the need to be cognizant of relevant environmental issues, such as hot/cold weather, etc., and to adapt the working environment accordingly. Lastly, there must be adequate communication with the public regarding the limitations of the screening center to minimize the number of people who may attempt to use this resource inappropriately. They recommend considering a similar process for other uses such as medication distribution or vaccine administration. Comment: While not a typical research manuscript we would select for Abstracts, this article describes a non-novel approach to a novel viral pandemic. The drive-through screening process has a number of advantages as outlined above, especially as centers begin seeing higher numbers of potential COVID-19 patients. It is important to consider and plan for the unintended consequences of such a program, including how HCWs will handle unexpectedly ill patients and patients arriving by alternative transportation (bike, walking, public transportation). Healthcare leaders considering a drive-through screening option should also consider the heightened emotions and fear that are present during epidemic/pandemic conditions and plan for security accordingly.","Eastin, Travis; Eastin, Carly",J.

While preexisting diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19, it is unclear whether COVID-19 severity is a cause or consequence of diabetes. To mechanistically link COVID-19 to diabetes, we tested whether insulin-producing pancreatic ß cells can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and cause ß cell depletion. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and related entry factors (TMPRSS2, NRP1, and TRFC) are expressed in ß cells, with selectively high expression of NRP1. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infects human pancreatic ß cells in patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and selectively infects human islet ß cells in vitro. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection attenuates pancreatic insulin levels and secretion and induces ß cell apoptosis, each rescued by NRP1 inhibition. Phosphoproteomic pathway analysis of infected islets indicates apoptotic ß cell signaling, similar to that observed in type 1 diabetes (T1D).

278908,Application of composite degradable modified starch-based flocculant on dewatering and recycling properties,2020,"Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 µL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.","de Oliveira, Kézia Gomes; Estrela, Paulo Felipe Neves; Mendes, Geovana de Melo; Dos Santos, Carlos Abelardo; Silveira-Lacerda, Elisângela de Paula; Duarte, Gabriela Rodrigues Mendes",Analyst,,356

Exome sequence data was obtained for 49,953 UK Biobank subjects, of whom 82 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and could be presumed to have severe disease. A weighted burden analysis was carried out using SCOREASSOC to determine whether there were differences between these cases and the other sequenced subjects in the overall burden of rare, damaging variants in ACE2 or TMPRSS2. There were no statistically significant differences in weighted burden scores between cases and controls for either gene. There were no individual DNA sequence variants with a markedly different frequency between cases and controls. Whether there are small effects on severity, or whether there might be rare variants with major effect sizes, would require studies in much larger samples. Genetic variants affecting the structure and function of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins are not the main explanation for why some people develop severe symptoms in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource.","Curtis, David",Hum Hered,,356

With the rapid growth of this global outbreak, psychological disorders or impact among the healthcare nurses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance and worth to be evaluated. Here, we aimed to determine the levels of stress and psychological disorders of nurses who provided nursing care during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 159 nurses who provided healthcare work for COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. The psychological disorders and stress level were assessed via a questionnaire implemented by the mobile app. The results showed that the nurses who worked in the non-critical care ward (general ward in which the invasive medical procedure such as mechanical ventilation is absent) scored significantly higher on the traumatization condition (Pâ<â.05) and stress level (Pâ<â.01) as well as the impact of event scale -revised level (Pâ<â.01) compared with those worked in the critical care ward. In contrast to the previous report, our findings revealed that the future intervention for preventing the mental crisis among the healthcare nurses needs to be focusing on the individuals in the non-critical care ward instead of those in the critical care ward under the spreading of COVID-19.","Xie, Hongling; Cheng, Xiaolin; Song, Xinyu; Wu, Wen; Chen, Jun; Xi, Zuyang; Shou, Kangquan",Medicine (Baltimore),,356

We evaluated patient outcomes among ED patients with a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation measurement. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of ED patients seen at New York University Langone Health during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. We identified ED patients who had a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation. We studied the outcomes of high oxygen requirement (defined as >4 liters per minute) and mechanical ventilation among admitted patients and bounceback admissions among discharged patients. We also performed logistic regression and compared the performance of different ambulatory oxygen saturation cutoffs in predicting these outcomes. RESULTS: Between March 15-April 14, 2020, 6194 patients presented with fever, cough, or shortness of breath at our EDs. Of these patients, 648 (11%) had a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation, of which 165 (24%) were admitted. Notably, admitted and discharged patients had similar initial vital signs. However, the average ambulatory oxygen saturation among admitted patients was significantly lower at 89% compared to 96% among discharged patients (p<0.01). Among admitted patients with an ambulatory oxygen saturation, 30% had high oxygen requirements and 8% required mechanical ventilation. These rates were predicted by low ambulatory oxygen saturation (p<0.01). Among discharged patients, 50 (10%) had a subsequent ED visit resulting in admission. Although bounceback admissions were predicted by ambulatory oxygen saturation at the first ED visit (p<0.01), our analysis of cutoffs suggested that this association may not be clinically useful. CONCLUSION: Measuring ambulatory oxygen saturation can help ED clinicians identify patients who may require high levels of oxygen or mechanical ventilation during admission. However, it is less useful for identifying which patients may deteriorate clinically in the days after ED discharge and require subsequent hospitalization.","Akhavan, Arvin R; Habboushe, Joseph P; Gulati, Rajneesh; Iheagwara, Oluchi; Watterson, Joanna; Thomas, Shawn; Swartz, Jordan L; Koziatek, Christian A; Lee, David C",West J Emerg Med,,356

Therefore, combination therapies may have the potential of alleviating the patient's outcome. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two different combination regimens in improving outcomes of patients infected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patient's data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir. RESULTS: The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.

The aim of this observational study is to explore the impact of healthcare professional involvement on the adherence of patients to an eHealth platform. We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299). In 57% (n = 171) of the patients, the eHealth platform was used in a blended setting, either in hospital (n = 128) or primary care (n = 29). To compare usage of the platform between patients who used the platform independently or with a healthcare professional, we applied propensity score matching and performed adjusted Poisson regression analysis on CCQ-submission rate. RESULTS: Using the eHealth platform in a blended setting was associated with a 3.25 higher CCQ-submission rate compared to patients using the eHealth platform independently. Within the blended setting, the CCQ-submission rate was 1.83 higher in the hospital care group than in the primary care group. CONCLUSION: It is shown that COPD patients used the platform more frequently in a blended care setting compared to patients who used the eHealth platform independently, adjusted for age, sex and disease burden. Blended care seems essential for adherence to eHealth programs in COPD, which in turn may improve self-management.","van Zelst, Cathelijne M; Kasteleyn, Marise J; van Noort, Esther M J; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P M H; Braunstahl, Gert-Jan; Chavannes, Niels H; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M",Respir Res,,356

308054,A discussion on some simple epidemiological models,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the worldwide health community has been able to record a large number of the recovered population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations, which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium state for the coronavirus disease. METHODS: The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as the existence and stability criteria for the disease, using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R0=0) were satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0). RESULTS: With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded. Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor Okhuese, Alexander",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,356

Background: An inflammatory response to the virus has been a suggested mechanism of etiology for ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients with limited evidence from prior studies. Neutrophilto-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easily calculated lab measure indicating an underlying inflammatory process. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study of patients (n=60) admitted with ischemic stroke between late March and early May 2020. All patients were tested for COVID-19 during admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data was collected through electronic medical record review. Results: Nine out of the 60 stroke patients were positive for COVID-19. African-Americans comprised of 55.6% of those that had COVID-19 and stroke and 37.7% of those with only stroke. Stroke patients with COVID-19 had a significantly higher NIHSS [18.4 (8.8)] and NLR [7.3 (4.2) vs 3.8 (2.8);P=0.0137] than those without. Those with COVID-19 also had a significantly higher mortality rate (44.4% vs. 7.6%;p<0.001). Conclusions: We observed a cohort of patients, including a large proportion of AfricanAmericans, who developed ischemic stroke with or without COVID-19. An exaggerated inflammatory response, as indicated by NLR, likely plays a role in stroke severity among COVID-19 patients that concurrently develop ischemic stroke.","Nanavati, H.; Lin, C.; Arevalo, A.; Lin, D.",Neurology,,356

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 17 studies evaluating discontinuation of CPs for MRSA and VRE. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to determine the pooled risk ratios (RR) of preincidence hospital-associated infection rate to postincidence rate. Subgroup analysis was used to assess sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: No significant difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection before and after stopping the CPs was observed (RR, 0.84; 95% confidence internal [CI], 0.71-1.01; Pâ¯=â¯.06). An inverse association was observed between discontinuation of CPs and rates of hospital-associated VRE infection (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; Pâ¯=â¯.005). A subgroup analysis of 6 studies that used chlorhexidine, showed no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-1.00; Pâ¯=â¯.05). In 5 studies that did not use chlorhexidine, there was no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.55-1.88; P= .95). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection before and after removing CPs. Additionally, there were decreased rates of hospital-associated VRE infection following stoppage of CPs.","Kleyman, Robert; Cupril-Nilson, Sophia; Robinson, Kent; Thakore, Shaival; Haq, Furqan; Chen, Liwei; Oyesanmi, Olugbenga; Browning, Kimberly; Pino, Joseph; Mhaskar, Rahul",Am J Infect Control,,356

While most Americans were sheltering in place, nurses headed to work. Many lacked adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), increasing the risk of becoming infected or infecting others. Some health care organizations were not transparent with their nurses; many nurses were gagged from speaking up about the conditions in their workplaces. This study used a descriptive phenomenological design to describe the lived experience of acute care nurses working with limited access to PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unstructured interviews were conducted with 28 acute care nurses via telephone, WebEx, and Zoom. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The major theme, emotional roller coaster, describes the varied intense emotions the nurses experienced during the early weeks of the pandemic, encompassing eight subthemes: scared and afraid, sense of isolation, anger, betrayal, overwhelmed and exhausted, grief, helpless and at a loss, and denial. Other themes include: self-care, 'hoping for the best', 'nurses are not invincible', and 'I feel lucky'. The high levels of stress and mental assault resulting from the COVID-19 crisis call for early stress assessment of nurses and provision of psychological intervention to mitigate lasting psychological trauma.","Iheduru-Anderson, Kechi",Nurs Inq,,356

A total of 357 valid questionnaires were used for structural equation model research. The results indicated that two types of scientific self-efficacy, as indicated by scientific learning ability and scientific learning behavior, were negatively associated with cognitive anxiety. In addition, cognitive anxiety was also negatively correlated to four types of science engagement, as indicated by cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, behavioral engagement, and social engagement through smartphone interactions. These findings provide further evidence for game-based learning promoted by smart phones, contributing to a deeper understanding of the associations between scientific self-efficacy, cognitive anxiety, and science engagement.

324782,Deep Learning for Flight Demand and Delays Forecasting,2020-11-06,"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were among the first drugs repurposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A few in vitro studies confirmed that both drugs exhibited dose dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These observations and the encouraging results from early poorly conducted observational studies created a major hype about the therapeutic potential of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 disease. This was further catalyzed by media and political influences leading to a widespread use of these agents. Subsequent randomized trials revealed lack of efficacy of these agents in improving the outcomes of COVID-19 or in preventing infection in post-exposure prophylaxis studies. Nevertheless, many ongoing trials continue to actively recruit tens of thousands of patients to receive HCQ worldwide. In this perspective, we address the possible mechanisms behind the lack of efficacy and the increased risk of cardiac toxicity of HCQ in COVID-19 disease. For the lack of efficacy, we discuss the fundamental differences of treatment initiation between in vitro and in vivo studies, the pitfalls of the pharmacological calculations of effective blood drug concentrations and related dosing regimens, and the possible negative effect of HCQ on the antiviral type-I interferon response. Although it has been repeatedly claimed that HCQ has a longstanding safety track record for many decades in use, we present counterarguments for this contention due to disease-drug and drug-drug interactions. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and the cumulative epidemiological evidence of HCQ cardiac toxicity.","Kashour, Tarek; Tleyjeh, Imad M.",Med. Hypotheses,,356

In this study, we show in a mouse model of Ehrlichia muris that type 1 T follicular helper (TFH1) cells provide help to CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells via the dual secretion of IL-21 and IFN-Î³ in a CD40/CD40L-dependent manner. TFH1 cell help was delivered in two phases: IFN-Î³ signals were provided early in infection, whereas CD40/CD40L help was provided late in infection. In contrast to T-bet+ T cells, T-bet+ B cells did not develop in the absence of B cell-intrinsic Bcl-6 but were generated in the absence of T-bet. T-bet-deficient memory B cells were largely indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, although they no longer underwent switching to IgG2c. These data suggest that a primary function of T-bet in B cells during ehrlichial infection is to promote appropriate class switching, not lineage specification. Thus, CD11c+ memory B cells develop normally without T-bet but require Bcl-6 and specialized help from dual cytokine-producing TFH1 cells.","Levack, Russell C; Newell, Krista L; Popescu, Maria; Cabrera-Martinez, Berenice; Winslow, Gary M",J. immunol,,356

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is supported by SARS-CoV-2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Italy has been the first European country recording an elevated number of infected forcing the Italian Government to call for total lockdown. The lockdown had the aim to limit the spread of infection through social distancing. The purpose of this study is to analyze how the pandemic has affected the patient's accesses to the Ophthalmological Emergency Department of a tertiary referral center in central-northern Italy, during the lockdown period. The charts of all patients that came to the Emergency Department during the lockdown period (March 10 -May 4, 2020) have been retrospectively collected and compared with those in the same period of 2019 and the period from 15 January- 9 March 2020. A significant reduction of visits during the lockdown has been observed, compared with those of pre-lockdown period (reduction of 65.4%) and with those of the same period of 2019 (reduction of 74.3%). Particularly, during the lockdown, minor and not urgency visits decreased whereas the undeferrable urgency ones increased. These pieces of evidence could be explained by the fear of patients to be infected; but also revealed patients misuse of emergency services.","Posarelli, Chiara; Maglionico, Maria Novella; Covello, Giuseppe; Loiudice, Pasquale; Cipriano, Alessandro; Santini, Massimo; Figus, Michele",PLoS One,,356

Likewise, other viruses of the Coronaviridae family were responsible for causing epidemics earlier. To tackle these viruses, there is a lack of approved antiviral drugs. Therefore, we have developed robust computational methods to predict the repurposed drugs using machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Deep Learning. We used the experimentally validated drugs/chemicals with anti-corona activity and their inhibition efficiencies (IC50/EC50) from 'DrugRepV' repository. The unique entries of SARS-CoV-2 (142), SARS (221), MERS (123), and overall Coronaviruses (414) were subdivided into the training/testing and independent validation datasets, followed by the extraction of chemical/structural descriptors and fingerprints (17968). The highly relevant features were filtered using the recursive feature selection algorithm. The selected chemical descriptors were used to develop prediction models with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.60-0.90 on training/testing. The robustness of the predictive models was further ensured using external independent validation datasets, decoy datasets, applicability domain, and chemical analyses. The developed models were used to predict promising repurposed drug candidates against coronaviruses after scanning the DrugBank. Top predicted molecules for SARS-CoV-2 were further validated by molecular docking against the spike protein complex with ACE receptor. We found potential repurposed drugs namely, Verteporfin, Alatrofloxacin, Metergoline, Rescinnamine, Leuprolide, and Telotristat ethyl with high binding affinity. These computational methods would assist in antiviral drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses.","Rajput, Akanksha; Thakur, Anamika; Mukhopadhyay, Adhip; Kamboj, Sakshi; Rastogi, Amber; Gautam, Sakshi; Jassal, Harvinder; Kumar, Manoj",,,356

We sought to evaluate the demographic and clinical characteristics of cerebral venous thrombosis among patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 6 tertiary care centers in the New York City metropolitan area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 13,500 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 1 and May 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of 13,500 patients with COVID-19, twelve had imaging-proved cerebral venous thrombosis with an incidence of 8.8 per 10,000 during 3 months, which is considerably higher than the reported incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis in the general population of 5 per million annually. There was a male preponderance (8 men, 4 women) and an average age of 49 years (95% CI, 36-62 years; range, 17-95 years). Only 1 patient (8%) had a history of thromboembolic disease. Neurologic symptoms secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the respiratory and constitutional symptoms in 58% of cases, and 75% had venous infarction, hemorrhage, or both on brain imaging. Management consisted of anticoagulation, endovascular thrombectomy, and surgical hematoma evacuation. The mortality rate was 25%.

Although primarily affecting the lungs, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also affects the cardiovascular system. In addition to cardiac effects, e.g. myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial damage, the vasculature is affected in COVID-19, both directly by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and indirectly as a result of a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm. This includes the role of the vascular endothelium in the recruitment of inflammatory leucocytes where they contribute to tissue damage and cytokine release, which are key drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. There is also evidence linking endothelial cells (ECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (i) the expression and function of its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the vasculature; (ii) the prevalence of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (vasculitis) in COVID-19; and (iii) evidence of EC infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with fatal COVID-19. Here, the Working Group on Atherosclerosis and Vascular Biology together with the Council of Basic Cardiovascular Science of the European Society of Cardiology provide a Position Statement on the importance of the endothelium in the underlying pathophysiology behind the clinical presentation in COVID-19 and identify key questions for future research to address.

348404,Lessons from history,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from those caused by common viruses. Early isolation and containment is challenging. Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed. METHODS: Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a ""respiratory surveillance ward"" (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done. Patients could be transferred when SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative on 2 consecutive occasions, 24 hours apart. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1,178 patients were admitted to the RSWs. The mean length-of-stay (LOS) was 1.89 days (SD, 1.23). Among confirmed cases of pneumonia admitted to the RSW, 5 of 310 patients (1.61%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This finding was comparable to the pickup rate from our isolation ward. In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE. In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure. No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Our institution successfully utilized the strategy of an RSW over a 6-week period to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases and to prevent patient-HCW transmission.

In addition to other potential explanations for the few cases and deaths of COVID-19 such as the population socio-demographics, early lockdown measures and the possibility of under reporting, we hypothesize in this mini review that individuals with a recent history of malaria infection may be protected against infection or severe form of COVID-19. Given that both the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) merozoites bind to the cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) immunoglobulin, we hypothesize that the immunological memory against P. falciparum merozoites primes SARS-CoV-2 infected cells for early phagocytosis, hence protecting individuals with a recent P. falciparum infection against COVID-19 infection or severity. This mini review therefore discusses the potential biological link between P. falciparum infection and COVID-19 infection or severity and further highlights the importance of CD147 immunoglobulin as an entry point for both SARS-CoV-2 and P. falciparum into host cells.","Kalungi, Allan; Kinyanda, Eugene; Akena, Dickens Howard; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Bisangwa, Innocent M",Front Immunol,,356

Objective: To determine whether adults with risk factors for COVID-19 complications perceive an elevated chance of complications and undertake fewer higher infection risk behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analysis, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, included civilian noninstitutionalized US adults of wave 18 of the Understanding America Study collected from November 11 to December 9, 2020. Exposures: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-identified medical risk factors for COVID-19 complications and older age. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were perceived percentage chance of infection and hospitalization and death if infected; whether 9 potentially higher infection risk activities were undertaken in the past week and, if so, whether a mask was worn; whether a mask was worn anywhere in the past week; and attitudes toward 12 aspects of mask wearing. Results: In Understanding America Study wave 18 (n = 5910 participants with nonmissing data), the mean age was 48 years, and 52% were women. The response rate was 77%. Adults with 7 of 9 medical risk factors and aged 70 years and older reported a higher perceived chance of complications if infected. Adjusted mean perceived chance of hospitalization if infected ranged from 23.9% (95% CI, 22.2%-25.5%) for those with high blood pressure to 40.4% (95% CI, 34.6%-46.2%) for those with chronic lung disease and was associated with number of medical risk factors: 17.6% (95% CI, 16.4%-18.8%) and 41.8% (95% CI, 38.7%-45.0%) for adults with 0 vs 3 or more medical risk factors, respectively. Fewer potentially higher infection risk activities were undertaken by adults with 3 or more vs 0 risk factors: 2.83 (95% CI, 2.66-2.99) vs 3.12 (95% CI, 3.02-3.22). Wearing a mask sometime last week was nearly universal (90.1%). But during only 1 specific activity (visiting a grocery store or pharmacy) did more than half always wear a mask, and for only 1 activity (visiting a grocery store or pharmacy) was mask wearing more common among adults with 3 or more vs 0 conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional survey study, adults with risk factors for COVID-19 complications reported higher perceived susceptibility to complications. During common activities, including visiting with friends, the majority of adults, including the highly susceptible, did not consistently wear masks.","Schoeni, Robert F; Wiemers, Emily E; Seltzer, Judith A; Langa, Kenneth M",JAMA Netw Open,,356
352020,Covid-19: automatic detection from X-ray images utilizing transfer learning with convolutional neural networks,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as a pandemic that has spread worldwide, affecting 205 countries. The disease affected 1, 40, 43, 176 individuals and caused 5, 97, 583 deaths around the globe. The organism responsible for the cause of disease is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 enters into the cell via receptors present on the cell surface named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Notwithstanding ACE2 receptors acts as a gateway for infection, and most of the cardiovascular patients are treated with the ACE inhibitors. Thus, the role of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may play a critical role in the severity or outcome of disease. Also, the effect of ACE inhibitors varies with the polymorphism in ACE2 receptors present in the individuals. Hence, it is the need of the hour to investigate the mechanisms which could better aid in the treatment of COVID-19-infected cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients.","Sharma, Shruti",Cardiovasc Toxicol,,356

This overview provides an example of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for infection prevention measures in HEMS missions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we describe different methods used by several organizations in Europe and the experience of the Swiss air rescue organization Rega in transporting these patients. Possible benefits of the use of small patient isolation units (PIU) are discussed, including the fact that accompanying medical personnel do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during the transport but can still maintain full access to the patient. Rega has developed and patented its own PIU. This device allows spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients to be transported in pressurized jet cabins, small helicopters and ambulance vehicles, without the need to change between transport units. This PIU is unique, as it remains air-tight even when there is a sudden loss of cabin pressure. CONCLUSION: A wide variety of means are being used for the aeromedical transport of infectious patients. These involve isolating either the patient or the medical crew. One benefit of PIUs is that the means of transport can be easily changed without contaminating the surroundings and while still allowing access to the patient.","Albrecht, Roland; Knapp, Jürgen; Theiler, Lorenz; Eder, Marcus; Pietsch, Urs",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,356
357892,Dynamics of epidemics: Impact of easing restrictions and control of infection spread,2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter in Bronx, NY, the Montefiore Neuroscience Center required rapid and drastic changes when considering the delivery of neurologic care, health and safety of staff, and continued education and safety for house staff. Health care leaders rely on principles that can be in conflict during a disaster response such as this pandemic, with equal commitments to ensure the best care for those stricken with COVID-19, provide high-quality care and advocacy for patients and families coping with neurologic disease, and advocate for the health and safety of health care teams, particularly house staff and colleagues who are most vulnerable. In our attempt to balance these principles, over 3 weeks, we reformatted our inpatient neuroscience services by reducing from 4 wards to just 1, in the following weeks delivering care to over 600 hospitalized patients with neuro-COVID and over 1,742 total neuroscience hospital bed days. This description from members of our leadership team provides an on-the-ground account of our effort to respond nimbly to a complex and evolving surge of patients with COVID in a large urban hospital network. Our efforts were based on (1) strategies to mitigate exposure and transmission, (2) protection of the health and safety of staff, (3) alleviation of logistical delays and strains in the system, and (4) facilitating coordinated communication. Each center's experience will add to knowledge of best practices, and emerging research will help us gain insights into an evidence-based approach to neurologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Correa, Daniel J; Labovitz, Daniel L; Milstein, Mark J; Monderer, Renee; Haut, Sheryl R",Neurology,,356

359908,"The good, the bad, and the ugly in chemical and biological data for machine learning",2020,"Abstract: Introduction: The World Health Organization defined the compulsory need to redirect all educational, research and public health service activities of medical schools to meet all priority health needs, attributing to them this social responsibility role. Due to the emergency situation in the public health system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as a measure of social accountability, remote medical care services and online education were adopted in order to continue following the curricular program and to provide assistance to local city governments. Experience report: Two months before graduation, medical students followed-up on the monitoring of residents and COVID-19 healthcare professionals of forty-three ILPIs (Long-Term Elderly Care Facilities) in the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The medical students made daily telephone calls to all these ILPI units, requesting information, generally from the head nurses and owners, about the main COVID-19 symptoms that were detected in the residents and employees of these facilities. All the collected information was discussed daily with the teacher in charge of mentoring the program, fed into an online database and into a work schedule chart, then relayed to the local Municipal Health Secretariat. A COVID-19 contingency plan was devised by the team, authorized by the Local Health Secretariat and then presented to the ILPIs, aiming to offer them the best guidance throughout the pandemic. Discussion: the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the Health Education System's fragilities, limitations and capacity to adapt to this crisis, thus largely contributing to improving the training of new medical doctors. During the program, medical students faced many challenges, especially regarding the difficulty to contact some ILPIs by telephone, omitted or erroneous information provided by employees in these facilities and delays in reporting suspected cases. In spite of this scenario, daily contact with these facilities allowed the team to identify the ILPIs that were more adequately prepared and the ones that needed auditing and further supervision. Also, this daily contact established a bond between the team and the ILPIs. Conclusion: During the pandemic, it was possible to perform actions according to the logic of social accountability, demonstrating that remote online medical practice is a tool capable of both maintaining interns in contact with the practical aspects of medical care and providing medical assistance to the community and to the local government.","Bertasso, Carolina Pimentel; Guerra, Amanda Cristina Netto; Pereira, Fernanda; Nakazato, Lissa; Delatore, Lara Godela; Anbar Neto, Toufic; Spadacio, Cristiane",Rev. bras. educ. méd,,356

Contamination events can take the form of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats (CBRN) that are often compounded by explosions and trauma (ET). Resuscitation follows the emergency medicine mantra of managing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) to sustain life and regarding contamination gives preference to antidotes (AABCs). The most common schema for PPE is the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) PPE protection levels A, B, C, and D. [1] CBRN threats are common;they have been well documented throughout history. The nature of evolving viruses that cause Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has required the use of PPE by emergency providers to avoid natural or nosocomial inoculation from airborne or contact means.[2] In developed countries like the United States, industrial production, transportation, and storage of chemicals can all be potential areas for accidental exposure. In April 2013, Adair Grain Fertilizer Company in Texas had hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate erupt, which killed 15 people and injured or contaminated 160 others.[1] Foreign terrorists have plagued the globe by causing such acts as the 2013 sarin gas release in Damascus, Syria, where at least 36 persons were required to be evacuated by United Nations emergency providers.[1] Domestic terrorism is also present, for example, in 1984, an Oregon cult released Salmonella typhimurium causing 751 casualties.[3] These historical examples illustrate the ever-present CBR and ET threats worldwide necessitating the need for highly trained and prepared emergency providers.","Sprague, R.

These were subjected to ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), physiochemical properties, molecular docking, in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant studies. The in silico studies indicated lower toxicity with metabolic stability for nearly all the derivatives proving reliability as drug candidates. The comparative antibacterial study against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, also showed a superior inhibition than reference drug and their mono counterparts. The increase in linker alkyl chain length and variation of substituents in indole, further predicted increased inhibition, with maximum value for compound 4o at 50 µg/ml. The in vitro calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA) binding ability of compounds 4c, 4f, 4i, 4l, 4 m, 4n, and 4o was evaluated via ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. A hyperchromic effect was observed with no apparent wavelength shift which predicted for the groove binding mode. A moderate binding constant for 4o, in fluorescence results, confirms groove binding. The molecular docking of 4o with ct-DNA (PDBID:1BNA) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (3CL protease, PDBID:6LU7) prove its efficacy as potential DNA binder and antiviral agent.","Singhal, Sugandha; Khanna, Pankaj; Khanna, Leena",Luminescence,,356

The present paper presents Dash Sylvereye: a new Python library to produce interactive visualizations of primal street networks on top of tiled web maps to fill this gap. Dash Sylvereye can render large street graphs in commodity computers by exploiting WebGL for GPU acceleration. Dash Sylvereye also provides convenient functions to easily import OpenStreetMap street topologies obtained with the OSMnx library. Thanks to its integration with the Dash framework, Dash Sylvereye can be used to develop web dashboards around temporal and multivariate street data by coordinating the various elements of a Dash Sylvereye visualization with other plotting and UI components provided by Dash. We conduct experiments to assess the performance of Dash Sylvereye on a commodity computer in terms of animation CPU time and frames per second. To further illustrate the features of Dash Sylvereye, we also describe a web dashboard application that exploits Dash Sylvereye for the analysis of a SUMO vehicle traffic simulation.","Garcia-Robledo, Alberto; Zangiabady, Mahboobeh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14362v1.pdf,356

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it comprises and has been customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 29, 2020 (one day before submission). Study selection and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect, in patients with COVID-19, of vitamin C versus placebo or no treatment. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will resubmit it to the journal whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 95 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 20 ongoing studies, including 13 randomized trials evaluating vitamin C in COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Case Presentation: A 74-year-old man with epigastric pain, diarrhea and vomiting for one week was treated, based on the routine abdominal treatment protocol. Since all GI symptoms were resistant to therapy, we decided to perform laboratory assays for a more accurate diagnosis of the disease. Considering the persistence of abdominal pain and nausea, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans, as well as endoscopy and colonoscopy, were performed. After performing the chest CT scan, we noticed the involvement of the lungs. The patient did not have any respiratory symptoms, and at the time of his hospitalization, the COVID-19 epidemic had been reported in Iran. With the progression of the disease, he started to experience mild fever (38°C). Using a specific COVID-19 kit, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after precise evaluations. However, without any medications, all of his symptoms subsided after 2-3 weeks. Conclusions: It is important for all physicians to know that some pure GI symptoms, which are resistant to therapy, may be the only symptoms in suspected COVID-19 patients. Timely diagnosis and isolation of these patients can guarantee population to avoid the spread of this highly contagious infection.","Hormati, Ahmad; Shahhamzeh, Alireza; Aminnejad, Reza; Afifian, Mahbobeh; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Jundishapur J.

There are people with disabilities who have culinary businesses which can maintain their business during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was expressed in a seminar which was held by the Community of Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Houses. In the seminar, Sri Arya Ramadani, a person with visual impairment disability and the owner of Ayam Geprek Petukangan business, shared her experiences and strategies for running a culinary business in the pandemic era. The challenge faced by entrepreneurs is the socioeconomic stability against competitors who have similar businesses with other entrepreneurs. However, a strong enthusiasm for learning, a strong mentality, not easy to despair and support from family and community make entrepreneurs able to compete with other similar businesses. Another challenge faced by disability entrepreneurs is the existence of the Covid-19 pandemic, entrepreneurs trying to adapt to crisis situations and developing an Efficiency, Creative and Healthy strategy. The strategy is supported by promotional tactics, including using social media in the form of Instagram, using professional photography services to get quality product photos, establishing relationships with consumers through the WhatsApp media platform, and also not easy to complain about social media. The digital marketing strategy is balanced with the alms strategy, which is believed to bring blessings on its business journey.

The subjects of the study were college students at D University selected by purposeful sampling technique. A semi-structured questionnaire focusing on students' satisfaction and dissatisfaction with emergency remote teaching as well as their desired improvement was distributed online, and a total of 393 student responses were collected for analysis. According to the results of the study, the most common environment and method for participating in classes were student homes and personal laptops. Students noted some positive features of emergency remote teaching such as comfortable educational environments, smooth interactions, and efficient time utilization, while network instability, unilateral interactions, and reduced concentration were shown to be causes of students' complaints. Areas students identified for improvement were closely related to the causes of complaints, such as network stabilization, recorded lecture sharing, and the activation of interactions. The results of this study concluded that college students' educational environments are important, and the quality of interactions can vary depending on the teachers and technology used. Based on the results of this study, an improved and effective emergency remote teaching system maintaining academic achievement similar to traditional classroom teaching can be designed in preparation for any possible future crisis like COVID 19.","Eun Shim, Tae; Yi Lee, Song",Child Youth Serv Rev,,356

Aims: The study aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, assessing the incidence, mortality-related and fatality rate in different countries, in comparison with the worldwide mean. Methods: Data were sourced from the Worldometer surveillance page and from governmental reporting channels. Data were exported and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23.0). Results: In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the testing frequency is heterogeneous between countries, in addition to the reported cases and death. Very few data are available from countries with political instability and security problems (Yemen, Syrian Arab Republic and Sudan), particularly for the testing frequency. Overall, despite similar rates of testing, there was a significantly lower incidence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region versus the rest of the world, in addition to a lower mortality per million-population, particularly in countries with low to moderate testing rates. However, in countries with higher testing than the world average, there is a higher incidence, a lower mortality, but an unexpected higher fatality rate. Conclusion: The overall testing frequency was similar in the Eastern Mediterranean Region compared to the rest of the world; this would be expected to lead to a similar cumulative incidence and case fatality rate. Nevertheless, the average incidence was 70% lower than the rest of the world, and mortality per million-population was lower (90%). Moreover, in Gulf Cooperation Council high-testing countries, a similar case-fatality rate to other countries in the Region was noted, but was higher than the world average, although expected to be lower. Further studies are necessary to explain discrepancies in incidence, mortality and fatality rates among countries; principally, environmental, genetic and managerial reasons should be investigated.","Salameh, Pascale",East Mediterr Health J,,356

The complex goal of improving health status of the citizens of home nations while ensuring the right of health workers to migrate generates policy discussions and decisions that often are not adequately informed by evidence. In times of global public health crises like the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, the need for equitable distribution and adequate training of health workers globally becomes even more pressing. Brugha et al report suboptimal training and working conditions among Irish and foreign medical doctors practicing in Ireland, while predicting large-scale outward migration. We comment on health personnel migration and retention based on our own experience in this area of research. Drawing from our examination of medical migration dynamics from sub-Saharan Africa, we argue for greater consideration of health workforce retention in research and policy related to resource-limited settings. The right to health suggests the need to retain healthcare providers whose education was typically subsidized by the home nation. The right to migrate may conflict with the right to health. Hence, a deeper understanding is needed as to healthcare worker motives based on interactions of psychosocial processes, economic and material determinants, and quality of work environments.","Tankwanchi, Akhenaten Siankam; Hagopian, Amy; Vermund, Sten H",Int. j. health policy manag,,356

METHODS: We performed a chart review of all patients with KD-like illnesses from January 1, 2016, to May 31, 2020, at a tertiary care children's hospital within a larger health system. Relevant symptoms, comorbid illnesses, laboratory results, imaging studies, treatment, and outcomes were reviewed. Descriptive analyses to compare features over time were performed. RESULTS: We identified 81 cases of KD-like illnesses from January 1, 2016, to May 31, 2020. Few clinical features, such as gallbladder involvement, were more prevalent in 2020 than in previous years. A few patients in 2020 required more intensive treatment with interleukin 1 receptor antagonist therapy. There were no other clear differences in incidence, laboratory parameters, number of doses of intravenous immunoglobulin, or outcomes over the years of the study. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in incidence, laboratory parameters, or number of doses of intravenous immunoglobulin required for treatment of KD-like illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with previous years at our institution. Kawasaki disease-like illnesses, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, may not have changed substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Molin, Amber; Kulenthirarajan, Rajesh; Lopez-Peña, Maricarmen; Knuth, Emily; Barillas-Arias, Liliana; Andrews, Shannon L",J. clin. rheumatol,,356

Although fruit flies are a common laboratory model organism of choice, there is relatively little understood about the ethological relationship between flies and ethanol. In this study, we find that when male flies inhabit ethanol-containing food substrates they become more aggressive. We identify a possible mechanism for this behavior. The odor of ethanol potentiates the activity of sensory neurons in response to an aggression-promoting pheromone. Finally, we observed that the odor of ethanol also promotes attraction to a food-related citrus odor. Understanding how flies interact with the complex natural environment they inhabit can provide valuable insight into how different natural stimuli are integrated to promote fundamental behaviors.","Park, Annie; Tran, Tracy; Scheuermann, Elizabeth A; Smith, Dean P; Atkinson, Nigel S",eLife (Cambridge),,356

Hospital readmission rate and ED-visits within 30 days from discharge are considered low-cost quality indicators. This work assesses an indicator of quality of care in a tertiary referral hospital in Argentina, using data available from clinical records. PURPOSE: To estimate the rate of ED-visits and the hospital readmission rate (HRR) after a first hospitalization (First-H), and to identify associated factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients who had a First-H in Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires between 2014-2015. Follow-up occurred from discharge until ED-visit, readmission, death, disaffiliation from health insurance, or 13 months. We present HRR at 30 days and ED-visits rate at 72 h, using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model to explore associated factors, and reporting adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95 %CI. RESULTS: The study comprised 10,598 hospitalizations (median age was 68 years). Of these, 5966 had at least one consultation to the ED during follow up, resulting in a 24 h rate of consultations to ED of 1.51 % (95 %CI 1.29-1.72); at 48 h 3.18 % (95 %CI 2.86-3.54); at 72 h 4.71 % (95 %CI 4.32-5.13). In multivariable models, factors associated for 72 h ED-visits were: age (aHR 1.06), male (aHR 1.14), Charlson Comorbidity Index (aHR 1.16), unscheduled hospitalization (aHR 1.39), prior consultation with the ED (aHR 1.08) and long hospital stay (aHR 1.39). Meanwhile, 2345 patients had at least one hospital readmission (98 % unscheduled), resulting a 24 h rate of 0.5 % (95 %CI 0.42-0.71), at 48 h 0.98 % (95 %CI 0.80-1.18), at 72 h 1.4 % (95 %CI 1.2-1.6); at 30 days 7.7 % (95 %CI 7.2-8.2); at 90 days 13 % (95 %CI 12.4-13.8); and one-year 22.5 % (95 %CI 21.7-23.4). Associated factors for HRR at 30 days were: age (HR 1.16), male (HR 1.09), Charlson comorbidities score (HR 1.27), social service requirement during First-H (HR 1.37), unscheduled First-H (HR 1.16), previous ED-visits (HR 1.03) and length of stay (HR 1.08). CONCLUSION: Priorities efforts to improve must include greater attention to patients' readiness prior discharge, to explore causes of preventable readmissions, and better support for patient self-management.","Giunta, Diego Hernán; Marquez Fosser, Santiago; Boietti, Bruno Rafael; Ación, Laura; Pollan, Javier Alberto; Martínez, Bernardo; Luna, Daniel; Bonella, Maria Belen; Grande Ratti, María Florencia",Int J Med Inform,,356

STUDY DESIGNS: A total of 554 women respondents age 18 to 49 and reside in the United States were recruited using social media between May 16, 2020 and June 16, 2020. Logistic regression models assessed predictors of reporting pandemic-related changes in economic conditions, desire for pregnancy, and contraceptive access. RESULTS: Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Hispanics/Latinx and Black/African Americans have 4 times the odds of experiencing inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing (p < 0.01) during the pandemic; Hispanics/Latinx have twice the odds of experiencing food insecurity (p < 0.05). Inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing was associated with drop in desire to be pregnant (p < 0.01). Despite the 25% of participants who reported a drop in desire for pregnancy, 1 in 6 reported difficulty accessing contraceptives, particularly those who experienced reduced income (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, the pandemic unevenly affected people from different socioeconomic groups. Many simultaneously experienced reduced income, difficulties in accessing contraception, and a greater desire to avoid a pregnancy. This combination of factors increases the chance that people will experience unintended pregnancies. IMPLICATIONS: The pandemic caused economic hardship and an increased desire to postpone or prevent pregnancy at the same time that it created new barriers to contraceptive services. This pattern may lead to a potential net effect of an increase in unintended pregnancy, particularly among people who had difficulty affording food, transportation, and/or housing during the pandemic.","Lin, Tracy Kuo; Law, Rachel; Beaman, Jessica; Foster, Diana Greene",Contraception,,356

This analysis aims to assess activities of early warning alert and response system to COVID-19 at Juanda International Airport on January 2020 and provides recommendations to enhance the system in the future. The method used includes interviewing four informants, studying of documents and directing field-observation by following regular activities of PHO representatives, who supervise, inspect General Declarations, distribute, and collect the Health Alert Card (HAC) and monitor body temperature of travelers. The analysis uses a system approach (input, process, output) and a 4M model with modification by adding time, technology and information variables. Activities in the early warning alert and response system of COVID-19 are in accordance with the Preparedness Guidelines by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. The outputs of reported activities have been classified as appropriate. The HAC form is lacking as a source of COVID-19 surveillance with regards to address information, which often being misinterpreted by travelers. It is necessary to add additional questions regarding the destination address of travelers in Indonesia, and to educate on how to fill in a HAC correctly through a completed example form;communication and direction from Surabaya PHO Class I operatives are also necessary so that the effectiveness of HAC can be maximized.","Nastiti, Rizma Dwi; Artanti, Kurnia Dwi; Faqih, Achmad Faridy",Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat Nasional,,356

To discover the prevalence of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a study was designed using a rapid immunoassay test (carried out between 6 and 22 July 2020), and in addition a cross-sectional survey was conducted on risk factors, symptoms, predisposition for becoming vaccinated, and sources of information about COVID-19. A random sample, stratified by students, faculty, and administrative staff, was selected. The seroprevalence found was 2.64% (39/1479; 95% CI 1.8-3.4), and the adjusted seroprevalence was 2.89% (95% CI 2.1-3.7). The average age of the students was 23.2 years old, and 47.6 years old for staff. In relation to COVID-19, the following was found: 17.7% pauci-symptomatic, 1.3% symptomatic, 5.5% contact with cases, 4.9% confined, and 0.3% PCR positive. More than 90% complied with preventive measures. The proportion willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was 91%. Their sources of information were the Internet (74%) and television (70.1%). They requested that the university offer information (45.1%), training (27%), and provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (26.3%). Lastly, 87.9% would repeat the test.

405306,Multi-Robot Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Navigation,2021-06-24,"Artificial intelligence (AI) as a branch of computer science, the purpose of which is to imitate thought processes, learning abilities and knowledge management, finds more and more applications in experimental and clinical medicine. In recent decades, there has been an expansion of AI applications in biomedical sciences. The possibilities of artificial intelligence in the field of medical diagnostics, risk prediction and support of therapeutic techniques are growing rapidly. The aim of the article is to analyze the current use of AI in nutrients science research. The literature review was conducted in PubMed. A total of 399 records published between 1987 and 2020 were obtained, of which, after analyzing the titles and abstracts, 261 were rejected. In the next stages, the remaining records were analyzed using the full-text versions and, finally, 55 papers were selected. These papers were divided into three areas: AI in biomedical nutrients research (20 studies), AI in clinical nutrients research (22 studies) and AI in nutritional epidemiology (13 studies). It was found that the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was dominant in the group of research on food composition study and production of nutrients. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms were widely used in studies on the influence of nutrients on the functioning of the human body in health and disease and in studies on the gut microbiota. Deep learning (DL) algorithms prevailed in a group of research works on clinical nutrients intake. The development of dietary systems using AI technology may lead to the creation of a global network that will be able to both actively support and monitor the personalized supply of nutrients.","Sak, Jaroslaw; Suchodolska, Magdalena",Nutrients,,356
405915,MultiCheXNet: A Multi-Task Learning Deep Network For Pneumonia-like Diseases Diagnosis From X-ray Scans,2020-08-05,"In the Plasmodium berghei ANKA mouse model of malaria, accumulation of CD8+ T cells and infected RBCs in the brain promotes the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). In this study, we used malaria-specific transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to track evolution of T cell immunity during the acute and memory phases of P. berghei ANKA infection. Using a combination of techniques, including intravital multiphoton and confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, we showed that, shortly before onset of ECM, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations exit the spleen and begin infiltrating the brain blood vessels. Although dominated by CD8+ T cells, a proportion of both T cell subsets enter the brain parenchyma, where they are largely associated with blood vessels. Intravital imaging shows these cells moving freely within the brain parenchyma. Near the onset of ECM, leakage of RBCs into areas of the brain can be seen, implicating severe damage. If mice are cured before ECM onset, brain infiltration by T cells still occurs, but ECM is prevented, allowing development of long-term resident memory T cell populations within the brain. This study shows that infiltration of malaria-specific T cells into the brain parenchyma is associated with cerebral immunopathology and the formation of brain-resident memory T cells. The consequences of these resident memory populations is unclear but raises concerns about pathology upon secondary infection.","Ghazanfari, Nazanin; Gregory, Julia L; Devi, Sapna; Fernandez-Ruiz, Daniel; Beattie, Lynette; Mueller, Scott N; Heath, William R",J. immunol,,356

Total 22 065 subjects were included and randomly divided into 2 groups. The non-intervention group was given health guidance only, while the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) intervention group was given two coordinated TCM in addition to health guidance. The medical instructions were as follows. Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid: oral before meals, 10 mL/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days. Jinhao Jiere Granules: dissolve in boiling water and take after meals, 8 g/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days, followed up for 14 days, respectively. The study found that with the intake of medication, the incidence rate of TCM intervention group was basically maintained at a low and continuous stable level(0.01%-0.02%), while the non-intervention group showed an overall trend of continuous growth(0.02%-0.18%) from 3 to 14 days. No suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case occurred in either group. There were 2 cases of colds in the TCM intervention group and 26 cases in the non-intervention group. The incidence of colds in the TCM intervention group was significantly lower(P&lt;0.05) than that in the non-intervention group. In the population of 16-60 years old, the incidence rate of non-intervention and intervention groups were 0.01% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference of colds incidence between the two groups was statistically significant(P&lt;0.05). In the population older than 60 years old, they were 0.04% and 0.21%, respectively. The incidence of colds in the non-intervention group was higher than that in the intervention group, but not reaching statistical difference. The protection rate of TCM for the whole population was 91.8%, especially for the population of age 16-60(95.0%). It was suggested that TCM intervention(combined use of Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid and Jinhao Jiere Granules) could effectively protect community residents against respiratory diseases, such as colds, which was worthy of promotion in the community. In addition, in terms of safety, the incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions in the TCM intervention group was relatively low, which was basically consistent with the drug instructions.","Yan, Bo-Hua; Jiang, Zhi-Wei; Zeng, Jie-Ping; Tang, Jian-Yuan; Ding, Hong; Xia, Jie-Lai; Qin, Shao-Rong; Jin, Si-Cen; Lu, Yun; Zhang, Na; Wang, Zhi-Hong; Li, Hai-Yan; Sang, Xiao-Ya; Wu, Li-Na; Tang, Shi-Yun; Li, Yan; Tao, Meng-Yao; Wang, Qiao-Ling; Wang, Jun-Dong; Xie, Hong-Yan; Chen, Qi-Yuan; Yang, Sheng-Wen; Hu, Nian-Shuang; Yang, Jian-Qiong; Bao, Xiao-Xia; Zhang, Qiong; Yang, Xiao-Li; Jiang, Chang-Yong; Luo, Hong-Yan; Cai, Zheng-Hua; Yu, Shu-Guang",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,356

Genotype-based personalised nutrition advice may improve nutrition knowledge and enhance behaviour change towards better diet quality compared with conventional recommendations. AIM: To investigate the nutrition knowledge, food choices and diet quality in genotyped and non-genotyped individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three healthy UK adults were recruited using convenience sampling through social networks. The online questionnaire consisted of the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire, the Food Choices Questionnaire, and the EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). FFQ was used to calculate participant diet quality with the Diet Quality Index-International and socio-demographic and anthropometric data. RESULTS: Median general nutrition knowledge, diet variety and diet balance scores were higher in genotyped compared with non-genotyped individuals (71.0 ± 11.0 vs. 61.0 ± 15.0, p = <.001, 18.00 ± 5.00 vs. 15.00 ± 5.00, p = .007 and 2.00 ± 4.00 vs. 0.00 ± 2.00, p = .025, respectively). Pooled sample multiple regression showed that health motive positively influenced while familiarity motive negatively influenced diet quality index scores (ß = .428, t = 4.822, p = <.001 and ß = -.356, t = -4.021, p = .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition knowledge and diet quality indices of balance and variety were higher among genotyped compared with non-genotyped individuals; overall diet quality was similar between groups. This may be due to pandemic-specific factors, such as altered motives of food choice and availability.","Kapellou, Angeliki; Silva, Gabriela; Pilic, Leta; Mavrommatis, Yiannis",Nutr Health,,356

METHODS: Any individual who tested positive for COVID-19 was classified as a confirmed case. Measures were taken to identify the source of infection and trace and quarantine contacts. Serial intervals were estimated and the effective reproduction number was computed. RESULTS: Of the total 18,303 COVID-19 tests performed between January 16, 2020 and March 24, 2020 in Busan, 108 yielded positive results (positive test rate, 0.6%). All confirmed cases were placed in isolation at hospitals. Of the 108 confirmed cases, 59 (54.6%) were female. The most common age group was 20-29 years with 37 cases (34.3%). Regarding symptoms at the time of diagnosis, cough (n=38, 35.2%) and fever (n=34, 31.5%) were most common; 12 cases (11.1%) were asymptomatic. The source of infection was identified in 99 cases (91.7%). A total of 3,223 contacts were identified and quarantined. Household contacts accounted for 196, and the household secondary attack rate was 8.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 12.9). The mean serial interval was estimated to be 5.54 days (95% CI, 4.08 to 7.01). After February 26, (Rt) remained below 1 in Busan. CONCLUSIONS: The early containment strategy implemented in Busan shows that control is possible if outbreaks are of limited scope. In preparation for future outbreaks, public health and healthcare systems should be re-examined and put in a ready state.","Son, Hyunjin; Lee, Hyojung; Lee, Miyoung; Eun, Youngduck; Park, Kyounghee; Kim, Seungjin; Park, Wonseo; Kwon, Sora; Ahn, Byoungseon; Kim, Dongkeun; Kim, Changhoon",Epidemiol Health,,356

To address this problem while maintaining patient safety, this pilot study explored the feasibility of using a wearable headset to live stream teaching ward rounds to remotely based medical students. Methods: Three live streamed teaching ward rounds were delivered to three groups of medical students (n=53) using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device and Microsoft Teams software, and results pooled for analysis. Feedback was gathered from students and instructors using the evaluation of technology-enhanced learning materials (ETELM). Patient feedback was gathered using the Communication Assessment Tool to explore any impact on interpersonal communication. Results: The response rate for the ETELM-learner perceptions was 58% (31/53), 100% for the ETELM-instructor perceptions. Students strongly agreed that the overall quality of the teaching session and instructors was excellent. However, 32% experienced issues with audio or video quality and one remote student reported cyber sickness. The statement 'educational activities encouraged engagement with session materials/content' returned the most varied response. Instructors reported technological problems with delivery while using the HoloLens 2 device and environmental noise in the ward was a disruptive factor. Preparation and skilled facilitation were key to delivering a high-quality teaching session. Patients reacted generally favourably to the technology and no negative effects on interpersonal communication were identified. Conclusion: The experience of live streamed ward rounds was well received by patients, medical students and teaching faculty. However, there remain limitations to the routine use of HoloLens 2 technology in our setting including steep learning curves, hardware costs and environmental factors such as noise and WiFi connectivity. Live streamed ward rounds have potential postpandemic implications for the judicious use of resources, and the possibility for few educationally minded clinicians to teach at scale in a patient-friendly manner. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among the physically active Sicilian population before and during the last seven days of the COVID-19 quarantine. Furthermore, the relation between this parameter and specific demographic and anthropometric variables was analyzed. Methods: 802 Sicilian physically active participants (mean age: 32.27 ± 12.81 years; BMI: 23.44 ± 3.33 kg/m2) were included in the study and grouped based on gender, age and BMI. An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was administered to the participants through an online survey. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results: As expected, we observed a significant decrease of the total weekly energy expenditure during the COVID-19 quarantine (p &lt; 0.001). A significant variation in the MET-min/wk in the before quarantine condition (p = 0.046) and in the difference between before and during quarantine (p = 0.009) was found for males and females. The male group decreased the PA level more than the female one. Moreover, a significant difference in the MET-min/wk was found among groups distributions of BMI (p &lt; 0.001, during quarantine) and of age (p &lt; 0.001, both before and during quarantine). In particular, the highest and the lowest levels of PA were reported by the young and the elderly, respectively, both before and during quarantine. Finally, the overweight group showed the lowest level of PA during quarantine. Conclusion: Based on our outcomes, we can determine that the current quarantine has negatively affected the practice of PA, with greater impacts among males and overweight subjects. In regards to different age groups, the young, young adults and adults were more affected than senior adults and the elderly.","Giustino, Valerio; Parroco, Anna Maria; Gennaro, Antonio; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio; Battaglia, Giuseppe",Sustainability,,356

Moreover, it examined the impact of COVID-19 on audiology practice, and audiologist's knowledge of telehealth as an alternative. DESIGN: A web-based cross-sectional study using a questionnaire consisting of four sections. STUDY SAMPLE: This study engaged 164 audiologists practicing in Jordan and Arab countries. RESULTS: Fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, and fatigue were identified as COVID-19 characteristics by over 80% of the audiologists. Other symptoms were identified by less than half of the audiologists. The audiologists showed limited knowledge regarding measures against COVID-19 transmission. This study revealed the limited availability of infection control measures in many audiologists' workplace. The majority of audiologists stopped working due to the COVID-19 crisis and only 61.6% of the audiologists were familiar with the concepts of tele-audiology and its related aspects. However, most participants were keen to learn more. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed limited knowledge among audiologists regarding some of the COVID-19 characteristics, and limited compliance with the infection control policies. Limited knowledge in the application of telehealth in audiology practice was also shown.","Zaitoun, Maha; Alqudah, Safa; Al Mohammad, Hana",Int J Audiol,,356

However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.","Xiong, Yong; Liu, Yuan; Cao, Liu; Wang, Dehe; Guo, Ming; Jiang, Ao; Guo, Dong; Hu, Wenjia; Yang, Jiayi; Tang, Zhidong; Wu, Honglong; Lin, Yongquan; Zhang, Meiyuan; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Mang; Liu, Yingle; Zhou, Yu; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu",Emerg Microbes Infect,,356

Investigations into the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 may inform ongoing vaccine development efforts and/or provide insights into vaccine efficacy to fight against COVID-19. Evolutionary analysis of 540 genomes spanning 20 different countries/territories was conducted and revealed an increase in the genomic divergence across successive generations. The ancestor of the phylogeny was found to be the isolate from the 2019/2020 Wuhan outbreak. Its transmission was outlined across 20 countries/territories as per genomic similarity. Our results demonstrate faster evolving variations in the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to the isolates from early stages of the pandemic. Genomic alterations were predominantly located and mapped onto the reported vaccine candidates of structural genes, which are the main targets for vaccine candidates. S protein showed 34, N protein 25, E protein 2, and M protein 3 amino acid variations in 246 genomes among 540. Among identified mutations, 23 in S protein, 1 in E, 2 from M, and 7 from N protein were mapped with the reported vaccine candidates explaining the possible implications on universal vaccines. Hence, potential target regions for vaccines would be ideally chosen from the structural regions of the genome that lack high variation. The increasing variations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 together with our observations in structural genes have important implications for the efficacy of a successful universal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Yellapu, Nanda Kumar; Patel, Shachi; Zhang, Bo; Meier, Richard; Neums, Lisa; Pei, Dong; Xia, Qing; Rotich, Duncan; Zimmermann, Rosalyn C; Nissen, Emily; Bell-Glenn, Shelby; Shae, Whitney; Hu, Jinxiang; Chalise, Prabhakar; Chollet-Hinton, Lynn; Koestler, Devin C; Thompson, Jeffery A",,,356

Therefore, the exploration of therapeutic interventions for maintaining the healthy gut microbiome is essential. Although, prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics have been frequently used for modulating gut microbiome composition to healthier side. However, the presence of immunosuppressing organisms in probiotics imposes a risk (mainly associated with their intake). This provides the baseline for exploring another substitute group- ‘Postbiotics’. Postbiotics are non-viable metabolites, and the risks associated with their intake can be minimized as compared to probiotics. In this review, we discuss the development and perturbations associated with the gut microbiome, postbiotic classes, and pleiotropic effects, the efficacy of postbiotics in functional foods, and their potential future perspectives along with knowledge gaps.","Kaur, Simardeep Thukral Steffy Kaur Kaur Preetiman Samota Mahesh Kumar",Future Foods,,356
446837,Synergistic Learning of Lung Lobe Segmentation and Hierarchical Multi-Instance Classification for Automated Severity Assessment of COVID-19 in CT Images,2020-05-08,"INTRODUCTION: Delays in cancer diagnosis arose from the commencement of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) introduced in the UK in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our earlier work predicted this will lead to approximately 3620 avoidable deaths for four major tumour types (breast, bowel, lung, and oesophageal cancer) in the next 5 years. Here, using national population-based modelling, we estimate the health and economic losses resulting from these avoidable cancer deaths. We also compare these with the impact of an equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths to understand the welfare consequences of the different health conditions. METHODS: We estimate health losses using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lost economic productivity using the human capital (HC) approach. The analysis uses linked English National Health Service (NHS) cancer registration and hospital administrative datasets for patients aged 15-84 years, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and oesophageal cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 2010, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2014, and diagnosed with lung cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 31 2012, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2015. Productivity losses are based on the estimation of excess additional deaths due to cancer at 1, 3 and 5 years for the four cancer types, which were derived from a previous analysis using this dataset. A total of 500 random samples drawn from the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Office for National Statistics, stratified by gender, were used to estimate productivity losses for an equivalent number of deaths (n = 3620) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We collected data for 32,583 patients with breast cancer, 24,975 with colorectal cancer, 6744 with oesophageal cancer, and 29,305 with lung cancer. We estimate that across the four site-specific cancers combined in England alone, additional excess cancer deaths would amount to a loss of 32,700 QALYs (95% CI 31,300-34,100) and productivity losses of £103.8million GBP (73.2-132.2) in the next five years. For breast cancer, we estimate a loss of 4100 QALYS (3900-4400) and productivity losses of £23.2 m (18.2-28.6); for colorectal cancer, 15,000 QALYS (14,100-16,000) lost and productivity losses of £35.7 m (22.4-48.7); for lung cancer 10,900 QALYS (9,900-11,700) lost and productivity losses of £38.3 m (14.0-59.9) for lung cancer; and for oesophageal cancer, 2700 QALYS (2300-3,100) lost and productivity losses of £6.6 m (-6 to -17.6). In comparison, the equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths caused approximately 21,450 QALYs lost, as well as productivity losses amounting to £76.4 m (73.5-79.2). CONCLUSION: Premature cancer deaths resulting from diagnostic delays during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK will result in significant economic losses. On a per-capita basis, this impact is, in fact, greater than that of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These results emphasise the importance of robust evaluation of the trade-offs of the wider health, welfare and economic effects of NPI to support both resource allocation and the prioritisation of time-critical health services directly impacted in a pandemic, such as cancer care.","Gheorghe, Adrian; Maringe, Camille; Spice, James; Purushotham, Arnie; Chalkidou, Kalipso; Rachet, Bernard; Sullivan, Richard; Aggarwal, Ajay",Eur J Cancer,,356

Public health agencies and leaders have served as the primary communicators of information related to COVID-19, and a key part of their public outreach has taken place on social media platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the content and engagement of COVID-19 tweets authored by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers. We propose ways for public health accounts to adjust their tweeting practices during public health crises to improve risk communication and maximize engagement. METHODS: We retrieved data from tweets by Canadian public health agencies and decision makers from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020. The Twitter accounts were categorized as belonging to either a public health agency, regional or local health department, provincial health authority, medical health officer, or minister of health. We analyzed trends in COVID-19 tweet engagement and conducted a content analysis on a stratified random sample of 485 tweets to examine the message functions and risk communication strategies used by each account type. RESULTS: We analyzed 32,737 tweets authored by 118 Canadian public health Twitter accounts, of which 6982 tweets were related to COVID-19. Medical health officers authored the largest percentage of COVID-19-related tweets (n=1337, 35%) relative to their total number of tweets and averaged the highest number of retweets per COVID-19 tweet (112 retweets per tweet). Public health agencies had the highest frequency of daily tweets about COVID-19 throughout the study period. Compared to tweets containing media and user mentions, hashtags and URLs were used in tweets more frequently by all account types, appearing in 69% (n=4798 tweets) and 68% (n=4781 tweets) of COVID-19-related tweets, respectively. Tweets containing hashtags also received the highest average retweets (47 retweets per tweet). Our content analysis revealed that of the three tweet message functions analyzed (information, action, community), tweets providing information were the most commonly used across most account types, constituting 39% (n=181) of all tweets; however, tweets promoting actions from users received higher than average retweets (55 retweets per tweet). When examining tweets that received one or more retweet (n=359), the difference between mean retweets across the message functions was statistically significant (P<.001). The risk communication strategies that we examined were not widely used by any account type, appearing in only 262 out of 485 tweets. However, when these strategies were used, these tweets received more retweets compared to tweets that did not use any risk communication strategies (P<.001) (61 retweets versus 13 retweets on average). CONCLUSIONS: Public health agencies and decision makers should examine what messaging best meets the needs of their Twitter audiences to maximize sharing of their communications. Public health accounts that do not currently employ risk communication strategies in their tweets may be missing an important opportunity to engage with users about the mitigation of health risks related to COVID-19.","Slavik, Catherine E; Buttle, Charlotte; Sturrock, Shelby L; Darlington, J Connor; Yiannakoulias, Niko",J Med Internet Res,,356
448209,Dynamic Radial Placement and Routing in Paper Microfluidics,2020,"Particulate matter (PM) is acknowledged to have multiple detrimental effects on human health. In this review, we report literature results on the possible link between outdoor PM and health outcomes with a focus on pulmonary infections and the mechanisms responsible for observed negative effects. PM physical and chemical properties, such as size and chemical composition, as well as major emission sources are described for a more comprehensive view about the role played by atmospheric PM in the observed adverse health effects; to this aim, major processes leading to the deposition of PM in the respiratory tract and how this can pave the way to the onset of pathologies are also presented. From the literature works here reviewed, two ways in which PM can threaten human health promoting respiratory infectious diseases are mostly taken into account. The first pathway is related to an enhanced susceptibility and here we will also report on molecular mechanisms in the lung immune system responsible for the augmented susceptibility to pathogens, such as the damage of mechanical defensive barriers, the alteration of the innate immune response, and the generation of oxidative stress. The second one deals with the relationship between infectious agents and PM; here we recall that viruses and bacteria (BioPM) are themselves part of atmospheric PM and are collected during sampling together with particles of different origin; so, data should be analysed with caution in order to avoid any false cause-effect relation. To face these issues a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory as also evident from the ongoing research about the mechanisms hypothesized for the SARS-CoV-2 airborne spreading, which is still controversial and claims for further investigation. Therefore, we preferred not to include papers dealing with SARS-CoV-2.","Nozza, E; Valentini, S; Melzi, G; Vecchi, R; Corsini, E",Sci Total Environ,,356
448720,Evaluation of deep learning approaches for identification of different corona-virus species and time series prediction,2021,"Quantitative metrics in lung computed tomography (CT) images have been widely used, often without a clear connection with physiology. This work proposes a patient-independent model for the estimation of well-aerated volume of lungs in CT images (WAVE). A Gaussian fit, with mean (Mu.f) and width (Sigma.f) values, was applied to the lower CT histogram data points of the lung to provide the estimation of the well-aerated lung volume (WAVE.f). Independence from CT reconstruction parameters and respiratory cycle was analysed using healthy lung CT images and 4DCT acquisitions. The Gaussian metrics and first order radiomic features calculated for a third cohort of COVID-19 patients were compared with those relative to healthy lungs. Each lung was further segmented in 24 subregions and a new biomarker derived from Gaussian fit parameter Mu.f was proposed to represent the local density changes. WAVE.f resulted independent from the respiratory motion in 80% of the cases. Differences of 1%, 2% and up to 14% resulted comparing a moderate iterative strength and FBP algorithm, 1 and 3 mm of slice thickness and different reconstruction kernel. Healthy subjects were significantly different from COVID-19 patients for all the metrics calculated. Graphical representation of the local biomarker provides spatial and quantitative information in a single 2D picture. Unlike other metrics based on fixed histogram thresholds, this model is able to consider the inter-and intra-subject variability.

There are numerous qPCR assays on the market, some of them for pathogen detection, and the development of new assays still continues. However, what methods are suitable for assay performance validation and which information do they provide? For conclusions based on qPCR data, it is essential to know which capacities and limitations an assay has. This chapter gives an overview of methods for qPCR assay performance validation and the respective insights and how to combine them. Most of those validation methods have been published in connection with the prfA assay, which specifically detects Listeria monocytogenes. Thereby, it could be demonstrated that this assay reliably quantifies even a single copy of the prfA gene and is thus suitable for detection of Listeria monocytogenes.","Witte, Anna Kristina; Mester, Patrick; Rossmanith, Peter",Methods Mol Biol,,356

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study on 61 COVID-19 patients (severe and non-severe; 33 men, age 63+/-15 years) who underwent a CT scan due to tachypnea, dyspnoea or desaturation. QCT was performed using VCAR software. Patients' clinical data was collected, including laboratory results and oxygenation support. The optimal cut-off point for CT parameters for predicting death and respiratory support was performed by maximizing the Youden Index in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed significantly greater progression of changes: ground-glass opacities (GGO) (31,42% v 13,89%, p<0.001), consolidation (11,85% v 3,32%, p<0.001) in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Five lobes were involved in all patients with severe disease. In non-severe patients, a positive correlation was found between severity of GGO, consolidation and emphysema and sex, tachypnea, chest x-ray (CXR) score on admission and laboratory parameters: CRP, D-dimer, ALT, lymphocyte count and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. In the group of severe patients, a correlation was found between sex, creatinine level and death. ROC analysis on death prediction was used to establish the cut-off point for GGO at 24.3% (AUC 0.8878, 95% CI 0.7889-0.9866; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 75.5%), 5.6% for consolidation (AUC 0.7466, 95% CI 0.6009-0.8923; sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 59.2%), and 37.8% for total (GGO+consolidation) (AUC 0.8622, 95% CI 0.7525-0.972; sensitivity 75%, specificity 83.7%). The cut-off point for predicting respiratory support was established for GGO at 18.7% (AUC 0.7611, 95% CI 0.6268-0.8954; sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 64.4%), consolidation at 3.88% (AUC 0.7438, 95% CI 0.6146-0.8729; sensitivity 100%, specificity 46.7%), and total at 23.5% (AUC 0.7931, 95% CI 0.673-0.9131; sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 57.8%). CONCLUSION: QCT is a good diagnostic tool which facilitates decision-making regarding intensification of oxygen support and transfer to an intensive care unit in patients severely ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT can make an independent and simple screening tool to assess the risk of death, regardless of clinical symptoms. Usefulness of QCT to predict the risk of death is higher than to assess the indications for respiratory support.","Rorat, Marta; Jurek, Tomasz; Simon, Krzysztof; Guzinski, Maciej",PLoS One,,356
462049,CAggNet: Crossing Aggregation Network for Medical Image Segmentation,2020-04-16,"To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.","Behl, T.; Rocchetti, G.; Chadha, S.; Zengin, G.; Bungau, S.; Kumar, A.; Mehta, V.; Uddin, M.

466821,Masked Face Recognition: Human vs. Machine,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenetic steps leading to Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia remain to be clarified. Most postmortem studies to date reveal diffuse alveolar damage as the most relevant histologic pattern. Antemortem lung biopsy may however provide more precise data regarding the earlier stages of the disease, providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the morphological and immunohistochemical features of lung samples obtained in patients with moderate Covid-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy was carried out in 12 Covid-19 patients within 20 days of symptom onset. RESULTS: Histopathologic changes included spots of patchy acute lung injury with alveolar type II cell hyperplasia, with no evidence of hyaline membranes. Strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in >50% of AECII. Interalveolar capillaries showed enlarged lumen and were in part arranged in superposed rows. Pulmonary venules were characterized by luminal enlargement, thickened walls, and perivascular CD4+ T-cell infiltration. A strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3, associated with PD-L1 and IDO expression, was observed in endothelial cells of venules and interstitial capillaries. Alveolar spaces macrophages exhibited a peculiar phenotype (CD68, CD11c, CD14, CD205, CD206, CD123/IL3AR, and PD-L1). CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically distinct features were identified in early stages of Covid-19 pneumonia, with epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities different from either classical interstitial lung diseases or diffuse alveolar damage. Alveolar type II cell hyperplasia was a prominent event in the majority of cases. Inflammatory cells expressed peculiar phenotypes. No evidence of hyaline membranes and endothelial changes characterized by IDO expression might in part explain the compliance and the characteristic pulmonary vasoplegia observed in less-advanced Covid-19 pneumonia.","Doglioni, Claudio; Ravaglia, Claudia; Chilosi, Marco; Rossi, Giulio; Dubini, Alessandra; Pedica, Federica; Piciucchi, Sara; Vizzuso, Antonio; Stella, Franco; Maitan, Stefano; Agnoletti, Vanni; Puglisi, Silvia; Poletti, Giovanni; Sambri, Vittorio; Pizzolo, Giovanni; Bronte, Vincenzo; Wells, Athol U; Poletti, Venerino",Respiration,,356
470176,Study on Transfer Learning Capabilities for Pneumonia Classification in Chest-X-Rays Image,2021-10-06,"The coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put enormous pressure on health care systems around the world. Dentistry has had to adjust to the new epidemic situation to not only bring relief to suffering patients but also to avoid becoming a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: A comprehensive, cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 6 and 16, 2020 among 875 Polish dental practitioners. The aim of the research was to assess dentists' attitudes and professional approaches resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 71.2% of dentists who responded to the questionnaire decided to suspend their clinical practice during that particular time. The main factors for this fact were the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the respondents' subjective perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 contraction and a general feeling of anxiety and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 situation. The authors observed a significant decrease in the number of patients admitted weekly in April 2020 (12.06; SD, 11.55) in comparison to that in the time before the state of pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020 (49.21; SD, 24.97). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the unpreparedness of the dental sector, both in national health and private settings, most of the Polish dentists decided to voluntarily suspend their clinical practice in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. The COVID-19 outbreak has revealed numerous shortcomings in the dental care system, especially regarding the insufficient coordination of health services related to the pandemic and lack of advanced PPE. This has led to an overwhelming feeling of fear, confusion and anxiety among dental professionals in Poland and a sudden decrease in the number of performed dental procedures. Hopefully enriched with the recent experience and due to the implementation of proper strategic and long-term measures, dental practitioners will be better prepared and adapted to global health care disruptions in the future.","Tysiac-Mista, Monika; Dziedzic, Arkadiusz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,356

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, in particular the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, of continuous infusion propofol in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective study at 1 academic medical center and 1 affiliated teaching hospital in New York City. Adult, critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received continuous infusion propofol were included. Patients who received propofol for <12 hours, were transferred from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation, or did not have a triglyceride concentration obtained during the infusion were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were included. Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration &#8805; 400 mg/dL) occurred in 38.9% of patients after a median cumulative dose of 4307 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 2448-9431 mg). The median time to triglyceride elevation was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9-9.1 days). In the multivariable regression analysis, obese patients had a significantly greater odds of hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.10, 3.21). There was no occurrence of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of possible propofol-related infusion syndrome was 3.2%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 who received propofol but did not lead to acute pancreatitis. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than previously reported in patients without COVID-19. Application of these data may aid in optimal monitoring for serious adverse effects of propofol in patients with COVID-19.","Witenko, Corey J; Littlefield, Audrey J; Abedian, Sajjad; An, Anjile; Barie, Philip S; Berger, Karen",Ann Pharmacother,,356

We retrospectively analyzed the demographic data and corresponding laboratory biomarkers of 102 critical COVID-19 patients with a residence time &#8805; 24 h and divided patients into survival and death groups according to their prognosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for critical COVID-19 patients and a nomogram was constructed based on the screened risk factors. Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age, high peripheral white blood cell count (WBC), low lymphocyte count (L), low platelet count (PLT), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were associated with critical COVID-19 patients mortality risk (p < 0.05) and these were integrated into the nomogram model. Nomogram analysis showed that the total factor score ranged from 179 to 270 while the corresponding mortality risk ranged from 0.05 to 0.95. Findings from this study suggest advanced age, high WBC, high hs-CRP, low L, and low PLT are risk factors for death in critical COVID-19 patients.

Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities. However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations. Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.","Dumusc, Alexandre Dan Diana",Revue medicale suisse,,356
479740,On the dynamical modeling of COVID-19 involving Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative and based on Daubechies framelet simulations,2020,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments have turned their attention to digital contact tracing. In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world's leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.","Sharon, Tamar",Ethics Inf Technol,,356

We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS: Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenarios 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS: Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","Mettler, Sofia K; Park, Jewel; Özbek, Orhun; Mettler, Linus K; Ho, Po-Han; Rhim, Hye Chang; Maathuis, Marloes H",Int J Infect Dis,,356

As an important part of public services, rail transit requires effective response countermeasures to control the spread of COVID-19. Considering the current development of the epidemic situation, this article discusses the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and identifies vulnerable areas to target in order to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic in the rail transit system. Countermeasures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are analyzed in terms of external and internal categories, which were classified into six groups: passenger service, case care, information, staff, equipment and operation management. An evaluation architecture was also constructed, which was established from the perspective of effectiveness, economic efficiency, acceptability, privacy and so on. The effect of implementing the measures was evaluated by a social survey, and their advantages and shortcomings were analyzed, which can be used to guide future epidemic prevention and control for rail transit systems around the world. It is important to formulate a reasonable work schedule according to local conditions, providing a reference for rapid response to future public health emergencies of international concern.","Yin, Yonghao; Li, Dewei; Zhang, Songliang; Wu, Lifu",Urban Rail Transit,,356
486253,Dynamic Chest X-Ray Using a Flat-Panel Detector System: Technique and Applications,2020,"Objective: To analyze the CT imaging results of patients with COVID-19 who previously received several follow-up visits and to explain the changes in pulmonary inflammation. Methods: Cases of 15 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed: their epidemiology, clinical history, laboratory tests, and multiple CT chest scans obtained during the disease period were studied. Results: The CT scans of the 15 patients showed different results. Four patients had no abnormal findings in their chest CT scans. The first scan of 1 patient revealed right lower lobe inflammation, while the lesion had been completely absorbed in follow-up. Two patients showed bilateral pulmonary inflammation in the first scan which had been absorbed by follow-up but the last examination showed extensive fibrosis. Two patients had no abnormalities in their first CT scans, while pulmonary inflammation was found in the second scan and this had not been completely absorbed by the last follow-up. One patient had pulmonary interstitial lesions with no evidence of National Cochlear Implant Programme (NCIP) on the first and second CT scans. NCIP was found at the third scan, and pulmonary inflammation was not completely absorbed at the last follow-up. Three patients were in the early stage of inflammation at the first scan, and the lesions were absorbed and repaired at the last follow-up. However, the lesions were not completely absorbed. One patient was in the advanced stage at the first scan, and the last follow-up pulmonary lesions were not completely absorbed. The first CT scan of 1 patient revealed large ground-glass opacity in the lungs involving the inner and middle bands. After follow-up, the disease progressed, and this condition was consistent with severe manifestations. Conclusion: The follow-up of chest CT can reflect the change process of NCIP and the treatment effect. The first CT scan of lung lesions has a certain predictive effect on the outcome and prognosis of patients.","Deng, Lingbo; Khan, Aisha; Zhou, Wen; Dai, Yi; Chen, Renzheng; Cheng, Guanxun",,,356

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-11.17) and 6.59 (3.25-13.35), respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is comparable to the general population. Outcomes of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients are worse in ulcerative colitis, those on steroids or 5-aminosalicylates but outcomes are better with biological agents.","Singh, Anupam Kumar; Jena, Anuraag; Kumar-M, Praveen; Sharma, Vishal; Sebastian, Shaji",United European Gastroenterol J,,356

492497,Abnormal Lung Quantification in Chest CT Images of COVID-19 Patients with Deep Learning and its Application to Severity Prediction,2020,"In 2020, in the face of the unparalleled epidemiological threat posed by Covid-19, multiple governments around the world sought to contain the spread of the virus by imposing strict lockdown measures that dramatically limited the movement and gathering of citizens. Not only did these restrictions severely curtail the regular patterns of economic, political and cultural life, they also made it very hard to have fun. While this last point may appear flippant, this article proposes that a proper accounting for fun is absolutely necessary if we are to understand not just the challenges passed by lockdown measures, but also the legal and biomedical risks people were willing to take to engage in activities like hosting parties, surfing and attending raves, during a pandemic. Arguing against the idea of fun as a form of displaced political practice, I instead suggest that fun is best understood as an example of contingent, non-transcendent aesthetic value that is absolutely central to everyday desire and the appeal of popular culture. Often easy to overlook, the experience of lockdown brought the appeal and importance of fun into sharp relief in ways that point towards the powerful role fun plays in shaping our lives both during a pandemic and (hopefully) after.","Holm, Nicholas",Cultural Studies,,356

The main goal of this research is to identify the difficulties related to the professional activity and personal life of obstetrics and gynecology doctors. Material and Methods: In total, 94 physicians from a single university center answered to an online questionnaire. Socio-demographic, health, family, and job-related data were collected. Data were processed using SPSS (v.25). Results: 7.4% of the doctors were confirmed infected with SARS-Cov-2 during the first 6 months of the pandemic, and 48.94% treated infected patients. Due to the large number of patients, 10.64% of the doctors have had no days-off during the last 6 months, and 22.34% of them have had new medical problems that led them to see a specialist. Seventeen to nineteen percent mentioned an increasing number of working hours and shifts per month due to the pandemic period, more than 10% used pills to cope with work-stress, and 25% of them had sleep disorders along with appetite loss. Extra-protection rules and negative consequences of wearing special equipment were identified: thermal discomfort that caused decreasing resistance and concentration during the surgery (52%), reduced mobility and accuracy of surgical or medical gestures (40%), and intraoperative visibility (47%). Doctors who were working with confirmed pregnant women preferred caesarean section. Conclusions: Working under the stress of an infection with SARS-Cov-2 is causing a lot of pressure and determines changes in personal, familial, social, and professional life. Understanding the challenges that ob-gyn doctors are facing will help institutions to better provide support.","Iorga, Magdalena; Soponaru, Camelia; Socolov, Razvan-Vladimir; Carauleanu, Alexandru; Socolov, Demetra-Gabriela",Medicina (Kaunas),,356
495363,Development and Prospective Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Predicting Need for Mechanical Ventilation,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), distance learning, especially that mediated by information and digital communication technologies, has been adopted in all areas of knowledge and at all levels, including medical education. Imminently practical areas, such as pathology, have made traditional teaching based on conventional microscopy more flexible through the synergies of computational tools and image digitization, not only to improve teaching-learning but also to offer alternatives to repetitive and exhaustive histopathological analyzes. In this context, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing histological patterns in kidney biopsy slides have been developed and validated with a view to building computational models capable of accurately identifying renal pathologies. In practice, the use of such algorithms can contribute to the universalization of teaching, allowing quality training even in regions where there is a lack of good nephropathologists. The purpose of this work is to describe and test the functionality of SmartPath&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, a tool to support teaching of glomerulopathies using machine learning. The training for knowledge acquisition was performed automatically by machine learning methods using the J48 algorithm to create a computational model of an appropriate decision tree. RESULTS: An intelligent system, SmartPath&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, was developed as a complementary remote tool in the teaching-learning process for pathology teachers and their students (undergraduate and graduate students), showing 89,47% accuracy using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. CONCLUSION: This artificial intelligence system can assist in teaching renal pathology to increase the training capacity of new medical professionals in this area.","Aldeman, N. L.

Yet people who use opioids (PWUO) continue to face a number of barriers accessing naloxone, including not knowing where it is available. METHODS: We used data from 173 PWUO from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which is located between Baltimore City and Washington, DC. We assessed the prevalence of recently (past 6 months) receiving naloxone and currently having naloxone, the type(s) of the naloxone kits received, and the perceived ease/difficultly of accessing naloxone. We also assessed participants knowledge of where naloxone was available in the community. RESULTS: One third (35.7%) of participants had recently received naloxone. Most who had received naloxone received two doses (72.1%), nasal naloxone (86.9%), and education about naloxone use (72.1%). Most currently had naloxone in their possession (either on their person or at home; 78.7%). One third (34.4%) believed naloxone was difficult to obtain in their community. Only half (56.7%) knew of multiple locations where they could get naloxone. The health department was the most commonly identified naloxone source (58.0%). Identifying multiple sources of naloxone was associated with being more likely to perceive that naloxone is easy to access. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that additional public health efforts are needed to make PWUO aware of the range of sources of naloxone in their communities in order to ensure easy and continued naloxone access to PWUO.","Schneider, Kristin E; Urquhart, Glenna J; Rouhani, Saba; Park, Ju Nyeong; Morris, Miles; Allen, Sean T; Sherman, Susan G",Harm Reduct J,,356
500734,Implications of Inadequate Water and Sanitation Infrastructure for Community Spread of COVID-19 in Remote Alaskan Communities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Discovered in 2019 in the region of Wuhan, China, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly established itself as a major pathogenic agent of morbidity and mortality. France has implemented a strategy to fight this virus which relies essentially on widespread RT-PCR virological testing in order to isolate positive patients. Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. METHOD: Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test. CONCLUSIONS: Performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the TDR, as assessed in practice, are inferior to those given by the manufacturer, which raises several questions. What is the impact of falsely negative results for patients carrying a high viral load? Are the implemented measures sufficient to prevent the epidemic?","Bernard, Mathieu; Cosentino, Gina; Pieri, Laura; Zachary, Pierre; Buser, Michael; Kbaier, Laurent; Giannoli, Jean-Marc",Ann Biol Clin (Paris),,356

METHODS: This was a retrospective, IRB-approved study performed at a large academic hospital in the USA. Between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, 641 patients with COVID-19 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR received medical care at our institution. A small cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection underwent neck or cervical spine CT imaging for indications including stroke, trauma, and neck pain. The lung apices included in the field of view on these CT scans were reviewed for the presence of findings suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, including ground-glass opacities, consolidation, or crazy-paving pattern. The type and frequency of these findings were recorded and correlated with clinical information including age, gender, and symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had neck or spine CTs performed before or concurrently with a chest CT. Of this group, 17 (50%) had unknown COVID-19 status at the time of neck or spine imaging and 10 (59%) of their CT studies had findings in the lung apices consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Lung apical findings on cervical spine or neck CTs consistent with COVID-19 infection are common and may be encountered on neuroimaging performed for non-respiratory indications. For these patients, the emergency radiologist may be the first physician to suspect underlying COVID-19 infection.","Applewhite, Brooks P; Buch, Karen; Yoon, Byung Chul; Lang, Min; Li, Matthew D; Rincon, Sandra P; Mehan, William A",Emerg Radiol,,356

502127,"On Computability, Learnability and Extractability of Finite State Machines from Recurrent Neural Networks",2020-09-10,"SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. It relies on the fusion of their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid into the host cell. The spike glycoprotein (S) mediates virus entry into cells via the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein located on many cell types and tissues' outer surface. This study, therefore, aimed to design and synthesize novel pyrazolone-based compounds as potential inhibitors that would interrupt the interaction between the viral spike protein and the host cell receptor to prevent SARS-CoV 2 entrance into the cell. A series of pyrazolone compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Employing computational techniques, the inhibitory potentials of the designed compounds against both spike protein and hACE2 were evaluated. Results of the binding free energy from the in-silico analysis, showed that three compounds (7i, 7k and 8f) and six compounds (7b, 7h, 7k, 8d, 8g, and 8h) showed higher and better binding high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2, respectively compared to the standard drugs cefoperazone (CFZ) and MLN-4760. Furthermore, the outcome of the structural analysis of the two proteins upon binding of the inhibitors showed that the two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2) were stable, and the structural integrity of the proteins was not compromised. This study suggests pyrazolone-based compounds might be potent blockers of the viral entry into the host cells.","Obakachi, Vincent A; Kushwaha, Narva Deshwar; Kushwaha, Babita; Mahlalela, Mavela Cleopus; Shinde, Suraj Raosaheb; Kehinde, Idowu; Karpoormath, Rajshekhar",J Mol Struct,,356

METHODS: Human retinas were collected from 8 donors who had been clinically diagnosed and treated for glaucoma, and from 9 control donors. Immunohistochemical analysis for BDNF and TrkB was performed. The percent of each retina expressing BDNF and TrkB was quantified for the total retinal thickness, and separately for the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) complex + retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The expression of each protein was correlated with clinical outcomes obtained from the subject's ocular histories. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in BDNF or TrkB expression when comparing glaucomatous and control retinas. Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between BDNF expression and the use of prostaglandin analogs. TrkB expression was highly correlated with the last-measured intraocular pressure (IOP), the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the use of beta blockers, and the total number of drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Topical drugs used to treat glaucoma were associated with an increase in retinal BDNF and TrkB expression in human retina, independent of IOP, which may represent molecular evidence of neuroprotective pathway activation.","Harper, Matthew M; Boese, Erin A; Kardon, Randy H; Ledolter, Johannes; Kuehn, Markus H",Curr Eye Res,,356

We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. RESULTS: The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The deconfinement period after the first wave COVID-19 changed the number and type of psychiatric emergency medicine consultations at our hospital, suggesting a psychiatric impact of confinement during this pandemic. These findings will be of interest to practitioners and politicians in the coming months.","Flament, Julien; Scius, Nathan; Zdanowicz, Nicolas; Regnier, Maxime; De Cannière, Louis; Thonon, Henri",Am J Emerg Med,,356

Scaffold materials have a porous structure, with a high surface area and their intrinsic nanocavities can accommodate cells and macromolecules. The three-dimensional structure (3D) of scaffolds serves not only as a fibrous structure for cell adhesion and growth in tissue engineering, but can also provide the controlled release of drugs and other molecules for biomedical applications. There has been a limited number of reports on the use of scaffold materials in biomedical sensing applications. This review highlights the potential of scaffold materials in the improvement of sensing platforms and summarizes the progress in the application of novel scaffold-based materials as sensor, and discusses their advantages and limitations.

509474,Airplane Detection Based on Mask Region Convolution Neural Network,2021-08-29,"Background: To end the COVID-19 pandemic, a large part of the world must be immune to the virus by vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to gauge intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among ordinary people and to identify attitudes towards vaccines and barriers for vaccine acceptance. Methods: The study population comprises 1880 people residing in different countries that answer a prepared questionnaire. The questionnaire topics are demographics, historical issues, participants' attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines, concerns, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Attitudes and beliefs relating to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine, were ascertained. Overall, 66.81% of the contributors would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while %33.19 did not intend to be vaccinated. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding vaccine side effects, fear of getting sick from the uptake of the vaccine, and the absence of accurate vaccine promotion news. Individuals with higher education believe that India (68.6%) produces the best vaccine (P &lt; 0.001), while healthcare workers think the Chinese vaccine (44.2%) is the best (P = 0.020). Individuals with higher education have not been vaccinated, not be healthcare workers, and females were the most contributors to effective of the vaccine in reducing mortality from COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: Given the degree of hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccination, a multifaceted approach to facilitate vaccine uptake that includes vaccine education, behavioral change strategies, and health promotion, is paramount.","Faezi, N.

510337,Periodic Weather-Aware LSTM with Event Mechanism for Parking Behavior Prediction,2021,"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the worst global threats in the 21st century since World War II. This pandemic has led to a worldwide economic recession and crisis due to lockdown. Biomedical researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and premier institutes throughout the world are claiming that new clinical trials are in progress. During the severe phase of this disease, mechanical ventilators are used to assist in the management of outcomes; however, their use can lead to the development of pneumonia. In this context, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes can serve as an immunomodulation treatment for COVID-19 patients. Exosomes possess anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory properties that can be explored in an effort to improve the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Currently, only one ongoing clinical trial (NCT04276987) is specifically exploring the use of MSC-derived exosomes as a therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. The purpose of this review is to provide insights of using exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells in management of the co-morbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in direction of improving their health outcome. There is limited knowledge of using exosomes in SARS-CoV-2; the clinicians and researchers should exploit exosomes as therapeutic regime.","Raghav, Alok; Khan, Zeeshan Ahmad; Upadhayay, Viabhav Kumar; Tripathi, Prashant; Gautam, Kirti Amresh; Mishra, Brijesh Kumar; Ahmad, Jamal; Jeong, Goo-Bo",,,356

This stochastic SIS epidemic model can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian system, therefore we wondered if it could be geometrically handled through the theory of Lie--Hamilton systems, and this happened to be the case. The primordial result is that we are able to obtain a general solution for the stochastic/ SIS-epidemic model (with fluctuations) in form of a nonlinear superposition rule that includes particular stochastic solutions and certain constants to be related to initial conditions of the contagion process. The choice of these initial conditions will be crucial to display the expected behavior of the curve of infections during the epidemic. We shall limit these constants to nonsingular regimes and display graphics of the behavior of the solutions. As one could expect, the increase of infected individuals follows a sigmoid-like curve. Lie--Hamiltonian systems admit a quantum deformation, so does the stochastic SIS-epidemic model. We present this generalization as well. If one wants to study the evolution of an SIS epidemic under the influence of a constant heat source (like centrally heated buildings), one can make use of quantum stochastic differential equations coming from the so-called quantum deformation.","Esen, Ougul; Fern'andez-Saiz, Eduardo; Sard'on, Cristina; Zajkac, Marcin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02484v1.pdf,356

This MTase is composed of two nonstructural proteins, the nsp16 catalytic subunit and the activating nsp10 protein. We have solved the crystal structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site. Based on the structural data we built a model of the MTase in complex with RNA that illustrates the catalytic reaction. A structural comparison to the Zika MTase revealed low conservation of the catalytic site between these two RNA viruses suggesting preparation of inhibitors targeting both these viruses will be very difficult.

591748,Examination in the Time of COVID-19—MCh Plastic Surgery Examination: How Did We Do It?,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has broader geographic spread and potentially longer lasting effects than those of previous disasters. Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 has resulted in delays for in-person health care services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) in health care at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for such delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey that was distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US–based convenience sample of 2570 participants about delays in their health care resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of health care delays. In addition to all delays, we focused on the following three main types of delays, which were the primary outcomes in this study: dental, preventive, and diagnostic care delays. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to determine which factors were associated with health care delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving health care was the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection (126/374, 33.6%). Almost half (1227/2570, 47.7%) of the participants reported experiencing health care delays. Among those who experienced health care delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced (921/1227, 75.1%), the top three reported types of care that were affected by delays included dental (351/921, 38.1%), preventive (269/921, 29.2%), and diagnostic (151/921, 16.4%) care. The logistic regression models showed that age (P<.001), gender identity (P<.001), education (P=.007), and self-reported worry about general health (P<.001) were significantly associated with experiencing health care delays. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care. However, this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing based on the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, and although there was trend between race and delays (people of color experienced fewer delays than White participants), it was not significant (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This study addresses the demand side of health care delays by exploring the determinants of such delays. More research on health care delays during the pandemic is needed, including research on their short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, mental health, people’s quality of life, and the experience of pain.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Rice, Dylan R; Ghoneima, Hana; McKowen, Anna Laura W; Anderson, Nicholas; Wootton, Angie R; Veldhuis, Cindy",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886489/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25446,356

However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections. Objectives. To assess whether children with brain-based developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have complications or poorer outcomes following infection. Methods. We conducted a two-week rapid review on studies with primary data regarding children aged between zero and 18 years old with brain-based developmental disabilities, or who were at risk of developing such disabilities, with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

At present, the understanding of PDCoV pathogenesis is very limited, which seriously hinders effective prevention and control. In this study, liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) combined with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling was performed to compare the differential expression of proteins in PDCoV-infected and mock-infected LLC-PK cells at 18 h post-infection (hpi). In addition, the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) technique was used to verify the quantitative proteome data. A total of 4624 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitated, of which 128 were significantly upregulated, and 147 were significantly downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these DEPs were involved mainly in the defense response, apoptosis, and the immune system, and several DEPs may be related to interferon-stimulated genes and the immune system. Based on DEP bioinformatics analysis, we propose that PDCoV infection may utilize the apoptosis pathway of host cells to achieve maximum viral replication. Meanwhile, the host may be able to stimulate the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway to resist the virus. Overall, in this study, we presented the first application of proteomics analysis to determine the protein profile of PDCoV-infected cells, which provides valuable information with respect to better understanding the host response to PDCoV infection and the specific pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.","Gao, Xiang; Zhang, Liping; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Yongguang; Wei, Yanming; Wang, Yonglu; Liu, Xinsheng",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923756/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c00886,356

We describe a new service, HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi), that partnered physicians available by videoconferencing with 8-1-1 registered nurses to support callers. METHODS: From Apr. 6 to Aug. 2, 2020, all callers to the 8-1-1 telephone service (available to anyone in BC) categorized as “seek care within 24 hours” by registered nurses were eligible for referral to HEiDi. HEiDi physicians (“virtual physicians”) connected directly with callers via desktop videoconferencing software, assessed their health complaint, provided advice and suggested care disposition. We conducted a descriptive study and collected demographic characteristics, health concern and disposition determined by the virtual physician. RESULTS: HEiDi virtual physicians provided 7687 consultations. Most patients (n = 4439, 57.8%) were in the 20–64 age range, and 4814 (62.9%) were female. Common health concerns were related to gastroenterology (n = 1275, 16.6%), respiratory (n = 877, 11.4%) and dermatology (n = 874, 11.4%). From the 7531 calls with available data, 2548 (33.8%) callers were advised to attempt home treatment, 2885 (38.3%) to contact a primary care physician within 1 week, 1131 (15.0%) to attend an emergency department immediately and 538 (7.1%) to attend their primary provider now. INTERPRETATION: We found that virtual physicians were able to advise nearly 3 out of 4 (72.1%) patients away from in-person emergency or clinic assessment and 1 in 7 (15.0%) to seek immediate emergency department care. Virtual physicians can provide an effective complement to a provincial health telephone system.","Ho, Kendall; Lauscher, Helen Novak; Stewart, Kurtis; Abu-Laban, Riyad B.; Scheuermeyer, Frank; Grafstein, Eric; Christenson, Jim; Sundhu, Sandra",CMAJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131026/; https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200265,356

Even patients infected by SARS-CoV‑2 or COVID-19 may need operative procedures. Currently, no uniform recommendations exist on precautions to be taken when operating on these patients. Furthermore, they may differ from one hospital to another. METHODS: The task force COVID-19 of the emergency, intensive and severely injured section of the German Trauma Society (DGU e. V.) has developed consensus-based recommendations on surgical treatment of patients with SARS-CoV‑2 infections. Great importance is placed on the implementation in hospitals at all levels of care. RESULTS: The indications for surgical interventions in patients with COVID-19 infections require an extremely critical evaluation. When indicated these surgical intervention should ideally be performed in a separate operating theater. All personnel involved should wear personal protective equipment with FFP2 masks, face shields and double gloves. The emergency team in the resuscitation bay should generally wear the same personal protective equipment. Special training is mandatory and the exposure of team members should be minimized. CONCLUSION: The recommendations are principally used for all kinds of surgery and comply with the currently available knowledge. Nevertheless, all recommendations represent a compromise between maximum safety of all medical staff and practicability in the routine hospital workflow.","Mahlke, Lutz; Flohé, Sascha; Matthes, Gerrit; Paffrath, Thomas; Wagner, Frithjof; Wölfl, Christoph",Unfallchirurg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00113-020-00830-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32488319/,356

The objective of the study is to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic in counties across the U.S. by comparing socioeconomic variables to case and death data from January 22nd to June 30th, 2020. A cluster analysis was performed to examine areas of high-risk, followed by a three-stage regression to examine contextual factors associated with elevated risk patterns for morbidity and mortality. The factors associated with community-level vulnerability included age, disability, language, race, occupation, and urban status. We recommend that cluster detection and spatial analysis be included in population-based surveillance strategies to better inform early case detection and prioritize healthcare resources.","Andersen, Lauren; Harden, Stella; Sugg, Margaret; Runkle, Jennifer; Lundquist, Taylor",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254938/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720359258?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142396; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720359258,356

601720,The Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks and X-Ray as a Practical Alternative for Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19,2020-05-16,"COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.","de Moraes, Diogo; Paiva, Brunno Vivone Buquete; Cury, Sarah Santiloni; Junior, João Pessoa Araújo; da Silva Mori, Marcelo Alves; Carvalho, Robson Francisco",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030767,356

The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19-associated morbidity and in-hospital mortality by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of nine Massachusetts hospitals including all consecutive adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Measured outcomes were assessed and compared by patient-reported race/ethnicity, classified as White, Black, Latinx, Asian, or other. Students t-test, Fischer exact test, and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 379 patients (62.9±16.5 years; 55.7% men) with confirmed COVID-19 were included (49.9% White, 13.7% Black, 29.8% Latinx, 3.7% Asian), of which 376 (99.2%) were insured (34.3% private, 41.2% public, 23.8% public with supplement). Latinx patients were younger, had fewer cardiopulmonary disorders, were more likely to have obesity, more frequently reported fever and myalgia, and had lower D-dimer levels compared to White patients (p&0.05). On multivariable analysis controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes, no significant differences in in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation by race/ethnicity were found. Diabetes was a significant predictor for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11-3.23) while older age was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 4.18; 95% CI 1.94-9.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest health system in Massachusetts, there was no association between race/ethnicity and clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, after controlling for key demographic/clinical characteristics. These findings serve to refute suggestions that certain races/ethnicities may be biologically predisposed to poorer COVID-19 outcomes.","McCarty, Thomas R; Hathorn, Kelly E; Redd, Walker D; Rodriguez, Nicolette J; Zhou, Joyce C; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Njie, Cheikh; Wong, Danny; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Shen, Lin; Stone, Valerie E; Chan, Walter W",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32827436/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1245,356

RA is characterized by the clinical findings of synovial inflammation, autoantibody production, and cartilage/bone destruction, cardiovascular, pulmonary and skeletal disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were responsible for the induction of inflammation in RA patients. Drawbacks such as poor efficacy, higher doses, frequent administration, low responsiveness, and higher cost and serious side effects were associated with the conventional dosage forms for RA treatment. Nanomedicines were recently gaining more interest towards the treatment of RA, and researchers were also focusing towards the development of various anti-inflammatory drug loaded nanoformulations with an aid to both actively/passively targeting the inflamed site to afford an effective treatment regimen for RA. Alterations in the surface area and nanoscale size of the nanoformulations elicit beneficial physical and chemical properties for better pharmacological activities. These drug loaded nanoformulations may enhances the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs, improves the bioavailability, affords targetability and may improve the therapeutic activity. In this regimen, the present review focus towards the novel nanoparticulate formulations (nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, and nanocapsules) utilized for the treatment of RA. The recent advancements such as siRNA, peptide and targeted based nanoparticulate systems for RA treatment were also discussed.

605473,"Influenza A/H1N1 2009 Pandemic and Respiratory Virus Infections, Beijing, 2009–2010",2012-09-20,"BACKGROUND: Unlike well-established diseases that base clinical care on randomized trials, past experiences, and training, prognosis in COVID19 relies on a weaker foundation. Knowledge from other respiratory failure diseases may inform clinical decisions in this novel disease. The objective was to predict 48-hour invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using COVID-like diseases (CLD). METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study trained machine learning (ML) models on patients hospitalized with CLD to predict IMV within 48 h in COVID-19 patients. CLD patients were identified using diagnosis codes for bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, influenza, unspecified pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 2008–2019. A total of 16 cohorts were constructed, including any combinations of the four diseases plus an exploratory ARDS cohort, to determine the most appropriate cohort to use. Candidate predictors included demographic and clinical parameters that were previously associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Model development included the implementation of logistic regression and three ensemble tree-based algorithms: decision tree, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Models were validated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at two healthcare systems, March 2020–July 2020. ML models were trained on CLD patients at Stanford Hospital Alliance (SHA). Models were validated on hospitalized COVID-19 patients at both SHA and Intermountain Healthcare. RESULTS: CLD training data were obtained from SHA (n = 14,030), and validation data included 444 adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients from SHA (n = 185) and Intermountain (n = 259). XGBoost was the top-performing ML model, and among the 16 CLD training cohorts, the best model achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.883 in the validation set. In COVID-19 patients, the prediction models exhibited moderate discrimination performance, with the best models achieving an AUC of 0.77 at SHA and 0.65 at Intermountain. The model trained on all pneumonia and influenza cohorts had the best overall performance (SHA: positive predictive value (PPV) 0.29, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.97, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) 10.7; Intermountain: PPV, 0.23, NPV 0.97, PLR 10.3). We identified important factors associated with IMV that are not traditionally considered for respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of prediction models derived from CLD for 48-hour IMV in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 demonstrate high specificity and can be used as a triage tool at point of care. Novel predictors of IMV identified in COVID-19 are often overlooked in clinical practice. Lessons learned from our approach may assist other research institutes seeking to build artificial intelligence technologies for novel or rare diseases with limited data for training and validation.","Carmichael, Harris; Coquet, Jean; Sun, Ran; Sang, Shengtian; Groat, Danielle; Asch, Steven M.; Bledsoe, Joseph; Peltan, Ithan D.; Jacobs, Jason R.; Hernandez-Boussard, Tina",J Biomed Inform,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103802; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965640/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001313,356

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether cancer transitions exist in the US, select European countries, and Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, annual cause-of-death data from the 1950s to 2018 for the US, England and Wales, France, Sweden, Norway, and Japan were extracted from the Human Mortality Database and the World Health Organization (WHO). Statistical analysis was performed from April 2020 to February 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-standardized death rates for all ages and both sexes combined were estimated for cancers of the stomach, cervix, liver, lung, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, breast, and prostate. RESULTS: The results of the analysis show that for all countries in this study except for Japan, mortality from infectious-related cancers has declined steadily throughout the period, so that by the end of the period, for Norway, England and Wales, Sweden, and the US, rates were approximately 20 deaths per 100 000 population. Regarding noninfectious-related cancers, at the beginning of the period, all countries exhibited an increasing trend in rates, with England and Wales having the greatest peak of 215.1 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI 213.7-216.6 deaths per 100 000 population) in 1985 followed by a decline, with most of the other countries reaching a peak around 1990 and declining thereafter. Furthermore, there is a visible crossover in the trends for infectious-related and noninfectious-related cancers in Japan and Norway. This crossover occurred in 1988 in Japan, when the rates for both types of cancers stood at 116 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 115.0-116.5 per 100 000 population), and in 1955 in Norway, when they passed each other at 100 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 96.4-105.3 per 100 000 population). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the findings suggest that cancer mortality patterns parallel the epidemiological transition, which states that as nations develop, they move from a stage where infectious diseases are prominent to one where noninfectious diseases dominate. An implication is that the epidemiological transition theory as originally formulated continues to be relevant, despite some researchers arguing that there should be additional stages beyond the original 3.","Gersten, Omer; Barbieri, Magali",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843999/,356

In this context, the study aims to analyze the impact of work–family conflict on burnout, considering work overload, in teleworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic. To evaluate the hypotheses, we used data collected during the last week of July 2020 using an online survey. Work–family conflict and burnout were measured using the Gutek et al.

The results indicated, between other findings, that there was a positive relationship between work–family conflict and family–work conflict and all the dimensions of burnout. However, there was no effect of teleworking overload in the work–family conflict and burnout relationship.

607716,An IoT-based Framework for Early Identification and Monitoring of COVID-19 Cases,2020-08-15,"Background The worldwide shortage of single-use N95 respirators and surgical masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many health care personnel to prolong the use of their existing equipment as much as possible. In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Methods and findings We examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (silk, cotton, polyester), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Tests were done when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier and also when constructed as do-it-yourself face coverings. As a protective barrier and face covering, silk is more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. Silk face coverings repelled droplets as well as masks, but unlike masks they are hydrophobic and can be readily sterilized for immediate reuse. Conclusions Silk is an effective hydrophobic barrier to droplets, more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are readily re-useable via cleaning. Therefore, silk can serve as an effective material for protecting respirators under clinical conditions and as a material for face coverings.","Parlin, A. F.; Stratton, S. M.; Culley, T.

611251,Detection of Progressive Glaucomatous Optic Nerve Damage on Fundus Photographs with Deep Learning,2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Accumulated evidence suggest that specific patterns of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and their crosstalks may determine transcriptional outcomes. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these ""histone codes"" in plants remain largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that a salinity stress inducible PHD (plant homeodomain) finger domain containing protein GmPHD5 can read the ""histone code"" underlying the methylated H3K4. GmPHD5 interacts with other DNA binding proteins, including GmGNAT1 (an acetyl transferase), GmElongin A (a transcription elongation factor) and GmISWI (a chromatin remodeling protein). Our results suggest that GmPHD5 can recognize specific histone methylated H3K4, with preference to di-methylated H3K4. Here, we illustrate that the interaction between GmPHD5 and GmGNAT1 is regulated by the self-acetylation of GmGNAT1, which can also acetylate histone H3. GmGNAT1 exhibits a preference toward acetylated histone H3K14. These results suggest a histone crosstalk between methylated H3K4 and acetylated H3K14. Consistent to its putative roles in gene regulation under salinity stress, we showed that GmPHD5 can bind to the promoters of some confirmed salinity inducible genes in soybean. CONCLUSION: Here, we propose a model suggesting that the nuclear protein GmPHD5 is capable of regulating the crosstalk between histone methylation and histone acetylation of different lysine residues. Nevertheless, GmPHD5 could also recruit chromatin remodeling factors and transcription factors of salt stress inducible genes to regulate their expression in response to salinity stress.","Wu, Tao; Pi, Er-Xu; Tsai, Sau-Na; Lam, Hon-Ming; Sun, Sai-Ming; Kwan, Yiu Wa; Ngai, Sai-Ming",BMC Plant Biol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168212/,356

Given that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease promoted by specific cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, we aimed at evaluating whether sex could affect the levels of these proatherogenic cytokines in a group of healthy adults. In this analysis, we also included other cytokines and peptides that have been implicated in atherosclerosis development and progression. Methods: A total of 104 healthy adults were recruited; we measured circulating levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, angiotensins and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), as well as osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Results: IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly higher in men as compared to women. They were all associated with testosterone and the testosterone/estradiol ratio. They remained significantly associated with sex (but not with hormones) after being tested for potential confounders. Conclusions: Sex seems to influence the levels of proatherogenic cytokines. This is consistent not only with sex differences in vulnerability to infections but also with the higher cardiovascular risk exhibited by the male gender as compared to the female gender.

Since its emergence in 2012, nosocomial amplifications have led to its high epidemic potential and mortality rate of 34.5 %. To date, there is an unmet need for vaccines and specific therapeutics for this disease. Available treatments are either supportive medications in use for other diseases or those lacking specificity requiring higher doses. The viral infection mode is initiated by the attachment of the viral Spike glycoprotein to the human Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP4). Our attempts to screen antivirals against MERS led us to identify montelukast sodium hydrate (MSH), an FDA-approved anti-asthma drug, as an agent attenuating MERS-CoV infection. We showed that MSH directly binds to MERS-CoV-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and inhibits its molecular interaction with DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner. Our cell-based inhibition assays using MERS pseudovirions demonstrated that viral infection was significantly inhibited by MSH and was further validated using infectious MERS-CoV culture. Thus, we propose MSH as a potential candidate for therapeutic developments against MERS-CoV infections.","Gan, Hanjie Jonathan; Harikishore, Amaravadhi; Lee, Jihye; Jeon, Sangeun; Rajan, Sreekanth; Chen, Ming Wei; Neo, Jun Long; Kim, Seungtaek; Yoon, Ho Sup",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220304101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309540/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104996; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220304101?v=s5,356

Nevertheless, rare vaccine‐induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) cases have been reported in some people being vaccinated against Covid‐19. This review summarizes the thromboembolic events after Covid‐19 vaccination and discusses its molecular mechanism, incidence rate, clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis. Then, a step‐by‐step algorithm for diagnosing such events, along with a management plan, are presented. In conclusion, considering the likeliness of acquiring severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its subsequent morbidity and mortality, the benefits of vaccination outweigh its risks.

620162,Deep Learning-Based Haptic Guidance for Surgical Skills Transfer,2021-01-20,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes bluetongue, a major hemorrhagic disease of ruminants. In order to investigate the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, we used a BTV8 strain minimally passaged in tissue culture (termed BTV8(L) in this study) and a derivative strain passaged extensively in tissue culture (BTV8(H)) in in vitro and in vivo studies. BTV8(L) was pathogenic in both IFNAR(−/−) mice and in sheep, while BTV8(H) was attenuated in both species. To identify genetic changes which led to BTV8(H) attenuation, we generated 34 reassortants between BTV8(L) and BTV8(H). We found that partial attenuation of BTV8(L) in IFNAR(−/−) mice was achieved by simply replacing genomic segment 2 (Seg2, encoding VP2) or Seg10 (encoding NS3) with the BTV8(H) homologous segments. Fully attenuated viruses required at least two genome segments from BTV8(H), including Seg2 with either Seg1 (encoding VP1), Seg6 (encoding VP6 and NS4), or Seg10 (encoding NS3). Conversely, full reversion of virulence of BTV8(H) required at least five genomic segments of BTV8(L). We also demonstrated that BTV8(H) acquired an increased affinity for glycosaminoglycan receptors during passaging in cell culture due to mutations in its VP2 protein. Replication of BTV8(H) was relatively poor in interferon (IFN)-competent primary ovine endothelial cells compared to replication of BTV8(L), and this phenotype was determined by several viral genomic segments, including Seg4 and Seg9. This study demonstrated that multiple viral proteins contribute to BTV8 virulence. VP2 and NS3 are primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis, but VP1, VP5, VP4, VP6, and VP7 also contribute to virulence. IMPORTANCE Bluetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants, and it is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The clinical outcome of BTV infection varies considerably and depends on environmental and host- and virus-specific factors. Over the years, BTV serotypes/strains with various degrees of virulence (including nonpathogenic strains) have been described in different geographical locations. However, no data are available to correlate the BTV genotype to virulence. This study shows that BTV virulence is determined by different viral genomic segments. The data obtained will help to characterize thoroughly the pathogenesis of bluetongue. The possibility to determine the pathogenicity of virus isolates on the basis of their genome sequences will help in the design of control strategies that fit the risk posed by new emerging BTV strains.","Janowicz, Anna; Caporale, Marco; Shaw, Andrew; Gulletta, Salvatore; Di Gialleonardo, Luigina; Ratinier, Maxime; Palmarini, Massimo",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00395-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822026/,356

The cardiac pathological changes in these patients with COVID-19 have yet to be well described. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an international multicentre study, cardiac tissue from the autopsies of 21 consecutive COVID-19 patients was assessed by cardiovascular pathologists. The presence of myocarditis, as defined by the presence of multiple foci of inflammation with associated myocyte injury, was determined, and the inflammatory cell composition analysed by immunohistochemistry. Other forms of acute myocyte injury and inflammation were also described, as well as coronary artery, endocardium, and pericardium involvement. Lymphocytic myocarditis was present in 3 (14%) of the cases. In two of these cases, the T lymphocytes were CD4 predominant and in one case the T lymphocytes were CD8 predominant. Increased interstitial macrophage infiltration was present in 18 (86%) of the cases. A mild pericarditis was present in four cases. Acute myocyte injury in the right ventricle, most probably due to strain/overload, was present in four cases. There was a non-significant trend toward higher serum troponin levels in the patients with myocarditis compared with those without myocarditis. Disrupted coronary artery plaques, coronary artery aneurysms, and large pulmonary emboli were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-CoV-2 there are increased interstitial macrophages in a majority of the cases and multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis in a small fraction of the cases. Other forms of myocardial injury are also present in these patients. The macrophage infiltration may reflect underlying diseases rather than COVID-19.","Basso, Cristina; Leone, Ornella; Rizzo, Stefania; De Gaspari, Monica; van der Wal, Allard C; Aubry, Marie-Christine; Bois, Melanie C; Lin, Peter T; Maleszewski, Joseph J; Stone, James R",Eur Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968776/,356

Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Setting: Summary-level genetic association data. Participants: Participants were predominantly of European ancestry. Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants). Main outcomes and measures: Lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and plasma ACE2 levels. Results: There were no association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with any of the outcomes considered here. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in GTEx (p = 4x10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in INTERVAL (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations between genetically predicted levels of the other cardiometabolic traits with the outcomes. Conclusions: This study does not provide evidence to support that ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drugs affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression or plasma ACE2 levels. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our findings do not support a change in ACE inhibitor medication use without clinical justification.","Gill, D.; Arvanitis, M.; Carter, P.; Hernandez Cordero, A.

Analytical modeling of the triple treatment of virus within a small liquid droplet and within a solid porous particle is the basic research polygon of this paper. The three-stage treatment aims to maximize the efficacy of deactivating viruses indoors. In order to achieve this, viruses undergo treatment by infrared heating, ultraviolet deactivation and ionization–electrostatic deactivation by negative ions. When the droplets are treated with infrared heating, incomplete evaporation occurs, reducing their initial diameter by 10 times; an initial diameter of droplets is 0.01 mm, 0.03 mm and 0.05 mm. Thermal inactivation of viruses inside the droplets is almost negligible, due to short exposure time and a maximum temperature of 100 °C. On the other hand, when solid porous particles are heated to a much higher temperature at the same exposure time, this causes significant thermal inactivation of viruses inside them. Reducing the diameter of the droplet (due to evaporation) by 10 times causes a multiple increase in UV-C deactivation of viruses inside the droplets. The effect of UV-C radiation on viruses within solid porous particles is not included in this paper.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) resulting in decreased activation of the AT1 receptor and decreased immune system activation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies against ACE2 may develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as anti-idiotypic antibodies to anti-spike protein antibodies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We tested plasma or serum for ACE2 antibodies in 67 patients with known SARS-CoV-2 infection and 13 with no history of infection. None of the 13 patients without history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1 of the 20 outpatients that had a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 had levels of ACE2 antibodies above the cutoff threshold. In contrast, 26/32 (81%) in the convalescent group and 14/15 (93%) of patients acutely hospitalized had detectable ACE2 antibodies. Plasma from patients with antibodies against ACE2 had less soluble ACE2 activity in plasma but similar amounts of ACE2 protein compared to patients without ACE2 antibodies. We measured the capacity of the samples to inhibit ACE2 enzyme activity. Addition of plasma from patients with ACE2 antibodies led to decreased activity of an exogenous preparation of ACE2 compared to patients that did not have antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have antibodies specific for ACE2. Patients with ACE2 antibodies have lower activity of soluble ACE2 in plasma. Plasma from these patients also inhibits exogenous ACE2 activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ACE2 antibodies develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection and decrease ACE2 activity. This could lead to an increase in the abundance of Ang II, which causes a proinflammatory state that triggers symptoms of PASC.","Arthur, John M.; Forrest, J.

Several vaccines, including mRNA, adenoviral-vectored, protein subunit and whole-cell inactivated virus vaccines, have now reported efficacy in phase III trials and have received emergency approval in many countries. The two mRNA vaccines approved to date show efficacy even after only one dose, when non-NAbs and moderate T helper 1 cell responses are detectable, but almost no NAbs. After a single dose, the adenovirus vaccines elicit polyfunctional antibodies that are capable of mediating virus neutralization and of driving other antibody-dependent effector functions, as well as potent T cell responses. These data suggest that protection may require low levels of NAbs and might involve other immune effector mechanisms including non-NAbs, T cells and innate immune mechanisms.

La grippe, survenant par vagues épidémiques hivernales, continue d’être à l’origine de plusieurs centaines de milliers de décès chaque année. La pandémie, émergente, liée au nouveau coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (maladie COVID-19) constitue une forte crise sanitaire, accroissant la morbidité et la mortalité, avec un fort impact socio-économique. Les données autour de la vitamine D ont nettement augmenté ces dernières années. La connaissance de son rôle a progressé de manière considérable, passant d’une vitamine ayant un rôle essentiellement sur le métabolisme phosphocalcique et osseux à une hormone ayant une implication sur la « santé intégrale ». La vitamine D semble favoriser l’activation de la réponse immunitaire et limite les conséquences néfastes de l’immuno-pathologie induite par les agents pathogènes. Dans la littérature, des données probantes lient le déficit en vitamine D d’une part, à la susceptibilité aux infections virales aiguës et, d’autre part, à l’évolution plus défavorable de certaines infections chroniques. Cette revue examine les connaissances actuelles sur la vitamine D et son influence sur le risque des infections respiratoires (épidémies de grippe et pandémie COVID-19). Abstract Acute viral respiratory infections represent a large part of the morbidity and mortality. The influenza, which occurs in epidemics waves during the winter, continues to cause hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. The emerging pandemic of new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reports an huge health crisis, increasing morbidity and mortality, with a strong socio-economic impact. The data around vitamin D has greatly increased in recent years. Knowledge of its role has advanced considerably, from a vitamin with a phosphocalcic and bone metabolism role to a hormone with an implication for “integral health”. Vitamin D appears to stimulate the activation of the immune response and limit the destructive consequences of immunopathology induced by pathogens. In the literature, there is evidence linking vitamin D deficiency, on the one hand to susceptibility to acute viral infections and, on the other hand, to the more unfavorable evolution of chronic infections. This review examines current knowledge of vitamin D and its influence on the risk of respiratory infections (influenza epidemics and COVID-19 pandemic).","Taqarort, Naima; Chadli, Smail",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0985056220304891; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0985056220304891,356

This report shares key lessons learned for community engagement practices during a malaria outbreak response in the Los Tres Brazos neighborhood of urban Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic from 2015-2016. In this two-year period, 233 cases of malaria were reported—more than seven times the number of cases (31) reported in the previous two years. The initial outbreak response by the national malaria program emphasized “top-down” interventions such as active surveillance, vector control, and educative talks within the community. Despite a transient reduction in reported cases in mid-2015, transmission resurged at the end of 2015. The program responded by introducing active roles for trained community members that included door-to-door fever screening, testing with rapid diagnostic tests and treatment. Malaria cases declined significantly throughout 2016 and community-based active surveillance infrastructure helped to detect and limit a small episode of transmission in 2017. Results from qualitative research among community members revealed two key factors that facilitated their cooperation with community-based surveillance activities: motivation to help one’s community; and trust among stakeholders (community health workers, their neighbors and other key figures in the community, and malaria program staff and leadership). This experience suggests that community-led interventions and the program’s willingness to learn and adapt under changing circumstances can help control malaria transmission and pave the way for elimination.","Valdez, Dianelba; Keys, Hunter; Ureña, Keyla; Cabral, Domingo; Camilo, Francisco; Ogando, Eulalia C.; Mercedes, Luz; Noland, Gregory S.; Blount, Stephen B.; Lavery, James V.; Desir, Luccene; Puello, Jose",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32774350/; https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2020.92,356

The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset in most individuals, with a median probability of transmission of 15%, that hindered large individual variations (IQR: [8, 37]).

Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by 2 to 4-fold on average, we estimate that infection with B1.1.7 virus could lead to an increase in the probability of transmission by 8 to 17%.","Marc, A.; Kerioui, M.; Blanquart, F.; Bertrand, J.; Mitja, O.; Corbacho-Monne, M.; Marks, M.; Guedj, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256341; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21256341v1?rss=1,356

Although there are many differences between England and Israel, the factors influencing the early days of the rollout merit exploration and learning that could be of benefit to other countries as they grapple to plan their own Covid-19 vaccine programmes. This commentary considers aspects of the rollout in both countries, in response to the article by Rosen and colleagues that identified contributing and facilitating factors in Israel.

640033,Transfer Learning Approach for Classification of Histopathology Whole Slide Images,2021-08-09,"Organisms respond in multiple ways to microbial infections. Pathogen invasion tipically triggers an inflammatory response where acute phase proteins (APP) have a key role. Pentraxins (PTX) are a family of highly conserved APP that play a part in the host defense against infection. The larger proteins of the family are simply named pentraxins, while c-reactive proteins (CRP) and serum amyloid proteins (SAA, SAP) are known as short pentraxins. Although high APP levels have been broadly associated with bacterial infections, there is a growing body of evidence revealing increased PTX, CRP and SAP expression upon viral infection. Furthermore, CRP, PTX and SAP have shown their potential as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease outcome. Likewise, the measurement of APP levels can be valuable to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines. From the practical point of view, the ability of APP to reduce viral infectivity has been observed in several virus-host models. This has prompted investigation efforts to assess the role of acute phase response proteins as immunoregulatory molecules and their potential as therapeutic reagents. This work aims to present an overview of the APP response to viral infections reviewing the current knowledge in the field.","Perez, Luis",Arch Biochem Biophys,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986119303212; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323216/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003986119303212,356

Given the severity of this pandemic, it will likely fundamentally impact the use of these services for years to come. Our institution and radiation oncology department have used telemedicine services for many years; we would like to report on our departmental experience to guide other radiation oncology practices on its long-term use for clinical evaluation and patient care. Our institution’s telemedicine program provides clinical services for a number of remote locations and represents the largest telehealth network in the world, with over 300 sites and 60,000 patient encounters a year. Specifically for our radiation oncology department, over 200 patient encounters occur via telemedicine a year. Patients report great appreciation and satisfaction with these encounters, as they eliminate the time and energy needed for travel from long distances. It has resulted in improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness as well. Based on our institutional experience, our long-term vision for telemedicine (after the COVID-19 pandemic has hopefully subsided) is as an excellent and cost-efficient tool to provide long-term follow-up for patients, especially for those who live far away in rural or underserved areas.","Lewis, Gary D.; Hatch, Sandra S.; Wiederhold, Lee R.; Swanson, Todd A.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300944; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391444/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300944?v=s5,356

We used multiparameter immunofluorescence to examine extensively heart autopsy tissue of 7 patients who died of COVID-19 compared to 12 control specimens, some with and some without cardiovascular disease. Consistent with prior reports, we found no evidence of viral infection or lymphocytic infiltration indicative of myocarditis but did observe frequent and extensive thrombosis in large and small vessels in the hearts of the COVID cohort, findings that were infrequent in controls. The endothelial lining of thrombosed vessels typically lacked evidence of cytokine-mediated endothelial activation, assessed as nuclear expression of transcription factors p65 (RelA), pSTAT1, or pSTAT3 or evidence of inflammatory activation assessed by expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), tissue factor, or von Willebrand factor (VWF). Intimal EC lining was also generally preserved with little evidence of cell death or desquamation. In contrast, there were frequent markers of neutrophil activation within myocardial thrombi of COVID-infected patients including neutrophil-platelet aggregates, neutrophil-rich clusters within macrothrombi, and evidence of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. These findings point to alterations in circulating neutrophils rather than the endothelium as contributors to the increased thrombotic diathesis in the hearts of COVID-19 patients.","Johnson, Justin E.; McGuone, Declan; Xu, Mina L.; Jane-Wit, Dan; Mitchell, Richard N.; Libby, Peter; Pober, Jordan S.",Am J Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944021004296?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944021004296; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599881/,356

We report a lineage data collected from hospitals in the Kanto region of Japan. Methods We performed whole genome sequencing in specimens of 198 COVID-19 patients at 13 collaborating hospitals in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions underwent to differentiate and classify the viral lineages. Results More than 90% of the strains belonged to Clade 20B and two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) have been detected predominantly in the Kanto region. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient in November 2020, belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in western United States. The patient had no history of overseas travel and no contact with anyone who had travelled abroad, suggesting that this strain appeared likely to have been imported from western United States, across the strict quarantine barrier. Conclusion B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 have been identified predominantly in the Kanto region and B.1.346 of clade 20C in one patient was probably imported from western United States. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals can be significantly advantageous for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.","Kodai, A.; Takako, S.; Toshiki, T.; Yuka, I.; Hirotsugu, I.; Yoshifumi, U.; Shunsuke, U.; Jun, G.; Natsuo, T.; Yuriko, T.; Junpei, K.; Hiroyuki, N.; Susumu, F.; Shikou, S.; Morio, N.; Kazuhiro, U.; Takahiko, M.; Jun, I.; Kenichiro, Y.; Toshio, K.; Shinji, M.; Kazuhiro, A.; Tamotsu, E.; Haruhiko, S.; Naoki, H.; Masayuki, A.; Yuko, K.; Makoto, S.; Kenjiro, K.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250798; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250798v1?rss=1,356

An international group of radiation oncologists agreed to assess, integrate, and interpret the existing evidence into a practical report to guide clinicians in their daily management of breast cancer patients.

This study was aimed to assess awareness, attitude and expectations of physiotherapy students on telerehabilitation. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey employed systematic probability sampling technique to recruit 200 physiotherapy students. A self-developed questionnaire which was tested for its face and content validity was used to obtain data. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 21.2 ± 2.04 years. There was higher prevalence of moderate awareness (43%) and positive attitude towards telerehabilitation (39%). Majority of the respondents (62%) had high expectation towards future telerehabilitation products and services. There was significant association between level of awareness of telerehabilitation and age (X(2) = 7.119; p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: The responding students in this study are by age in the class of digital natives, who should be conversant with technology. This could account for the higher moderate level of awareness of telerehabilitation. However, the higher rates of negative attitude towards telerehabilitation could be attributed to prevailing barriers to its utilization in Nigeria. Nonetheless, a large percentage of the students had high expectations for the future of telerehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Nigerian physiotherapy students have moderate awareness and high expectation for future telerehabilitation applications. However, a larger number of them hold negative attitude towards it use.","C.E, Mbada; T.A., Baderinwa; C.T., Sanuade; B., Ademoyegun Adekola; Fatoye, Clara; Maikudi, Laminde; Fatoye, Francis",Med Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619445/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-021-01234-w,356
642990,Cleaning the River Ganga: Impact of lockdown on water quality and future implications on river rejuvenation strategies,2020-07-11,"In this work we present an analysis of the two major strategies currently implemented around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing & shelter-in-place measures to protect the susceptible, and testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that a ""brute-force"" approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient.","Humphrey, L.; Thommes, E.

643153,"Mask on, Mask off: The Role of Comprehensive Craniofacial Care in Addressing Patient Safety and COVID-19 Mandates during School Reopening",2021-07-09,"Introduction :- In current COVID19 situation, we have tried to formulate a practical approach for managing haematology patients, which we have been following for the last four months at our centre. Cancer can kill; COVID also can kill. The aim is to be alive till the end of pandemic - both patients and doctors. Some general points for consideration: Due to lockdown and general panic, the stocks in Blood Banks are in an all-time low. So transfusions and donor arrangements have to be dealt judiciously. [6,7] Telemedicine was encouraged to reduce hospital visits in all chronic follow up patients who are stable with safe blood counts. Our Haematology Management Protocol - COVID19 Acute Myeloid Leukaemia For Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia cases it was the same as before. Acute Myeloid Leukaemia - NON-M3 We admitted all these patients with one attendee for few hours in COVID suspect ward and did COVID19 test before starting treatment. We were worried about intense 7+3 induction regimen. Hypomethylating agent (Subcutaneous Azacitidine or five-day protocol Decitabine) + Venetoclax or Midostaurin was preferred than a 7+3 nightmare. For consolidation, we continued either hypomethylating agents or preferred 1.5gm cytarabine BD on Day 1,2,3. This protocol had a minimal blood product requirement and lessened the chance of febrile neutropenia. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia We did a 50% dose reduction of induction drugs and used minimal steroids In elderly patients, Vincristine + steroids were considered and few received 50% dose adjusted R-HYPER-CVAD / MAC For Consolidation we gave home-based Subcutaneous Cytarabine or switched to oral 6-MP/Methotrexate maintenance. We tried to keep WBC counts >2,000/microL in maintenance patients. Myelodysplastic Syndromes Higher-risk MDS (IPSS-R score of >3.5): We gave Hypomethylating agents (without reducing doses). We made Transfusion cut-off as Hb < 7gm and Platelet < 10,000/microL or clinical bleeding. Myelo- proliferative Neoplasms the protocol was the same like before. Myeloma [12] For Newly Diagnosed cases if <65 years -VRd x 4 cycles, followed by autograft & Lenalidomide maintenance protocol were continued.We converted Bortezomib to no more than weekly injections.We continued myeloma autograft with 140mg/m2 Melphalan. For Maintenance, we continued single-agent iMID. For Relapse - we tried weekly Carfilzomib with Pomalidomide. Hodgkin Lymphoma We gave ABVD every two weeks with Peg GCSF or mid-cycle home GCSF. This avoided severe neutropenia. We used liberal prophylactic antibiotics. In relapsed cases, Gemcitabine based or three-day admission DHAP salvage were given. We did dose adjusted BEAM autografts. Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma Indolent NHL: In asymptomatic patients, Wait & Watch policy with monthly monitoring was done. We gave R-CVP. Oral Ibrutinib home therapy for Marginal zone, Mantle cell, Small cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia. Relapsed /Refractory cases, we used Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib with or without Rituximab. High-grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma If fit - R-CHOP 14/21 was given with GCSF support. For Frail patients, we preferred R-CVP. Suspected CNS lymphoma, we gave R-CHOP with IT Methotrexate than HDMTx. In few patients, we considered Lenalidomide / Ibrutinib maintenance.Dose adjusted BEAM autografts were done. Bone marrow transplant We did a detailed discussion about the pros and cons with patient and attendee. We admitted them in a separate block and got both tested for COVID19. The donor was made to stay as attendee for the patient. We shifted them inside transplant unit and observed for a week to rule out COIVD symptoms. For autograft , we did around 30% dose reduction but for allograft, no drug dose modification was done. Once engrafted, they were discharged early and kept on follow-up. From first lockdown to mid June 2020 , we completed twelve bone marrow transplants in our centre which included five AML haplo-identical transplants. Conclusion As we wait for the situation to better, the normal functioning of hospitals may take some more time even months. These above are the methods we are following in our MIOT hospital at Chennai, India the city which has got around 30,000 COVID19 cases during submission. Our advice is where ever feasible, we should try to stick to time tested conventional protocols. The above protocols may be useful temporarily till the COVID crisis is over.

This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community. A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others. The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted. Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and subsequent virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.","Gordon, Rebecca K.; Kotowski, Ingrid K.; Coulson, Kari F.; Link, Donald; MacKenzie, Alexandra; Bowling-Heyward, Joyce",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508430/,356

Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated to analyze predictors of intention to vaccinate. Fifty-eight percent of parents intended to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and 51% intended to have their child vaccinated. Significant predictors for the intention to get vaccinated and for having the child vaccinated included stronger parental confidence in one’s knowledge about prevention measures and lower beliefs that policy measures were exaggerated.

We sought to determine the efficacy of early administration of anti-interleukin 6 therapy in reducing hospital mortality and progression to mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 11,512 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to a New York health system from March to May 2020. Tocilizumab was administered to subjects at the nasal cannula level of oxygen support to maintain an oxygen saturation of >88%. The Charlson comorbidity index was used as an objective assessment of the burden of comorbidities to predict 10-year mortality. The primary outcome of interest was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were progression to mechanical ventilation; the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and renal failure; and the change in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels after tocilizumab administration. Propensity score matching by using a 1:2 protocol was used to match the tocilizumab and non-tocilizumab groups to minimize selection bias. The groups were matched on baseline demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and body mass index; Charlson comorbidity index score; laboratory markers, including ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein values; and the maximum oxygen requirement at the time of tocilizumab administration. Mortality outcomes were evaluated based on the level of oxygen requirement and the day of hospitalization at the time of tocilizumab administration. RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality was significantly reduced in the tocilizumab group when tocilizumab was administered at the nasal cannula level (10.4% vs 22.0%; P = .002). In subjects who received tocilizumab at the nasal cannula level, the progression to mechanical ventilation was reduced versus subjects who were initially on higher levels of oxygen support (6.3% vs 18.7%; P < .001). There was no improvement in mortality when tocilizumab was given at the time of requiring non-rebreather, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator, or invasive ventilator.

Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus particles in the diarrhea fluid sample and the infected HRT‐18 cell cultures. This virus possessed hemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities and caused cytopathic effects in HRT‐18 cells but not in MDBK, GBK and FE cells. One of four S‐specific monoclonal antibodies reacted in Western blots with HECV‐4408, BCV‐L9 and BCV‐LY138 but not with HCV‐OC43, and two reacted with BCV‐L9 but not with HECV‐4408, BCV‐LY138 and HCV‐OC43. One S‐specific and two N‐specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains. cDNA encompassing the 3′ 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV‐L9 and BCV‐LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV‐OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV‐4408 and BCV. A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the nonstructural genes of HCV‐OC43 was not detected in HECV‐4408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV‐4408 and the virulent wild‐type BCV. Forty‐nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV‐4408 and HCV‐OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV‐4408 and BCVLY138. We thus conclude that the strain HECV‐4408 is a hemagglutinating enteric coronavirus that is biologically, antigenically and genomically more closely related to the virulent BCVLY138 than to HCV‐OC43. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Zhang, X.

648535,Antibody Responses to Natural SARS-CoV-2 Infection or after COVID-19 Vaccination,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: In early 2013, a novel avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged in China, and has caused sporadic human infections. The incubation period is the delay from infection until onset of symptoms, and varies from person to person. Few previous studies have examined whether the duration of the incubation period correlates with subsequent disease severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data of period of exposure on 395 human cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in China in a Bayesian framework using a Weibull distribution. We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatal cases with a mean of 3.7 days (95% credibility interval, CrI: 3.4–4.1), compared to a mean of 3.3 days (95% CrI: 2.9–3.6) for the 222 non-fatal cases, and the difference in means was marginally significant at 0.47 days (95% CrI: -0.04, 0.99). There was a statistically significant correlation between a longer incubation period and an increased risk of death after adjustment for age, sex, geographical location and underlying medical conditions (adjusted odds ratio 1.70 per day increase in incubation period; 95% credibility interval 1.47–1.97). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases. The underlying biological mechanisms leading to this association deserve further exploration.","Virlogeux, Victor; Yang, Juan; Fang, Vicky J.; Feng, Luzhao; Tsang, Tim K.; Jiang, Hui; Wu, Peng; Zheng, Jiandong; Lau, Eric H.

648710,"Automated CT Lung Density Analysis of Viral Pneumonia and Healthy Lungs Using Deep Learning-Based Segmentation, Histograms and HU Thresholds",2021-04-21,"INTRODUCTION: To mitigate the spread of the pandemic coronavirus infection (COVID-19), governments across the world have adopted “lockdowns” which have confined many individuals to their homes. This disrupts normal life routines, elements of which are important circadian cues. The pandemic is also associated with new stressors, altered roles, and uncertainties about health and economic security, which are also likely to affect sleep. The current study is an online survey of sleep experience, routines, physical activity, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, to study the alterations associated with the lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was conducted in early May 2020 using a questionnaire circulated through social media platforms. Questions related to demographic characteristics, current and previous sleep schedules, routine, and working patterns. Insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index - 4), Stress (Perceived Stress Scale - 4), anxiety and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - 4) and physical activity (International Physical Activities Questionnaire) were assessed using standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 958 valid responses were received. Compared to the prelockdown period, there was a shift to a later bedtime and waking time, with a reduction in night-time sleep and an increase in day-time napping. These effects were visible across occupational groups, but mostly affected working individuals except health professionals. Sleep quality deteriorated across groups. Reductions in sleep duration were associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown is associated with changes in sleep schedule and in the quantity and quality of night-time sleep. Although these changes are associated with elevated rates of emotional symptoms, it is unclear from these cross-sectional results, whether sleep deterioration produces psychological distress, or vice versa.","Gupta, Ravi; Grover, Sandeep; Basu, Aniruddha; Krishnan, Vijay; Tripathi, Adarsh; Subramanyam, Alka; Nischal, Anil; Hussain, Arshad; Mehra, Aseem; Ambekar, Atul; Saha, Gautam; Mishra, Kshirod Kumar; Bathla, Manish; Jagiwala, Mukesh; Manjunatha, Narayana; Nebhinani, Naresh; Gaur, Navendu; Kumar, Niraj; Dalal, Pronob Kumar; Kumar, Pankaj; Midha, Purav Kumar; Daga, Ritu; Tikka, Sai Krishna; Praharaj, Samir Kumar; Goyal, Sandeep Kumar; Kanchan, Shweta; Sarkar, Siddharth; Das, Sourav; Sarkhel, Sujit; Padhy, Susanta Kumar; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Satyanarayana Rao, T S; Dubey, Vaibhav; Menon, Vikas; Chhabra, Vishal; Lahan, Vivekanand; Avasthi, Ajit",Indian J Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_523_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165382/,356

The major clinical manifestations of COVID‐19 include a range from asymptomatic presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients usually managed with immunosuppressive agents, hence, they are at a higher risk of infections [2].

This study analyzes its propagation and evaluates statistically the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. METHODS: We apply a variation of the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model to describe the temporal-spatial evolution of the disease across 33 provincial regions in China, where the disease was first identified. We employ Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo methods to estimate the model and to characterize a dynamic transmission network, which enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of various local and national policies. RESULTS: The spread of the disease in China was predominantly driven by community transmission within regions, which dropped substantially after local governments imposed various lockdown policies. Further, Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of mobility restrictions across regions. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial transmission network is able to differentiate the effect of the local lockdown policies and the cross-region mobility restrictions. We conclude that both are important policy tools for curbing the disease transmission. The coordination between central and local governments is important in suppressing the spread of infectious diseases.","Oka, Tatsushi; Wei, Wei; Zhu, Dan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280197/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254403,356

Parental involvement (PI) is considered as an essential factor for SC, contributing to promote good students’ educational results, as well as better social functioning. The present study aimed to analyze the mediating effect of PI on the relationship between SC and BP, taking into consideration the school personnel perceptions. A total of 329 school personnel (teachers versus no teachers) aged between 29 and 66 (M = 50.78, SD = 7.56), mainly female (79%), were integrated in the sample. Based on the perception of the school personnel, the results indicate moderate level of PI and SC, as well as the existence of different BP in the school context. The mediating effect of PI in the relationship between the SC and BP has been demonstrated. These results suggest that, if the SC and PI are improved, it could be an effective strategy to enhance the social functioning of students in the school context. This study thus contributes to a comprehensive empirical analysis of how PI can improve the relationship between the SC and the BP of Portuguese students.","Caridade, Sónia Maria Martins; Sousa, Hélder Fernando Pedrosa e; Pimenta Dinis, Maria Alzira",Behav Sci (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bs10080129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784916/,356

Grossly, there were patchy or diffuse areas of endocardial thickening affecting the left ventricle. The more common patchy endocardial lesions occurred as large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Microscopically, regardless of the gross pattern, the thickened endocardium contained various numbers of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemical findings were indicative of smooth muscle differentiation in mesenchymal cells. These cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; it was considered that the mesenchymal cells contributed to the formation of the endocardial lesions. In addition, multiple left ventricular ‘false tendons’ were invariably included within the trabecular or broad fibrous bands, providing a framework for formation of those bands. Evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases, and no viral genomes were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 of the hearts. These observations suggest that any relationship between feline RCM and a virus-induced inflammatory response seems unlikely.","Kimura, Y.; Karakama, S.; Hirakawa, A.; Tsuchiaka, S.; Kobayashi, M.; Machida, N.",J Comp Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2016.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997516300585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27392420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997516300585,356

Our previous work showed that in addition to the conserved coronavirus double membrane vesicles (DMVs), Beau-R, an apathogenic strain of avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), induces regions of ER that are zippered together and tethered open-necked double membrane spherules that resemble replication organelles induced by other +RNA viruses. Here we compared structures induced by Beau-R with the pathogenic lab strain M41 to determine whether membrane rearrangements are strain dependent. Interestingly, M41 was found to have a low spherule phenotype. We then compared a panel of pathogenic, mild and attenuated IBV strains in ex vivo tracheal organ culture (TOC). Although the low spherule phenotype of M41 was conserved in TOCs, each of the other tested IBV strains produced DMVs, zippered ER and spherules. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation for the presence of DMVs with spherules, suggesting that these structures are spatially and temporally linked. Our data indicate that virus induced membrane rearrangements are fundamentally linked to the viral replicative machinery. However, coronavirus replicative apparatus clearly has the plasticity to function in different structural contexts.","Maier, Helena J.; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Bickerton, Erica; Keep, Sarah M.; Alrashedi, Hasan; Hall, Ross; Britton, Paul",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27255716/,356
654839,Complex dynamics in susceptible-infected models for COVID-19 with multi-drug resistance,2020-08-29,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to affect individuals, communities, and health systems worldwide. Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving children’s health globally. RECENT FINDINGS: In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. SUMMARY: The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes. Child health providers should advocate for an equitable response to COVID-19 that prioritizes the health of vulnerable children and furthers the gains made in global child health.","Garcia-Prats, Anthony J.; McAdams, Ryan M.; Matshaba, Mogomotsi; Thahane, Lineo; Butteris, Sabrina M.; Conway, James H.; Slutsker, Mandy; St Clair, Nicole E.; Haq, Heather",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996382/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00241-6,356
655109,"Nanostructures for Biosensing, with a Brief Overview on Cancer Detection, IoT, and the Role of Machine Learning in Smart Biosensors",2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is an adverse prognostic marker. Coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) is a measure of coronary microvascular function and can be assessed using Doppler echocardiography. Reduced CFVR in ESRD has been attributed to factors such as diabetes, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. The contributory role of other mediators important in the development of cardiovascular disease in ESRD has not been studied. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of CMD in a cohort of kidney transplant candidates and to look for associations of CMD with markers of anaemia, bone mineral metabolism and chronic inflammation. METHODS: Twenty-two kidney transplant candidates with ESRD were studied with myocardial contrast echocardiography, Doppler CFVR assessment and serum multiplex immunoassay analysis. Individuals with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension or ischaemic heart disease were excluded. RESULTS: 7/22 subjects had CMD (defined as CFVR < 2). Demographic, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters and serum biomarkers were similar between subjects with and without CMD. Subjects with CMD had significantly lower haemoglobin than subjects without CMD (102 g/L ± 12 vs. 117 g/L ± 11, p = 0.008). There was a positive correlation between haemoglobin and CFVR (r = 0.7, p = 0.001). Similar results were seen for haematocrit. In regression analyses, haemoglobin was an independent predictor of CFVR (β = 0.041 95% confidence interval 0.012–0.071, p = 0.009) and of CFVR < 2 (odds ratio 0.85 95% confidence interval 0.74–0.98, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Among kidney transplant candidates with ESRD, there is a high prevalence of CMD, despite the absence of traditional risk factors. Anaemia may be a potential driver of microvascular dysfunction in this population and requires further investigation.","Radhakrishnan, Ashwin; Pickup, Luke C.; Price, Anna M.; Law, Jonathan P.; McGee, Kirsty C.; Fabritz, Larissa; Senior, Roxy; Steeds, Richard P.; Ferro, Charles J.; Townend, Jonathan N.",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902440/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-02025-2,356
656007,On the Use of Deep Learning for Imaging-Based COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-rays,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plasma citrulline, a non-protein amino acid, is a biochemical marker of small intestine enterocyte mass in humans. Indeed, citrulline is highly correlated with residual bowel length in patients with short bowel syndrome. It is known to be synthesised in epithelial cells of the small intestine from other amino acids (precursors). Citrulline is then released into systemic circulation and interconverted into arginine in kidneys. If plasma citrulline concentration depends on abundance of intestinal amino acid transporters is not known. The aim of the present study was to explore whether plasma citrulline concentration correlates with the expression of intestinal amino acid transporters. Furthermore, we assessed if arginine in urine correlates with plasma citrulline. METHODS: Duodenal samples, blood plasma and urine were collected from 43 subjects undergoing routine gastroduodenoscopy. mRNA expression of seven basolateral membrane amino acid transporters/transporter subunits were assessed by real-time PCR. Plasma and urine amino acid concentrations of citrulline, its precursors and other amino acids were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography measurements. Amino acid transporter mRNA expression was correlated with blood plasma and urine levels of citrulline and its precursors using Spearman's rank correlation. Likewise, urine arginine was correlated with plasma citrulline. RESULTS: Plasma citrulline correlated with the mRNA expression of basolateral amino acid transporter LAT4 (Spearman's r = 0.467, p = 0.028) in small intestine. None of the other basolateral membrane transporters/transporter subunits assessed correlated with plasma citrulline. Plasma citrulline correlated with urinary arginine, (Spearman's r = 0.419, p = 0.017), but not with urinary citrulline or other proteinogenic amino acids in the urine. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed for the first time that small intestinal basolateral LAT4 expression correlates with plasma citrulline concentration. This finding indicates that LAT4 has an important function in mediating citrulline efflux from enterocytes. Furthermore, urine arginine correlated with plasma citrulline, indicating arginine in the urine as possible additional marker for small intestine enterocyte mass. Finally, basolateral LAT4 expression along the human small intestine was shown for the first time.","Maric, Stefano; Flüchter, Pascal; Guglielmetti, Laura Chiara; Staerkle, Ralph Fabian; Sasse, Tom; Restin, Tanja; Schneider, Christoph; Holland-Cunz, Stefan Gerhard; Crenn, Pascal; Vuille-dit-Bille, Raphael Nicolas",Clin Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561420305306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077272/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420305306?v=s5,356

The objective of the study was to summarize the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with HCQ, CQ, and AZM use during the COVID-19 national emergency declaration and compare the results to known adverse reactions listed in the drugs’ package inserts. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used. The publicly available Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 were downloaded. A disproportionality analysis was conducted using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) to identify possible ADE signals. Poisson regression was used to assess if the number of ADE reports for the three drugs increased over time. Results There was a significant increasing trend in reported ADEs for both HCQ (p < 0.001) and AZM (p < 0.001). Before the national emergency declaration, there were 592 reported ADEs for the three drugs compared to 2,492 ADEs reported since March 13, 2020. Fifty-nine (51.8%) ADEs were listed in the prescribing information, and the remaining 55 (48.2%) were not listed representing possible signals. Conclusions Our results show the reported ADEs for HCQ and AZM have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences were observed in both the type of and frequency of the top reported ADEs for the three selected drugs before and after the national emergency declaration. Even though causation cannot be determined from ADE reports, further investigation of some reports may be warranted.

A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effect of different stages of the pandemic, in terms of percentage of infected population, on the probability of infection. Results reveal that estimates of viral loads in sewage at the entrance of WWTPs ranged from 1.03x102 to 1.31x104 GC.mL-1 (0.1 to 13.06 PFU.mL-1, respectively) and that estimated risks for the aggressive and extreme scenarios (6.5x10-3 and 3.1x10-2, respectively) were likely to be above a WHO benchmark of tolerable risk used for virus infection of 10-3 and higher than the risk of infection of E. coli, used herein as common pathogen indicator for a relative comparison, thus reinforcing the concern of sewage systems as a transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2.

665035,Early Detection of Coronavirus Cases Using Chest X-ray Images Employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches,2020-06-08,"Although it is widely accepted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has adversely affected the Global South’s most vulnerable refugee communities, they have received little attention. There have been gaps in testing, which is fundamental to treat and isolate patients and make data-driven decisions to protect the refugee community. Therefore, it is imperative to holistically implement policies to curtail COVID-19 in refugee camps to ensure that refugees are safe and protected from the pandemic. Processes for timely diagnosis and treatment, quick isolation and contact tracing are essential to keep refugees safe. Furthermore, it is crucial to encourage protective behaviours and raise awareness about hygiene and social prevention to dampen disease transmission. Refugees in the Global South have been disproportionately affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, facing financial hardship and social injustice throughout. Refugees in Africa have also faced threats to their security, being subjected to torture, disappearance, or even killings in their host countries. The pandemic has exposed gender inequalities, with females being the most affected, and health inequities in the refugee community in Africa. There is a need for international organizations like the African Union, United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to take serious action regarding the refugee situation in Africa. Food aid for refugees in Africa should be increased as quickly as possible and refugees’ security must be guaranteed. Of equal importance, there must be justice for the death or disappearance of refugees. It is imperative to end discrimination against refugees and support the promotion of gender equity.","Manirambona, Emery; Wilkins, Laura; Lucero-Prisno III, Don Eliseo",Health Promot Perspect,https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2021.33,356

The base coverage of each primer against diverse BVDVs were more than 99% in each base position. The one step LAMP test with the P25 primer set could detect both BVDV1 (TK) and BVDV2 (KZ), but did not amplify 5 other bovine viruses. Detection limit of the LAMP test was 10(3) copies of synthesized DNAs, and 10(−3) and 10(−4) dilutions of viral RNAs of TK and KZ strains, respectively, whereas that with current Aebischer’s primer set was 10(−2) dilution and negative of these RNAs, respectively. All of the 63 viral RNA samples of persistently infected (PI) cattle, consisting of the 1a (12), 1b (31), 1c (11), and 2a (9) subgenotypes, were broadly detected with the P25, while only 65% of them were positive with Aebischer’s primer set. The validation study showed that the RT-LAMP test with the P25 had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity against that with updated Vilcek’s PCR primers. Also, by using the P26 primer set which contained 3 species-specific primers, all 63 RNA samples were clearly distinguished from BVDV1 or BVDV2 by the typing RT-LAMP test. These results indicate that the one step RT-LAMP test using P25 or P26 primer sets would be useful for broad detection and rapid differentiation of BVDV1 and BVDV2.","MUNGTHONG, Kanumporn; KHAING, Soe Thiri; OTSUBO, Takehiko; HATANAKA, Chihiro; YONEYAMA, Shuji; HISAMATSU, Shin; MURAKAMI, Hironobu; TSUKAMOTO, Kenji",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162783/; https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.20-0742,356

670014,Fully automated unified prognosis of Covid-19 chest X-ray/CT scan images using Deep Covix-Net model,2021-08-03,"The community lockdown measures implemented in the United States from late March to late May of 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in the community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods (mention what happens if lockdown measures were extended by two weeks). We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Iboi, Enahoro; Gumel, Abba B.",Math Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818515/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420301164; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420301164?v=s5,356

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted on the dental practitioners of Uttarakhand, India. The dentists were approached by obtaining their E-mail address from the heads of dental institutions or dental association branches in the state. The knowledge, attitude, and practices along with apparent challenges of practicing during pandemic were assessed using closed-ended questionnaire. The relationship between the mean scores and demographic variables was determined using Student's unpaired t-test by keeping the significance level below 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 759 respondents, a total of 458 respondents were male (60%), whereas 301 (40%) were female. The mean knowledge scores were higher in females (11.06 ± 2.12) compared to males (9.72 ± 4.53), which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mean practice score was lower in males (17.49 ± 6.47) compared to females (19.26 ± 6.69) and likewise lower scores were seen in graduates compared to specialists and these differences were again statistically significant (P < 0.05). Majority of the study participants felt that following various safety guidelines were not feasible (96.97%) and too expensive (96.44%) and considered them as a challenge. CONCLUSION: It is imperative that dentists should be fully prepared before resuming their services and reach the right kind of awareness to limit the spread of the disease.","Kumar, Mukesh; Sonone, Truppti P.; Shukla, Alok Kumar; Singh, Kumar Tathagat; Kishore, Jay; Harsha, M.",J Educ Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_786_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222503/,356

In this work, we quantitatively compare the effects of elderly population (60 years old or more) selective isolation with a no isolation scenario using an adapted Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed (SEIR) compartmental model. For these simulated scenarios, we estimate the number of hospitalizations and deaths for different Brazilian cities, including those due to the lack of hospital beds. Our simulations show that, for Sao Paulo City, the isolation of the elderly would reduce demand for hospital beds by 9% and deaths by 16% compared to the no intervention scenario. Other Brazilian cities follow the same pattern, with median reductions of deaths ranging from 12-18%. We conclude that the social distancing of the elderly would be marginally effective and would not avoid health system collapse in several Brazilian cities.","Ribeiro Venturieri, V.; Silva Goncalves, M.; Rios Fuck, V.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249495; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249495v1?rss=1,356

Personal protective equipment and hand hygiene are a must while handling any suspected COVID-19 patient. Apart from that, there are several other things, which should be followed in ICU and specifically while caring for a patient on ventilator. There are a large number of interventions done while treating any critically ill patient in ICU, which can generate aerosols and exaggerate spread of COVID-19, which include high-flow nasal cannula, NIV, nebulization, suctioning, bag and mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy.

Roem. leaves",2014-05-28,"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of COVID-19 poses a global health emergency. One of the most frequently reported data is sex-related severity and mortality: according to the last available analysis on 239,709 patients in Italy, lethality is 17.7% in men and 10.8% in women, with 59% of total deaths being men. Interestingly, the infection rate is lower in males than in females, with 45.8% and 54.2% of positive cases, respectively, suggesting that gender-related factor may worsen disease evolution. A tentative hypothesis to explain these findings is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in viral infection. PURPOSE: In this review, we summarize the available evidence pointing to gender-related differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, from both genetic and endocrine points of view. RESULTS: Altogether, available evidence points toward two not-mutually exclusive mechanisms in gender susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex hormonal regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. On one hand, ACE2 expression could be increased in women, either by estrogens or constitutively by X chromosome inactivation escape or by reduced methylation, providing a larger reservoir of ACE2 to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of RAS regulatory axis. On the other, low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, despite the increased expression of ACE2, which represents the Trojan horse for SARS-CoV-2 entry. CONCLUSIONS: Both mechanisms consistently point to the role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in the differential severity and lethality of COVID-19 in men and women.","Foresta, C.; Rocca, M.

We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focusing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases from inception to 1 October 2020, without language restrictions. We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) and a modified TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement for AI. We critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies. Results: Of fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Studies had low adherence to reporting guidelines, with particularly poor reporting on model calibration and blinding of outcome and predictor assessment. Of the remaining three studies, two evaluated the prognostic utility of deep learning-based lung segmentation software and one studied an AI-based system for resource optimisation in the ICU. These studies had similar issues in methodology, validation, and reporting.

METHODS: Retrospective assessment of all Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scans performed for any clinical / oncological reason from 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Results of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved for all patients with lung consolidations and/or peripheral ground glass opacities characterized by increased metabolism to evaluate any possible association with the viral infection. RESULTS: Seven (4%) out of 172 FDG-PET scans were included. Six out of seven patients (85%) had positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, while one patient (15%) had possible (not PCR confirmed) COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Suspicious accidental COVID-19 findings in Nuclear Medicine Department need to be reported and appropriately evaluated to implement proper supportive treatment and infection control measures.","Olivari, Laura; Riccardi, Niccolò; Rodari, Paola; Buonfrate, Dora; Diodato, Stefania; Formenti, Fabio; Angheben, Andrea; Salgarello, Matteo",Clin Transl Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989417/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40336-020-00388-8,356
688163,IoMT-Based Automated Detection and Classification of Leukemia Using Deep Learning,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China spread worldwide, resulting in a large number of deaths. METHODS: Temporary Ark hospitals (TAH) have played an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan. Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staffs, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on. RESULTS: Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment. Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals owing to aggravation of their condition. The achievement is to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in‐hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients and successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan. The successful model of TAH would rapidly and effectively control the spread of COVID‐19 in other cities. This article is protected by copyright.

689042,Development of a serological assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients,2020-09-13,"BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents and staff were included in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies. METHODS: We use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario. RESULTS: Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in the nursing home (among staff and residents combined) in each VE scenario. In scenarios with 50% and 90% VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, and asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents. However, this is outweighed by the reduction in symptomatic cases among staff. Higher frequency testing—more than once weekly—is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has lower efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.","Kahn, Rebecca; Holmdahl, Inga; Reddy, Sujan; Jernigan, John; Mina, Michael J; Slayton, Rachel B",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086877/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab517,356
689074,Deep Learning–Based COVID-19 Pneumonia Classification Using Chest CT Images: Model Generalizability,2021-06-29,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and characteristics of headache in patients with COVID-19 and whether there is an association between headache and anosmia and ageusia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, were assessed by neurologists. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included in the study, 63% were male; the median age was 58 years (IQR: 47–66). Forty-seven patients (64.4%) reported headaches, which had most frequently begun on the first day of symptoms, were bilateral (94%), presenting severe intensity (53%) and a migraine phenotype (51%). Twelve patients (16.4%) presented with headache triggered by coughing. Eleven (15%) patients reported a continuous headache. Twenty-eight patients (38.4%) presented with anosmia and 29 (39.7%) with ageusia. Patients who reported hyposmia/anosmia and/or hypogeusia/ageusia experienced headache more frequently than those without these symptoms (OR: 5.39; 95% CI:1.66–17.45; logistic regression). Patients with anosmia and ageusia presented headache associated with phonophobia more often compared to those with headache without these complaints (Chi-square test; p < 0.05). Headache associated with COVID-19 presented a migraine phenotype more frequently in those experiencing previous migraine (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Headaches associated with COVID-19 are frequent, are generally severe, diffuse, present a migraine phenotype and are associated with anosmia and ageusia.","Rocha-Filho, Pedro Augusto Sampaio; Magalhães, João Eudes",Cephalalgia,https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102420966770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33146035/,356

690513,Analyzing Particularities of Sensor Datasets for Supporting Data Understanding and Preparation,2021,"Background To limit societal and economic costs of lockdown measures, public health strategies are needed that control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneously allow lifting of disruptive measures. Regular universal random screening of large proportions of the population regardless of symptoms has been proposed as a possible control strategy. Methods We developed a mathematical model that includes test sensitivity depending on infectiousness for PCR-based and antigen-based tests, and different levels of onward transmission for testing and non-testing parts of the population. Only testing individuals participate in high-risk transmission events, allowing more transmission in case of unnoticed infection. We calculated the required testing interval and coverage to bring the effective reproduction number due to universal random testing (Rrt) below 1, for different scenarios of risk behavior of testing and non-testing individuals. Findings With R0 = 2.5, lifting all control measures for tested subjects with negative test results would require 100% of the population being tested every three days with a rapid test method with similar sensitivity as PCR-based tests. With remaining measures in place reflecting Re = 1.3, 80% of the population would need to be tested once a week to bring Rrt below 1. With lower proportions tested and with lower test sensitivity, testing frequency should increase further to bring Rrt below 1. With similar Re values for tested and non-tested subjects, and with tested subjects not allowed to engage in higher risk events, at least 80% of the populations needs to tested every five days to bring Rrt below. The impact of the test-sensitivity on the reproduction number is far less than the frequency of testing. Interpretation Regular universal random screening followed by isolation of infectious individuals is not a viable strategy to reopen society after controlling a pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2. More targeted screening approaches are needed to better use rapid testing such that it can effectively complement other control measures.","Bootsma, M. C.; Kretzschmar, M.
