5413,Learning Theory as Teaching Resource: Enhancing Students’ Understanding of Economic Concepts,2005,"In this paper, epidemic spread with the staged progression model on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is studied. First, the epidemic threshold of the simple staged progression model is given. Then the staged progression model with birth and death is also considered. The case where infectivity is a nonlinear function of the nodes’ degree is discussed, too. Finally, the analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.","Zhang, Haifeng; Small, Michael; Fu, Xinchu",J Syst Sci Complex,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089252/,483
5692,COPD in Asia: Where East Meets West,2015-12-28,"OBJECTIVE: To provide cutting-edge information for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community-acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin <0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77–98%) and 93% (90–99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation <90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.",J Pediatr (Rio J),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094337/,483
6245,Anthropocène et viroses émergentes,2016-06-24,"The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury and repair responses. The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by ∼20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This Review summarizes the present and future pharmacological manipulation of this important system.

There is a growing body of evidence that stone disease is not simply a disorder of the kidney. In fact, nephrolithiasis is clearly a systemic disorder. Conditions associated with stone disease include the classic ones such as inflammatory bowel disease and primary hyperparathyroidism. More recent studies have demonstrated strong associations with obesity, gout, diabetes and hypertension.

7298,Self‐organized criticality in human epidemiology,2005-07-20,"Humanity is facing an increasing number of highly virulent and communicable diseases such as avian influenza. Researchers believe that avian influenza has potential to evolve into one of the deadliest pandemics. Combating these diseases requires in‐depth knowledge of their epidemiology. An effective methodology for discovering epidemiological knowledge is to utilize a descriptive, evolutionary, ecological model and use bio‐simulations to study and analyze it. These types of bio‐simulations fall under the category of computational evolutionary methods because the individual entities participating in the simulation are permitted to evolve in a natural manner by reacting to changes in the simulated ecosystem. This work describes the application of the aforementioned methodology to discover epidemiological knowledge about avian influenza using a novel eco‐modeling and bio‐simulation environment called SEARUMS. The mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS, its design, and the procedure for using SEARUMS are discussed. The bio‐simulations and multi‐faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS elucidate its ability to pinpoint timelines, epicenters, and socio‐economic impacts of avian influenza. This knowledge is invaluable for proactive deployment of countermeasures in order to minimize negative socioeconomic impacts, combat the disease, and avert a pandemic.","Rao, Dhananjai M.; Chernyakhovsky, Alexander; Rao, Victoria",AIP Conf Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108769/,483

This study assessed the safety and efficacy of TG01/GM-CSF in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients with stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone surgical resection (R0 or R1) received adjuvant gemcitabine with TG01/GM-CSF using two schedules of vaccination. Immune response was defined as a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and/or positive T-cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled between February 2013 and May 2016. Nineteen were treated with the high antigen burden, with four serious adverse reactions considered possibly related to TG01 treatment, including three allergic reactions. On this basis, a further 13 patients received a modified vaccination schedule with reduced antigen burden, with no serious adverse events related to TG01. Ninety-five percent patients in the main cohort and 92% in the modified cohort had a positive immune response. Median overall survival (OS) was 33.1 months, and median disease-free survival (DFS) was 13.9 months for the main cohort. For the modified cohort, the median OS was 34.3 months and median DFS was 19.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: TG01/GM-CSF with gemcitabine was well tolerated, with high levels of immune activation. OS and DFS compare favourably with published data for adjuvant gemcitabine.

Polyclonal antiserum was produced against purified Rubisco from the marine diatom Chaetoceros gracilis. The results of western immunoblotting demonstrated that the antiserum reacted positively with Rubisco from 38 species of algae and higher plants and failed to react with only three species of dinoflagellates and one prochlorophyte species. However, the binding affinity or the strength of the cross‐reaction for the polyclonal antiserum with purified Rubisco varied among species. The antiserum was then affinity purified against spinach Rubisco and its binding affinity for purified Rubisco determined by ELISA. Two taxonomic groupings resulted: one with high‐binding affinity (these species included chrysophytes, bacillariophytes, prymnesiophytes, and chlorophytes) and the other with low‐binding affinity (dinophytes and cyanophytes). Rubisco concentration per cell and light‐saturated rates of photosynthesis were highly correlated for cultures of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. These results indicate that affinity‐purified antiserum can be rigorously characterized for use in quantifying Rubisco concentration and for assessing the maximal photosynthetic potential of individual phytoplankton cells.","Orellana, Mhica V.; Perry, Mary Jane",Limnol Oceanogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165624/,483

18582,Analysis of different affective state multimodal recognition approaches with missing data-oriented to virtual learning environments,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND: WHO has launched an initiative aiming to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. Elimination is a long-term target that needs long-lasting commitment. To support local authorities in implementing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, we provide regional and country-specific estimates of cervical cancer burden and the projected impact of HPV vaccination among today's young girls who could develop cervical cancer if not vaccinated. METHODS: The expected number of cervical cancer cases in the absence of vaccination among girls born between 2005 and 2014 was quantified by combining age-specific incidence rates from GLOBOCAN 2018 and cohort-specific mortality rates by age from UN demographic projections. Preventable cancers were estimated on the basis of HPV prevalence reduction attributable to vaccination and the relative contribution of each HPV type to cervical cancer incidence. We assessed the number of cervical cancer cases preventable through vaccines targeting HPV types 16 and 18, with and without cross-protection, and through vaccines targeting HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. FINDINGS: Globally, without vaccination, the burden of cervical cancer in these birth cohorts is expected to reach 11·6 million (95% uncertainty interval 11·4–12·0) cases by 2094. Approximately 75% of the burden will be concentrated in 25 countries mostly located in Africa and Asia, where the future number of cases is expected to increase manyfold, reaching 5·6 million (5·4–6·0) cases in Africa and 4·5 million (4·4–4·6) cases in Asia. Worldwide immunisation with an HPV vaccine targeted to HPV types 16 and 18, with cross-protection against HPV types 31, 33, and 45, could prevent about 8·7 million (8·5–9·0) cases. INTERPRETATION: Detailed estimates of the increasing burden of cervical cancer and projected impact of HPV vaccination is of immediate relevance to public health decision makers. Shifting the focus of projections towards recently born girls who could develop cervical cancer if not vaccinated is fundamental to overcome stakeholders' hesitancy towards HPV vaccination.

The aim of this study was to evaluate BD articles published between 2010–2019 bibliometrically and to provide up-to-date data. A secondary aim was to present a different perspective using altmetric assessments. METHODS: This bibliometric and altmetric research was performed with data obtained from the Web of Science database. The key terms “Behcet's disease,” “Behcet's syndrome,” and “Behcet” were used for listing the articles. The number of articles, citation data, and active countries were determined. Trend and correlation analyses were performed. Altmetric attention scores (AASs) and Mendeley readers count (MRC) of the articles were acquired for the altmetric evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 5,201 articles were listed. After the exclusion criteria, a total of 2,163 articles were obtained for further analysis. A significant and increasing trend was detected in the number of articles from 2010 to 2019 (P < 0.001). Turkey (28.24%), China (9.57%), South Korea (9.20%), Japan (6.38%), and Italy (5.64%) were the five most productive countries. France, the United States and, the United Kingdom were the top three countries in respect of the average number of citations per article. A weak significant correlation was detected between the number of citations and AAS (P < 0.001). The number of citations was significantly and strongly correlated with the MRC (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: An increasing trend was found in BD research productivity. Although the Silk Road countries were prominent in the number of articles, a similar ranking was not valid for the average number of citations per article.","Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih; Akyol, Ahmet",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369313/,483

Now there was a bright new moon, and as usual the horns protruded to the east; and lo, suddenly, the upper horn split in two. From the middle of this division a firebrand burst forth, throwing over a considerable distance fire, hot coals and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the moon which was lower [than this] writhed as if troubled, and in the words of those who told this to me and who saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed as a beaten snake. It then returned to its former state. This phenomenon was repeated twelve times and more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random then returning to normal. And after these vibrations it became semi-dark from horn to horn, that is, throughout its length.

The traveler can be the target and sufferer from microbial threats; the traveler can also provide the microbial transport system. Traveling humans alter infectious diseases patterns by introducing pathogenic microbes or resistance, or virulence factors into new populations. The movement of pathogenic microbes through history has been intimately linked to the capacity of humans to travel and to migrate to new locations. Today, humans have the capacity to reach virtually any city in the world within a day or two. Travel to tropical and developing countries are increasing more rapidly than travel to developed countries, and all projections suggest that human travel will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Infectious diseases influence decisions about travel and trade; and travelers change the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Travel has played an essential role in the movement of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Rapid international air travel moved the virus that causes SARS to multiple countries within weeks. Travel has been and will continue to be important in the movement of human influenza. Travel consists of sequential shared environments, often with people from diverse regions of the world.

31273,From the Editor,2020-04-21,"The composition and distribution of littoral vegetation in four weir pools of the lower Murray were surveyed in summer 1994. Between‐weir gradients in the amplitude of water level fluctuations were reflected in the typical distributions of plants, with a 4–6 m elevational range in upper‐pool sites, where levels fluctuate most, and a 1–1.5 m band in the lower‐pool sites, where levels are more stable. Forty‐one of 48 species occurred across much of the longitudinal×elevational site matrix within this cone‐shaped distribution, indicating considerable tolerance to flooding and exposure; this was especially apparent for Phragmites australis, Cyperus spp. and Centipeda spp. The 41 species were represented in seven of nine water‐regime groups identified by cluster analysis. The remainder, found within ±1 m of the water surface in lower‐pool reaches, were aquatic macrophytes such as Vallisneria americana and Typha spp. and amphibious ‘mudmats’ such as Glossostigma elatinoides. Water regimes at given sites were measured by the number of days in 2 years flooded to any depth (>0 cm), or to 0–30 cm, and by days exposed by >100 cm. Inter‐pool differences in the median number of days flooded to >0 cm and 0–30 cm were 3–30% and <8%, respectively, for all species except Typha spp. but an order of magnitude for the number of days exposed by >100 cm. However, eight of 14 common or representative species analysed showed significant inter‐pool differences in the number of days flooded to >0 cm, indicating that sufficient variation exists to necessitate considerable intra‐pool replication to allow for the detection of statistical differences in a multi‐pool experiment. The practice of maintaining stable weir pool levels limits vegetation processes, e.g. germination, recruitment, decomposition.

Measurements of vibrations of real buildings are costly and laborious. Therefore the aim of the research is to propose the original numerical algorithm which allows us to predict, with high probability, the negative dynamic impact of traffic-induced vibrations on the examined building. The model has been based on machine learning. Firstly, the experimental tests have been conducted on different buildings using specialized equipment taking into account six factors: distance from the building to the edge of the road, type of surface, condition of road surface, condition of the building, the absorption of soil and the type of vehicle. Then, the numerical algorithm based on machine learning (using support vector machine) has been created. The results of the conducted analysis clearly show that the method can be considered as a good tool for predicting the impact of traffic-induced vibrations on buildings, being characterized by high reliability.","Jakubczyk-Gałczyńska, Anna; Jankowski, Robert",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304024/,483

A good fire alarm system should be small-sized, low-cost and effective to prevent fire accidents from happening. In this paper we introduce a smart fire alarm system used in kitchen as a representative scenario. The system captures both thermal and optical videos for temperature monitoring and person detection, which are further used to predict potential fire accident and avoid false alarm. Thermal videos are used to record the temperature change in region-of-interests, for example, cookware. YOLOv3-tiny algorithm is modified for person detection and can be iteratively improved with the hard examples gathered by the system. To implement the system on an edge device instead of a server, we propose a high-efficiency neural network inference computing framework called TuringNN. Comprehensive rules enable the system to appropriately respond to different situations. The proposed system has been proved effective in both experiments and numerous cases in complex practical applications.","Ma, Yibing; Feng, Xuetao; Jiao, Jile; Peng, Zhongdong; Qian, Shenger; Xue, Hui; Li, Hua",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304706/,483

This study explores the Corporate Social Responsibility priorities and performance of the largest 23 global retailers. This set of global retailers, who have a major impact on society, were studied in terms of social, environmental and sustainability practices and strategy, and there performance was analysed and evaluated. The study uses a four-dimensional Social, Economic, Environmental, Supply Chain model for sustainability performance evaluation. We rely on data collected from annual reports, and find that global retailers have addressed the business-society interface in relatively balanced ways for the different dimensions of CSR. Further, our findings indicate that global retailers in different regions have different CSR priorities. In particular, the data indicates that the US retailers place a lower priority on supply chain sustainability performance, followed by the Australians, while European retailers place a higher priority. The study concludes that while global retailers all pay attention to the same dimensions of CSR and do so differently in the different regions, the variation and lack of significant progress indicates that there is a role for stronger government regulation. This study contributes to the literature by shifting the analysis from country to a global level, is more objective in relying on reported data rather than interviews or surveys and provides a new analytical tool.","Rahdari, Amir; Sheehy, Benedict; Khan, Habib Zaman; Braendle, Udo; Rexhepi, Gadaf; Sepasi, Sahar",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7424317/,483

However, the rate of MTB and rifampicin resistant-MTB (RR-MTB) in the Nepalese setting has not been studied extensively. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the rate of MTB and RR-MTB and further determine the factors associated with it. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study, among national representative data of 990 consecutive presumptive TB resister of patients subjected to the GeneXpert test that presented to the tuberculosis referral hospital, was conducted over a one year period from February 2018 to January 2019. Significance for the difference for categorical data was performed by Chi-square test and factors associated with MTB and RR-MTB were assessed using binary logistic regression yielding OR with 95%CI. RESULTS: Of total 990 presumptive tuberculosis analyzed cases, median ages of the patients were 39±19.09 years and two-thirds of the patients were male 653 (66.0%). The estimated prevalence of MTB in presumptive TB patients was 13.8% (95%CI: 11.88%–16.16%), and risk for MTB was significantly associated with previously treated patients: OR: 10.4 (P<0.001). The estimated prevalence of RR-MTB in MTB confirmed patients was 10.2% (4.97%–15.1%). Our study confirmed no association of RR-TB with age, sex, ethnicity, geographical diversity and previous history of treatment failure (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of MTB and RR-MTB was high in Nepalese study population, and that being previously treated with anti-TB drug remained significant predictors for MTB; proactive measures are urgently needed to address the challenge of prompt diagnosis, early management and improved monitoring of treatment to limit the emergence drug-resistant MTB strains in the community.","Sah, Shiv Kumar; Bhattarai, Pramod Raj; Shrestha, Anjana; Dhami, Deepak; guruwacharya, Deepa; Shrestha, Renu",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7445509/,483

The convergence region of the B–S model solutions are clearly identified using h-curve and the closed form series solutions are produced using FGHAM. To verify the convergence of the proposed series solutions, sequence of errors are obtained by estimating the deviation between the exact solution and the series solution, which is increased in number of terms in the series. The convergence of sequence of errors is verified using the convergence criteria and the results are graphically illustrated. Moreover, the FGHAM approach has overcome the difficulties of applying multiple integration and differentiation procedures while obtaining the solution using well-established methods such as homotopy analysis method and homotopy perturbation method. The computational efficiency of the proposed method is analyzed using a comparative study. The advantage of the proposed method is shown with a numerical example using the comparative study between FGHAM and Monte Carlo simulation. Using the numerical example, analytical expression for the implied volatility is derived and the non-local behavior is studied for the various values of the fractional parameter. The results of FGHAM are statistically validated with the exact solution and the other existing computational methods.","Saratha, S.

Pigs at 21 days of age were administered either a combination of two mixable monovalent vaccines or a bivalent vaccine containing PCV2 and M. hyopneumoniae. Vaccination was followed with an M. hyopneumoniae challenge at 42 days of age (−14 days post challenge, dpc) and a PCV2d challenge at 56 days of age (0 dpc). Each vaccinated and challenged group was compared with the unvaccinated and challenged group for clinical, microbiological, immunologic, and pathologic differences.

Few studies have reported the occurrence of asynchrony in brain-injured patients. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, type and severity of patient–ventilator asynchrony in mechanically ventilated patients with brain injury. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled acute brain-injured patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Esophageal pressure monitoring was established after enrollment. Flow, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure–time waveforms were recorded for a 15-min interval, four times daily for 3 days, for visually detecting asynchrony by offline analysis. At the end of each dataset recording, the respiratory drive was determined by the airway occlusion maneuver. The asynchrony index was calculated to represent the severity. The relationship between the prevalence and the severity of asynchrony with ventilatory modes and settings, respiratory drive, and analgesia and sedation were determined. Association of severe patient–ventilator asynchrony, which was defined as an asynchrony index ≥ 10%, with clinical outcomes was analyzed. RESULTS: In 100 enrolled patients, a total of 1076 15-min waveform datasets covering 330,292 breaths were collected, in which 70,156 (38%) asynchronous breaths were detected. Asynchrony occurred in 96% of patients with the median (interquartile range) asynchrony index of 12.4% (4.3%–26.4%). The most prevalent type was ineffective triggering. No significant difference was found in either prevalence or asynchrony index among different classifications of brain injury (p > 0.05). The prevalence of asynchrony was significantly lower during pressure control/assist ventilation than during other ventilatory modes (p < 0.05). Compared to the datasets without asynchrony, the airway occlusion pressure was significantly lower in datasets with ineffective triggering (p < 0.001). The asynchrony index was significantly higher during the combined use of opioids and sedatives (p < 0.001). Significantly longer duration of ventilation and hospital length of stay after the inclusion were found in patients with severe ineffective triggering (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient–ventilator asynchrony is common in brain-injured patients. The most prevalent type is ineffective triggering and its severity is likely related to a long duration of ventilation and hospital stay. Prevalence and severity of asynchrony are associated with ventilatory modes, respiratory drive and analgesia/sedation strategy, suggesting treatment adjustment in this particular population.

Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging information technology and digital innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned.

41891,Citizens’ Attitudes to Contact Tracing Apps,2020-09-02,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered β-coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in a recent pandemic of COVID-19. As a novel pathogen, the nature and degree of risk of COVID-19 to individuals with rheumatic diseases were unknown, as was its ability to induce musculoskeletal and autoimmune disease. Concerns were related to the chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disease and immune suppressive medications to treat it. The consequences of this infection are currently not fully understood, including the autoimmune sequelae. Here we present two cases of inflammatory arthritis with a temporal link to COVID-19. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: CASE 1: A 37-year-old Caucasian male was referred to Rheumatology with severe joint pains. He developed flu-like symptoms in early April 2020, with myalgia, fever, sore throat, anosmia, and fatigue. SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab was positive. He recovered from these initial symptoms, however 4 weeks later, he developed pain and swelling in his hands, feet, ankles, and knee joints with early morning stiffness. On examination, there was marked synovitis of hands, wrists, knees, and ankle joints. Systemic examination was otherwise normal. CASE 2: A 70-year-old lady developed sore throat and cough started in late March 2020. 3 weeks later, she became generally unwell with lethargy and fatigue. Her cough gradually improved, but she continued to experience breathlessness on minimal exertion. In early May 2020, she developed excruciating pain in her hands, wrists, and right knee joints with morning stiffness. On examination she had synovitis in the wrists, small joints of the hands and right knee. Systemic examination otherwise was unremarkable. Given the severe inflammatory arthritis, both patients were commenced on oral prednisolone with remarkable improvement 4 weeks later. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: We present 2 cases of acute inflammatory arthritis, which were suspected to have been triggered by COVID-19 viral infection without any musculoskeletal complications with good prognosis. COVID-19 is a new disease and our understanding of it is continuing to grow. The initial concern was that COVID-19 -19 infection may lead to severe illness in immunocompromised patients, including those and with rheumatic conditions. However, this was not seen in large numbers. To our knowledge, COVID-19-related inflammatory arthritis has not previously been reported in the literature. Our current understanding of the COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms is limited. However, it is likely that the disease may evolve in overlapping phases. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: In both cases, it was suggested that COVID-19 19 may be a triggering factor for inflammatory arthritis with good prognosis and settled with steroid therapy. It was suggested that arthritis may occur in patients with COVID-19, in previously fit and well patients without any underlying co-morbidities and autoimmune rheumatic disease and warrants urgent Rheumatology review. However, all COVID-19 suspected cases should be investigated on an individual basis to exclude other diagnosis to avoid missing other common reversible illnesses.","Ansari, Ghazal; Borg, Frances A; Koduri, Gouri",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607310/,483

A global overview of research on AIWS can inform future developments and clinical practice in this field. This bibliometric study aimed to analyze the characteristics of the global research landscape on AIWS. METHODS: Bibliometric data on AIWS related publications published until 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The data were analyzed using statistical and scientometric tools to evaluate the publication trends, key research domains, top contributing journals, institutions, and countries associated with AIWS-related research. RESULTS: A total of 125 published items were analyzed with a mean of 3 authors and 8.15 citations per document. Most articles were published after 2008, in medical journals focused on neuropsychiatric sciences, and most institutions affiliated with AIWS research were based on high-income countries. Major research domains associated with AIWS included visual disturbances, body image, migraine, infections, risk factors, and other clinical correlates. Several overarching domains were identified; however, clinical research on diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AIWS is relatively limited. CONCLUSION: The current research landscape informs a developing trend in AIWS research in selected regions and specialties. Future research should emphasize multidisciplinary and translational investigations on clinical and epidemiological areas through global collaborations that may advance the knowledge and practice on AIWS.","Hossain, Md Mahbub",AIMS Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7701374/,483

The COVID‐19 crisis came like any other natural disaster, finding people and organizations unprepared for disruptive power and social nexus. The unthinkable became a reality, and people realized that organizations and governments have no strategies to fight against such a pandemic. They found out that the strategic knowledge gap is enormous, and the only way to navigate this crisis is to create emergent knowledge strategies. This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of emergent knowledge strategies by comparing them with deliberate knowledge strategies and showing how people can develop such new kinds of strategies. The analysis is based on criteria like time perception, systems thinking, type of knowledge, type of changes, and complexity.","Bratianu, Constantin; Bejinaru, Ruxandra",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753563/,483

43743,Cultural Survival in B. F. Skinner: Possibilities for Conceptual Refinement,2021-01-03,"[Image: see text] Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, the third killer of mankind. The finding of potent drugs against diabetes remains challenging. In the present study, coumarin derivatives with known biological activity against diabetic protein have been used to predict functional groups’ positions on coumarin derivatives. α-Glucosidase is a brush border membrane-bound lysosomal enzyme from the hydrolase enzyme family. It plays an important role in the metabolism of glycoproteins. Inhibitors of lysosomal α-glucosidase can reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. Due to this, lysosomal α-glucosidase is a good therapeutic target for drugs. A total of 116 coumarin derivatives with IC50 values against lysosomal α-glucosidase were selected for a CADD (computer-aided drug design) approach to identify more potent drugs. Pharmacophore modeling and atom-based 3-QSAR of 116 active compounds against lysosomal α-glucosidase were performed and identified positions and types of groups to increase activity. We performed molecular docking of 116 coumarin derivatives against the lysosomal α-glucosidase enzyme, and three compounds (isorutarine, 10_, and 36) resulted in a docking score of −7.64, −7.12, and −6.86 kcal/mol. The molecular dynamics simulation of the above three molecules and protein complex performed for 100 ns supported the interaction stability of isorutarine, 10_, and 36 with the lysosomal binding site α-glucosidase.","Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar; Mulpuru, Viswajit; Mishra, Nidhi",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758891/,483
44153,Digital Transformation in Learning Organizations,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Rapid scale up of testing to detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to direct clinical management, optimize infection control actions, and guide public health response efforts to mitigate the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the largest integrated health care system in the United States, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) supported the laboratory-based detection of COVID-19 in a network of 170 medical centers across the country. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 testing data from VHA databases were analyzed to assess SARS-CoV-2 detection characteristics. Testing capacity was calculated by multiplying the number of inventoried instruments available for SARS-CoV-2 detection by estimates of instrument-specific maximum throughput with the assumption that instruments would be operational for 16 hours a day and 7 days a week. RESULTS: From March 01, 2020 to May 31, 2020, 224,059 Emergency Use Authorization approved RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 on more than 7 different assay platforms were conducted among 168,761 individuals attending VHA facilities; 10,048 individuals (5.9%) tested positive. During this period, the average rate of tests completed for SARS-CoV-2 increased to more than 4,000 per day (Figure 1A), the percentage of hospitalized individuals who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 increased to approximately 80% (Figure 1B), the median turnaround time from specimen collected to result reported decreased to less than 1 day (Figure 1C), and the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens collected in VHA facilities that were tested at VHA laboratories increased to more than 80% (Figure 1D). Based on inventories of high-throughput and rapid diagnostic instruments (Figure 2), VHA could perform at least 20,000 tests for SARS-CoV-2 per week. Figure 1. Testing metrics for SARS-CoV-2 across VHA facilities. A) Number of daily tests for SARS-CoV-2 completed. B) Percentage of hospitalized Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2. C).

44154,Individualizing Workplace Learning with Digital Technologies: New Learning Cultures in Swiss Apprenticeship Training,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to severe and life threatening. National-level registries found that children, generally, have less severe disease when compared to adults. However, most asymptomatically infected children will not present to hospital and may be missed. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, and to estimate the potential duration of viral shedding. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in Jaber Alahmad Hospital (JAH) from Feb. 29th to Apr. 30th, 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures to contain COVID-19, all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 1 month-18 years old, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at JAH, and were included. Demographics, clinical data, and laboratory results were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity was defined as having two consecutive negative PCR results from a respiratory specimen. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 134 pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. Of those, 91 patients (67.9%) were asymptomatic, the remaining cases had mild COVID-19 illness and mild pneumonia. The median age was 8.8 years (IQR: 4.7–12.4), 55.2% were males, and 89.5% were healthy. Cough and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms. The median duration to PCR negativity was 15 days (IQR: 13–19) for symptomatic patients and 15.5 days (IQR: 14–21) for asymptomatic patients. Predictors for symptoms included abnormal procalcitonin (aOR 6.6; 95% CI 1.48 -29.3), C-reactive protein (aOR 9.10; 95% CI 1.29–32.13), and X-ray finding of pneumonia (aOR 6.44; 95% CI 1.29–32.13). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is very common in children. Among symptomatic patients, the disease seems to be mild. Children exhibit substantial duration of viral shedding, as measured by PCR positivity, regardless of symptoms.

44157,Multi-Stakeholder Dialogues as Instrument for Design and Qualitative Research in Educational Organisations,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: While major progress has been made to establish diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, determining the severity of COVID-19 remains an unmet medical need. With limited hospital resources, gauging severity would allow for some patients to safely recover in home quarantine while ensuring sicker patients get needed care. We discovered a 5 host mRNA-based classifier for the severity of influenza and other acute viral infections and validated the classifier in COVID-19 patients from Greece. METHODS: We used training data (N=705) from 21 retrospective clinical studies of influenza and other viral illnesses. Five host mRNAs from a preselected panel were applied to train a logistic regression classifier for predicting 30-day mortality in influenza and other viral illnesses. We then applied this classifier, with fixed weights, to an independent cohort of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 from Athens, Greece (N=71) using NanoString nCounter. Finally, we developed a proof-of-concept rapid, isothermal qRT-LAMP assay for the 5-mRNA host signature using the QuantStudio 6 qPCR platform. RESULTS: In 71 patients with COVID-19, the 5 mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.97) for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure and/or 30-day mortality (Figure 1). Applying a preset cutoff based on training data, the 5-mRNA classifier had 100% sensitivity and 46% specificity for identifying mortality, and 88% sensitivity and 68% specificity for identifying severe respiratory failure. Finally, our proof-of-concept qRT-LAMP assay showed high correlation with the reference NanoString 5-mRNA classifier (r=0.95). Figure 1. Validation of the 5-mRNA classifier in the COVID-19 cohort. (A) Expression of the 5 genes used in the logistic regression model in patients with (red) and without (blue) mortality. (B) The 5-mRNA classifier accurately distinguishes non-severe and severe patients with COVID-19 as well as those at risk of death. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our 5-mRNA classifier demonstrated very high accuracy for the prediction of COVID-19 severity and could assist in the rapid, point-of-impact assessment of patients with confirmed COVID-19 to determine level of care thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.

This study utilized a random effect, fixed effect, GMM, and FGLS approach. The outcomes of COVID-19 demonstrate a significant negative influence as per the FGLS model, whereas the health expenditure demonstrates a significant negative effect on the global supply chain under both the dynamic models i.e. GMM and FGLS. As far as manufacturing value-added is concerned it indicates a positive and significant influence on the global supply chain according to the FGLS model whereas, last but not least the logistics performance index has a significant positive effect on the global supply chain according to the results of GMM and FGLS models respectively. The global supply chain is the lifeline for the global economy; thus, it is suggested that under COVID-19 pandemic situation policymakers need to react quickly and take suitable policy actions to deal with this unprecedented pandemic driven economic crises and further the cross-border trading activities should not be stopped, rather governments should formulate smart lockdown strategies.","Qin, Xuanlong; Godil, Danish Iqbal; Khan, Muhammad Kamran; Sarwat, Salman; Alam, Sadaf; Janjua, Laeeq",Oper Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786342/,483
44617,Conducting virtual meetings during the pandemic,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: In the United States social disparities in health outcomes are found wherever they are sought, and they have been documented extensively in trauma care. Because social factors cannot cause a trauma outcome directly, there must exist mediating causal factors related to the nature and severity of the injury, the robustness of the victim, access to care, or processes of care. An understanding these mediators is the point of departure for addressing inequities in outcomes. FINDINGS: Data were extracted from the registry of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program of the American College of Surgeons for 2007 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were age less than 19 years and head Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 4, 5, or 6. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was undertaken to analyze the relative contributions of a large set of covariates to the difference in mortality rates between Black and White children. Covariates were aggregated into the following categories: “Severity,” “Structure and Process,” “Mechanism,” “Demographics,” and “Insurance.” Eligible for analysis were 7273 White children and 2320 Black children. There were 1661 deaths (17.3%) The raw mortality rates were 15.6 and 22.8% for White and Black children, respectively. Factors categorized as “Severity” accounted for 95% of the mortality difference, “Mechanism” accounted for 13%, “Insurance” accounted for 5%, and “Demographics” accounted for 2%. The contribution of “Structure and Process” did not attain statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of injury accounts for most of the disparity between Black and White children in traumatic brain injury mortality rates. Mechanism, insurance status, and gender make a small contributions. Because insurance status like other social factors cannot directly affect trauma survival, what mediates its contribution requires further study.","Piatt, Joseph",Inj Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7797202/,483

From the experience of the PoliVisu pilots the influence and added value of data in the policy making process is assessed. Considering the recent “shake” in data production and use, PoliVisu has adopted four driving questions, as follow: what are the new roles data can play in the policy making process?, What is the added value of data for policy making? How can innovative visualisations contribute to improve the use of data in policy making processes? To what extent can an increased adoption of data affect the policy making process? How is the data shake affecting the involvement of non-institutional actors in the policy making process?

Despite the existing evidence, the traditional center-based PR model is applied to a small percentage of patients and presents numerous problems of accessibility, adherence, and costs. This study presents a home model of simple muscle training, non-presential, monitored by telephone and individualized, according to the severity of the COPD. In addition, to evaluate the results, simple tests associated with the physical performance of the lower limbs, previously validated in COPD, have been used, such as the four-meter walk, speed test (4MGS) and the five-repetition test sitting and standing (5STS). The objective was to evaluate whether the Individualized Non-Presential Exercise Training PrOgram (NIETO) induces improvements in the 4MGS, 5STS and quadriceps muscle strength (QMS) tests in outpatients with advanced COPD (FEV1 ≤ 50%). After one year, the QMS was significantly higher in the intervention group (IG) than in the control group (CG) (2.44 ± 4.07 vs. 0.05 ± 4.26 kg; p = 0.009).

The character photos, which contain both people and landscapes, are the most extensive ones in all kinds of photos. However, it is usually time-consuming and laborious for people to select and manage desired character photos manually. Therefore, automatic photo selection became extremely significant. Most of the existing methods select best character photos by assigning a absolute score or binary label, regardless of the photo’s content. The selected character photos are hence not satisfied. In this paper, we propose an effective automatic framework to select best character photos, which first automatically eliminates photos with unattractive character, then ranks photos and assists users to select the desired ones. Moreover, our framework is especially useful for mobile camera in practical application scenarios. To reduce the burden of photo selection and improve the efficiency of automatic selection from a large number of photos on mobile platform, we divide the photo selection into two stages: eliminating of unattractive photos based on designed efficient and effective features related to faces and human postures, and ranking the remaining photos using a two-stream convolution neural network. To ensure that informative features are selected and less useful ones are suppressed, we design and utilize the attention mechanism module in network. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the automatic selection of the satisfied photos from a large number of photos.","Xu, Chuchu; Yu, Xinguo; Sun, Chao",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971822/,483

Personalized Medicine or Precision Medicine is gaining more and more critical, and its implementation is necessary. Different gaps cannot be covered if the software continues to be developed in isolation without considering the user as the central axis of the conception, design, and implementation of the different solutions. For this reason, in this research work proposes the construction of a 3D model of the bone structure of the pelvis based on X-ray images of a patient and a volumetric template as a model that serves for training and simulation for subsequent use in a surgical. This model based on patient-centered personalized medicine and user-centered software development. As a result, we present the creation of a model that can be adapted to each patient’s reality. Likewise, these results can be used in computerized training systems for future health professionals, either by printing the model in 3D or using the software to perform measurements on each patient.","Castro-Gutierrez, Eveling; Suca, Christian; Vidal, Elizabeth",Information Technology and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972095/,483

Essentially this study can be termed as a testimonial for “Digitalize and Transform” initiative. A Production Digital Twin was developed leveraging the IIoT ready shop floor and adopting appropriate digital technologies. The proven DES model and digital twin methodology can be leveraged for future simulations to support market variability. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) method was deployed to create digital models of the shop floor resources and their interplay to help explore the plant characteristics and optimize its performance. The digital simulation model was integrated with the shop floor IIoT framework in a closed-loop, to run experiments and what-if scenarios with variable input parameters. Using this setup, physical shop floor and the digital simulation model share operational data in a continuous closed-loop to provide decision support for improving plant operations. EDM manufacturer’s target was to set up a re-usable DES model to arrive at actionable insights those can help them improve assembly line performance and get ready for the variable demand and product variants that subsequently would help them in driving business and profitability. Significant improvements were realized across all operational indicators—efficiency, quality, productivity and flexibility. Manufacturing SMEs across India are implementing IIoT and data analytics with the objective of acquiring real-time data thus enabling quick and accurate decision making. The closed-loop discrete event simulation methodology has the potential of enhancing IIoT investments further. Especially in the post-COVID scenario, when manufacturers are challenged with disrupted supply-chain, inconsistent demand and manpower shortages, this methodology can help execute shop-floor plans efficiently with optimum resources.","Dutta, Gautam; Kumar, Ravinder; Sindhwani, Rahul; Singh, Rajesh Kumar",Advances in Industrial and Production Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972121/,483
47599,Decentralized Contact Tracing Protocols,2020-11-17,"Political Islam has been a major force across the MENA for much of the twentieth century. Reaching the zenith of their political ascendancy in the immediately aftermath of the 2011 Arab Uprisings, it is clear that Islamism is on the wane across the region. Opinion polls demonstrated that the Arab street, in particular the youth, are becoming more secular, less conservative in their attitudes and more suspicious of the role of religion in the public sphere. What is driving this disenchantment with Islamist parties relates to their aligning themselves with anti-democratic forces, the endemic corruption and nepotism they have demonstrated once in office, their inability to govern and their internal divisions. Our multivariate empirics of the support rates for Political Islam in the region relied on data from the Arab Barometer survey (5). If the people of the entire Arab world had a free vote in a referendum, the following rules and regulations still would gain an absolute majority: Against a marriage of a female with a man who does not pray. Terrorism against the USA is a logical consequence of US interference in the region. Males are better political leaders. The USA, the UK and Israel pose the greatest threat to the stability and well-being of the region. Banks should not be allowed to charge interest. More than a third of Arab opinion still supports, among others, the following contentions: In favour of Shari’a using physical punishments. A woman cannot be prime minister/president. In society, non-Muslims’ rights should be inferior. Rejecting neighbours – people of a different religion. Shari’a should restrict women’s role. From the Arab Barometer data, we constructed parametric and non-parametric indices of Overcoming Islamism and of Political Islam. The indices show a very high correlation with each other. The country values of the Index components are found in Table 7.2. Islamism is defined as high values along our 24 indicators across the board. Table 7.3 reports our UNDP-type Index “Overcoming Islamism” based on the valid country-level Arab Barometer results with 24 variables, aggregated with equal weights. Tunisia, according to Table 7.3, is the country whose population is rendering least support for Islamist worldviews, followed by Lebanon and Iraq. Yemen, Sudan and Algeria are the three Arab nations, whose population still lends biggest across-the-board support for the 24 Islamist positions under consideration here. We could show the close relationship between support of the most salient global Islamist leader today, Turkish President Erdogan, and Political Islam among the interviewed Arab publics. Support for Political Islam is also still very clearly connected to Anti-Westernism in the region. Political Islamist hatred against the West now also features the United Arab Emirates with its close cooperation with Western countries and its world class Universities as a victim of this prejudice. As a rule, the advancement of education reduces the extent of support for Political Islam. A post-Islamist future beckons the region and those Islamist parties who make the successful adaptation to this new reality will thrive. Those who do not will be confined to the dustbin of history.","Solomon, Hussein; Tausch, Arno",Arab MENA Countries: Vulnerabilities and Constraints Against Democracy on the Eve of the Global COVID-19 Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972123/,483

Foreign language training contributes to the formation of linguistic, communicative and metacognitive skills. International modern requirements to the students’ foreign language training at an engineering university are actualized, its contradictions and features of pedagogical forms, methods and tools are identified. The content and structure of multilingualism, technocommunication and metalinguistic awareness of the students’ foreign languages training at an engineering university are revealed. A methodology for the implementation of foreign language training in combination with multilingualism, technocommunication and metalinguistic awareness is devoted. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was proved through the realization of group international study trips where students showed an understanding of technology by means of foreign languages and a metalinguistic awareness focusing on the cultural traditions of the region and local features of production. A conscious approach to deeper linguistic knowledge, cultures of different countries and technologies according to the high language and communications requirements in the field of science and technology, combining linguistic and engineering thinking in the human mind for a more complete understanding of the essence and content of engineering education is argued.","Tsareva, Ekaterina; Bogoudinova, Roza; Volkova, Elena",Educating Engineers for Future Industrial Revolutions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972140/,483

Design/Methodology/Approach: The economy of pleasure is seen as a concept with a resource of novelty, manifesting itself in the most divergent regimes of knowledge: politics, poetry, psychoanalysis and, of course, ethics. This allows you to analyze an object from multiple disciplinary positions at once. Purely economic discourse is naturally present, but rather in a somewhat indirect form. Findings: The economy of pleasure is akin to innovative art practices in art. Its appearance can also be considered the generation of a collective traumatic experience gained by huge masses of people in the conditions of modern capitalism. The authors understand the economy of pleasure as a socio-personal creative in the economic sphere, an action with obvious humanitarian intentions. Originality/Value: The economy of pleasure is becoming a powerful lever of confidence-building in a society so badly undermined in recent decades of rampant consumption. That is why its loci will increase the level of solidarity, without which neither self-organization of society nor elementary civic activism is possible. It is this type of economic creativity that is considered in the article as a priority in the scenarios of the «post-coronavirus» existence of the immediate future of global civilization.","Shulzhenko, Vyacheslav I.; Avsharov, Arsen G.; Kontsevich, Galina E.; Sumskaya, Marina Yu.; Savchenko, Tatyana D.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972271/,483

This system is not sufficient to write and produce scientific contents that contain several symbols. Despite this need, the Arabic language still lacks an eight-point coding system. In this context, this paper aims to present a unified eight-point Braille system and present it to Arab communities to get benefit from it in developing digital content for blind people. The Arabic language differs from the Latin and other languages in the number of letters and diacritics, which makes the coding system different from the one used in these languages. In this work, we studied the symbols used in the Arabic language and the current Braille system and looked for methods and recommendations regarding the design of the eight-point Braille system. A methodology and a set of principles have been identified that have been adopted in preparing the system, and rules for coding have been established.","El Ghoul, Oussama; Ahmed, Ikrami; Othman, Achraf; Al-Thani, Dena A.; Al-Tamimi, Amani",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972573/,483

48580,Recourse to the Circular Economy: The Path Ahead,2021-01-16,"Global value chains are highly prone to distortions in value distribution among participants. Their global fragmentation and relational governance undermine the effectiveness of regulatory intervention in amending these distortions. In this paper, I propose a new mechanism to administer value distribution that is in tune with the nature of these production systems. Building on interdependence theory, I suggest that interdependencies inherent in the co-specialized nature of supply chains give participants the power to alter the trade-offs between investment in social causes and economic gains and to incentivize socially desired behavior. I show how the interdependence logic manifests at varying levels of the GVC, including the producing constituencies, governments, and international organizations, as well as civil society. These dynamics create markets for social justice that are driven by relationships among GVC participants and operate simultaneously at different scales. I further posit that the effectiveness of interdependence relationships as a value-distributing mechanism is socially-constructed and outline the social conditions that determine the outcomes. I specify the varying impact of governments on interdependence relationships – as activators, facilitators, or inhibitors of the transformative power of interdependencies – and discuss their effectiveness.","Nachum, Lilac",J Int Bus Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7976672/,483
48587,An Evaluation of Monetary Policy in India: A Sustainable Development Perspective,2021-01-16,"Each rapid autopsy is a powerful opportunity to supply multiple researchers with many valuable tissue specimens at the same time. Since the beginning of the development of rapid autopsy, the overriding organizing principle for all rapid autopsy programs has been that the samples or organs must be removed and processed as rapidly as possible. To accomplish this, some rapid autopsy programs are focused on only 1 tumor type, whereas others accept patients demonstrating all tumor types and sometimes other diseases as well. Rapid autopsy programs are logistically complicated and labor-intensive structures; therefore, the key to their success is program flexibility and maintaining a multidisciplinary focus. The necessary collaborations in the complex relationships between clinicians and researchers can be broken down into a series of thought and action steps that must be understood, accepted, and practiced by all participants. A crucial part of the precase steps (prior to death) for a rapid autopsy is the study consenting process. It is extremely important that this individualized consent is obtained for postmortem specimens and that it is written in terms general enough to be used for patients with all types of diseases and for an appropriate range of future research uses. The advent of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019) has presented new challenges and opportunities to the field of autopsy pathology. Guidelines and practice had to be created and adapted to protect physicians and staff while maximizing diagnostic yield. However, any autopsy performed on a patient dying of or with COVID-19 represents a unique opportunity to contribute to understanding the disease mechanisms and to improve death certification, thus assisting in both clinical care and the development of health public policy.","Hooper, Jody E.",AJSP Rev Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938914/,483

This has highlighted the need for alternative, accurate, non-invasive strategies to safely assess disease activity. AIMS: The aim of this study is to describe the impact of point of care intestinal ultrasound (IUS) in a university-based tertiary care IBD urgent access clinic. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a comprehensive care pathway which incorporated outpatient sigmoidoscopy and intestinal ultrasound with the purpose of directing further ambulatory clinical care and avoiding hospitalization or hospital-based investigations including endoscopy during the COVID pandemic for patients with established IBD with symptoms suggestive of a disease flare, or those at high risk of a new diagnosis of IBD. Non-invasive markers C Reactive Protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (fCal) were collected where available. Patients were pre-screened for influenza-like illness, as COVID-19 testing was not available for this population during the study period. Substantial management changes were defined as addition of any medications, biologic switch/ optimization, and or referral for surgical consultation. RESULTS: Between March 15(th) and June 30(th) 2020, a total of 72 patients were seen in the urgent access clinic. All patients were seen within 7 days of referral. The majority were female 57% (41/72) and/ or had Crohn’s disease 65.5% (47/72) (Table 1). Of these, 84.7% (61/72) underwent a substantial management change based on features of active inflammation detected by either IUS alone (53% 38/72) sigmoidoscopy alone (12.5% 9/72) or combination IUS with in-clinic sigmoidoscopy (32% 23/72) in addition to CRP and fCal. Three new diagnoses of IBD were made: one colonic Crohn’s and 2 with ulcerative colitis. One pregnant patient avoided all acute care utilization. Five patients were referred to colorectal surgery for urgent resection including two patients admitted directly for emergent operations. No patients required visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, there have been no unscheduled hospitalizations occurred in this cohort since inception March 23, 2020 til November 15(th) 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of IUS in a centralized, urgent access clinic pathway resulted in efficient and meaningful changes in IBD management while sparing the need for acute care services including ER visits, need for in-hospital endoscopy, and hospitalization. The pandemic highlights the utility of this patient-center tool and supports expansion of wider IUS adoption.

The evaluation of the seismic performance of buildings can be useful to assess possible damages occurred after an earthquake, the direct costs which would result from it, the “pre” and “post” loss distribution in an urban area and the most vulnerable buildings. At urban scale, a building-specific assessment approach appears extremely difficult and time-consuming because of the large number of constructions. Therefore, being able to classify the built heritage in a limited number of territorial-specific structural typologies with similar characteristics would significantly simplify the vulnerability assessment. This paper shows a typological and structural classification of existing masonry buildings of the historic center of Potenza (south of Italy) aimed at designing a virtual city consisting of different buildings categories. The main typological and structural features of the masonry constructions (MUR) have been identified through documentary analyses, Census data, site investigation and GIS-based analysis by considering the frequency of significant structural parameters.

It takes as its framework the question of the impact on Western policymaking of contrasting perceptions of China as threat and/or opportunity in the post-Cold War period. After a brief historical overview of the UK’s China policy up to 2016, it examines how China policy developed after the Brexit referendum, based primarily on analysis of policy papers, statements and speeches from the government, and with particular reference to a number of high-profile issues, from the Belt and Road Initiative to the question of Chinese companies’ involvement in the development of 5G networks in the UK. It concludes that the ideas of China as an economic opportunity for the UK were strongest in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, but diminished somewhat over time as security and normative concerns became more prominent and China policy became more contested domestically. The chapter also concludes that, for the most part, ‘non-Brexit’ factors have had the greatest impact on the UK’s China policy, in contrast to the tendency to look at every issue of British foreign policy through a Brexit lens.","Summers, Tim",A New Beginning or More of the Same?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979951/,483

To start with, they will pinpoint the way ahead with regard to implementation issues of the arbitration award on the Croatian–Slovenian border. Implementation not only depends on the political will of both parties, but also on the ability to amend existing agreements in the Northern Adriatic involving Italy as a third party. Secondly, the recommendations touch on the area of strengthening dispute settlement processes, both in an EU context and with regard to reform of international arbitration. There are a few lessons to be learnt from the Croatia–Slovenia case which must be translated into a more robust dispute resolution infrastructure, both internally within the EU and in view of future arbitration procedures. Third, the recommendations address outstanding bilateral issues relevant to the EU enlargement process in the post-Yugoslav space. Proposals will be outlined as to how to tackle them to steer clear of the risk of Candidate Countries being vetoed by Member States.

It has indeed been a collective humanitarian responsibility for the international community to protect the rights of Palestine, in accordance with legal norms. The Turkish governments have taken a strong stance in support of Palestine, voicing concerns over the humanitarian and unlawful aspect of the Palestine question, and have lent a friendly helping hand to the Palestinian people. Turkey has been supporting a peaceful two-state solution to the conflict at all pertinent international platforms. As the inhumane circumstances in the Palestinian territories urgently await solutions directed by the international community, another significant dimension to the criminal treatment of the Palestinians is the deported refugees who must continue their lives in remote camps. In this regard, Turkey also continues its efforts to improve the living standards of Palestinian refugees in Jordan, where the camps are concentrated.

All of these scholars focus on particular topics of inquiry within entrepreneurship, with some working in areas where there is already a rich body of knowledge and others interested in areas with little academic knowledge. The purpose of this chapter is to present the work of these five scholars, identifying significant contributions and notable omissions that may guide future inquiry in these areas.","Gupta, Vishal K.",Great Minds in Entrepreneurship Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980821/,483

Among them, primary graft dysfunction, bacterial and fungal infections, airway complications (e.g. bronchial dehiscence, necrosis and stenosis) and acute rejection can occur in the early phase. These events increase the ICU length of stay and compromise the early survival rate. On the other hand, immunosuppression, which is mandatory to prevent rejection of the graft, exposes the lung recipient to late complications such as opportunistic and viral infection and malignancies. Finally, the incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction remains high and represents the major impediment to long term survival. This chapter will provide an overview of the important early and late complications following lung transplantation.","Pasero, Daniela; Lees, Nicholas James; Costamagna, Andrea; Ellena, Marco; Montrucchio, Giorgia; Brazzi, Luca",Thoracic Surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980825/,483

Measures were implemented in Portugal in response to COVID-19: limitations on travel rights, closure of commercial establishments, and prohibition on holding events. Teleworking was also encouraged, and distance learning was promoted. The present manuscript aims to understand the role that film tourism plays in marketing applied to territories and how important it is for segmenting markets and attracting new tourists in the post-pandemic period (covid-19). The movie tourism business incorporates the development of destination marketing campaigns to promote films, while more and more common initiatives are emerging between DMOs and filmmakers to promote films and tourist destinations. The present study will include document analysis and exploratory interviews with some tourism leaders and stakeholders in Portugal and two best practices Portuguese campaigns. The management of territories provides several advantages for the sustainable development of a tourist destination, stimulating exports and attracting more tourism and investment. In particular, film tourism has increasingly established itself as one of the most common leisure activities, and one of the fastest growing in the tourism sector, as it is a segment where tourists have the highest expenditure and, for this has received greater attention from business leaders, policy makers and academics around the world. From an interdisciplinary perspective, this study presents inputs in local development and niche tourism perspective. Some lines of future research will be presented.","Sousa, Bruno; Malheiro, Alexandra; Liberato, Dália; Liberato, Pedro","Advances in Tourism, Technology and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980912/,483

Such displacements could be either internal displacement or cross border displacement. In just last year (2019), nearly 24.9 million people have been displaced due to the above cited reasons as per the report of United Nations Refugee Agency. Warsaw International Mechanism has put forth its effort to address the concern of displacements and support humanity along with United Nations, States, few ad-hoc working groups, civil societies and few supporting countries way back in 2016. On one side while the combined and sincere efforts are being made, on the other side the threats in terms of violence, riots, natural disasters, pandemics keep increasing at an alarming rate. Recent Covid-19 is a classic example which are likely to trigger more displacements to be continued in 2020. This has a spillover effect on demand and supply chain of health care services to the impacted as well as the citizens or locals in a particular region.

The said diseases can be quite dangerous for countries and even for the whole world as the mode of transmission and transmission rate of such diseases increase. The literature needs mathematical modeling and subsequent analysis of such diseases. In the light of this information, TB-HIV/AIDS coinfection model was analyzed. To this end, the model was firstly extended to the Caputo-Fabirizo fractional derivative obtained using the exponential function. Then, uniqueness solutions were investigated by the help of the fixed-point theorem. Thereafter, the uniqueness solution of the model was made by assuming certain parameters, and its stability analyzes were examined. Finally, numerical solutions of the mathematical model were made and its numerical simulations were shown.","Dokuyucu, Mustafa Ali; Dutta, Hemen",Mathematical Modelling and Analysis of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981131/,483

However, the maritime industry is complex; in addition to the shipping, transportation and port services involved, there are myriad support services interacting directly or indirectly to create value in an integrated and coordinated manner to meet the demands of multimodal transportation processes. The regulatory framework governing emissions and reducing air pollution and production of greenhouse gas emissions has been on the agenda of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for a long time. The IMO role is critical to the development of sustainable shipping. Digitalisation is advancing rapidly in all sectors, and Maritime Informatics will shape the future of shipping. Huge opportunities exist in the connectivity of ships and ports. With an increased role of technology and need for sustainable shipping, the maritime sector will require continuous digital data flows as real-time transport monitoring and management progresses. Maritime transport is currently transformed by “digitalisation” and “decarbonisation”. Great synergy between these two movements will generate greater benefits for many.

The ancient MSR centred around the idea of “Sinosphere” the mainstay of which was the so-called tributary system and was clearly demonstrated during different phases of Chinese history, especially by Zheng He’s voyages. One may argue that Zheng He did demonstrate a sense of realpolitik in engaging China in Southeast and South Asia and acting as a countervailing power in all the episodes of regime change; however, we may also argue that Chinese presence in the Indo-Pacific was not without the political development in the region, which may be true to the present geopolitics in the region too, albeit without regime changes. Secondly, and most importantly, even if China had storage facilities in the places such as Malacca and Sumatra during Zheng He’s times, China did not seize territories in the littoral states in Indo-Pacific even though it was in a position to do so. As far as the Twenty-First Century MSR is concerned, it has raised hopes as well as suspicion as to what China is up to. And that even if silk routes existed in ancient times, but what is the relevance of such initiatives in modern times, and whether such initiatives are in sync with China’s foreign policy goals or not. This paper apart from examining the triggers and contours of “Belt and Road” Initiative focuses on the responses from various stakeholders, especially India. Meanwhile, owing to the overlapping interests of the two in the Indo-Pacific, the study argues that the “Belt and Road” Initiative essentially provides an opportunity to dock each other’s connectivity initiatives in the region; it suggests that both need to find a middle ground and make strategic adjustments vis-à-vis each other’s interests in the region through a substantive maritime security dialogue on the one hand and a deeper economic stakes in each other’s developmental strategies on the other.","Deepak, B.

Given such a graph, the original problem frequently translates to the detection of the graph’s strongly connected components, which is challenging at this scale. We propose a new, symbolic algorithm that computes all the monochromatic strongly connected components of an edge-coloured graph. In the worst case, the algorithm performs [Formula: see text] symbolic steps, where p is the number of colours and n the number of vertices. We evaluate the algorithm using an experimental implementation based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and large (up to [Formula: see text] ) coloured graphs produced by models appearing in systems biology.","Beneš, Nikola; Brim, Luboš; Pastva, Samuel; Šafránek, David",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984532/,483

Our starting point is an open problem posed by Hongseok Yang: what class of statistical probabilistic programs have densities that are differentiable almost everywhere? To formalise the problem, we consider Statistical PCF (SPCF), an extension of call-by-value PCF with real numbers, and constructs for sampling and conditioning. We give SPCF a sampling-style operational semantics à la Borgström et al., and study the associated weight (commonly referred to as the density) function and value function on the set of possible execution traces. Our main result is that almost surely terminating SPCF programs, generated from a set of primitive functions (e.g. the set of analytic functions) satisfying mild closure properties, have weight and value functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. We use a stochastic form of symbolic execution to reason about almost everywhere differentiability. A by-product of this work is that almost surely terminating deterministic (S)PCF programs with real parameters denote functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. Our result is of practical interest, as almost everywhere differentiability of the density function is required to hold for the correctness of major gradient-based inference algorithms.","Mak, Carol; Ong, C.-H.

Furthermore, we provide perspective regarding the controversy surrounding pulmonary artery (PA) catheter use as well as current society guidelines and scientific statements. Lastly, we review the technical aspects for accurate interpretation of data of cardiogenic shock. RECENT FINDINGS: More recent studies specifically evaluating cardiogenic shock patients have shown higher mortality when PA catheters were not used. Furthermore, initiatives are underway to develop more standardized definitions of cardiogenic shock, including the SCAI Shock Classification Scheme. Only by having a standardized fashion of conveying severity of shock will we be able to more systematically study this patient population and improve outcomes moving forward. SUMMARY: PA catheters are critical to the prognostication and management of a subset of patients with cardiopulmonary disease, particularly in those with pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic shock, or requiring mechanical circulatory support or undergoing evaluation for advanced heart failure therapies.","Isseh, Iyad N.; Lee, Ran; Khedraki, Rola; Hoffman, Karlee",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7985592/,483

The intended benefits to the older adult and service were for: 1. Daily rehabilitation input for older adults. 2. Older adults to spend less time immobile. 3. Ongoing rehabilitation intervention while awaiting medical clearance for discharge. 4. Increased staff satisfaction 5. Better outcomes on discharge. 6. Rehabilitation ethos on the Health and Ageing wards. METHODS: The quality improvement project was carried out using the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle. Three iterative PDSA cycles were carried out over the course of the project to deliver proactive interventions as a result of analysis of baseline data and stakeholder involvement. These interventions were aimed at developing communication around the rehabilitation list within the team and sustainability of this list. RESULTS: The project resulted in better functional outcomes for older adults and increased staff morale. Between May 2020–June 2020, a total of 56 patients were seen on the rehabilitation list, with 84% of these patients seeing improvements in their Elderly Mobility Scores (EMS). 27% of patients on the rehabilitation list saw a change to their initial discharge plan, either needing reduced packages of care or reduced need for ongoing rehabilitation in an external setting. CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement project found that with focussed rehabilitation older adult inpatients with or without COVID-19 can make significant functional gains. These gains have wider effects on their outcomes on discharge and also for the service through increased morale and job satisfaction. Due to demand and capacity issues in the acute setting, older adults who would often benefit from ongoing input are not always reviewed regularly. This project demonstrates that with focussed rehabilitation older adults can improve and achieve better functional outcomes.","Roberts, F; Birmingham, K; Darlison, L; Hertzberg, K; Chapman, K; Krampikowski, J; Bunden, D; King, L; Tebbutt, E; Potter, E",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989638/,483

The continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) is an alternative that allows strict glucose monitoring and reduces the contact of the healthcare providers with the patients in the pandemic era. We conducted a study using CGM in COVID vs non-COVID patients hospitalized at the San José Hospital in Bogotá Colombia. Methods: Single center, prospective study of glucose monitoring in patients with and without COVID19 using the Freestyle system. We included patients of 18 years and older, hospitalized at Hospital San José de Bogotá, with diagnosis of diabetes and treated with insulin. We used the T student distribution to analize the data. Primary outcomes were the usefulness of the device in inpatients, and the clinical outcomes according to glucometric measures in patients with and without COVID19 infection. Results: CGM devices were placed on 30 patients: 10 with, and 20 without COVID. The system was feasible with good nurse acceptance. The age of the patients was between 18 and 90 years. Of the COVID positive patients, 30% required ICU and 10% died, the mean HBA1C was 9.5% (CI 95% 7.5–10.09%) with a general variability of 35.6%, only 3 patients archieved goals of time in range. The general glycemic index was 7.04% (CI 0.66-0.100)Of the non COVID patients, 10% required ICU and 10% died, the average variability was 30.9% and hypoglycemic episodes predominated in 3 patients. The general glycemic index was 6.6% (CI 0.61–0.71)The patients who required ICU had an average HBA1C of 10.4%, 80% received corticosteroid management during the hospital stay. No patient had skin or soft tissue infection at the sensor insertion site. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGM is a useful method for glucometric control that reduces the contact of healthcare providers and allows early interventions to improve metabolic control.

Under the working capital channel, cash credit constraints force entrepreneurs to forgo investment opportunities in order to finance their working capital needs. Building on survey data, I find that short-term credit constraints are as important as long-term ones in SMEs’ investment decisions. Besides, the detrimental effect of cash credit constraints on corporate investment is stronger for SMEs with higher increase in working capital needs but lower for liquid ones that are able to adjust their accounts receivable and inventories. My results suggest that short-term finance is a major issue for SMEs. Plain English Summary Short-term credit constraints turn out to be as important as long-term ones in SMEs’ investment decisions. Building on survey data, this paper investigates the real effects of short-term financial constraints on small businesses through an under-explored transmission mechanism. While the bulk of research on the effects of financial constraints focuses on long-term liabilities, I stress the importance of short-term finance. Owing to the competition between working and fixed capital in cash-flow uses, cash credit constraints force entrepreneurs to allocate additional cash-flow to finance the increase in their working capital needs to the detriment of long-term assets.The main implication of this work is that supports for short-term financing would provide a significant boost to long-term investment and economic growth.","Nicolas, Théo",Small Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8096609/,483

(2) To what extent do farmers markets participate in programs aimed at reducing food insecurity? (3) To what extent do farmers markets serve low-income residents and people of color? and (4) How has the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) affected the operations of farmers markets. This article discusses the findings of a 2020 study that examined the extent to which Michigan’s farmer’s markets served low-income customers and people of color and participated in food assistance programs. The study examined 79 farmers markets and found that 87.3% of the farmer’s market managers are White. On average, roughly 79% of the vendors of the markets are White and almost 18% are people of color. Most of the vendors in the markets participate in nutrition assistance programs. Market managers estimate that about 76% of their customers are White and about 23% are people of color. Farmers markets operated by people of color attract higher numbers of customers and vendors of color than those operated White market managers. Almost half of the farmer’s markets started operations later than usual in 2020 because of the pandemic. More than a third of the markets reported that their funding declined during the pandemic. Moreover, the number of vendors declined at two thirds of the markets and the number of customers dipped at more than 40% of the markets. On the other hand, the number of people requesting food assistance during the pandemic increased in more than half of the markets.","Taylor, Dorceta E.; Lusuegro, Alliyah; Loong, Victoria; Cambridge, Alexis; Nichols, Claire; Goode, Maeghen; McCoy, Ember; Daupan, Socorro M.; Bartlett, M’Lis; Noel, Erin; Pollvogt, Brayden",Am Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107495/,483

53761,Entrepreneurial learning in online communities,2021-06-01,"Early characterization of emerging viruses is essential to control their spread, such as the Zika Virus outbreak in 2014. Among other non-viral factors, host information is essential for the surveillance and control of virus spread. Flaviviruses (genus Flavivirus), akin to other viruses, are modulated by high mutation rates and selective forces to adapt their codon usage to that of their hosts. However, a major challenge is the identification of potential hosts for novel viruses. Usually, potential hosts of emerging zoonotic viruses are identified after several confirmed cases. This is inefficient for deterring future outbreaks. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to identify the host range of a virus from its raw genome sequences. The proposed strategy relies on comparing codon usage frequencies across viruses and hosts, by means of a normalized Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). We have tested our algorithm on 94 flaviviruses and 16 potential hosts. This novel method is able to distinguish between arthropod and vertebrate hosts for several flaviviruses with high values of accuracy (virus group 91.9% and host type 86.1%) and specificity (virus group 94.9% and host type 79.6%), in comparison to empirical observations. Overall, this algorithm may be useful as a complementary tool to current phylogenetic methods in monitoring current and future viral outbreaks by understanding host–virus relationships.","Truong Nguyen, Phuoc; Garcia-Vallvé, Santiago; Puigbò, Pere",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157105/,483

METHODS: The #PRESTOinsieme project is a web-based survey open to people over 16 years of age that started on the 20(th) of March 2020 in Italy. Survey respondents underwent a set of validated questionnaires to assess dietary habits and psychological well-being (depression and posttraumatic stress, using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively) during the lockdown. RESULTS: Survey respondents were 5008, with a median age of 38 years. The female gender was the most prevalent (63%). Dietary habits were found to be associated with psychological well-being. People suffering from moderate/severe depression symptoms and posttraumatic stress were found to have more frequently foods high in fat and sugars compared to people with no/mild depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms (P-value 0.008). Furthermore, subjects with most severe depressive symptoms ate less frequently fruits (P-value < 0.001), vegetables (P-value 0.013), dried fruits (P-value < 0.001), and milk-based products. CONCLUSIONS: Present results showed a strict relationship between dietary habits and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Such a relationship could be interpreted as emotional eating, which has been frequently reported during the lockdown, showing that depressed people are more prone to emotional eating habits. Present results claim the need to develop public programs of psychological support for the community during the lockdown and public health strategies targeting diet.

55201,Learning to learn by yourself: Unsupervised meta‐learning with self‐knowledge distillation for COVID‐19 diagnosis from pneumonia cases,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can result in severe physiological impairments to cardiovascular and respiratory function. Further, a hallmark symptom of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is shortness of breath, even at rest, which may be exaggerated during periods of exertion. However, the lasting effects of COVID‐19 on quantitative measures of exertional breathlessness in otherwise healthy individuals is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the sensory and affective dimensions of exertional dyspnea (i.e., shortness of breath during exercise) in otherwise healthy, young adults who had previously tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 over a period of three months. METHODS: Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21 ± 1 y, body mass index: 24.1±1.4 kgᐧm(‐2), aerobic fitness: 35.7± 11.3 mL·kg(‐1)·min(‐1)) who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 completed an incremental exercise test to voluntary exhaustion on a cycle ergometer three‐to‐four weeks after the positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test result (BL), as well as one and two months following baseline testing (1M and 2M, respectively). Subjective ratings of perceived breathlessness (RPB) and unpleasantness of breathing (RPU) were collected at rest and during each stage of exercise. Following exercise completion, subjects rated the unpleasantness and accompanying negative emotions (depression, anxiety, frustration, anger, and fear) associated with their exertional dyspnea using a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: RPB at rest, during cycling at 60W, and at peak exercise were similar across visits (p > 0.05). RPB during cycling at 120W tended to decrease across time (BL: 2.9±0.9; 1M: 2.1±1.1; 2M: 2.0±1.4; p = 0.06). RPU at rest, during cycling at 60W, 120W, and at peak exercise were not different between visits (p > 0.05). VAS ratings of anxiety (BL: 1.8±2.1 cm; 1M: 3.1±3.2 cm; 2M: 0.8±0.7 cm; p = 0.05), but not those of depression, unpleasantness, anger, frustration, or fear differed across visits (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the sensory dimension of exertional dyspnea during moderate intensity exercise improves (i.e., decreases) during recovery from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In contrast, the affective dimension of exertional dyspnea appears to be largely maintained throughout recovery, as only anxious emotions related to exertional dyspnea fluctuated over the three‐month time period.","Province, Valesha; Augenreich, Marc; Stute, Nina; Stickford, Abigail; Ratchford, Steve; Stickford, Jonathon",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239581/,483
55323,Pivoting to online learning—The future of learning and work,2021-03-11,"Modern railway projects, characterized by “natural monopoly”, large investment, and far-reaching influences, are highly dependent on the institutional and cultural environments in China. The countries along the Belt and Road are characterized by weak institutions, unstable politics, and poor technology foundations, which are largely different from China. These factors are severe obstacles to international technology transfer. By summarizing the experiences from the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard-Gauge Railway (SGR) project, this study proposes a framework for embedded technology transfer with a technology-institution-culture nexus. The results indicate that technology localization, including technology standards, management mode, and industrial chain, should be realized in the process of technology transfer. Then, the host government ought to overhaul its institutional and policy framework to support the infrastructure projects. Moreover, the cultural conflicts between the transferor and transferee should be taken seriously. This experience could provide references for other international infrastructure technology transfers.","Wang, Jiaoe; Du, Fangye; Wu, Mingquan; Liu, Weidong",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240777/,483

AIMS: This study aimed to improve the understanding of how students experience the process of accessing and using mental health support, barriers and facilitators to treatment, and how students would adapt provision to improve experiences. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 full-time students who had used mental health services at university. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five higher-order themes were identified: personalisation and informed choice, simplifying the process, feeling abandoned ignored or invisible, stigma, and superiority of private and external services. Sixteen subthemes were identified within these themes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that access to mental health support should be simplified, with collaboration across university and external health and care services, to prevent students feeling lost or abandoned when seeking care. An inclusive approach to support access and provision of services for all presentations of mental health problems should be developed.","Barnett, Phoebe; Arundell, Laura-Louise; Matthews, Hannah; Saunders, Rob; Pilling, Stephen",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269927/,483

However, there is no strong empirical evidence on the association between health literacy (HL) as a particular health-related competence and neighbourhoods. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the association between the features of neighbourhoods and the level of HL competencies of young people from three countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia). Self-reported data from an international sample of 11,521 students aged 13–15 years participating in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study (HBSC) in the year 2018 were included in the analyses. The level of HL shows a strong positive relationship with family wealth, and a significant relationship is maintained in all studied countries. Both social and structural features of neighbourhoods turned out to have an impact on students’ HL. However, HL is most clearly explained by the school environment. This study confirms the school effect on higher levels of HL competences in adolescents. This indicates the need to invest in schools located in less affluent areas to generally improve the level of education, implement modern health education combined with HL, and strengthen the social and health competencies of students.","Kleszczewska, Dorota; Porwit, Katarzyna; Boberova, Zuzana; Sigmund, Eric; Vasickova, Jana; Paakkari, Leena",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8303563/,483

The present article is based on a corpus from French print news corpus drawn from the databases Factiva and Europresse. The concept of »crisis«, a core notion in the underlying reflection, has brought in its wake many linguistic issues, including the gender of »covid-19«, the various different names for the so-called crisis (»pandemic«, »health crisis«, etc.), and the competition between »social distancing« and »physical distancing«. To begin, I use some of the many concepts available in the domain of discourse analysis to analyze the event itself and the naming process, and I make some proposals in the framework of discursive semantics. Next, I tackle the issue of lexical creativity while distinguishing two linguistic spheres, that of institutional discourse and that of the discourse of ordinary people. I study some of these neologisms by noting their spread throughout the current discourse and their inclusion in common French dictionaries. Lastly, I pave the way toward a contrastive discourse analysis that takes languages and cultures into account.","Reboul-Touré, Sandrine",Z Literaturwiss Linguistik,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335975/,483

To prevent and control different types of diseases as well as their complex variants, research on the spatio-temporal differentiation among and mechanisms of influence of epidemic diseases is growing worldwide. This study analyzed monthly data on the incidence of influenza by using different methods, including Moran’s I, the hotspot analysis model, concentration analysis, and correlation analysis, to determine the characteristics of spatio-temporal differentiation in the incidence of influenza across prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2017, and to examine its relationship with air pollution. According to the results, the overall incidence of influenza in China exhibited a trend of increase from 2004 to 2017, with small peaks in 2009 and 2014. More cases of influenza were recorded in the first and fourth quarters of each year. Regions with higher incidences of influenza were concentrated in northwestern and northern China, and in the coastal areas of southeastern China. Over time, the distribution of regions with a higher incidence of influenza has shifted from the west to the east of the country. A significant relationship was observed between the incidence of influenza and factors related to air pollution. The contents of five air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and CO) were significantly positively correlated with the incidence of influenza, with a decreasing order of contribution to it of SO(2) > CO > NO(2) > PM(2.5) > PM(10). The content of O(3) in the air was negatively correlated with the incidence of influenza. The influence of air pollution-related factors on the incidence of influenza in different regions and seasons showed minor differences. The large-scale empirical results provided here can supply a scientific basis for governmental disease control authorities to formulate strategies for regional prevention and control.","Song, Yang; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Tingting; Qian, Sitong; Wang, Shijun",Chin Geogr Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457542/,483

The synthesized compounds were designed to bear the reported pharmacophoric features of the HDAC inhibitors in addition to an extra moiety to occupy the non-used vacant deep pocket of the HDAC receptor. The newly prepared compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities against HepG-2 and HuH-7 liver cancer cell lines. The tested compounds showed promising anti-proliferative activities against both cell lines. The most active ten candidates (6 (c), 6 (d), 6 (f), 6 (g), 6 (k), 6 (l), 7 (b), 8, 10 (h), and 12) were further evaluated for their effect on the gene expression levels of Bax as an apoptotic marker and Bcl-2 as an anti-apoptotic one. Moreover, they were evaluated for their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC6) activities. Compound 6 (c) achieved the best cytotoxic activities on both HepG-2 and HuH-7 cell lines with IC(50) values of 1.53 and 3.06 µM, respectively, and also it showed the most inhibitory activities on HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC6 with IC(50) values of 1.76, 1.39, and 3.46 µM, respectively, compared to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) as a reference drug (IC(50) = 0.86, 0.97, and 0.93 µM, respectively). Furthermore, it achieved a more characteristic arrest in the growth of cell population of HepG-2 at both G0/G1 and S phases with 1.23-, and 1.18-fold, respectively, compared to that of the control, as determined by cell cycle analysis. Also, compound 6 (c) showed a marked elevation in the AnxV-FITC apoptotic HepG-2 cells percentage in both early and late phases increasing the total apoptosis percentage by 9.98-, and 10.81-fold, respectively, compared to the control. Furthermore, docking studies were carried out to identify the proposed binding mode of the synthesized compounds towards the prospective target (HDAC4). In silico ADMET and toxicity studies revealed that most of the synthesized compounds have accepted profiles of drug-likeness with low toxicity. Finally, an interesting SAR analysis was concluded to help the future design of more potent HDACIs in the future by medicinal chemists.","Ma, Chao; Taghour, Mohammed S.; Belal, Amany; Mehany, Ahmed B.

As the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin has been shown to have inconsistent roles in the incidence of NDs. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to evaluate the effect of metformin exposure on onset of NDs. METHODS The observational studies that investigated the associations between metformin and the incidence of NDs were searched in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. A random-effect model was performed using STATA to calculate the combined ORs. RESULTS In total, 23 comparisons out of 19 studies with 285 966 participants were included. Meta-analysis found there was no significant effect on incidence of all the subtypes of NDs with metformin exposure (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). However, metformin monotherapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of PD incidence compared with non-metformin users or glitazone users (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.42). CONCLUSION Metformin has failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on NDs. In addition, it may increase the risk of PD development. In light of current results, how metformin would impact NDs, especially the potential risk of PD, needs to be scrutinized.

64771,Lessons From the Aftermaths of Green Revolution on Food System and Health.,2021-02-22,"To cope with climate change, it is of great importance to describe the temporal and spatial evolution of climate change vulnerability and its driving factors. Therefore, this paper establishes a comprehensive index of vulnerability to climate change based on the vulnerability scoring diagram (VSD) framework. Moran's I index is used to study the spatial evolution characteristics of vulnerability, and spatial regression analysis is used to explore the factors influencing the spatial distribution of vulnerability. The results show that (1) the climate change vulnerability of China has decreased over time, and the sensitivity state is relatively stable; however, the annual change in exposure and adaptive capacity is significant. (2) The western region of China is more vulnerable than the eastern region, and the most vulnerable provinces are Guizhou and Gansu. (3) The regional vulnerability is generally in a significant spatial agglomeration state. (4) Finally, the driving factors of the spatial distribution of climate change vulnerability include forest coverage, the urban-rural income gap and information technology. These recommendations provide detailed discussions and scientific information for mitigating global warming and formulating long-term emission reduction targets, thereby optimizing resource allocation and providing spatial governance directions for the formulation of adaptation policies.","Jiang, Huiqin; Yu, Yinhua; Chen, Miao-Miao; Huang, Wei",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13513-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763834/,483

We developed needlescopic intragastric surgery performed via 2 mm, 2 mm, and 5 mm ports (PEIGS-225). MATERIAL AND METHODS In cooperation with Niti-On Co., Ltd. we developed a series of 2 mm instruments including grasping forceps, a cannula, a laparoscope, an electrocautery, scissors, and a needle holder. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE Two 2 mm trocars and a 5 mm one are inserted into the gastric lumen percutaneously. Intragastric procedures are performed by the instruments brought through those three ports. The specimen is extracted via the esophageal-oral route. The defect in the gastroesophageal wall is closed by hand-suture. After the intragastric procedure, the 5 mm stab wound on the gastric wall is closed by hand-suture, while the 2 mm wounds are left untreated. PATIENTS Between March and August 2015 PEIGS-225 was performed in five patients. RESULTS There was no operative conversion. The mean operation time was 96 minutes. There were no perioperative complications. Pathological findings indicated that the margin was negative in all cases.

In addition to the health concerns, COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous impact on economic and political conditions of every nation. Ever since the start of pandemic the physicians were constrained to rely on the management strategies due to lack of clear understanding of the disease pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Scientists are working tirelessly to gather maximum information about the deadly virus and come up with various strategies which can be used against COVID-19 infection in terms of therapeutics and vaccine development. It is quite evident that virus infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and most of the deaths occur due to respiratory failure. As the virus spread through respiratory droplets, the strenuous exercise of preventive measures and large scale diagnosis has been in practice across the globe to prevent the transmission. This review amalgamates the various updates and acts as an umbrella to provide insights on SARS-CoV-2 mediated ARDS pathogenesis, impact of co-morbidities, diagnostics, current progress in vaccine development, and promising therapeutics and immuno-modulatory strategies highlighting various concerns and gaps that need to be addressed to fight current and future pandemics effectively.","Narota, Arun; Puri, Gayatri; Singh, Vikram Pal; Kumar, Ashwani; Naura, Amarjit S",Current molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2174/1566524021666210408103921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829971/,483
74897,Therapeutic drug monitoring-based dosing of TNF inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the way forward?,2019,"BACKGROUND Considering most people who inject drugs (PWID) received help with the first injection, understanding the perspective of potential 'initiators' is a priority to inform harm reduction interventions. This paper examines how PWID narrate their experiences with injection initiation and assistance from the lens of their lived experience and perceptions of harm reduction. METHODS In-depth interviews were conducted with individuals who reported injection drug use and recent (past 30 days) opioid use in Baltimore (N = 19) and Anne Arundel County (N = 4), Maryland and analyzed using a narrative approach. RESULTS Respondents cast initiation events as meaningful transitions to a life characterized by predictable harms, including homelessness, infections, and social stigma. Respondents used examples from their personal experience to explain experiences with initiation and assistance by strategically attributing personal agency and predicting specific injection-related harms for initiates. In their narratives, respondents balanced notions of individual agency with harm reduction intentions by distinguishing between two forms of harm: perceived inevitable distal harm caused by long-term injection (e.g. socioeconomic decline) and potentially avoidable proximal harm caused by risky injection practices (e.g. overdose, HIV). CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight opportunities for interventions targeting injection initiation events and support the implementation of safer injection training in interventions. This identity of the 'responsible drug user' could be leveraged to support employing peers to help mitigate harm among inexperienced PWID either through peer outreach or formal venues, such as overdose prevention sites.","Weicker, Noelle P; Whaley, Sara; Urquhart, Glenna; Park, Ju Nyeong; Sherman, Susan G; Owczarzak, Jill",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1958854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348070/,483

Current data so far indicate low incidence of AKI in Covid-19 disease. OBJECTIVE In this retrospective study, we analysed the clinical features of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and investigated the effect of Covid-19 on kidney function. METHODS Ninety-six patients diagnosed with Covid-19 were included in our study. Demographic features (Age, gender, co-morbidities), symptoms, thorax CT findings, Covid-19 PCR results and laboratory findings were recorded. The clinical features of the patients were analysed and kidney function values before Covid-19 diagnosis were compared with kidney function values after Covid-19 diagnosis. RESULTS Most presenting symptom was fever (51%). Most accompanying co-morbidity was hypertension (56%). According to laboratory findings; ferritin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels were statistically significantly higher in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .002, P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Also lymphocyte levels were statistically significantly lower in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .042). According to KDIGO criteria 3 (3.1%) patients had AKI during the hospital stay. For all patients, there was statistically significant difference between basal, 1st, 5th and 10th day BUN and SCr levels (P = .024 and P = .018, respectively). For severe pneumonia group there was statistically significant difference between basal, 1st, 5th and 10th day SCr levels (P = .045). CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that Covid-19 can cause renal impairment both with pneumonia and ARDS.

92531,David Oliver: A vision for transparent post-covid government.,2021-05-05,"In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths. The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation. The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators. The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies. Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes. Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.","Ambrosino, Immacolata; Barbagelata, Elena; Ortona, Elena; Ruggieri, Anna; Massiah, Grace; Giannico, Orazio Valerio; Politi, Cecilia; Moretti, Anna Maria",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449614/,483
92571,Removal of atmospheric CO2 by rock weathering holds promise for mitigating climate change.,2020-07-01,"COVID-19, which is caused by the single-stranded RNA severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has introduced significant therapeutic dilemmas in several areas. One of these is concern regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. Dysfunction of the RAS has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with improved or worse clinical outcomes, remains unclear. RAS inhibitors are currently widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, several recently published research papers have focused on the management of hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic, as this co-morbidity was found to be the most common in patients with coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV-2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm. While the SARS-CoV-2 viral load remains the highest in upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, it has also been reported in multiple sites in COVID-19, and patients not infrequently require the Intensive Care Units (ICU) admission. However, despite the theoretical concerns of possible increased ACE2 expression by RAS blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection, and indeed they have been shown to be beneficial in some animal studies. In this review we summarise the pathophysiology of the interaction between RAS, ACEIs/ARBs inhibitors and COVID-19, and conclude, on the basis of current data, that RAS blockade should be maintained during the current coronavirus pandemic.","Dworakowska, D; Grossman, A B",Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.26402/jpp.2020.2.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633235/,483
94409,In situ split of the liver when portal venous embolization fails to induce hypertrophy: a report of two cases.,2013,"PURPOSE Chronic postoperative pain is probably the most significant complication of tension-free inguinal hernia repair as its presence can considerably affect the life quality of the patient. Different mesh materials and different surgical techniques for mesh fixation have been applied to reduce chronic postoperative pain, with controversial, nevertheless, results. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the effect of a relatively new mesh with self-fixating properties, used to repair inguinal hernia with the Lichtenstein technique, on early and chronic postoperative pain. METHODS Between June 2009 and June 2010, 50 patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were treated using the Lichtenstein technique. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a polypropylene mesh, fixed with polypropylene sutures (n = 25; group A), or a self-fixating polypropylene mesh with resorbable polylactic acid microgrips (n = 25; group B). Demographic data were recorded. Early and chronic postoperative pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Duration of surgery, complications, length of hospitalization and recurrence were also recorded. RESULTS No statistical difference was found between the two groups in association to demographic data. Operating time was 53.4 ± 12.5 and 44.4 ± 7.2 min in groups A and B, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). No difference was observed between the groups regarding the postoperative complications. The VAS of early postoperative pain was 1.7 ± 1.9 in group A and 1.3 ± 1.6 in group B, with the difference being not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Concerning chronic pain, no remarkable statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups at 3-month, 1- and 2-year follow-up period. At the end of the study, no recurrence was reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS Self-fixating mesh can be safely and effectively used in inguinal hernia repair with the additional advantage of reducing the operative time compared to the classic Lichtenstein technique. However, its use is not accompanied by reduced rates in early or chronic postoperative pain.","Chatzimavroudis, G; Papaziogas, B; Koutelidakis, I; Galanis, I; Atmatzidis, S; Christopoulos, P; Doulias, T; Atmatzidis, K; Makris, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1211-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24430578/,483

In the summer during the COVID-19 pandemic, a differential diagnosis between the two conditions is important. However, no studies have compared and distinguished heat-related illness from COVID-19. We aimed to compare the data between patients with early-stage heat-related illness and those with COVID-19. METHODS This retrospective observational study included 90 patients with early-stage heat-related illness selected from Heatstroke STUDY 2017-2019 (nationwide registries of heat-related illness in Japan) and 86 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with complaints of fever or fatigue and were admitted to one of two hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS Amongvital signs, systolic blood pressure (119 vs. 125 mmHg, p = 0.02), oxygen saturation (98% vs. 97%, p < 0.001), and body temperature (36.6 vs. 37.6 °C, p<0.001) showed significant between-group differences for the heatstroke and COVID-19 groups, respectively. Numerous intergroup differences in laboratory findings were present, including white blood cell counts (10.8 vs. 5.2 × 103/μL, p<0.001), creatinine (2.2 vs. 0.85 mg/dL, p<0.001), and C-reactive protein (0.2 vs. 2.8 mg/dL, p<0.001), although a logistic regression model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 using these three factors. A Random Forest machine learning model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC of 0.908, 0.976, 0.842, and 0.978, respectively. Creatinine was the most important feature of this model.

AREAS COVERED Peer-reviewed research is summarized regarding the complications of COVID-19 as related to the pandemic's impact on hospital admissions, imaging capabilities, treatment times, and outcomes of neurointerventional cases. EXPERT OPINION In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a global decline in neuroimaging, use of intravenous thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and coil embolization for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. An early recommendation to utilize general anesthesia and intubate all patients undergoing intervention to avoid an emergent aerosolizing procedure was found to have worse outcomes. The decline in new stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnoses may be related to patient and/or family fear of seeking acute medical care. A true shift in stroke epidemiology is also possible. As several vaccines become more readily available and the world rebounds from this pandemic, we hope to transform the neurointerventional experiences discussed in this paper into strategies that may improve care delivery of neurologically ill patients during a global crisis.","Rana, Ameena; Nguyen, Thanh N; Siegler, James E",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2021.1928495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966557/,483
102169,Cognitive Deficits and Clinical Symptoms with Hippocampal Subfields in First-Episode and Never-Treated Patients with Schizophrenia.,2020-09-09,"Viruses commonly antagonize innate immune pathways that are primarily driven by Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB), Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription proteins (STAT) family of transcription factors. Such a strategy allows viruses to evade immune surveillance and maximize their replication. Using an unbiased RNA-seq based approach to measure gene expression induced by transfected viral genomic RNA (vgRNA) and reovirus infection, we discovered that mammalian reovirus inhibits host cell innate immune signaling. We found that, while vgRNA and reovirus infection both induce a similar IRF dependent gene expression program, gene expression driven by the NF-κB family of transcription factors is lower in infected cells. Potent agonists of NF-κB such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) and vgRNA failed to induce NF-κB dependent gene expression in infected cells. We demonstrate that NF-κB signaling is blocked due to loss of critical members of the Inhibitor of KappaB Kinase (IKK) complex, NF-κB Essential MOdifier (NEMO) and IKKβ. The loss of the IKK complex components prevents nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of NF-κB, thereby preventing gene expression. Our studies demonstrate that reovirus infection selectively blocks NF-κB, likely to counteract its antiviral effects and promote efficient viral replication.IMPORTANCEHost cells mount a response to curb virus replication in infected cells and prevent spread of virus to neighboring, as yet uninfected cells. The NF-κB family of proteins is important for the cell to mediate this response. In this study, we show that in cells infected with mammalian reovirus, NF-κB is inactive. Further, we demonstrate that NF-κB is rendered inactive because virus infection results in reduced levels of upstream intermediaries (called IKKs) that are needed for NF-κB function. Based on previous evidence that active NF-κB limits reovirus infection, we conclude that inactivating NF-κB is a viral strategy to produce a cellular environment that is favorable for virus replication.","McNamara, Andrew J; Danthi, Pranav",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00382-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161168/,483

Here, we explore the issue through extensive analyses using a combination of structure-based methods and bioinformatics tools on130 sPLA2 family members. The principal component analysis of the structure ensemble reveals that the enzyme has an open-close motion which helps widen the substrate binding channel, facilitating its binding to phospholipid. Performing elastic network model and sequence analyses found that the residues critical for family functions, such as cysteine and catalytic residues, are highly conserved and undergo minimal movements, which is evolutionarily essential as their perturbation would impact the function, while the four residue regions involved in the association with the calcium ion/membrane are lowly conserved and of high mobility and large variations in low-to-intermediate frequency modes, which reflects the specificity of members. The analyses from perturbation response scanning also reveal that the above four regions with high sensitivity to an external perturbation are member-specific, suggesting their different roles in allosteric modulation, while the minimal sensitive residues are the shared characteristics across family members, which play an important role in maintaining structural stability as the folding core. This study is helpful for understanding how sequences, structures, and dynamics of sPLA2 family members evolve to ensure their common and specific functions and can provide a guide for accurate design of proteins with finely tuned activities.","Zhang, Shan; Gong, Weikang; Han, Zhongjie; Liu, Yang; Li, Chunhua",The journal of physical chemistry.

Methods From January 2018 to January 2020, 80 patients who met the research criteria in the First Central Hospital of Baoding, China were selected. According to the time of onset, they were divided into test group and control group, with 40 cases in each group. Forty patients in the test group were beyond time window (6~24h) and the MRI showed a DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Forty patients in the control group were within the time window (< 6h). All patients received endovascular treatment (EVT). The mRS, NIHSS and infarct volume of patients in the test group were compared and analyzed before and 30 and 90 days after treatment, as well as the indicators of both groups of patients before and after treatment, to determine therapeutic effect in patients receiving EVT beyond time window. Meanwhile, the recanalization of the blood vessel and the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage of patients in both groups were compared to determine the safety in patients receiving EVT beyond time window under DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Results The mRS, NIHSS and infarct size in the test group were significantly improved before and 30 and 90 days after treatment (p<0.05). The test group showed no significant difference in mRS, NIHSS and other indicators when compared with the control group (p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of recanalization of the blood vessel and intracranial hemorrhage after treatment between both groups (p>0.05). Conclusion DWI-FLAIR mismatch can be used as an objective imaging basis for intravascular interventional therapy in patients with stroke with over-time window and large vessel occlusion.

An absolute binding energy (ΔG) of -42 kJ mol-1 for the protein-ligand (Mpro-N3) complex has been calculated using the potential-of-mean-force (geometrical) approach. Furthermore, the relative binding energies were computed for the top docking results. Our results suggest several promising approved and bioactive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as follows: a bioactive compound, ChEMBL275592, which has the best MM/GBSA binding energy; the second-best compound, montelukast, is an approved drug used in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis; the third-best compound, ChEMBL288347, is a bioactive compound. Bromocriptine and saquinavir are other approved drugs that also demonstrate stability in the active site of Mpro, albeit their relative binding energies are low compared to the N3 inhibitor. This study provides useful insights into de novo protein design and novel inhibitor development, which could reduce the cost and time required for the discovery of a potent drug to combat SARS-CoV-2.","Abu-Saleh, Abd Al-Aziz A; Awad, Ibrahim E; Yadav, Arpita; Poirier, Raymond A",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp04326e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025993/,483
115818,Phosphite Integrated in Late Blight Treatment Strategies in Starch Potato Does Not Cause Residues in the Starch Product.,2020-08-24,"Little is known about the cellular mechanisms of innate immunity against dengue virus (DV) infection. Specifically, the γδ T cell response to DV has not been characterized in detail. In this article, we demonstrate that markers of activation, proliferation, and degranulation are upregulated on γδ T cells in PBMC isolated from individuals with acute dengue fever. Primary γδ T cells responded rapidly in vitro to autologous DV-infected dendritic cells by secreting IFN-γ and upregulating CD107a. The anti-DV IFN-γ response is regulated by type I IFN and IL-18 in a TCR-independent manner, and IFN-γ secreting γδ T cells predominantly expressed IL-18Rα. Antagonizing the ATP-dependent P2X7 receptor pathway of inflammasome activation significantly inhibited the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells. Overnight priming with IL-18 produced effector γδ T cells with significantly increased ability to lyse autologous DV-infected dendritic cells. Monocytes were identified as accessory cells that augmented the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells. Lack of monocytes in culture is associated with lower IL-18 levels in culture supernatant and diminished production of IFN-γ by γδ T cells, whereas addition of exogenous IL-18 restored the IFN-γ response of γδ T cells in monocyte-depleted cocultures with DV-infected DC. Our results indicate that primary γδ T cells contribute to the immune response during DV infection by providing an early source of IFN-γ, as well as by killing DV-infected cells, and suggest that monocytes participate as accessory cells that sense DV infection and amplify the cellular immune response against this virus in an IL-18-dependent manner.","Tsai, Chen-Yu; Liong, Ka Hang; Gunalan, Matilda Gertrude; Li, Na; Lim, Daniel Say Liang; Fisher, Dale A; MacAry, Paul A; Leo, Yee Sin; Wong, Siew-Cheng; Puan, Kia Joo; Wong, Soon Boon Justin",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1303343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732728/,483

In light of its aging population, the US has supported services focused on enabling older adults to continue living in their current homes, a model commonly described as ""aging in place."" The lived experience of aging in place is not well documented in existing systematic reviews. The aims of this systematic review are to synthesize and evaluate the existing qualitative evidence on experiences of aging in place in the US and identify knowledge gaps and directions for future studies. METHODS Six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Sociological Abstracts) will be searched. Studies presenting qualitative data on the experiences of older adults currently aging in place in the US will be included. Covidence software will be used to screen studies and extract data. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research will be used to assess quality and risk of bias of included studies. We will use meta-ethnography, following the method described by Noblit and Hare, to synthesize and evaluate the results of the included studies. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to integrate and synthesize the findings of qualitative studies of aging in place focusing on older adults in the US.

128530,BreathSens: A Continuous On-Bed Respiratory Monitoring System With Torso Localization Using an Unobtrusive Pressure Sensing Array.,2015,"An earlier article, inspired by overflow models in telecommunication systems with multiple streams of telephone calls, proposed a new analytical model for a network of intensive care units (ICUs), and a new patient referral policy for such networks to reduce the blocking probability of external emergency patients without degrading the quality of service (QoS) of canceled elective operations, due to the more efficient use of ICU capacity overall. In this work, we use additional concepts and insights from traditional teletraffic theory, including resource sharing, trunk reservation, and mutual overflow, to design a new patient referral policy to further improve ICU network efficiency. Numerical results based on the analytical model demonstrate that our proposed policy can achieve a higher acceptance level than the original policy with a smaller number of beds, resulting in improved service for all patients. In particular, our proposed policy can always achieve much lower blocking probabilities for external emergency patients while still providing sufficient service for internal emergency and elective patients. In addition, we provide new accurate and computationally efficient analytical approximations for QoS evaluation of ICU networks using our proposed policy. We demonstrate numerically that our new approximation method yields more accurate, robust and conservative results overall than the traditional approximation. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed approximation method can be applied to solve resource planning and optimization problems for ICU networks in a scalable and computationally efficient manner.","Chan, Yin-Chi; Wong, Eric W M; Joynt, Gavin; Lai, Paul; Zukerman, Moshe",Health care management science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-017-9412-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755176/,483

Summary Vedolizumab is a safe and effective drug to induce and maintain clinical remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in both clinical trials and real-world data. Various guidelines recommend vedolizumab as a first- or second-line treatment regimen for steroid-dependent, steroid, or immunomodulator refractory cases of UC and CD; however, it is more effective in anti-TNF-naive patients. The first head-to-head trial (VARSITY trial) comparing the efficacy of vedolizumab to adalimumab has shown better clinical remission and mucosal healing with vedolizumab. Key Messages In this review, we have discussed guidelines recommendation of vedolizumab use, as well as its safety data, use in special population, in presence of extraintestinal complications, therapeutic drug monitoring, data from Asian patients, along with other evolving concepts.

However, the rising global trends of the so-called incurable diseases continue to put pressure on Pharma industries and other drug discovery platforms. In the past, drugs with more than one target were deemed as undesirable options with interest being on the one-drug-single target. Despite the successes of the single-target drugs, it is currently beyond doubt that these drugs have limited efficacy against complex diseases in which the pathogenesis is dependent on a set of biochemical events and several bioreceptors operating concomitantly. Different approaches have thus been proposed to come up with effective drugs to combat even the complex diseases. In the past, the focus was on producing drugs from screening plant compounds; today, we talk about combination therapy and multi-targeting drugs. The multi-target drugs have recently attracted much attention as promising tools to fight against most challenging diseases, and thus a new research focus area. This review will discuss the potential impact of multi-target drug approach on various complex diseases with focus on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases as the main representatives of multifactorial diseases.

However, interactions between their biogeochemical fates remain poorly characterized, with absence of efficient route to decontamination of this combined pollution. In this work, microbial-driven Pyr degradation coupled to V(V) reduction was demonstrated for the first time. Removal efficiencies of Pyr and V(V) reached 94.8 ± 1.55% and 51.2 ± 0.20% in 72 h operation. The supplementation of co-substrate (glucose) deteriorated Pyr degradation slightly, but significantly promoted V(V) reduction efficiency to 84.5 ± 0.635%. Pyr was mineralized with NH4+-N accumulation, while insoluble vanadium (IV) was the major product from V(V) bio-reduction. It was observed that Bacillus and Pseudomonas realized synchronous Pyr and V(V) removals independently. Interspecific synergy between Pyr degraders and V(V) reducers also functioned with addition of co-substrate. V(V) was bio-reduced through alternative electron acceptor pathway conducted by gene nirS encoded nitrite reductase, which was evidenced by gene abundance and enzyme activity. Cytochrome c, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and extracellular polymeric substances also contributed to the coupled bioprocess.

Our objective was to study the relationship between CTP-derived parameters and outcome and treatment effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke because of a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. METHODS We included 175 patients who underwent CTP in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN). Association of CTP-derived parameters (ischemic-core volume, penumbra volume, and percentage ischemic core) with outcome was estimated with multivariable ordinal logistic regression as an adjusted odds ratio for a shift in the direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. Interaction between CTP-derived parameters and treatment effect was determined using multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Interaction with treatment effect was also tested for mismatch (core <70 mL; penumbra core >1.2; penumbra core >10 mL). RESULTS The adjusted odds ratio for improved functional outcome for ischemic core, percentage ischemic core, and penumbra were 0.79 per 10 mL (95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.89; P<0.001), 0.82 per 10% (95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.90; P=0.002), and 0.97 per 10 mL (96% confidence interval: 0.92-1.01; P=0.15), respectively. No significant interaction between any of the CTP-derived parameters and treatment effect was observed. We observed no significant interaction between mismatch and treatment effect.

This systematic review facilitates decision-making concerning the optimal choice for a suitable fall risk assessment test for older persons in four different settings. This systematic review provides an overview of reliability and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity [SE], specificity, likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities) of commonly used performance measures to assess older persons' fall risk. Methods Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of all articles identified through a systematic search on the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. The methodological quality was critically appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and the COSMIN risk of bias tool. Due to a setting-dependent fall risk, four relevant settings were selected for the analyses: 1) community dwelling, 2) nursing home, 3) hospital, and 4) the combined setting of hospitalized and community-dwelling persons. Results Recommendations for diagnostic accuracy can be made for the specific settings: setting 1) mini-balance evaluation system test, timed up and go test with fast speed (TUG FAST), cognitive TUG FAST, functional reach test, and fast gait speed; 2) TUG at usual speed; 3) none of the included tests; and 4) some hip muscle strength and hand grip strength tests might be recommended. Conclusion The review's results are applicable for use in clinical practice, both on a population and on an individual level for patients and caregivers. Most measures' reliability is sufficient. However, the included tests' discriminative ability is not optimal for clinical use in relevant settings.

Alongside the more established categories of the sustainability of materials used and the technical construction processes and economic investments mobilized, there are now new facets of the idea of sustainability. They affect the impact that architecture can have on communities in terms of social relations and quality of context of life. This work explores the idea of landscape sustainability of architecture, understood as the ability of man-made interventions to belong to the context and the inhabitants, while promoting forms of alliance with the ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scale. Starting from the analysis of some trends in contemporary architecture that deals with these problems, the research identifies the volcanic environment as a terrain for exploration, with particular interest in its natural characteristics and dynamic interactions with anthropic contexts.

As an architect from the Canary Islands, he has developed his own modus operandi which, while rooted in its original context, is inspired by principles of social, cultural, and landscape sustainability of architecture that are valid today everywhere. The objective of this work is therefore to draw a reflection from his architectural poetics, with the intention of outlining the features of a possible contemporary design posture based on principles of landscape sustainability.","Calvagna, Simona",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208711,483

Sehingga berimbas pada pembatasan aktivitas salah satunya sekolah. Muncul kebijakan yang memaksa guru dan murid tetap bekerja dan belajar di dalam rumah. Kebijakan ini tentunya tidak hanya berdampak pada relasi guru dan murid selama belajar di rumah. Namun juga pentingnya optimalisasi peran orang tua dalam pelaksanaan belajar di rumah. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan peran orang tua sebagai pengganti guru sekolah pada masa pandemi COVID-19 siswa SMP Negeri 1 Panai Tengah Kabupaten Labuhanbatu. Metode penelitian menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan pada bulan Desember – Januari 2020. Responden penelitian ini yaitu orang tua siswa SMP Negeri 1 Panai Tengah sebanyak 64 orang. Instrumen penelitian yaitu melalui penyebaran angket. Analisis data nya menggunakan reduksi data penyajian data dan kesimpulan. Pembelajaran di rumah sangat efektif untuk diterapkan namun bukan berarti pembelajaran di sekolah tidak efektif dibandingkan kegiatan pembelajaran di rumah. Guru memberikan tugas karena terbatasnya waktu belajar dan sulitnya berinteraksi selama pembelajaran dirumah, oleh karena itu banyak sebagian guru yang mengganti hal tersebut menjadi pemberian tugas untuk memantapkan kemampuan anak mengenai materi yang dipelajari. Maka, sebagai orang tua wajib memberikan motivasi kepada anaknya belajar di rumah, baik dalam keadaan orang tua bekerja maupun orang tua yang hanya menjadi ibu rumah tangga. Orang tua berperan untuk membimbing anaknya dalam belajar, tugas orang tua juga di harapkan sebagai pembimbing, pendidik, penjaga dan pengawas. Dan peran serta orang tua dalam melakukan pembelajaran dirumah sebagai pintu terdepan untuk meningkatkan hasil belajar dan prestasi anak.","Rahayu, Puji; Rohana, Rohana; Febriani, Eka; id,",Jurnal Ilmiah Profesi Pendidikan,https://doi.org/10.29303/jipp.v6i1.157,483

These measures, although straightforward to follow, highlight the tip of an imbalanced socio-economic and socio-technological iceberg. Here, a System Dynamic (SD) model of COVID-19 preventive measures and their correlation with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is presented. The result demonstrates a better informed view of the COVID-19 vulnerability landscape. This novel qualitative approach refreshes debates on the future of SDGS amid the crisis and provides a powerful mental representation for decision makers to find leverage points that aid in preventing long-term disruptive impacts of this health crisis on people, planet and economy. There is a need for further tailor-made and real-time qualitative and quantitative scientific research to calibrate the criticality of meeting the SDGS targets in different countries according to ongoing lessons learned from this health crisis.","Beigi, Shima",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02290v1.pdf,483
163432,Zero-shot Text Classification via Knowledge Graph Embedding for Social Media Data,2021,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory small non-coding RNAs that function as translational repressors. MiRNAs are involved in most cellular processes, and their expression and function are presided by several factors. Amongst, miRNA editing is an epitranscriptional modification that alters the original nucleotide sequence of selected miRNAs, possibly influencing their biogenesis and target-binding ability. A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing are recognized as the canonical types, with the A-to-I type being the predominant one.

Design: Population-wide register-based cohort study. Setting: Primary and lower secondary schools in Norway have been open during the academic year 2020/2021 with strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in place. All identified contacts including student and staff members were urged to get tested following a positive SARS-CoV-2 case in a school. Participants: All students and educational staff in Norwegian primary and lower secondary schools from August 2020 to June 2021. Main outcome measures: Overall secondary attack rate (SAR14) was operationalized as the number of secondary cases (among students and/or staff) in the school by 14 days after the index case, divided by the number of students and staff members in the school. Moreover, we calculated SAR14-to-students, denoting transmission from all index cases to students only, SAR14-to-school staff, denoting transmission from all index cases to staff members only. We also calculated these measures in stratified samples consisting of student index cases or school staff index cases. Results: From August 2020 to June 2021 there were 4,078 index cases, 79% were students and 21% were school staff. In the majority (55%) of schools with an index case, no secondary cases were observed by 14 days, and in 16% of the schools there were only one secondary case within 14 days. Overall SAR14 was found to be 0.33% (95%CI 0.32-0.33). Staff-to-staff transmission (SAR14 0.45%, 95%CI 0.40-0.52) was found to be slightly more common than student-to-student (SAR14 0.33%, 95%CI 0.32-0.34) and student-to-staff (SAR14 0.28%, 95%CI 0.25-0.30) transmission. Conclusions: Our results confirm that schools have not been an important arena of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway and therefore support that schools can be kept open with IPC measures in place.","Rotevatn, T.

The paper reviews and analyses the literature by focusing on keywords like “Blockchain AND COVID-19”. In response to the 2019 pandemic, most local governments closed their borders and imposed movement restrictions, impacting the global economy, peoples' mobility and everyday life. This study aims to provide a solution to how Blockchain technology can improve the socioeconomic impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by enhancing people's mobility and achieving a balance between protecting individuals' rights and public health safety.Design/methodology/approachThis research utilized machine learning bibliometric tools for investigating the normative literature in the area of blockchain and COVID-19. The article conducts a systematic literature review and develops a bibliometric map based on Plevris et al.’s (2017) method.FindingsThis study indicates that there is limited literature on the use of blockchain technology in issuing and validating COVID-19 tests. The development of such solutions can be done through the utilization of smart contracts, and it is expected to increase mobility in a secure and trusted environment that will help in monitoring and slow down the spread of the pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThis analysis is done during the first ten months of the pandemic outbreak, and there is still limited scientific literature investigating blockchain and COVID-19 concepts.Practical ImplicationsOrganizations are rethinking their information management due to the COVID-19 pandemic for creating better value for the enterprise and all associate stakeholders. Blockchain technology helps organizations to move from a centralized to a decentralized way of information managing. The decentralization of information in the health-care sector will create a better value for all involved stakeholders and radical change in how health-care data are managed and controlled. The implementation of blockchain applications in the health-care industry will result in a more secure, visible, auditable environment accessible by all the parties involved.Originality/valueIt was identified that there is currently limited research done on aligning smart contracts structure within the health-care sector. Therefore, while the current literature demonstrates the importance of aligning the key concepts, little research is done on considering people’s mobility and cross-country communication.","Papadaki, Maria Karamitsos Ioannis Themistocleous Marinos",Journal of Enterprise Information Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jeim-07-2021-554,483

Breathing is indispensable to human life and changes in respiratory rates and breathing patterns are an indicator of various states of diseases. Hence, this research studies a method of recognizing inhalation and exhalation through a face mask. Initially, videos of people breathing were recorded using a thermal camera. Next, still images were extracted from each video. Then, image masking was applied to detect blue and red colors. The obtained information was used to indicate inhalation and exhalation.

164512,Urban Zoning for Sustainable Tourism: A Continuum of Accommodation to Enhance City Resilience,2021,"Nelfinavir is one of the FDA approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors and is a part of HAART therapy for the treatment of HIV-AIDS. Nelfinavir was the first HIV-1 protease inhibitor to be approved as a Paediatric formulation. The application of HAART had resulted into significant improvement in the life of AIDS patients. However, emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 protease limited the use of many of these drugs including nelfinavir. A unique mutation observed frequently in patients treated with nelfinavir is D30N as it is selected exclusively by nelfinavir. It imparts very high resistance to nelfinavir but unlike other primary mutations does not give cross resistance to the majority of other drugs. D30N mutation also significantly reduces cleavage activity of HIV-1 protease and affects the viral fitness. Here, we have determined structures of D30N HIV-1 protease in unliganded form and in complex with the drug nelfinavir. These structures provide rationale for reduced cleavage activity and molecular basis of resistance induced by D30N mutation. The loss of coulombic interaction part of a crucial hydrogen bond between the drug and the enzyme, is a likely explanation for reduced affinity and drug resistance towards nelfinavir. The decreased catalytic activity of D30N HIV protease, due to altered interaction with substrates and reduced stability of folding core may be the reasons for reduced replicative capacity of the HIV harboring D30N HIV-1 protease.","Bihani, Subhash C; Hosur, Madhusoodan V",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.28.433284,483

Conversational search systems make it possible to improve user satisfaction by asking questions to clarify users' search intents. This, however, can take significant effort to answer a series of questions starting with""what/why/how"". To quickly identify user intent and reduce effort during interactions, we propose an intent clarification task based on yes/no questions where the system needs to ask the correct question about intents within the fewest conversation turns. In this task, it is essential to use negative feedback about the previous questions in the conversation history. To this end, we propose a Maximum-Marginal-Relevance (MMR) based BERT model (MMR-BERT) to leverage negative feedback based on the MMR principle for the next clarifying question selection. Experiments on the Qulac dataset show that MMR-BERT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly on the intent identification task and the selected questions also achieve significantly better performance in the associated document retrieval tasks.","Bi, Keping; Ai, Qingyao; Croft, W.

Will COVID-19 further exacerbate the tide of anti-economic globalization? International trade gradually turns from commodity trade to factor flow after economic globalization. Therefore, this paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on economic globalization from the perspective of factor flow. This paper finds that COVID-19 causes the deterioration of the market environment. The deterioration of the market environment leads to the restriction of production and the decline of purchasing power, which may temporarily restrain the economic development within countries. Strict import and export controls have reduced or even temporarily disrupted the flow of factors between countries with close trade links. The consequence of the disruption is that International direct investment projects may be delayed by the emergence of COVID-19, that factor resources of the investing country may not be integrated with host country resources, and that economic globalization is temporarily hindered. © 2021 ACM.","Jia, X.","6th International Conference on Information Management and Technology, CIMTECH 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3465631.3465690,483

We observed annually re-occurring geographic clusters of influenza incidences, mainly associated with net income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination against influenza was also mainly associated with household income and was linked to the likelihood of influenza-like illness within an urban quarter. Transmissions patterns within and between quarters were complex.

Prior works of tackling ℓ0 attacks can neither eliminate perturbed pixels nor improve the performance of the classifier in the recovered low-quality images. To address the issue, we propose a novel method, called space transformation pixel defender (STPD), to transform any image into a latent space to separate the perturbed pixels from the normal pixels. In particular, this strategy uses a set of one-class classifiers, including Isolation Forest and Elliptic Envelope, to locate the perturbed pixels from adversarial examples. The value of the neighboring normal pixels is then used to replace the perturbed pixels, which hold more than half of the votes from these one-class classifiers. We use our proposed strategy to successfully defend against well-known ℓ0-norm adversarial examples in the image classification settings.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of household ETS exposure on symptom frequency and clinical severity in children and adolescents with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included pediatric cases (&lt;18 years old) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, who were admitted to our hospital between 20.03.2020 and 01.05.2020. Patients with respiratory diseases and active smokers were excluded. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, and clinical severity of COVID-19 were obtained from parents and children using a questionnaire and from patients' files. Household ETS exposure was assessed by questionnaire. Results: A total of 167 patients (median age 145 months, 50.7 % male) were included in the study. The frequency of household ETS exposure was 50.9%, and the frequency of cough was significantly higher in exposed children than non-exposed children (71.4% vs 50.8% respectively, p=0.02). The frequency of both fever and cough was significantly higher ETS-exposed in the subgroup of cases with a mild clinical course (69.5% vs 48.1% respectively, p= 0.02 for fever and 67.8% vs 44.4% respectively, p=0.01 for cough). There was no relationship between clinical severity and household ETS exposure. Conclusion: Household ETS exposure may impact COVID-19 pediatric cases as demonstrated by the increased frequency of cough and fever in ETS-exposed children. As new lockdown measures are implemented, increasing public awareness about the effect of household ETS exposure on COVID-19as well as encouraging a decrease in ETS exposure are essential.

The traditional U-Net scheme is employed to examine the COVID-19 infection present in the lung CT images. This scheme is implemented on the benchmark COVID-19 images existing in the literature (300 images) and the segmentation performance of the U-Net is confirmed by computing the essential performance measures using a relative assessment among the extracted lesion and the Ground-Truth (GT).

More online product service providers makes it better for people but also raises the question of product quality and services. So it is easy for new customers to get scammed while shopping online. Our goal is to make a system that will analyze the customer's feedback from online shopping and provide a ratio of the positive and negative feedback written in Bangla from the previous customers using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have collected over 1000 feedback and comments on the product to conduct the research. We used sentiment analysis along with some classification algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Logistic Regression. With the highest accuracy of 88.81%, SVM outperformed all the other algorithms.","Shafin, M. A.; Hasan, M. M.; Alam, M. R.; Mithu, M. A.; Nur, A. U.; Faruk, M.

To better develop personalized learning plans for students, it is necessary to build a model that can automatically evaluate students’ performance in online education. For this purpose, in this study we propose an ensemble learning method named light gradient boosting channel attention network (LGBCAN), which is based on label distribution estimation. First, the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is used to predict the performance in online learning tasks. Then The Channel Attention Network (CAN) model further improves the function of LightGBM by focusing on better results in the K-fold CrossEntropy of LightGBM. The results are converted into predicted classes through post-processing methods named approximation of label distribution to complete the classification task. The experiments are employed on two datasets, data science bowl (DSB) and answer correctness prediction (ACP).

166680,A Paradigm Shift in International Service-Learning: The Imperative for Reciprocal Learning,2021,"There is considerable inter-individual and inter-population variability in response to viruses. The potential of monocytes to elicit type-I interferon responses has attracted attention to their role in viral infections. Here, we use an ex vivo model to characterize the role of cellular heterogeneity in human variation of monocyte responses to influenza A virus (IAV) exposure. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show widespread inter-individual variability in the percentage of IAV-infected monocytes. We show that cells escaping viral infection display increased mRNA expression of type-I interferon stimulated genes and decreased expression of ribosomal genes, relative to both infected cells and those never exposed to IAV. While this host defense strategy is shared between CD16+/CD16- monocytes, we also uncover CD16+-specific mRNA expression of IL6 and TNF in response to IAV, and a stronger resistance of CD16+ monocytes to IAV infection. Notably, individuals with high cellular susceptibility to IAV are characterized by a lower activation at basal state of an IRF/STAT-induced transcriptional network, which includes antiviral genes such as IFITM3, MX1, and OAS3. Finally, using flow cytometry and bulk RNA-sequencing across 200 individuals of African and European ancestry, we observe a higher number of CD16+ monocytes and lower susceptibility to IAV infection among monocytes from individuals of African-descent. Collectively, our results reveal the effects of IAV infection on the transcriptional landscape of human monocytes and highlight previously unappreciated differences in cellular susceptibility to IAV infection between individuals of African and European ancestry, which may account for the greater susceptibility of Africans to severe influenza. Significance Statement Monocytes may play a critical role during severe viral infections. Our study tackles how heterogeneity in monocyte subsets and activation contributes to shape individual differences in the transcriptional response to viral infections. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal heterogeneity in monocyte susceptibility to IAV infection, both between CD16+/CD16- monocytes and across individuals, driven by differences in basal activation of an IRF/STAT-induced antiviral program. Furthermore, we show a decreased ability of IAV to infect and replicate in monocytes from African-ancestry individuals, with possible implications for antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. These results highlight the importance of early cellular activation in determining an individuals’ innate immune response to viral infection.","O’Neill, Mary; Quach, Hélène; Pothlichet, Julien; Aquino, Yann; Bisiaux, Aurélie; Zidane, Nora; Deschamps, Matthieu; Libri, Valentina; Hasan, Milena; Zhang, Shen-Ying; Zhang, Qian; Matuozzo, Daniela; Cobat, Aurélie; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Naffakh, Nadia; Rotival, Maxime; Quintana-Murci, Lluis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.414151,483

To understand whether the tool could support the needs of job seekers outside the U.S., we assessed it among 16 job seekers with limited education and language resources in Switzerland. While many of our results mirrored those of the U.S., we found that the tool was especially beneficial for non-French speaking immigrants who needed support describing their skills outside of their native language. We also found that listing skills like ""active listening""without important context was insufficient and risked hiding key skills and meaning behind those skills to employers. Taking these factors into account, we illustrate the design implications of our findings and directions for practitioners who wish to design employment tools in support of job seekers, especially those who have traditionally been excluded from the labor market.

As this pandemic persists the second, third and fourth quarters had shown variation in COVID-19 cases. In the first quarter of the year 2021 again there seems to be a rise in cases of COVID- 19. So, a comparative analysis from March 2020 - April 2021 of COVID-19 cases has been studied. Methodology: An exponential statistical model was used to calculate the predicted value of COVID-19 using doubling time for a short duration. The cases of COVID-19 were predicted from 10th April 2021 to 10th June 2021 using doubling time and exponential regression method. Results: The distribution of cases showed a curve-linear trend over the last one year. We explored various models like exponential, logarithmic (lo-linear), linear, quadratic, and generalized linear model (GLM) to fit into the observed distribution of cases. Since the distribution of cases was perfectly following a linear trend in each of the four segments, we applied a linear regression model to observed distribution and then predicted the anticipated no. of cases by extending this linear trend to a future period (120 day). With the help of the exponential statistical model, doubling time/rate based on prior 9 days, the predictions of up to 2.61 lakhs cases have been done by the end of June 2021. Conclusion: This study will be useful for the Government of India and Maharashtra state-specific to Pimpri- Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), Administrative Units, Frontline health workforce, researchers, and scientists. From this study it has been evident that during the pre-lockdown period, in the initial stages there seems to be rise in cases. While, during lockdown period it was observed that there was relatively decrease in the number of cases. After the government authorities imposed the unlock strategies the cases began to rise as compared to the lockdown period. Thus, it appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the state lockdown should be carried on for the next 3 months (April 2021 - June 2021).","Aphale, P.; Patil, A.

Contrary to common beliefs, settlement size and density are not positively associated with reproduction numbers. Further, the impacts of closing activity spaces vary with settlement types and are consistently lower in larger settlements in all sample countries, suggesting more complex pattern of virus transmission in large settlements.

Metaheuristics target the promoting of new applied algorithms to resolve NP-Hard problems in order to improve resolutions requiring enhanced search strategies. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a common combinatorial problem, applied on several benchmark networks, namely the transportation networks and the routing vehicle problem in order to establish new intelligent computing methods as well as, to prove studies on their performances and efficiencies. Collective intelligence has proven satisfactory resolutions wherewith metaheuristics, although their algorithms complexity. The aim of this work is to solve the Euclidean TSP, classified as a NP-hard problem by means of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) which is a Kohonen-type network. The resolution is also computed corresponding to a new bio-inspired evolutionary strategy so-called coronavirus optimization algorithm combined with SOM algorithm. The present approach is combining an unsupervised learning strategy within the new coronavirus optimization algorithm to replicate iteratively new infected individuals and to generate diversification on the search space. This new hybrid method presents a good approximative resolutions, proved by applying tests for TSPLIB instances wherein the exact optimum is defined corresponding to each TSP data.

Aim: The purpose of this review is to explore the prevalence of convergence insufficiency (CI) in younger populations and to map any associations between CI, near work and e-device usage. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Elsevier, PubMed, Medline and Ebscohost databases. The literature search used the following keywords in various combinations: ‘Convergence Insufficiency’, ‘Binocular vision status of primary school children’, ‘E-learning’, ‘M-learning’, ‘Computer vision syndrome’, ‘Digital eye syndrome’, ‘E-devices and children’. Results: The observed prevalence of CI ranges from 5.46% to 13.00% among non-clinical studies and from 3.50% to 18.00% among clinical studies. The prevalence among primary school children ranges from 6.80% to 31.40% whilst CI among high school children may be as prevalent as 32.60%, depending on the diagnostic criteria employed. There is mixed evidence showing the association between screen time and myopia. No studies were identified showing a direct association between CI and e-device use. Conclusion: Convergence insufficiency has proven to be a prevalent condition among both young children and young adult populations. There is a need for studies to investigate the prevalence of CI in younger populations who learn in a digital environment. This may highlight exposure to the modifiable factor of screen time in managing the condition in the context of a tech-infused lifestyle.","Pillay, R.; Munsamy, A.

168421,"Connected Learning, Collapsed Contexts",2021-05-05,"Studies related to COVID-19 increasingly use electronic health records (EHR) to obtain large-scale evidence. However, EHR-based research must be performed with care because it can involve new study design problems that are unfamiliar to much of the medical community. Haimovich et al. (2020) sought to inform COVID-19 practice by evaluating temporal artery thermometers (TATs). They retrospectively searched EHR for temperatures measured twice within 15 minutes, including once with a TAT. The TAT often disagreed with reference measurements, so Haimovich et al. concluded TATs perform poorly. Here, we extended Haimovich et al.'s study design to all other major thermometer types using the eICU Collaborative Research Database. We retrospectively identified 80,065 pairs of quickly retaken temperatures from 24,765 adult U.S. critical care patients treated in 2014-2015. We found that oral, tympanic, and axillary thermometers disagreed with reference measurements as much as TATs did. Moreover, all thermometer types showed unprecedentedly worse agreement than observed in research using other study designs. Every thermometer type broke {+/-}0.9{degrees}F ({+/-}0.5{degrees}C) limits of clinically acceptable agreement by >2-fold and no type satisfied basic standards for repeatability. A natural explanation for these findings is that clinicians often retook temperatures within minutes because of user or patient errors during measurement, such as probe misplacement or patient movement. This means that quickly retaken EHR measurements do not reflect device accuracy or precision in correct use and, contrary to Haimovich et al.'s conclusions, should not be used to evaluate thermometer performance or revise COVID-19 fever thresholds. Our study provides an illustrative example of unexpected study design problems that can undermine EHR-based research.","Harding, C.; Pompei, M.; Burmistrov, D.; Pompei, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20237958v1?rss=1,483

To compel states to pay for costs resulting from domestic consumption patterns that are externalized to other countries, this paper proposes a global contribution regime based on state consumption of animal products.

169481,Learning to Teach from Home,2021,"The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits lentiviral gene therapy vector entry into hematopoietic stem cells and can be overcome by Cyclosporine H (CsH), but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that mutating the evolutionarily conserved lysines of the IFITM3 intracellular loop abolishes its antiviral activity without affecting either its localization or its degradation by CsH through non-canonical lysosomal pathways. When confined to the plasma membrane, the lysine-competent IFITM3 lost restriction against VSV-G pseudotyped viral vectors but gained antiviral activity against vectors that fuse directly at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, altering the lysines did not alter IFITM3 homodimerization but impacted higher-order protein complex formation, suggesting loss of interaction with cellular co-factors. In agreement, IFITM3 expression was not sufficient to restrict viral vectors in myeloid K562 cells as opposed to promonocytic THP1 or primary HSC. We exclude the involvement of previously identified factors affecting IFITM3 biology and propose a novel model for IFITM3 restriction that depends on the presence of cellular co-factor(s) that may interact with IFITM3 through the intracellular loop lysine residues. Overall, our work provides significant insight into the mechanisms of action of IFITM3 and CsH that can be exploited for improved gene therapies and broadly acting antiviral strategies.","Unali, G.; Giordano, A.M.S; Cuccovillo, I.; Alezz M., Abou; Apolonia, L.; Merelli, I.; Malim, M.

Microplastic directly affects living organisms like mechanical injury, false satiation, declined growth, promoted immune response, and energy loss. Other debilitating effects include disrupted enzyme activity and produc-tion, decreased fecundity, oxidative stress, and mortality. Nano plastic could enter the circulatory system and caused negative effects on the cellular and molecular levels.

This reduction was most notable in the group that reduced PA Conclusions: The closure of universities and sport facilities unfavorably influenced the students’ previous PA level. Based on the result, there is a negative relationship between PA and psychological wellbeing also between PA and perceived health status. Universities may pay more attention to keep their students physically active even during a pandemic as it may be far from being over yet. © 2021 The Author(s)","Lukács, A.",Journal of King Saud University - Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101531,483
169806,Detailed modelling and simulation of different dc motor types for research and educational purposes,2021,"Importance Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, their role in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate disease is less clear. The inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide has shown early promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective To determine whether the inhaled steroid ciclesonide is efficacious in patients with high risk for disease progression and can reduce the incidence of long-term COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. Design This was a phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclesonide metered-dose inhaler (MDI) for the treatment of non-hospitalized participants with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Patients were screened from June 11, 2020 to November 3, 2020. Setting The study was conducted at 10 centers throughout the U.S. public and private, academic and non-academic sites were represented among the centers. Participants Participants were randomly assigned to ciclesonide MDI 160 g per actuation, two actuations twice a day (total daily dose 640 g) or placebo for 30 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary endpoint was time to alleviation of all COVID-19 related symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell) by Day 30. Secondary endpoints included subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons attributable to COVID-19. Results 413 participants were screened and 400 (96.9%) were enrolled and randomized (197 in the ciclesonide arm and 203 in the placebo arm). The median time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms was 19.0 days (95% CI: 14.0, 21.0) in the ciclesonide arm and 19.0 days (95% CI: 16.0, 23.0) in the placebo arm. There was no difference in resolution of all symptoms by Day 30 (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.97). Participants treated with ciclesonide had fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons attributable to COVID-19 (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 - 0.85). No subjects died during the study. Conclusions and Relevance Ciclesonide did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms. Future studies of inhaled steroids are needed to explore their efficacy in patients with high risk for disease progression and in reducing the incidence of long-term COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.","Clemency, B.

To investigate the impact of national vaccination programs and natural infection on viral transmission in those South American countries, we analyzed the coupling between population mobility and the viral effective reproduction number Rt. Our analyses reveal that population mobility was highly correlated with viral Rt from January to May 2021 in all countries analyzed; but a clear decoupling occurred since May-June 2021, when the rate of viral spread started to be lower than expected from the levels of social interactions. These findings support that populations from the South American Southern cone probably achieved the conditional herd immunity threshold to contain the spread of regional SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Fiori, M.; Bello, G.; Wschebor, N.; Lecumberry, F.; Ferragut, A.; Mordecki, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.16.21263701v1?rss=1,483

Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) was approved by EMA sooner than expected in August 2020 during a global pandemic. Method: RECOVER, a multi-centre, post-approval study examining the impact of ETI, and conducted in 8 clinical sites in Ireland and the UK over 2 years, examines important outcomes in children and adults prescribed ETI. The study will be conducted in 2 phases in line with ETI approval: 12+ and 6–11. In addition to routine data collected as part of normal care, key RECOVER endpoints include lung clearance index (LCI), spirometry-controlled CT, treatment adherence, GI symptoms, inflammation, liver disease markers, nasal inflammation and nitric oxide metabolism. Results: To date, 96 participants (56% female) out of a target of 137 in people with CFaged 12 and above, have been recruited (predominantly 12–18yrs to date). Recruitment and sample collection has been impacted by the effect of COVID-19 on CF care and CF centre attendance. Key challenges have included: Sputum collection (risks of induction and non-sputum producing participants) and coordination of study activities with limited clinic attendance. Despite this, key baseline data, prior to commencing treatment, has been successfully collected on the majority of participants to date. For subjects recruited to date, 56% have F508del/F508del and 44% F508del/minimum function mutations, mean age is 16.1 years, mean FEV1 83.6% (23–111%), mean LCI 12.2 (6.9–24.3). Recruitment and data collection is ongoing. Conclusion: Despite the impact of accelerated approval and COVID-19, we have been able to proceed with study initiation, recruitment and sample collection.

There is also a lot of research related to the factors that influence consumer decision to online shop groceries. However, to our knowledge, there is an extremely modest amount of research on how and why consumers decide to online shop organic food. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in consumer propensity to shop online, so this topic has gained in importance. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors that most influenced consumers' decision to online shop organic food during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The survey was carried out in Serbia by using a questionnaire developed specifically for this purpose, based on questions from 9 relevant surveys in the world. Factor analysis and standard multiple regressions were used to analyze the data obtained from the survey. Four factors have been identified that influenced the online shopping organic food during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The first and most important factor is the Attributes of organic food and deterrents for purchasing. The second important factor is the advantages of online shopping, Covid-19 Pandemic consequences, and organic food labeling. While the third factor (Website characteristics and satisfaction with online shopping) and the fourth factor (Safety of online shopping) are of minor importance. At the end of the paper recommendations for improvement marketing strategy for online selling organic food are given.","Ciric, M.; Ignjatijevic, S.; Ilic, D.; Puvaca, N.; Brkanlic, S.",Acta Agriculturae Serbica,https://doi.org/10.5937/aaser2151011c,483
170987,Supply chain finance: the role of credit rating and retailer effort on optimal contracts,2021,"Motivation Infectious diseases from novel viruses have become a major public health concern. Rapid identification of virus–host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights into infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments. Current computational prediction methods for novel viruses are based mainly on protein sequences. However, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., signs and symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts. Results We developed DeepViral, a deep learning based method that predicts protein–protein interactions (PPI) between humans and viruses. Motivated by the potential utility of infectious disease phenotypes, we first embedded human proteins and viruses in a shared space using their associated phenotypes and functions, supported by formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By jointly learning from protein sequences and phenotype features, DeepViral significantly improves over existing sequence-based methods for intra- and inter-species PPI prediction. Lastly, we propose a novel experimental setup to realistically evaluate prediction methods for novel viruses.

171196,Cybersecurity and Sustainable Development,2021-05-28,"Generation of transcriptional data has dramatically increased in the last decade, driving the development of analytical algorithms that enable interrogation of the biology underpinning the profiled samples. However, these resources require users to have expertise in data wrangling and analytics, reducing opportunities for biological discovery by “wet-lab” users with a limited programming skillset. Although commercial solutions exist, costs for software access can be prohibitive for academic research groups. To address these challenges, we have developed an open source and user-friendly data analysis platform for on-the-fly bioinformatic interrogation of transcriptional data derived from human or mouse tissue, called “MouSR”. This internet-accessible analytical tool, https://mousr.qub.ac.uk/, enables users to easily interrogate their data using an intuitive “point and click” interface, which includes a suite of molecular characterisation options including QC, differential gene expression, gene set enrichment and microenvironmental cell population analyses from RNA-Seq. Users are provided with adjustable options for analysis parameters to generate results that can be saved as publication-quality images. To highlight its ability to perform high quality data analysis, we utilise the MouSR tool to interrogate our recently published tumour dataset, derived from genetically engineered mouse models and matched organoids, where we rapidly reproduced the key transcriptional findings. The MouSR online tool provides a unique freely-available option for users to perform rapid transcriptomic analyses and comprehensive interrogation of the signalling underpinning transcriptional datasets, which alleviates a major bottleneck for biological discovery.","Ahmaderaghi, Baharak; Amirkhah, Raheleh; Jackson, James; Lannagan, Tamsin RM; Gilroy, Kathryn; Malla, Sudhir B; Redmond, Keara L; Maughan, Tim; Leedham, Simon; Campbell, Andrew S; Sansom, Owen J; Lawler, Mark; Dunne, Philip D",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456127,483

171239,E-Learning Acceptance During the Covid-19 Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study,2021,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant with negative health effects and a precursor of ozone and particulate matter responsible for photo-chemical smog and wintertime air pollution. To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69μg/m3, performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 × 5.5 km2) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown presents a case study that offers new insights into the importance of satellite data that can partially re-mediate statistical models' unsusceptibility to unusual events (like changes due to political intervention) with regard to model training.","Kim, Minsu Brunner Dominik Kuhlmann Gerrit",Remote Sensing of Environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112573,483
171533,A Study of the Impact of Crypto Assets on Portfolio Risk-Return Characteristics Before and After COVID-19 Outbreak (2014–2020),2021,"An integrated method comprising DEA and machine learning for risk management is proposed in this paper. Initially, in the process of risk assessment, the DEA cross-efficiency method is used to evaluate a set of risk factors obtained from the FMEA. This FMEA-DEA cross-efficiency method not only overcomes some drawbacks of FMEA, but also eliminates several limitations of DEA to offer a high discrimination capability of decision units. For risk treatment and monitoring processes, an ML mechanism is utilized to predict the degree of remaining risk depending on simulated data corresponding to the risk treatment scenario. Prediction using ML is more accurate since the predictive power of this model is better than that of DEA which potentially contains errors. The motivation for this study is that the combination of the DEA and ML approaches gives a flexible and realistic choice in risk management. Based on a case study of logistics business, the results ascertain that the short-term and urgent solutions in service cost and performance are necessary to sustainable logistics operations under the COVID-19 pandemic. The prediction findings show that the risk of skilled personnel is the next concern once the service cost and performance strategies have been prioritised. This approach allow decision-makers to assess the risk level for handling forthcoming events in unusual conditions. It also serves as a useful knowledge repository such that appropriate risk mitigation strategies can be planned and monitored. The outcome of our empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed approach contributes towards robustness in sustainable business operations.","Jomthanachai, S.; Wong, W. P.; Lim, C.

The lockdowns significantly reduced road traffic and meant that many people worked remotely. Therefore, the question arose as to how the reduced road traffic and stays of residents at home affected the degree of pollution and the structure of major air pollutants. To answer this question, the article presents an analysis of changes in typical air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) in the five largest Polish cities and one of the voivodships. The data from the Polish State Environmental Monitoring were used for the analysis. The analysis showed that the period of the first lockdown in Poland (April 2020), despite the reduced road traffic, resulted in a significant increase in PM10 emissions (9–91% during working days and an average of 30% on Saturdays and Sundays), a slight increase in PM2.5 emissions (on average from 2% to 11% for all analyzed locations), and a reduction in NO2 emissions (on average from 6% to 11% for all analyzed locations) compared to the period before the lockdown. However, the changes were not homogeneous—in Łódź and Warsaw, in most cases, an increase in all analyzed pollutants was observed, and the greatest decrease in pollution took place in Małopolska voivodship (including Kraków). Comparing the data from April 2020 to the data from April 2019, the overall difference in the PMs concentrations was small, although there are places where there has been a significant decrease (Wrocław, Poznań), and there were also places where the concentration increased (Warsaw, Łódź, Małopolska). In the case of nitrogen dioxide, pollution concentration decreased in most locations. The only exception was the background stations in Warsaw, where the increase was 27%.","Rogulski, Mariusz Badyda Artur",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12070806,483
171830,Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Digital Business Models—Contactless Payments,2021,"The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model structure and its variants are a fundamental modeling tool in epidemiology. As typically used, however, this tool may introduce an inconsistency by assuming that the rate of depletion of a compartment is proportional to the content of that compartment. As mentioned in the seminal SIR work of Kermack and McKendrick, this is an assumption of mathematical convenience rather than realism. As such, it leads to underprediction of the infectious compartment peaks by a factor of about two, a problem of particular importance when dealing with availability of resources during an epidemic. To remedy this problem, we develop the dSIR model structure, comprising a single delay differential equation and associated delay algebraic equations. We show that SIR and dSIR fully agree in assessing stability and long-term values of a population through an epidemic, but differ considerably in the exponential rates of ascent and descent as well as peak values during the epidemic. The novel Pade-SIR structure is also introduced as a approximation of dSIR by ordinary differential equations. We rigorously analyze the properties of these models and present a number of illustrative simulations, particularly in view of the recent coronavirus epidemic.

Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in France on initiation and renewal of B/TST. Methods: LRx contains all anonymized medication dispenses prescribed in outpatient care in a representative panel of French retails pharmacies, including data of near 40 million patients. The impact of B/TST initiation and renewal were studied using 2019 as reference and dispense deliveries data of pharmacies with regular flew in order to perform the comparison. B/TST considered were abatacept, anti-TNF, anti-IL6, anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23 or anti-IL23, JAK inhibitors (JAKi) and other classes such as aprelimast, aminosalicylates (AS), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and methotrexate (MTX). A treatment initiated was defined as a treatment not delivered in the past 12 months, and conversely for a treatment renewal. Results were presented as raw one and expressed in percentage of patients having at least one B/TST delivery in each therapeutic classes of interest in 2020 compared to 2019 used as reference year (period from week 12 to week 19 considered and corresponding to the lockdown period in France). Results: During the lockdown period, a decrease in initiation was observed for patients treated with: abatacept (405 in 2019 vs 227 in 2020: -44%, p<0.001), anti-TNF (1156 vs 1058, -31%, p<0.001), anti-IL17 (415 vs 206, -50%, p<0.001), anti-IL12-23 (395 vs 339, -12%, p=0.16), JAKi (289 vs 174, -39%, p=0.006), contrasting with an increase for Tociliumab (117 vs 445, +152%, p=0,01). We found a decrease of 7% (2171 vs 2015, p=0,35), 44% (405 vs 227, p<0.001), 30% (3430 vs 2390, p p<0.001) of AS, aprelimast and MTX initiation, respectively, and an increase of 173% (1708 vs 4671, p=0.11) of HCQ initiation. No decrease for the renewal of B/TST was observed Conclusion: During the epidemic's peak, initiation of AS, MTX, biotherapies (except for tocilizumab), and JAKi dramatically decreased without impacting their renewal. Two treatments were mainly initiated, tocilizumab probably due to a switch from intravenous to subcutaneous injection and HCQ in relation to its presumably effect on COVID-19.

A course created by the author called New Interior Urbanism, included a series of local and global urban interior research scenarios to study how streets, parks, plazas, and markets normally considered urban exteriors, should be understood as interiors. Along with on site and virtual fieldwork, a multi-disciplinary reading list informed student opinions;while, the addition of a COVID-19 pandemicinfluenced Sketch Problem/Charrette asked for contemplating interior-based, forwardthinking attitudes to create hypothetical adaptations for existing global public urban spaces, with social/physical distancing strategies.

Fibers are formed by immersing an array of pins in a highly viscous precursor solution of PEO and then rapidly removing the pins such that polymer entanglement occurs, forming multiple liquid bridges that rapidly dry as they extend. Tunable filtration is achieved by varying the number of PEO fiber elongation cycles. Placing the PEO textiles between two woven cotton cloths provides structural support and additional filtration capacity, achieving a maximum filtration efficiency of 95% with a corresponding initial pressure drop of 281 Pa. The entrapment of silver nanoparticles in the PEO fibers imparts virucidal properties to PEO-based textiles, as demonstrated by inactivation of a human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 and influenza A virus inoculum.

We sought to identify all potentially deleterious drug groups in COVID-19 and critically assess the underpinning strength of evidence pertaining to the harmful effects of these drugs. Methods and findings: We performed a rapid systematic review, searching Medline, Embase and two COVID-19 portfolios (WHO COVID-19 database and NIH iSearch COVID-19 portfolio) for papers and preprints related to primary studies investigating drugs identified as potentially deleterious. Primary outcomes were direct measures of susceptibility to infection, disease severity and mortality. Study quality was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for data synthesis with further subgroup analyses where possible for specific outcome, study design, statistical adjustment and drug groups when two were combined. Sensitivity analyses were performed by removing any studies at high risk of bias and by publication status. 49 observational studies (15 peer-reviewed papers and 34 preprints) reported primary outcomes for eight drug groups hypothesised to be deleterious. Meta-analysis showed that acute inpatient corticosteroid use was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.90), however this result appeared to have been biased by confounding via indication. One subgroup analysis indicated an association between immunosuppressant use and susceptibility to COVID-19 among case control and cross-sectional studies (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40) but this was not found with cohort studies (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.43). Studies which adjusted for multiple confounders showed that people taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-II-receptor blockers (ARBs) required a lower level of care (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98). Furthermore, studies which combined these two drug groups in their analysis demonstrated an association with a lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.85). Conclusions: We found minimal high quality or consistent evidence that any drug groups increase susceptibility, severity or mortality in COVID-19. Converse to initial hypotheses, we found some evidence that regular use of ACEIs and ARBs prior to infection may be effective in reducing the level of care required, such as requiring intensive care, in patients with COVID-19.","Holder, M.

A popular and cheap screening method is through chest X-Rays, however it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested fast and get quarantined in time. Thus, an automatic approach is needed which is motivated by the efforts of the research community. Specifically, we introduce a Deep Neural Network topology that can classify chest X-Ray images from patients in 3 classes;Covid-19, Viral Pneumonia and Normal.

173797,COVID-19 Kindness: Patterns of Neighborly Cooperation during a Global Pandemic,2021,"Using real-world data and past vaccination data, we conducted a large-scale experiment to quantify bias, precision and timeliness of different study designs to estimate historical background (expected) compared to post-vaccination (observed) rates of safety events for several vaccines. We used negative (not causally related) and positive control outcomes. The latter were synthetically generated true safety signals with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4. Observed vs. expected analysis using within-database historical background rates is a sensitive but unspecific method for the identification of potential vaccine safety signals. Despite good discrimination, most analyses showed a tendency to overestimate risks, with 20%-100% type 1 error, but low (0% to 20%) type 2 error in the large databases included in our study. Efforts to improve the comparability of background and post-vaccine rates, including age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rates around a visit, reduced type 1 error and improved precision but residual systematic error persisted. Additionally, empirical calibration dramatically reduced type 1 to nominal but came at the cost of increasing type 2 error. Our study found that within-database background rate comparison is a sensitive but unspecific method to identify vaccine safety signals. The method is positively biased, with low (<=20%) type 2 error, and 20% to 100% of negative control outcomes were incorrectly identified as safety signals due to type 1 error. Age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rate estimates around a healthcare visit are useful strategies to reduce false positives, with little impact on type 2 error. Sufficient sensitivity was reached for the identification of safety signals by month 1-2 for vaccines with quick uptake (e.g., seasonal influenza), but much later (up to month 9) for vaccines with slower uptake (e.g., varicella-zoster or papillomavirus). Finally, we reported that empirical calibration using negative control outcomes reduces type 1 error to nominal at the cost of increasing type 2 error.","Li, X.; Lai, L.

These questions have gathered renewed urgency during the ongoing COVID-19 and climate change crises posing a threat to the legitimacy not only of national governments but also of IOs. The paper aims to address these questions through the analysis of environmental commitments made in legal documents of three IOs (the EU, the EAEU, and the AIIB) and through the analysis of their respective social media between 2017 and 2021. Among other issues, we find significant differences in self-legitimation strategies of these three IOs as reflected by their social media and some evidence of mimicry across these IOs that should remain on the agenda for further studies.","Hall, S.

174351,COVID-19 Portal: Machine Learning Techniques Applied to the Analysis of Judicial Processes Related to the Pandemic,2021,"Air pollution is one of the most dangerous problems we face in the world today. It causes many illnesses and diseases that affect the immune system of humans and non-human animals and is also a means of propagating the novel COVID-19 or corona virus. Temperature, humidity, and the level of carbon dioxide characterize the air quality in an environment. In addition to abnormal temperatures and humidity causing direct problems to humans like headaches, heatstroke, hypothermia and hyperthermia, death and so on, it could also cause complicated problems like the acceleration of the growth and lifespan of harmful viruses like the corona virus especially in closed spaces like on a drilling rig or a processing facility. Multiple studies show that the influenza virus, coronavirus, and many others spread from host to host faster in areas with low humidity and high temperatures and upon infection, mortality rate is higher in low humidity regions. Inhalation of toxic levels of carbon dioxide has adverse effects ranging from drowsiness to coma and even death. Despite safety measures put in place in offshore facilities, there are still cases of corona virus outbreaks, hence this study aims to combat the facilitated spread of viruses and enhancement of good air quality via the design and construction of a device that measures the temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels, using a DHT11 and MQ135 sensor. The temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels of the living area, bedroom, kitchen, and balcony in a facility was captured by the device to determine the quality of air and characterized. The values were then compared with the expected values from a trusted website to determine the accuracy of the device. The device showed a 99.8% accuracy and passed quality check making it a recommendation to enhance air quality in facilities, houses, or offices. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","Ochie, S.; Ochie, K.","SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition 2021, NAIC 2021",https://doi.org/10.2118/208263-ms,483

Computer-aided screening on chest computed tomography (CT) images using deep learning, especially, lesion segmentation, is an effective complement for COVID-19 diagnosis. Although edge detection highly benefits lesion segmentation, an independent COVID-19 edge detection task in CT scans has been unprecedented and faces several difficulties, e.g., ambiguous boundaries, noises and diverse edge shapes. To this end, we propose the first COVID-19 lesion edge detection model: COVID Edge-Net, containing one edge detection backbone and two new modules: the multi-scale residual dual attention (MSRDA) module and the Canny operator module. MSRDA module helps capture richer contextual relationships for obtaining better deep learning features, which are fused with Canny features from Canny operator module to extract more accurate, refined, clearer and sharper edges. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance and can be a benchmark for COVID-19 edge detection.

174795,Weathering Climate Change in Archaeology: Conceptual Challenges and an East African Case Study,2021,"In many important contexts involving measurements of biological entities, there are distinct categories of information: some information is easy-to-obtain information (EI) and can be gathered on virtually every subject of interest, while other information is hard-to-obtain information (HI) and can only be gathered on some of the biological samples. For example, in the context of drug discovery, measurements like the chemical structure of a drug are EI, while measurements of the transcriptome of a cell population perturbed with the drug is HI. In the clinical context, basic health monitoring is EI because it is already being captured as part of other processes, while cellular measurements like flow cytometry or even ultimate patient outcome are HI. We propose building a model to make probabilistic predictions of HI from EI on the samples that have both kinds of measurements, which will allow us to generalize and predict the HI on a large set of samples from just the EI. To accomplish this, we present a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework we call the Feature Mapping GAN (FMGAN). By using the EI as conditions to map to the HI, we demonstrate that FMGAN can accurately predict the HI, with heterogeneity in cases of distributions of HI from EI. We show that FMGAN is flexible in that it can learn rich and complex mappings from EI to HI, and can take into account manifold structure in the EI space where available. We demonstrate this in a variety of contexts including generating RNA sequencing results on cell lines subjected to drug perturbations using drug chemical structure, and generating clinical outcomes from patient lab measurements. Most notably, we are able to generate synthetic flow cytometry data from clinical variables on a cohort of COVID-19 patients—effectively describing their immune response in great detail, and showcasing the power of generating expensive FACS data from ubiquitously available patient monitoring data. Bigger Picture Many experiments face a trade-off between gathering easy-to-collect information on many samples or hard-to-collect information on a smaller number of small due to costs in terms of both money and time. We demonstrate that a mapping between the easy-to-collect and hard-to-collect information can be trained as a conditional GAN from a subset of samples with both measured. With our conditional GAN model known as Feature-Mapping GAN (FMGAN), the results of expensive experiments can be predicted, saving on the costs of actually performing the experiment. This can have major impact in many settinsg. We study two example settings. First, in the field of pharmaceutical drug discovery early phase pharmaceutical experiments require casting a wide net to find a few potential leads to follow. In the long term, development pipelines can be re-designed to specifically utilize FMGAN in an optimal way to accelerate the process of drug discovery. FMGAN can also have a major impact in clinical setting, where routinely measured variables like blood pressure or heart rate can be used to predict important health outcomes and therefore deciding the best course of treatment.","Amodio, Matthew; Shung, Dennis; Burkhardt, Daniel; Wong, Patrick; Simonov, Michael; Yamamoto, Yu; van Dijk, David; Wilson, Francis Perry; Iwasaki, Akiko; Krishnaswamy, Smita",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.20.259598,483

However, after people wear masks, thousands of tons of medical waste caused by used disposable masks is being generated every day in the world, causing great pressure on the environment. Herein, polymer composites completely derived from waste are manufactured by simple melt blending of disposable mask fragments (mask polypropylene, short for mPP) and discarded loofah sponge (LS). LS was used as a reinforcing agent for the composites because of its unique micron channel structure. The crystalline structure and the mechanical enhancement effect of the composites were investigated. LS powders played a role in promoting the crystallization of mPP by expediting the crystalline nucleation, leading to an improvement in the amount of crystalline nuclei. After being incorporated within the mPP with high fluidity, the LS fiber changing from hollow to solid provides reinforcement for composite materials. With 12 wt % LS loading, the tensile strength of the composites was increased by 326%.

This standalone temperature-controlled device houses tubes designed for conducting reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays. Moreover, the device utilises tubes illuminated by LEDs, an in-built camera, and a small onboard computer with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms. This intelligent device significantly reduces the normal assay run time and removes the subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of colourimetric RT-LAMP results. To further improve this device’s usability, a mobile app has been integrated into the system to control the LAMP assay environment and to visually display the assay results by connecting the device to a smartphone via Bluetooth. This study was undertaken using ~5000 images produced from the ~200 LAMP amplification assays using the prototype device. Synthetic RNA and a small panel of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patient samples were assayed for this study. State-of-the-art image processing and artificial intelligence algorithms were applied to these images to analyse them and to select the most efficient algorithm.

The determinants of panic buying, upon being identified, can be applied to control the escalation of panic buying behaviour that is highly detrimental to societies. This research aims to synthesise the dual-system theory and stimulus-organism-response framework to investigate into the causes of panic buying. Structural equation modelling is employed to analyse data collected from 508 residents in Singapore. The results reveal that panic buying can be explained as a response to both environmental stimuli and reflective thinking. Specifically, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of a pandemic event as well as social influence and social norm can stimulate consumers' perceptions of scarcity and affective response, which in turn leads to the impulsive decision of panic buying;meanwhile, a rational reflection which is operationalised by perceived lack of control also influences panic buying. Furthermore, the perceived lack of control positively moderates the effect of affective response on panic buying. Theoretically, this research provides a unique explanation of panic buying. The findings also provide managerial implications on dealing with panic buying in response to disasters such as a health crisis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Li, X.; Zhou, Y.; Wong, Y.

175539,Sensitivity Analysis for Dry Deposition and PM2.5-bound Content of PCDD/Fs in the Ambient Air,2021,"Aerosol particles are one of the main routes of transmission of COVID-19. Mobile air purifiers are used to reduce the risk of infection indoors. We focus on an air purifier which generates a defined volumetric air flow through a highly efficient filter material. We investigate the transport of aerosol particles from an infected dummy equipped with an aerosol generator to receiving thermal dummies. For analysis, we use up to 12 optical particle counters to monitor the particle concentration with high spatial resolution. Based on the measurement data, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is set up and validated. The experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate how the risk of infection suggested by the particle exposure in an exemplary lecture hall can be reduced by a clever choice of orientation of the air purifier. The particle concentration at head height deviates by 13 % for variations of location and orientation. Finally, CFD simulation was used to monitor the particle fates. The steady simulation results fit quite well to the experimental findings and provide additional information about particle path and for assessing comfort level due to air flow. Practical implications Different installation locations and operating conditions of the air purifier are evaluated and the use of thermal dummies mimics the conditions of practical use cases. The measurement results show the integral particle mass over time in the “faces of the dummies”, representing the potentially inhaled particle load of persons present in the room. At an air change per hour of 5, the cumulated PM1 mass at head level was reduced by 75 %, independently of the location of the infected dummy, compared to the “natural decay” case showing that filtration is an effective means of reducing aerosol particle concentrations. It turns out that obstructing the outlet stream of the air purifier may be particularly advantageous.","Tobisch, Adrian; Springsklee, Lukas; Schäfer, Lisa-Franziska; Sussmann, Nico; Lehmann, Martin J.; Weis, Frederik; Zöllner, Raoul; Niessner, Jennifer",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453308,483

Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of immune responses. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for virally encoded structure mimics across thousands of catalogued viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (>70%) cannot be discerned through protein sequence. The results point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome. Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting viruses points to broad diversification of cellular pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies biological processes that may underly autoimmune disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Moreover, the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type, with ssRNA viruses circumventing limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large dsDNA counterparts. Finally, we identified over 140 cellular proteins that are mimicked by CoV, providing clues about cellular processes driving the pathogenesis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Lasso, Gorka; Honig, Barry; Shapira, Sagi D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.159467,483
175613,Challenges of Immediate Transition to e-Learning,2021,"Positive interpersonal relationships between college administration and faculty are necessary as they contribute to organizational climate measures, such as a sense of belonging and perceived organizational worth. Furthermore, such relationships may combat against faculty cynicism. Interpersonal experiences are particularly relevant in a post-coronavirus disease 2019 workplace in which interactions with colleagues are infrequent. Little is known about the effects of interpersonal experiences on part-time faculty specifically, as compared with full-time faculty. This study investigates teamwork experiences and interpersonal constraints as predictors of the attitudes and perceptions of full- and part-time faculty at a four-year public teaching college in the southwestern United States. After controlling for years working at the college, teamwork was a consistent predictor of higher sense of belonging, perceived organizational worth, and lower cynicism among full- and part-time faculty. Furthermore, the presence of negative coworker relationships was a significant predictor of lower sense of belonging and perceived organizational worth among full-time faculty. Inadequate help or lack of contact with co-workers was not a significant predictor of faculty attitudes and perceptions. The results of this study suggest the need for fostering teamwork and positive relationships among full- and part-time faculty in a meaningful and systemic manner within institutions of higher education. Additionally, this study provides support for institutionalizing a team-based approach to working among all faculty to foster perceived belonging and worth, while limiting cynicism.","Batiste, Heidi Benson Wendi L.; Garcia, Cynthia",Management in Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/08920206211027633,483

175845,The effects of COVID-19-related driving restrictions on air quality in an industrial city,2021,"Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders. Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community. Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The ""Five-Day Switch"" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that childrens interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.","Shelley, Courtney D; Chadwick, Philippa S; Manore, Carrie; Valle, Sara Y Del",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208710,483
176015,Promoting digital entrepreneurship to mitigate the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Education today faces new challenges in implementing learning during the Covid -19 pandemic. A compulsion to keep a distance causes learning to be carried out remotely using online methods. During the distance learning process students undergo more independent learning at home and cannot interact directly with teachers and friends. This condition is one of the causes of the lack of student motivation. Family members are major learning companion during a pandemic who could deal directly with students. So that we need a learning innovation that can empower homes and family members as a primary place for learning during home learning activities. This study aims to promote student motivation during the Covid -19 pandemic by applied a home-based STEM model. This model applied when students make learning media on subject of the earth structure and water layers. This study used a Classroom Action Research approach. Class actions are implemented through two cycles of action. Data collection techniques are obtained through observation, interviews, documentation study, and literature study. The research was carried out on class VII-A within 22 students. The results showed that there was an increase in student motivation after the implementation of home-based STEM learning. This is because students feel challenged and have the freedom to develop ideas in making learning media by making use of existing materials. Student interactions with family members during the learning process also play a role in making learning more enjoyable and promote student learning motivation.","Yunita, H.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1957/1/012038,483
176110,Mask Material Filtration Efficiency and Mask Fitting at the Crossroads: Implications during Pandemic Times,2021,"Background Attenuated immune responses to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported in solid organ transplant recipients. Most studies have assessed serological responses alone, and there is limited immunological data on vector-based vaccines in this population. This study compares the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 in kidney transplant patients, assessing both serological and cellular responses. Methods 920 patients were screened for spike protein antibodies (anti-S) following 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (n=490) or ChAdOx1 (n=430). 106 patients underwent assessment with T-cell ELISpot assays. 65 health care workers were used as a control group. Results Anti-S was detected in 569 (61.8%) patients. Seroconversion rates in infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2 were higher compared with ChAdOx1, at 269/410 (65.6%) and 156/358 (43.6%) respectively, p<0.0001. Anti-S concentrations were higher following BNT162b, 58(7.1-722) BAU/ml, compared with ChAdOx1, 7.1(7.1-39) BAU/ml, p<0.0001. Calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy, vaccination occurring >1st year post-transplant and receiving BNT162b2 was associated with seroconversion. Only 28/106 (26.4%) of patients had detectable T-cell responses. There was no difference in detection between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 7/40 (17.5%), versus ChAdOx1, 2/39 (5.1%), p=0.15. There was also no difference in patients with prior infection who received BNT162b2, 8/11 (72.7%), compared with ChAdOx1, 11/16 (68.8%), p=0.83. Conclusions. Enhanced humoral responses were seen with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1 in kidney transplant patients. T-cell responses to both vaccines were markedly attenuated. Clinical efficacy data is still required but immunogenicity data suggests weakened responses to both vaccines in transplant patients, with ChAdOx1 less immunogenic compared with BNT162b2.","Prendecki, M.; Thomson, T.; Clarke, C.

176303,Accessible Maker-Based Approaches to Educational Robotics in Online Learning,2021,"Background: Simple and reliable predictive scores for intensive care admissions and death based on clinical data in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are numerous but may be misleading. Predictive scores for admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death based on clinical and easily affordable laboratory data are still needed in secondary hospital and hospitals in developing countries that do not have high-performance laboratories. Methods: The goal of this study is to verify that a recently published predictive score conducted on a large scale in China (Liang score) can be used on patients coming from a Belgian population catchment area. Monocentric retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with known COVID-19 disease run from early March to end of May in Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies, a secondary care hospital in Belgium. The outcomes of the study are (I) admission in the ICU and (II) death. All patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test were included in the study. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at their admission and during their stay, as well as chest X-rays and CT-scans. Liang score was used as benchmark. Logistic regression models were used to develop predictive. Results: Liang score performs poorly, both in terms of admission to intensive care and in terms of death. In our cohort, it appears that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above 579 UI/L and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol/L may be considered as good predictive biological factors for ICU admission. With regards to death risk, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) above 22.1, tobacco abuse status and respiratory impairment appears to be relevant predictive factors. Conclusions: Firstly, a promising score from a large-scale study in China appears to perform poorly when applied to a European cohort, whether to predict for admission to ICU or death. Secondly, biological features that are quite significant for the admission to ICU such as LDH or venous lactate cannot predict death. Thirdly, simple and affordable variables such as LDH, LDH + sex, or LDH + sex + venous lactate have a very good sensitivity and an acceptable specificity for ICU admission. © Journal of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

176509,Choice Experiment Method for Sustainable Tourism in Theme Parks,2021,"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of PED, an enteric disease that causes high mortality rates in piglets. PEDV is an alphacoronavirus that has high genetic diversity. Insights into neutralizing B cell epitopes of all genetically diverse PEDV strains are of importance, particularly for designing a vaccine that can provide broad protection against PEDV. In this work, we aimed to explore the landscape of linear B cell epitopes on the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins of global PEDV strains. All amino acid sequences of the PEDV S and M proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database and grouped. Immunoinformatics-based methods were next developed and used to identify putative linear B cell epitopes from 14 and 5 consensus sequences generated from distinct groups of the S and M proteins, respectively. ELISA testing predicted peptides with PEDV-positive sera revealed 9 novel immunodominant epitopes on the S protein. Importantly, 7 of these novel immunodominant epitopes and other subdominant epitopes were demonstrated to be neutralizing epitopes by neutralization-inhibition assay. Additionally, our study shows the first time that M protein is also the target of neutralizing antibodies as 7 neutralizing epitopes in the M protein were identified. Conservancy analysis revealed that epitopes in the S1 subunit are more variable than those in the S2 subunit and M protein. In this study, we offer the immunoinformatics approach for linear B cell epitope identification and a more complete profile of linear B cell epitopes across the PEDV S and M proteins, which may contribute to the development of a greater PEDV vaccine as well as peptide-based immunoassays.","Polyiam, Kanokporn; Ruengjitchatchawalya, Marasri; Mekvichitsaeng, Phenjun; Kaeoket, Kampon; Hoonsuwan, Tawatchai; Joiphaeng, Pichai; Roshorm, Yaowaluck Maprang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.05.463270,483

We used DISCOVER, a global observational study of people with T2D initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy, to examine factors associated with HRQoL over 3 years of follow-up. Methods: HRQoL was assessed using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) v2 mental and physical component summary (MCS;PCS) scores (higher scores = better HRQoL) and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II;higher scores = greater fear). Factors associated with HRQoL over time were assessed using longitudinal multivariable regression models. Results: Of 14 691 DISCOVER patients from 37 countries, baseline and ≥ 1 follow-up MCS, PCS and HFS-II scores were available for 7880, 7854 and 5387 patients, respectively. Over time, SF-36 scores decreased (change per 6 months from baseline: MCS −0.04 [95% CI: −0.05 to −0.04];PCS −0.03 [95% CI: −0.03 to −0.02]), and HFS-II scores increased (change: 0.10 [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.12]). Many factors were associated with HRQoL (Table). Conclusions: HRQoL worsened during follow-up. Patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors were associated with HRQoL differences. Assessing factors associated with HRQoL over time may inform interventions to improve this important outcome. Disclosure: A. Nicolucci: Consultant;Self;AstraZeneca. H. Chen: None. A.

176856,Smart Sentimental Analysis of the Impact of Social Media on COVID-19,2021,"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic infections in Australia during 2020 were small in number in epidemiological terms and are well described. The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data of many infected patients has been largely curated in a number of publicly available databases, including the corresponding epidemiological data made available by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. We have critically analysed the available SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes and genomic sequences in the context of putative deficits in innate immune APOBEC and ADAR deaminase anti-viral responses. It is now known that immune impaired elderly co-morbid patients display clear deficits in Interferon (IFN) Type 1 (α/?) and III (?) stimulated innate immune gene cascades, of which APOBEC and ADAR induced expression are part. These deficiencies may help explain some of the clear genetic patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Victoria, Australia during the 2nd Wave (June-September, 2020). We tested the hypothesis that predicted lowered innate immune APOBEC and ADAR anti-viral deaminase responses in a significant proportion of elderly patients would be consistent with/reflected in a low level of observed mutagenesis in many isolated SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our findings are consistent with this expectation. The analysis also supports the conclusions of the Victorian government?s Department of Health that essentially one variant or haplotype infected Victorian aged care facilities where the great majority (79%) of all 820 SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths occurred. The implications of our data analysis for other localised epidemics and efficient coronavirus vaccine design and delivery are discussed.","Lindley, Robyn A.; Steele, Edward J.",Scandinavian Journal of Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.13100,483

177343,Role of Design Attributes to Determine the Intention to Use Online Learning via Cognitive Beliefs,2021,"Background: Expectant parents worldwide have experienced changes in the way they give birth as a result of COVID-19, including restrictions relating to access to birthing units and the presence of birthing partners during the birth, and changes to birth plans. This paper reports the experiences of women in England. Methods: Data were obtained from both closed- and open-ended responses collected as part of the national COVID in Context of Pregnancy, Infancy and Parenting (CoCoPIP) Study online survey (n = 477 families) between 15th July 2020 to 29th March 2021. Frequency data are presented alongside the results of a sentiment analysis; the open-ended data was analysed thematically. Results: Two-thirds of expectant women reported giving birth via spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) (66.1%) and a third via caesarean section (CS) (32.6%) or other (1.3%). Just under half (49.7%) of the CS were reported to have been elective/planned, with 47.7% being emergencies. A third (37.4%) of participants reported having no changes to their delivery, with a further 25% reporting COVID-related changes, and 37.4% reporting non-COVID related changes (e.g., medical intervention). Experiences of COVID-related changes included limited birthing options and reduced feelings of control; difficulties accessing pain-relief and assistance, and feelings of distress and anxiety. Under half of the respondents reported not knowing whether there could be someone present at the birth (44.8%), with 2.3% of respondents reporting no birthing partner being present due to COVID-related restrictions. Parental experiences of communication and advice provided by the hospital prior to delivery were mixed, with significant stress and anxiety being reported in relation to both the fluctuating guidance and lack of certainty regarding the presence of birthing partners at the birth. The sentiment analysis revealed that participant experiences of giving birth during the pandemic were predominately negative (46.9%) particularly in relation to the first national lockdown, with a smaller proportion of positive (33.2%) and neutral responses (19.9%). Conclusion: Parents reported an overall increase in birthing interventions (e.g., emergency CS), increased uncertainties related to the birth, and poor communication, leading to increased feelings of anxiety and high levels of negative emotions. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Aydin, E.; Glasgow, K. A.; Weiss, S. M.; Khan, Z.; Austin, T.; Johnson, M.

177371,Evaluating Online Learning Practice in the Interior Design Studio,2021,"Current COVID-19 vaccines and many clinical diagnostics are based on the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we have uncovered that, in addition to the prefusion structure determined by cryo-EM, this protein adopts an alternative conformation that interconverts slowly with the canonical prefusion structure. This new conformation—an open trimer— contains easily accessible RBDs. It exposes the conserved trimer interface buried in the prefusion conformation, thus exposing potential epitopes for pan-coronavirus antibody and ligand recognition. The population of this state and kinetics of interconversion are modulated by temperature, receptor binding, antibody binding, and sequence variants observed in the natural population. Knowledge of the structure and populations of this conformation will help improve existing diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

177397,Learning behaviour in an extraordinary situation,2021,"This research explored the long-term relation between tourism development and counter-urbanization in a remote island in Japan, as the longevity of in-migrants’ role in low-amenity tourism destinations has been questioned. Using data collected over 10 years at Yakushima Island, the study investigated the island’s population trend, in-migrants’ motivation for relocation, their con-tributions to tourism, and the lives on the island. The results showed that the trend of population growth differed among Yakushima’s 24 villages likely because of accessibility, proximity to tourism attractions, the weather, and housing availability. Yakushima’s natural environment was the key factor in in-migrants’ migration choice. Encounters and connections with people on the island were found to be another important factor. In-migrants introduced ecotours as an innovation in the 1990s, and thereafter, many in-migrants moved to Yakushima with high aspirations of becoming tour guides. Tourism stagnated starting in 2008, and some in-migrants began moving out of the island. Despite the overall downward trend of tourism, an increase in international tourists created a niche market before the COVID-19 pandemic, attracting foreign in-migrants as tourism entrepreneurs in recent years. Similar to the main driver for Japanese in-migrants’ relocation, nature was also the main motivation for international tourists’ relocation. © 2021 by the authors.

The results of the study showed that the main problems and challenges are the lack of effective implementation and giving class student's teachers, an opportunity to take a chance in teaching lessons through educational platforms, in addition to losing the opportunity to interact with students and train in effective classroom management. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

178759,Performance analysis for human crowd monitoring to control COVID-19 disease by drone surveillance,2021,"Involving research users in setting priorities for musculoskeletal research is essential to raise awareness of the unmet needs for MSK research, to ensure research outcomes are patient-centred and relevant, have a high likelihood of resulting in patient benefit, reduce research waste and increase research value and impact. In 2018, Versus Arthritis convened an MSK Disorders Research Advisory Group (RAG) which included people with arthritis, health care professionals and researchers in MSK, in order to identify and prioritise research areas with a long-term aim of improving quality and impact of MSK research. On further review, there were few previous prioritisation approaches in this area looking across discovery science to more clinical research, at important research questions which might be common to a range of disorders or approaches incorporating input at all stages of the process by a range of stakeholders including people with arthritis. The group identified that more work to define research priorities in these areas was justified and designed a research priority setting process for MSK disorders. This manuscript documents the methodology that was developed by the group for this process. Methods: Following a review, the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method for research prioritisation was selected as best aligning with the needs of this process. The group agreed on adaptations to the CHNRI approach, context, purpose and remit of the exercise and identified through consensus four priority research Domains: Mechanisms of disease; Diagnosis (including early diagnosis) and measuring the impact of these disorders; Living well with MSK disorders and Successful Translation. From all published CHNRI scoring criteria for generated research avenues or themes of research, the group identified six which were most relevant to this process. To ensure accessibility of the survey and scoring, these were refined to three: Equity (considered cross cutting, not scored but considered throughout the process), Importance (Will research in this area have potential to lead to important new knowledge) and Impact (Might research in this area make a difference). Importance and Impact were to be scored on a scale of 1-10 for each research avenue with equal weighting of these two criteria in the subsequent generation of a total score. Data collection: Following ethical approval, an electronic first survey asking for important research uncertainties in the four research domains and any other areas will be distributed to all stakeholders (people with arthritis, researchers in all stages of MSK disorders research, healthcare professionals, industry e.g. pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, research funders, healthcare providers, government policy makers and charities). The next step is to consolidate all the gathered research uncertainties from the first survey into finalised research domains and avenues. Uncertainties will be summarised using deductive thematic analysis and organised into possible themes which will then be considered and refined by each of four appointed subgroups within the RAG. Following group and lay review and refinement of the wording including tests of readability, the second survey including this full list of research avenues will be submitted for ethical approval. The second survey will be completed by the same range of stakeholders as the first survey, both those who previously completed and new respondents. Respondents will be invited to rate each research avenue using the two scoring criteria, with the avenues presented in a random sequence to avoid bias. Analysis Plan: All available data will be analysed, from all respondents completing the survey in full and all partial respondents. For each research avenue, a mean criterion score will be calculated for each of the two criteria from all available survey responses (considering the number of respondents in each case), and then the two mean criterion scores will be summed to create a total score. Response rates and missing data for scoring of avenues will be reported. The primary prioritisation output of this exercise will be to produce a single ranked list of these total scores of research avenues, from highest to lowest. The most highly ranked avenues will be highlighted, for example the top five to top ten overall and from each research domain, with the exact number and nature of this depending on the distribution of the data. Respondent characteristics will be summarised including self-identified stakeholder group, age group, gender and ethnic background, to describe the diversity and representation within the survey respondents as far as possible. Dissemination plan: Findings will be communicated in a number of formats, both written and spoken, to ensure accessibility to all stakeholders, and will also be used by the charity in internal strategy development. Dissemination will include the submission of a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal.","Paskins, Z.; Manning, F.; Farmer, C.; Le Maitre, C.; Clark, E.; Mason, D.; Wilkinson, C.; Andersson, D.; Barlow, T.; Bishop, F.; Brown, C.; Clark, A.; Dulake, D.; Gulati, M.; Jones, R.; Loughlin, J.; McCarron, M.; Millar, N.; Pandit, H.; Peat, G.; Richardson, S.; Salt, E.; Taylor-Wormald, J.; Troeberg, L.; Wilcox, R.; Wise, E.; Rudkin, S.; Watt, F.

178839,Identifying the Potential Roles of Virtual Reality and STEM in Maker Education,2021,"BackgroundBy regulating behaviour at household level, COVID-19 restrictions drastically altered relationships. Given strong links between intimate relationships and health, we investigated how the pandemic impacted relational and sexual aspects of steady relationships in Britain in the 4-months following first national lockdown (23/3/2020).Methods6,657 participants aged 18–59 years completed a web-panel survey questionnaire between 29/7–10/8/20. A quasi-representative population sample was achieved via quotas and weighting. We analysed sexual activity by age, gender and cohabitation status, and used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to explore self-perceived changes in sex and relationship quality among those in steady relationships (n=4,271).ResultsOf the full sample, 64.2% were in a steady relationship, mostly cohabiting (88.8%). Following lockdown, 48.9% of those in cohabitating relationships and 36.4% in non-cohabiting relationships reported sex (anal/vaginal/oral) at least weekly. Frequency of sexual activity varied by age, gender and cohabitation status. The majority reported no change in their sex life and relational quality compared with the months pre-lockdown. Among those perceiving change, quality of sex life was more commonly reported to deteriorate, whereas quality of relationship was more commonly reported to improve. Change – both positive and negative – was more commonly reported by younger people. Overall, 7% reported deterioration to a ‘lower quality’ relationship, with deterioration more commonly reported by those: in mid-life (35–44 vs. 45–59) (men, AOR:2.31;95%CI:1.45–3.66;women, AOR=1.63;95%CI:1.03–2.56);living in an urban area (among men) (AOR:2.61;95%CI:1.15–5.90);and not living with a partner (among women) (AOR:2.01;95%CI:1.28–3.16). Deterioration was associated with poor health and with decline in sexual aspects of the relationship.ConclusionCOVID-19 led to an early net gain in relationship quality but net loss in quality of sex lives in steady relationships in UK. A sizeable minority of steady relationships were adversely affected with implications for sexual – and wider – wellbeing.","Mitchell, K.; Shimonovich, M.; Perez, R.

Case Study: Southern Moravia,2020,"Dense surface glycosylation on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein acts as a shield from the adaptive immune system. However, the molecular complexity and flexibility of glycans make experimental studies a challenge. Here we have integrated high-throughput atomistic modeling of fully glycosylated HIV-1 Env with graph theory to capture immunologically important features of the shield topology. This is the first complete all-atom model of HIV-1 Env SOSIP glycan shield that includes both oligomannose and complex glycans, providing results which are physiologically more relevant than the previous models with uniform glycosylation. This integrated approach including quantitative comparison with cryo-electron microscopy data provides hitherto unexplored details of the native shield architecture and its difference from the high-mannose glycoform. We have also derived a measure to quantify the shielding effect over the antigenic protein surface that defines regions of relative vulnerability and resilience of the shield and can be harnessed for rational immunogen design.","Chakraborty, Srirupa; Berndsen, Zachary T.; Hengartner, Nicolas W.; Korber, Bette T.; Ward, Andrew B.; Gnanakaran, S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/846071,483
179484,"Mathematics Support - Essential at the Best of Times, Crucial at the Worst of Times",2021,"Emotion classification of COVID-19 Chinese microblogs helps analyze the public opinion triggered by COVID-19. Existing methods only consider the features of the microblog itself, without combining the semantics of emotion categories for modeling. Emotion classification of microblogs is a process of reading the content of microblogs and combining the semantics of emotion categories to understand whether it contains a certain emotion. Inspired by this, we propose an emotion classification model based on the emotion category description for COVID-19 Chinese microblogs. Firstly, we expand all emotion categories into formalized category descriptions. Secondly, based on the idea of question answering, we construct a question for each microblog in the form of ‘What is the emotion expressed in the text X?’ and regard all category descriptions as candidate answers. Finally, we construct a question-and-answer pair and use it as the input of the BERT model to complete emotion classification. By integrating rich contextual and category semantics, the model can better understand the emotion of microblogs. Experiments on the COVID-19 Chinese microblog dataset show that our approach outperforms many existing emotion classification methods, including the BERT baseline. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Guo, X.; Lai, H.; Xiang, Y.; Yu, Z.; Huang, Y.","20th China National Conference on Computational Linguistics, CCL 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84186-7_5,483
179552,Managing the supply chain during disruptions: Developing a framework for decision-making,2021,"In order to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for severe/critical COVID-19 in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) patients, we conducted a multicentre observational nationwide study of adult patients prospectively-followed in the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register - Reuma.pt - during the first 6 months of the pandemic. We further evaluated the development of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with RMDs. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19+) with those who did not develop the disease (COVID-19-) and patients with mild/moderate disease with those exhibiting severe/critical COVID-19. COVID-19+ patients were asked to collect a blood sample for IgG testing >= 3 months after infection and results were compared with age-, sex- and sampling date-matched controls. Overall, 179 cases of COVID-19 were registered in Reuma.pt in the period of interest (median age 55 (IQR 20); 76.5% females) in a total of 6404 registered appointments. We found that patients treated with TNF inhibitors had reduced odds of infection (OR=0.16, 95%CI 0.10-0.26, p<0.001), severe disease (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.84, p=0.010) and seroconversion rates (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02-0.91, p=0.040). Tocilizumab was also associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.05-0.41, p<0.001). Older age, major comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary and kidney disease) and rituximab were associated with an increased risk of infection and worse prognosis, in line with previous reports. Importantly, most patients with inflammatory RMDs (86.2%) were able to develop a robust antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was linked with disease severity.","Cruz-Machado, A. R.; C.

179893,Standardizing Components and Rotating Workers Using GT-Based Algorithm-A Case Study,2021,"Introduction: Antiandrogen are good candidates against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) due to the inhibition of its entry into host cells by the suppression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme that primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and is key for its cell entry. Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal anti-androgen (NSAA) with strong activities on androgen receptor (AR) antagonism, suppression of AR nuclear expression, and downregulation of the membrane-attached angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The efficacy of proxalutamide was previously demonstrated for early COVID-19 patients, and has now demonstrated efficacy to reduce deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patient in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). Whether radiological changes would follow the improvement in clinical outcomes with proxalutamide is not established. The present post-hoc analysis aims to evaluate whether proxalutamide improves lung injury observed through chest computed tomography (CT) scans, in addition to the clinical improvement, thus providing further objective evidence of the drug response in COVID-19. Methods: This is a post-hoc analysis of the radiological findings of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) with all enrolled patients from the three participating institutions of the city of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, that had at least two chest CT scans during hospitalization. The quantification of lung parenchyma involvement was performed by independent board-certified radiologists with expertise in analysis of COVID-19 images, that were blind to the assigned intervention in the RCT. A first chest CT scan was performed upon randomization and a second CT scan was performed approximately five days later, whenever patient transportation was feasible. Results: Of the 395 patients initially evaluated, 72 and 179 patients from the proxalutamide and placebo arms, respectively, were included (n=251). Baseline and clinical characteristics, interval between first and second chest CT scans, and percentage of lung parenchyma affected in the baseline chest CT scan were similar between groups. In the second chest CT scan, the percentage of lungs affected (Median - IQR) was 35.0% (25.0-57.5%) in the proxalutamide group versus 67.5% (50.0-80.0%) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The absolute and relative change between the second and first chest CT scans (Median - IQR) were -15.0 percent points (p.p.) (-30.0 - 0.0p.p.) and -25.0% (-50.0 - 0.0%) in the proxalutamide group, respectively, and +15.0p.p. (0.0 - +30.0p.p.) and +32.7% (0.0 - +80.0%) in the placebo group, respectively (p < 0.001 for both absolute and relative changes).

Little research, however, has analyzed domestic and institutional drivers of burden-sharing behavior;even less has disaggregated defense spending to measure burden sharing more precisely. This paper enhances understanding of the relationship between national political economies and burden shifting, operationalizing burden shifting as the extent to which a country limits or decreases defense expenditures, while at the same time favoring personnel over equipment modernization and readiness in the composition of defense budgets. Why do countries choose to allocate defense resources to personnel, rather than equipment modernization? I find that governments slightly decrease top-line defense spending in response to unemployment while shifting much more substantial amounts within defense budgets from equipment expenditures into personnel. This research highlights the intimate connection between Europe’s economic fortunes, transatlantic security, and burden sharing in North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union – of particular interest as a pandemic buffets the transatlantic economy. It also points policy analysts toward factors more amenable to political decisions than the structural variables generally associated with burden sharing, bridging significant gaps between defense economics, security studies, and comparative political economy.","Becker, Jordan",European Political Science Review : EPSR,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1755773921000102,483

Mobile phone metadata, typically in the form of Call Detail Records (CDRs), represents a powerful source of information on human movements at an unprecedented scale. In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of harnessing aggregated CDR-derived mobility to predict the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Colombia, when compared to other traditional data sources. To simulate the spread of ZIKV at sub-national level in Colombia, we employ a stochastic metapopulation epidemic model for vector-borne disease. Our model integrates detailed data on the key drivers of ZIKV spread, including the spatial heterogeneity of the mosquito abundance, and the exposure of the population to the virus due to environmental and socio-economic factors. Given the same modelling settings (i.e. initial conditions and epidemiological parameters), we perform in-silico simulations for each mobility network and assess their ability in reproducing the local outbreak as reported by the official surveillance data. We assess the performance of our epidemic modelling approach in capturing the ZIKV outbreak both nationally and sub-nationally. Our model estimates are strongly correlated with the surveillance data at the country level (Pearson's r=0.92 for the CDR-informed network). Moreover, we found strong performance of the model estimates generated by the CDR-informed mobility network in reproducing the local outbreak observed at the sub-national level. Compared to the CDR-informed network, the performance of the other mobility networks is either comparatively similar or substantially lower, with no added value in predicting the local epidemic. This suggests that mobile phone data capture a better picture of human mobility patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the value of aggregated mobility estimates from CDRs data that, with appropriate data protection and privacy safeguards, can be used for social impact applications and humanitarian action.","Perrotta, D.; Frias-Martinez, E.; Pastore y Piontti, A.; Zhang, Q.; Luengo-Oroz, M.; Paolotti, D.; Tizzoni, M.; Vespignani, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.09.21261630v1?rss=1,483

The Effect of Disinformation on COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy in the Netherlands,2021,"Background: Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Results: SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.","Gazit, S.; Shlezinger, R.; Perez, G.; Lotan, R.; Peretz, A.; Ben-Tov, A.; Cohen, D.; Muhsen, K.; Chodick, G.; Patalon, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.24.21262415v1?rss=1,483

T-cell activation, proliferation and differentiation involves metabolic reprogramming involving the interplay of genes, proteins and metabolites. Here, we aim to understand the metabolic pathways involved in the activation and functional differentiation of human CD4+ T-cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTregs). We combined genome-scale metabolic modeling, gene expression data, targeted and non-targeted lipidomics experiments, together with in vitro gene knockdown experiments and showed that human CD4+ T-cells undergo specific metabolic changes during activation and functional differentiation. In addition, we identified and confirmed the importance of ceramide and glycosphingolipid synthesis pathways in Th17 differentiation and effector functions. Finally, through in vitro gene knockdown experiments, we substantiated the requirement of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), a de novo sphingolipid pathway in the expression of proinflammatory cytokine (IL17A and IL17F) by Th17 cells. Our findings may provide a comprehensive resource for identifying CD4+ T-cell-specific targets for their selective manipulation under disease conditions, particularly, diseases characterized by an imbalance of Treg / Th17 cells. Our data also suggest a role for elevated levels of ceramides in conditions comorbid with these diseases, e.g., obesity and insulin resistance.","Sen, Partho; Andrabi, Syed Bilal Ahmad; Buchacher, Tanja; Khan, Mohd Moin; Ullah, Ubaid; Lindeman, Tuomas; Amaral, Marina Alves; Hinkkanen, Victoria; Kemppainen, Esko; Dickens, Alex M; Rasool, Omid; Hyötyläinen, Tuulia; Lahesmaa, Riitta; Orešič, Matej",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428853,483
181482,Short term measurements of indoor air quality when using the home office in Norway,2021,"With the rise of the coronavirus crisis, ""social distancing,"" has emerged as a new buzzword. Politicians, journalists, commentators, news readers, senior executives, and experts use this term blindly. However, scrutinizing the word reveals a terminological mismatch between ""physical distancing"" and ""social distancing."" While revisiting the history of physical distancing and social distancing, this article attempts to show how the term ""social distancing"" moved through time and winded up floating in the atmosphere. This study is based on Critical race theory, which has as its aim to uncover the ideologies that have been constructed to perpetuate the oppression of some social categories on the fallacious pretext of race superiority and purity. After going down to the ancient roots of physical distancing practices, this work will recall social distancing behaviors during the slave trade era before delving into the current confusion between both terms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This work stresses the importance of social scientists to assess some official terminologies before their popularization. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Zhang, D.; Nyelade, R.

Rapid, accurate, and cost-effective COVID-19 screening tests working at a population level are in imperative demand globally. Methods Based on the eye symptoms of COVID-19, we developed and tested a COVID-19 rapid prescreening model using the eye-region images captured in China and Spain with cellphone cameras. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based model was trained on these eye images to complete binary classification task of identifying the COVID-19 cases. The performance was measured using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1. The application programming interface was open access. Findings The multicenter study included 2436 pictures corresponding to 657 subjects (155 COVID-19 infection, 23.6%) in development dataset (train and validation) and 2138 pictures corresponding to 478 subjects (64 COVID-19 infections, 13.4%) in test dataset. The image-level performance of COVID-19 prescreening model in the China-Spain multicenter study achieved an AUC of 0.913 (95% CI, 0.898-0.927), with a sensitivity of 0.695 (95% CI, 0.643-0.748), a specificity of 0.904 (95% CI, 0.891 -0.919), an accuracy of 0.875(0.861-0.889), and a F1 of 0.611(0.568-0.655). Interpretation The CNN-based model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening has reliable specificity and sensitivity.

181782,Aerosol filtration testing of fabrics for development of reusable face masks,2021,"Background: CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic functions (CD4+ CTL) have gained attention in recent years. Accumulating evidence supports their importance in defense against human viral infections such as CMV1, EBV2, dengue3, HIV4, 5 and SARSCoV-26. Moreover, expansion of so called CD28null cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have been reported in the blood of patients with rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)7, myositis8 and vasculitis9 as well as in cardiovascular diseases10. Objectives: Here, we aimed to investigate the presence and clonal expansion of CD4+ CTL in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients using single cell technologies. Methods: We assessed the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules and transcription factors in CD4+ T cells in synovial fluid (n=21) and paired peripheral blood (n=16) from ACPA-and APCA+ RA patients by multi-parameter flow cytometry. We performed single cell sequencing, in combination with 5 TCRab sequencing, on purified CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of ACPA+ RA patients (n=7). Results: Flow cytometry experiments show that Granzyme-B+ Perforin-1+ CD4+ CTL are significantly increased in the SF of ACPA+ RA patients as compared to ACPA-RA patients (p=0.0072). The presence of CD4+ CTL could be confirmed by single cell sequencing in SF of each ACPA+ RA patient tested (n=7). Moreover, we found that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor GPR56 is selectively expressed on the recently described peripheral helper (TPH) T-cell subset11 and associates with the expression of tissue resident memory markers LAG-3, CXCR6 and CD69. In blood, we confirmed a previous report12 showing that GPR56 delineates cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Finally, expanded TCR clones expressing cytotoxic effector molecules were identified in synovial fluid of ACPA+ RA patients and, for some patients, in their corresponding peripheral blood. Conclusion: We identified GPR56 as a marker of TPH cells in SF of ACPA+ RA patients that associates with tissue residency receptors. The combination of single cell sequencing and multi-parameter flow cytometry highlights the importance of CD4+ CTL in ACPA+ RA and suggests a potential therapeutic target (Figure 1).","Argyriou, A.; Wadsworth, M.

To gain mechanistic insight and ferret out the root of this immune dysregulation, we modeled by in vitro co-culture the interactions between infected epithelial cells and immunocytes. A strong response was induced in monocytes and B cells, with a SARS-CoV2-specific inflammatory gene cluster distinct from that seen in influenza-A or Ebola virus-infected co-cultures, and which reproduced deviations reported in blood or lung myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients. A substantial fraction of the effect could be reproduced after individual transfection of several SARS-CoV2 proteins (Spike and some non-structural proteins), mediated by soluble factors, but not via transcriptional induction. This response was greatly muted in monocytes from healthy children, perhaps a clue to the age-dependency of COVID-19. These results suggest that the inflammatory malfunction in COVID-19 is rooted in the earliest perturbations that SARS-CoV2 induces in epithelia.","Leon, Juliette; Michelson, Daniel A.; Olejnik, Judith; Chowdhary, Kaitavjeet; Oh, Hyung Suk; Hume, Adam J.; Galván-Peña, Silvia; Zhu, Yangyang; Chen, Felicia; Vijaykumar, Brinda; Yang, Liang; Crestani, Elena; Yonker, Lael M.; Knipe, David M.; Mühlberger, Elke; Benoist, Christophe",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462202,483

Interestingly, panic buying research has not been given much attention. The purpose of this paper is threefold. Firstly, it examines the influences of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) elements (subjective norm, attitude and perceived behavior control (PBC)) on panic buying. Secondly, it investigates online news and the perceived likelihood of being affected (PLA) as antecedents to the TPB constructs. Finally, to examine online news verification as a moderator on the relationship between the TPB constructs and panic buying. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 371 respondents and analyzed using the partial least squares method structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). PLS predict was applied to determine the predictive power of the model further. Findings This study found that subjective norms and attitude influence panic buying. The results further revealed that online news has a direct influence on the PLA and attitude. However, PBC has no such effect on panic buying. Surprisingly, online news verification also has no moderating effects on the relationships between the TPB elements and panic buying. Originality/value This research helps to understand consumer panic buying behavior, especially during shock events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first that extends the TPB incorporating both online news and PLA as antecedents to panic buying in the same model. Furthermore, the study serves as an initial attempt to investigate online news verification as a moderator between the link of three constructs of TPB and panic buying, contributing to existing literature. Lastly, it advances the body of knowledge on consumer behavior and contributes methodologically by introducing the PLS approach.","Tan, K. L.; Sia, J. K. M.; Tang, D. K.

182500,Guest editorial,2021,"BackgroundIn 2012, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was approved as an HIV-prevention intervention. PrEP is a highly effective strategy for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition, particularly in populations at high risk of contracting the virus. In an integrative review of the literature, we explored barriers and facilitators to accessing PrEP and outlined potential interventions to mitigate access. In the integrative review, 48 studies were included. We also extracted data that provided information on potential interventions and recommendations that stakeholders and decision-makers can utilize to advance practice guidelines and health policies that will improve PrEP access among high-risk populations. In this paper, we reflect on the review findings and contemplate the silences that became visible when looking across all studies.MethodsWe engaged in the process of reflexivity as we looked across the included studies. Throughout this process, we made notes, engaged in conversations, and consulted with others who work in the field. Results/ConclusionWe noted three significant areas of silence. One was a lack of intersectional analysis, which considers multiple minority-stress factors acting simultaneously. With little understanding of the complexities impacting understudied populations’ intersectionalities, stakeholders and decision-makers lack not only formative contextual research, but also any effective implementable measure to increase PrEP uptake. The studies analyzed showed a lack of community-participatory research practice. At large, the studies found did not explore, nor perceive, communities at HIV risk as agents of their own health. Neither did they represent these communities as capable stakeholders and decision-makers in matters regarding sexual behavior and harm reduction. Peer-support involvement in public health measures to improve PrEP access has been scarce. Despite social connections and relationships representing efficient methods for PrEP awareness, education, and stigma reduction, peer involvement remains mostly unexplored in the literature in relation to PrEP access.","Trombetta, T.; Tovillo, J.

182587,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of a Synchronous Online CS1",2021,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on most countries’ social and economic perspectives worldwide. Unemployment has become a vital challenge for policymakers as a result of COVID-19′s negative impact. Because of the nonstationary and nonlinear nature of the dataset, researchers applied various time series models to forecast the unemployment rate. This study aims to ensure a better forecasting approach for predicting the unemployment rates with an uncertainty of insufficient knowledge and tiny data throughout Vietnam. The study proposes the Grey theory system-based GM (1,1), the Grey Verhulst Model (GVM), and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model that can more precisely predict unemployment rates. The model’s applications are shown using the Vietnamese unemployment rate at six different rural and urban areas with data sets from 2014–2019. The results indicate that the lower Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) values obtained with the GM (1,1) model at all regions for rural and urban areas (excluding Highlands Region in urban area) are extremely encouraging in comparison to other traditional methods. The accurate level of the ARIMA and GVM models follows the GM (1,1) model. The findings of this study show that the effects of the modeling assist policymakers in shaping future labor and economic policies. Furthermore, this study can contribute to the unemployment literature, providing future research directions in the unemployment problems.","Nguyen, Phi-Hung Tsai Jung-Fa Kayral Ihsan Erdem Lin Ming-Hua",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147879,483

In bacteriophage lambda, this frameshift controls production of two proteins with overlapping sequences, gpG and gpGT, that are required for tail assembly. We developed bioinformatic approaches to identify analogous -1 frameshifting sites and experimentally confirmed our predictions for five additional phages. Clear evidence was also found for an unusual but analogous -2 frameshift in phage Mu. Frameshifting sites could be identified for most phages with contractile or noncontractile tails whose length is controlled by a tape measure protein. Phages from a broad spectrum of hosts spanning Eubacteria and Archaea appear to conserve this frameshift as a fundamental component of their tail assembly mechanisms, supporting the idea that their tail genes share a common, distant ancestry.","Xu, Jun; Hendrix, Roger W; Duda, Robert L",Molecular cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15469818/,483

METHODS We used a stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics and plausible control measures. RESULTS When no control interventions were in place, we estimated that an outbreak of COVID-19 in New Zealand would occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1,000 population per week, crews of 20 with a voyage length of 10 days and 1 day of shore leave per crew member both in New Zealand and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example, the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combination of PCR testing on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing and mask use during shore leave increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years, or a 49% probability within a year). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks, even with crews of only 5 members. CONCLUSION This modelling work suggests that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. But the risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.","Wilson, Nick; Blakely, Tony; Baker, Michael G; Eichner, Martin",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582705/,483

The impact of multiple, concurrent viral reactivations/infections remains to be delineated. METHODS The clinical correlates of single or multiple viremic infections following HSCT and especially the occurrence of respiratory viruses in the bloodstream were investigated. We retrospectively searched for 23 viruses in a total of 184 sera from 53 paediatric patients. The time-points of interest were pre-HSCT, one, two and three months post-HSCT, and at discharge or death. The viruses were analyzed by quantitative or qualitative PCR. RESULTS Of the 53 patients, 13 (25%) had viraemias by multiple viruses and 27 (51%) by a single virus. Thirteen patients (25%) had no viruses detected by PCR during the study period. In the children with viremic co-infections, polyomaviruses predominated over herpes viruses. Nearly half the patients, 24/53 (45%) had a polyomavirus in their serum at one or more time-points. At 12/15 time-points and in 11/13 patients with co-infections polyomaviruses were involved, compared with 6/15 time-points and 6/13 patients for cytomegalovirus. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and steroid use were significant risk factors for the viraemias caused by more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS Viral co-detection is a common finding in children undergoing HSCT. With large-scale viral screening also viruses other than CMV could be found as potential pathogens. In this study, BKPyV predominated over CMV as a contributor in viraemias caused by multiple viruses in children receiving HSCT.","Koskenvuo, Minna; Rahiala, Jaana; Sadeghi, Mohammadreza; Waris, Matti; Vuorinen, Tytti; Lappalainen, Maija; Norja, Päivi; Toppinen, Mari; Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla; Allander, Tobias; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria; Hedman, Klaus; Ruuskanen, Olli; Vettenranta, Kim",Infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27465580/,483
201211,Supply chain contagion and the role of industrial policy,2020,"During infection, adenovirus (Ad) capsids undergo microtubule-dependent retrograde transport as part of a program of vectorial transport of the viral genome to the nucleus. The microtubule-associated molecular motor, cytoplasmic dynein, has been implicated in the retrograde movement of Ad. We hypothesized that cytoplasmic dynein constituted the primary mode of association of Ad with microtubules. To evaluate this hypothesis, an Ad-microtubule binding assay was established in which microtubules were polymerized with taxol, combined with Ad in the presence or absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and centrifuged through a glycerol cushion. The addition of purified bovine brain MAPs increased the fraction of Ad in the microtubule pellet from 17.3% +/- 3.5% to 80.7% +/- 3.8% (P < 0.01). In the absence of tubulin polymerization or in the presence of high salt, no Ad was found in the pellet. Ad binding to microtubules was not enhanced by bovine brain MAPs enriched for tau protein or by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Enhanced Ad-microtubule binding was also observed by using a fraction of MAPs purified from lung A549 epithelial cell lysate which contained cytoplasmic dynein. Ad-microtubule interaction was sensitive to the addition of ATP, a hallmark of cytoplasmic dynein-dependent microtubule interactions. Immunodepletion of cytoplasmic dynein from the A549 cell lysate abolished the MAP-enhanced Ad-microtubule binding. The interaction of Ad with both dynein and dynactin complexes was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Partially uncoated capsids isolated from cells 40 min after infection also exhibited microtubule binding. In summary, the primary mode of Ad attachment to microtubules occurs though cytoplasmic dynein-mediated binding.","Kelkar, Samir A; Pfister, K Kevin; Crystal, Ronald G; Leopold, Philip L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15331745/,483
201268,Survival of expiratory aerosols in a room: Study using a bi-compartment and bi-component indoor air model,2021,"OBJECTIVE There is a paucity of information regarding the usefulness of non-traditional data streams for real-time syndromic surveillance systems. The objective of this paper is to examine the temporal relation between Ontario's emergency department (ED) visits and telephone health line (Telehealth) call volume for respiratory illnesses to test the feasibility of using Ontario's Telehealth system for real-time surveillance. METHODS Retrospective time-series data from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and the Telehealth Ontario program from June 1, 2004, to March 31, 2006, were analyzed. The added value of Telehealth Ontario data was determined by comparing it temporally with NACRS data, which uses the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10-Canadian Enhancement coding system for discharge diagnoses. RESULTS Telehealth Ontario had 216,105 calls for respiratory complaints, while 819,832 ICD-coded complaints from NACRS were identified with a comparable diagnosis of respiratory illness. Telehealth Ontario call volume was heavily weighted for the 0-4 years age group (49%), while the NACRS visits were mainly from those 18-64 years old (44%). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.97, with the time-series analysis also resulting in significant correlations at lags (semi-monthly) 0 and 1, indicating that increases in Telehealth Ontario call volume correlate with increases in NACRS discharge diagnosis data for respiratory illnesses. CONCLUSION Telehealth Ontario call volume fluctuation reflects directly on ED respiratory visit data on a provincial basis. These call complaints are a timely, useful and representative data stream that shows promise for integration into a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","van Dijk, Adam; McGuinness, Don; Rolland, Elizabeth; Moore, Kieran M",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226314/,483
201399,ROBOTS COME to RESCUE: How to reduce perceived risk of infectious disease in Covid19-stricken consumers?,2020,"In a survey which lasted one year and included data of 73 dairy cows with their calves, colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) of 22 primiparous cows and serum IgG of their calves were lower than the corresponding IgG levels of 51 multiparous cows and their calves. Serum IgG concentration was not correlated with diarrhoea incidence. Although there were no seasonal differences in the IgG concentration of colostrum and calf serum, neonatal diarrhoea incidence was higher in calves which were born in winter than in calves which were born in summer (P < 0.01). Thus the high diarrhoea incidence in winter was not a consequence of an insufficient IgG transfer to the calves. The 60 calves of the second study were fed colostrum on the first day of life. From the second to the tenth day 28 experimental calves received milk and 0.5 l of surplus colostrum of the first and second milking twice a day, whereas 32 control calves received milk only twice a day. Two of the 28 experimental and 11 of the 32 control calves suffered from diarrhoea during the first ten days of life (P < 0.05). These results show that the ingestion of surplus colostrum in addition to milk after the first day of life protects the new-born calf against infectious diarrhoea.","Gutzwiller, A",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11887613/,483
203076,Presence in Teaching-Learning: Insights From the Movie Patch Adams and Others,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the background, principles and implementation of the Stroke Action Plan for Europe 2018--2030 (SAP-E) in the perspective of the current COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY: Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

205045,Effect of Air Quality Alerts on Intended Behavior Change,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's physical and mental health. Quarantine and other lockdown measures have altered people's daily lives; levels of anxiety, depression, substance use, self-harm and suicide ideation have increased. This commentary assesses how international governments, agencies and organisations are responding to the challenge of the mental health impact of COVID-19 with the aim of informing the ongoing policy and service responses needed in the immediate and longer term. It identifies some of the key themes emerging from the literature, recognises at-risk populations and highlights opportunities for innovation within mental health services, focusing on the published academic literature, international health ministry websites and other relevant international organisations beyond the United Kingdom and Ireland. COVID-19 has challenged, and may have permanently changed, mental health services. It has highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing pressures and inequities. Many decision-makers consider this an opportunity to transform mental health care, and tackling the social determinants of mental health and engaging in prevention will be a necessary part of such transformation. Better data collection, modelling and sharing will enhance policy and service development. The crisis provides opportunities to build on positive innovations: the adaptability and flexibility of community-based care; drawing on lived experience in the design, development and monitoring of services; interagency collaboration; accelerating digital healthcare; and connecting physical and mental health.","McCartan, Claire; Adell, Tomas; Cameron, Julie; Davidson, Gavin; Knifton, Lee; McDaid, Shari; Mulholland, Ciaran",Health Res Policy Syst,,483

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki's disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH. Of 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C (laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and 4 with suspected MIS-C (met clinical and epidemiologic criteria), 53 (54%) were male; 31 of 78 (40%) were black, and 31 of 85 (36%) were Hispanic. A total of 31 patients (31%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 42 (42%) were 6 to 12 years of age, and 26 (26%) were 13 to 20 years of age. All presented with subjective fever or chills; 97% had tachycardia, 80% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 60% had rash, 56% had conjunctival injection, and 27% had mucosal changes. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and troponin were found in 100%, 91%, and 71% of the patients, respectively; 62% received vasopressor support, 53% had evidence of myocarditis, 80% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 2 died. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in New York State coincided with widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission; this hyperinflammatory syndrome with dermatologic, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal manifestations was associated with cardiac dysfunction.","Dufort, Elizabeth M; Koumans, Emilia H; Chow, Eric J; Rosenthal, Elizabeth M; Muse, Alison; Rowlands, Jemma; Barranco, Meredith A; Maxted, Angela M; Rosenberg, Eli S; Easton, Delia; Udo, Tomoko; Kumar, Jessica; Pulver, Wendy; Smith, Lou; Hutton, Brad; Blog, Debra; Zucker, Howard",N Engl J Med,,483

The authors, members of the APsaA COVID-19 Advisory Team and longtime researchers in screen relations-based psychoanalytic care, recount lessons learned from their pandemic experience. As both disaster victim and mental health responder, they start with the cultural context for pandemic-specific mental health practice. Going deeper into the technological context for psychoanalytic care, they describe clinically-relevant differences between screen relations and physical co-presence, highlighting risk and trust, richness, and relational embodiment as key influences on clinical process and outcome. Common adaptions and responses that helped make pandemic-specific screen relations-based treatment work emerged from their own work and discussions and consultations with numerous colleagues. Curiosity, humility, clinical creativity, and self-care are highlighted. They close with hopes for a post-pandemic world in which we can mourn loss, reestablish trust, and renew and deepen our appreciation for relationships and intimacies only possible when we are bodies together in the same place at the same time.

Many of the repurposed drugs were chosen for their benefits to the pulmonary system, as well as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, these drugs have mixed effects on the heart, liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Drug treatments are critical in the fight against COVID-19, along with vaccines and public health protocols. Drug treatments are particularly needed as variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus emerge with some mutations that could diminish the efficacy of the vaccines.

212662,Educational disruption & rising faculty expectations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel criteria for the remission of Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) based on an opinion survey of Japanese nephrologists and literature review were proposed in 2013. This single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted to validate this criteria. METHODS: Present study included the IgAN patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in the Juntendo University Hospital. Remission of hematuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick test results of ( -) to ( ±) or a red blood cell count < 5 in urinary sediment per high-power field during at least 6 months. Remission of proteinuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick results of ( -) to ( ±) during at least 6 months. We categorized four groups according to the remission status which was assessed 2 years after the renal biopsy. The primary outcome was a 50% increase in the serum creatinine over the baseline. We evaluated the slope of eGFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m2/year) and a decrease in the eGFR of 30% from baseline eGFR as the secondary outcome, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients (male: 47.3%, median age: 30 years) were included and were followed for a median of 86.5 months. During the period, forty-one patients achieved neither remission of proteinuria nor hematuria (NR). Twelve patients met the primary study outcome. A survival analysis revealed that the NR had the worst prognosis and the steepest slope of eGFR decline. CONCLUSION: Although further validation in a large cohort is necessary, these novel remission criteria for IgAN patients appear to predict the renal prognosis.","Matsuzaki, Keiichi; Suzuki, Hitoshi; Kawamura, Tetsuya; Tomino, Yasuhiko; Suzuki, Yusuke",Clin. exp. nephrol,,483

Our objective was to evaluate adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviours among adults without CDs compared with those with CDs and identify determinants of non-adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviours. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the nationally representative COVID-19 Impact Survey (n=10 760) conducted in the USA. PRIMARY MEASURES: Adults with CDs were categorised based on a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease/heart attack/stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis or emphysema, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, compromised immune system, or cancer (54%). RESULTS: Compared with adults without CDs, adults with CDs were more likely to adhere to preventive behaviours including wearing a face mask (&#967;2-p<0.001), social distancing (&#967;2-p<0.001), washing or sanitising hands (&#967;2-p<0.001), and avoiding some or all restaurants (&#967;2-p=0.002) and public or crowded places (&#967;2-p=0.001).

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course. DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline. All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full-text level. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the association between a population-level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes &#8805;1 month following the disaster. There were no restrictions on age, year of publication, country or population. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (eg, type of disaster, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes and measures of effect. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood. Studies included exposure to natural (n=35; 60%) and human-made (n=23; 40%) disasters, with only three (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics. Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes and obesity, but not all. Few studies evaluated the biological mechanisms or high-risk subgroups that may be at a greater risk of negative health outcomes following disasters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the burden of disasters extend beyond the known direct harm, and attention is needed on the detrimental indirect long-term effects on cardiometabolic health. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, these findings may inform public health prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of future cardiometabolic risk.

217474,An integrated multi-criteria decision making approach with linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets for E-learning website evaluation and selection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Early international observations report decreased number of acute ischemic stroke admissions and prolonged onset-to-treatment times during COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: Our goal was to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on Hungarian acute ischemic stroke care. METHOD: We compared demographical and clinical characteristics, rate of intravenous and endovascular therapies and therapeutic time parameters of acute ischemic strokes admitted to a university stroke centre in a COVID-epidemic period (01/03/2020-30/04/2020) and an identical period of 2019. RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted during the COVID-period and 97 in the control period. Demographical and clinical characteristics of these periods were well-balanced. In the COVID-period, the proportion of patients arriving beyond 24 hours after onset increased by 13% (p = 0.046), the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged (8%), the rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased from 26% to 16%, the mean onset-to-treatment time of thrombolysis increased by 20 minutes, while the mean door-to-treatment time increased by only 5 minutes. Behind the shift of arrival time categories, multivariable (year of examination, NIHSS, age) logistic regression shows that the year of examination might play a leading role (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-period, admissions for acute ischemic strokes decreased by 11% and the proportion of cases certainly untreatable by reperfusion therapies (arriving beyond 24 hours after onset) increased significantly. While the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged, the absolute rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased by 10% and the mean onset-to-treatment time showed a tendency to increase. In these changes, the COVID-epidemic itself and related out-of-hospital factors might play a leading role.

217509,Quality of solution of massively parallel MSA based on metaheuristic social behavioral model,2021,"AimsThe present study aims at investigating the level of stress among Saudi healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the present study sought to identify the coping strategies adopted by Saudi healthcare workers to alleviate the stress related to COVID-19 pandemic.MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in the period between September and November/2020. A sample of 381 healthcare workers (Physicians, nurses, and technicians) were recruited from King Saud Medical City (KSMC). Both Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) and BRIEF-COPE scale were used to assess the levels of stress and the stress coping strategies, respectively. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the healthcare workers’ responses about the COVID-19 related stress and their adopted coping strategiesResultThe results of the study showed that there was a moderate to high level of COVID-19 related stress (11.64 ± 0.73) among the Saudi healthcare workers. In addition, it was found that planning (3.89 ± 0.61), positive reframing (3.69 ± 0.77), venting (3.39 ± 1.01), and emotional support (3.27 ± 0.63) were the most adopted coping strategies by the healthcare workers to overcome and reduce the stress levelsConclusionThe study concluded that both problem-focused and emotion-focused stress coping strategies were the most commonly adopted coping strategies among Saudi healthcare workers in KSMC. The study recommends increasing the number of the healthcare workers in the KSMC, in addition to increasing the healthcare workers’ knowledge, awareness and practice of the stress coping strategies, especially in crisis events, such as COVID-19 pandemic.","Binnwejim, Mohammed Alhumade Atheer",BJPsych Open,,483
218062,The energy of Russia: hydrocarbon culture and climate change,2020,"Coronavirus infections of multiple origins have spread to date worldwide, causing severe respiratory diseases. Seven coronaviruses that infect humans have been identified: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the most recently discovered. It has created a severe worldwide outbreak beginning in late 2019, leading to date to over 4 million cases globally. Viruses are genetically simple, yet highly diverse. However, the recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, indicate that there remains a long way to go to identify and develop specific therapeutic treatments. Only after gaining a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms can we minimize viral pandemics. This paper mainly focuses on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Here, recent studies are summarized and reviewed, with a focus on virus-host interactions, vaccine-based and drug-targeted therapies, and the development of new approaches for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Chen, Bin; Tian, Er-Kang; He, Bin; Tian, Lejin; Han, Ruiying; Wang, Shuangwen; Xiang, Qianrong; Zhang, Shu; El Arnaout, Toufic; Cheng, Wei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,483

In this framework, the slice images of a CT-scan volume are first proprocessed using segmentation techniques to filter out images of closed lung, and to remove the useless background. Then a resampling method is used to select one or multiple sets of a fixed number of slice images for training and validation. A 3D CNN network with BERT is used to classify this set of selected slice images. In this network, an embedding feature is also extracted. In cases where there are more than one set of slice images in a volume, the features of all sets are extracted and pooled into a global feature vector for the whole CT-scan volume. A simple multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) network is used to further classify the aggregated feature vector. The models are trained and evaluated on the provided training and validation datasets. On the validation dataset, the accuracy is 0.9278 and the F1 score is 0.9261.","Tan, Weijun; Liu, Jingfeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14403v3.pdf,483

Understanding the details of SARS-CoV-2 structural biology is extremely important for development of antiviral agents that will enable regulation of its life cycle. This review focuses on the structural biology and medicinal chemistry of various key proteins (Spike, ACE2, TMPRSS2, RdRp and Mpro) in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, as well as their inhibitors/drug candidates. Representative broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, especially those against the homologous virus SARS-CoV, are summarized with the expectation they will drive the development of effective, broad-spectrum inhibitors against coronaviruses.

223138,"Framing Film-Induced Tourism into a Sustainable Perspective from Romania, Indonesia and Malaysia",2020,"The world is currently experiencing the worst health pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918-the COVID-19 pandemic-caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic is the world's third wake-up call this century. In 2003 and 2012, the world experienced two major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing major respiratory tract infections. At present, there is neither a vaccine nor a cure for COVID-19. The severe COVID-19 symptoms of hyperinflammation, catastrophic damage to the vascular endothelium, thrombotic complications, septic shock, brain damage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and acute neurological and psychiatric complications are unprecedented. Many COVID-19 deaths result from the aftermath of hyperinflammatory complications, also referred to as the ""cytokine storm syndrome"", endotheliitus and blood clotting, all with the potential to cause multiorgan dysfunction. The sphingolipid rheostat plays integral roles in viral replication, activation/modulation of the immune response, and importantly in maintaining vasculature integrity, with sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) and its cognate receptors (SIPRs: G-protein-coupled receptors) being key factors in vascular protection against endotheliitus. Hence, modulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), S1P, and the S1P receptor pathway may provide significant beneficial effects towards counteracting the life-threatening, acute, and chronic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review provides a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease, prospective vaccines, and current treatments. We then discuss the evidence supporting the targeting of SphK/S1P and S1P receptors in the repertoire of COVID-19 therapies to control viral replication and alleviate the known and emerging acute and chronic symptoms of COVID-19. Three clinical trials using FDA-approved sphingolipid-based drugs being repurposed and evaluated to help in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms are discussed.","McGowan, Eileen M; Haddadi, Nahal; Nassif, Najah T; Lin, Yiguang",,,483

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Online. METHODS: A survey was sent to all American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery FDs and co-FDs in September 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 77 eligible FDs, 45 responded (58.4%) representing a diverse group across the United States. All but 1 FD routinely screened patients for COVID-19 in the preoperative setting. FDs largely believed that universal preoperative testing was cost-effective (66.7%), improved patient safety (80.0%) and health care worker safety (95.6%), and was not burdensome for patients (53.3%). With regard to volume of cosmetic/aesthetic, reconstructive, facial nerve, and trauma surgery, FDs indicated largely no change in volume (34.9%, 71.0%, 68.4%, and 80.0%, respectively) or fellow experience (67.4%, 80.6%, 84.2%, and 80.0%). Half (50.0%) of the FDs reported decreased volume of congenital/craniofacial surgery, but 75.0% did not believe that there was a change in fellow experience. Overall, of the 15 responses indicating ""worsened training"" across all domains of FPRS, 14 were located in the Northeast (93.33%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had the least impact on the volume of reconstructive procedures, facial nerve operations, and trauma surgery and a negative impact on congenital/craniofacial surgery volume, and it has accelerated the demand for cosmetic/aesthetic operations. Overall, the majority of FDs did not feel as though their fellows' trainings would be adversely affected by the ongoing pandemic.","Salehi, P. P.; Torabi, S. J.; Lee, Y.

224050,Decision Support System for Determining the Provision of Single Tuition Relief Using KNN and SAW Methods,2020,"BACKGROUND: Limited comprehension of the concept of palliative care and misconceptions about it are barriers to meaningful utilisation of palliative care programs. As caregivers play an integral role for patients with terminal illness, it is necessary to assess their perceptions and attitudes towards the palliative care approach. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data was collected from the Aga Khan Hospital in-patient and out-patient departments and home-based palliative care services. All adult caregivers who met the inclusion criteria and consented, completed a questionnaire till the sample size was reached. Univariate and multivariate multivariable analysis was done and results were reported as crude prevalence's, crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Cox-proportional hazard algorithm. Mean difference of knowledge and attitude scores by caregiver variables were assessed using one-way ANOVA. SPSS version 18 was used and a p-value of less than 5% was treated as significant. RESULTS: Out of 250 caregivers more than 60% were 40 years or less, majority were males and at least graduates. Approximately 70% of the respondents agreed with the statement that the person suffering from cancer should be informed about the diagnosis and disease progression. About 45% (95% C.I.: 39.03, 51.37%) of the study respondents had enhanced understanding about palliative care. Individuals under 40 years old, those with an education level of at least grade 10, children or relatives were found to have significantly more enhanced knowledge about palliative care. The majority believed that the patient should be informed about the diagnosis and should be facilitated to carry out routine activities and fulfill their wishes. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the caregivers had enhanced understanding of the palliative care approach. They showed consistent understanding of two foundational aspects indicating correct knowledge across age groups, gender, education level, and relationship with the patient. Firstly, that palliative care should be offered to everyone suffering from a terminal illness and, secondly, that this approach encompasses not just physical, but also psychological and social needs of the patient and the family. These findings will help inform the establishment of a palliative care program that fills the gaps in comprehension and knowledge of caregivers.","Shah, Sameena; Qaisar, Faizan; Azam, Iqbal; Mansoor, Khairunnisa",BMC Palliat Care,,483

224884,EasyBand: A Wearable for Safety-Aware Mobility During Pandemic Outbreak,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 was discovered among humans in Wuhan, China in late 2019, and then spread rapidly, causing a global pandemic. The virus was found to be transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets from infected persons or by direct contact. It was also shown to be excreted in feces, why we investigated whether the virus could be detected in wastewater and if so, to which extent its levels reflects its spread in society. Samples of wastewater from the city of Gothenburg, and surrounding municipalities in Sweden were collected daily from mid-February until June 2020 at the Rya wastewater treatment plant. Flow proportional samples of wastewater were collected to ensure that comparable amounts were obtained for analysis. Daily samples were pooled into weekly samples. Virus was concentrated on a filter and analyzed by RT-qPCR. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 varied with peaks approximately every four week, preceding variations in number of newly hospitalized patients by 19-21 days. At that time virus testing for COVID-19 was limited to patients with severe symptoms. Local differences in viral spread was shown by analyzing weekly composite samples of wastewater from five sampling sites for four weeks. The highest amount of virus was found from the central, eastern, and northern parts of the city. SARS-CoV-2 was also found in the treated effluent wastewater from the WWTP discharged into the recipient, the Göta River, although with a reduction of 4-log10. The viral peaks with regular temporal intervals indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may have a cluster spread, probably reflecting that the majority of infected persons only spread the disease during a few days. Our results are important for both the planning of hospital care and to rapidly identify and intervene against local spread of the virus.","Saguti, Fredy; Magnil, Ellen; Enache, Lucica; Churqui, Marianela Patzi; Johansson, Anette; Lumley, Douglas; Davidsson, Fredrik; Dotevall, Leif; Mattsson, Ann; Trybala, Edward; Lagging, Martin; Lindh, Magnus; Gisslén, Magnus; Brezicka, Thomas; Nyström, Kristina; Norder, Heléne",Water Res,,483

235130,New energy spaces: Towards a geographical political economy of energy transition,2020,"BACKGROUND: The viral pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted cancer patient management around the world. Most reported data relate to incidence, risk factors, and outcome of severe COVID-19. The safety of systemic anti-cancer therapy in oncology patients with non-severe COVID-19 is an important matter in daily practice. METHODS: ONCOSARS-1 was a single-center, academic observational study. Adult patients with solid tumors treated in the oncology day unit with systemic anti-cancer therapy during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium were prospectively included. All patients (n = 363) underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological testing after the first peak of the pandemic in Belgium. Additionally, 141 of these patients also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the pandemic. The main objective was to retrospectively determine the safety of systemic cancer treatment, measured by the rate of adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two (6%) of the 363 eligible patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and/or serology. Of these, three required transient oxygen supplementation, but none required admission to the intensive care unit. Hematotoxicity was the only adverse event more frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2 -positive patients than in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients: 73% vs 35% (P < 0.001). This association remained significant (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, P = 0.009) even after adjusting for performance status and type of systemic treatment. Hematological adverse events led to more treatment delays for the SARS-CoV-2-positive group: 55% vs 20% (P < 0.001). Median duration of treatment interruption was similar between the two groups: 14 and 11 days, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, infections unrelated to COVID-19, and bleeding events occurred at a low rate in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Systemic anti-cancer therapy appeared safe in ambulatory oncology patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were, however, more treatment delays in the SARS-CoV-2-positive population, mainly due to a higher rate of hematological adverse events.","van Marcke, C; Honoré, N; van der Elst, A; Beyaert, S; Derouane, F; Dumont, C; Aboubakar Nana, F; Baurain, J F; Borbath, I; Collard, P; Cornélis, F; De Cuyper, A; Duhoux, F P; Filleul, B; Galot, R; Gizzi, M; Mazzeo, F; Pieters, T; Seront, E; Sinapi, I; Van den Eynde, M; Whenham, N; Yombi, J C; Scohy, A; van Maanen, A; Machiels, J P",BMC Cancer,,483

236108,Aging and Functionality of the Institutionalized Elderly People of Alto Alentejo: Contributions to the Diagnosis of the Situation,2021,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing ß cells. BDC2.5 T cells in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cell receptor transgenic Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (BDC2.5 + NOD mice) can abruptly invade the pancreatic islets resulting in severe insulitis that progresses rapidly but rarely leads to spontaneous diabetes. This prevention of diabetes is mediated by T regulatory (Treg) cells in these mice. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the inhibition of diabetes in BDC2.5 + NOD mice by generating Il-10-deficient BDC2.5 + NOD mice (BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice). Our results showed that BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice displayed robust and accelerated diabetes development. Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice promoted the generation of neutrophils in the bone marrow and increased the proportions of neutrophils in the periphery (blood, spleen, and islets), accompanied by altered intestinal immunity and gut microbiota composition. In vitro studies showed that the gut microbiota from BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice can expand neutrophil populations. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the depletion of endogenous gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment decreased the proportion of neutrophils. Although Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice had no obvious effects on the proportion and function of Treg cells, it affected the immune response and activation of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the pathogenicity of CD4+ T cells was much increased, and this significantly accelerated the development of diabetes when these CD4+ T cells were transferred into immune-deficient NOD mice. Our study provides novel insights into the role of IL-10 in the modulation of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells in BDC2.5 + NOD mice, and suggests important crosstalk between gut microbiota and neutrophils in type 1 diabetes development.","Huang, Juan; Tan, Qiyuan; Tai, Ningwen; Pearson, James Alexander; Li, Yangyang; Chao, Chen; Zhang, Lucy; Peng, Jian; Xing, Yanpeng; Zhang, Luyao; Hu, Youjia; Zhou, Zhiguang; Wong, F Susan; Wen, Li",Front Immunol,,483

Forty weaning piglets in four groups were fed diets supplemented with 40 or 110 ppm zinc as zinc oxide, 110 ppm as Zn-Lysinate, or 2500 ppm as zinc oxide. Host zinc homeostasis, intestinal zinc fractions, and ileal nutrient digestibility were determined as main nutritional and physiological factors putatively driving colon microbial ecology. Metagenomic sequencing of colon microbiota revealed only clear differences at genus level for the group receiving 2500 ppm zinc oxide. However, a clear group differentiation according to dietary zinc concentration and source was observed at species level. Functional analysis revealed significant differences in genes related to stress response, mineral, and carbohydrate metabolism. Taxonomic and functional gene differences were accompanied with clear effects in microbial metabolite concentration. Finally, a selection of certain antibiotic resistance genes by dietary zinc was observed. This study sheds further light onto the consequences of concentration and chemical form of dietary zinc on microbial ecology measures and the resistome in the porcine colon.","Pieper, Robert; Dadi, Temesgen H; Pieper, Laura; Vahjen, Wilfried; Franke, André; Reinert, Knut; Zentek, Jürgen",,,483

The aim of this study was to synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination. A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) was conducted on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms, respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2-log reduction in viral load. A >3-log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and no evidence of compromise was found. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","O039,; Hearn, K; Gertsman, S; Sampson, M; Webster, R; Tsampalieros, A; Ng, R; Gibson, J; Lobos, A T; Acharya, N; Agarwal, A; Boggs, S; Chamberlain, G; Staykov, E; Sikora, L; McNally, J D",J Hosp Infect,,483

Michigan Medicine, being one of the primary regional centers accepting COVID-19 cases, provided an ideal setting for studying COVID-19 repeated testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic Objective To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with patient characteristics and with downstream outcomes among positive cases Design This cross-sectional study described the pattern of testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine The main hypothesis under consideration is whether patient characteristics differed between those tested once and those who underwent multiple tests We then restrict our attention to those that had at least one positive test and study repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19 related outcomes (testing positive, hospitalization and ICU care) Setting Demographic and clinical characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for 15,920 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10 and June 4, 2020 for a diagnostic test for COVID-19 were collected from their electronic medical records on June 24, 2020 Data on the number and types of tests administered to a given patient, as well as the sequences of patient-specific test results were derived from records of patient laboratory results Participants Anyone tested

Results Between March 10th and June 4th, 19,540 tests were ordered for 15,920 patients, with most patients only tested once (13596, 85 4%) and never testing positive (14753, 92 7%) There were 5 patients who got tested 10 or more times and there were substantial variations in test results within a patient After fully adjusting for patient and neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and demographic characteristics, patients with circulatory diseases (OR: 1 42;95% CI: (1 18, 1 72)), any cancer (OR: 1 14;95% CI: (1 01, 1 29)), Type 2 diabetes (OR: 1 22;95% CI: (1 06, 1 39)), kidney diseases (OR: 1 95;95% CI: (1 71, 2 23)), and liver diseases (OR: 1 30;95% CI: (1 11, 1 50)) were found to have higher odds of undergoing repeated testing when compared to those without Additionally, as compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks were found to have higher odds (OR: 1 21;95% CI: (1 03, 1 43)) of receiving additional testing Females were found to have lower odds (OR: 0

annual income below the federal poverty level, the odds ratio of receiving repeated testing is 1 01 (OR: 1 01;95% CI: (1 00, 1 01)) Focusing on only those 1167 patients with at least one positive result in their full testing history, patient age in years (OR: 1 01;95% CI: (1 00, 1 03)), prior history of kidney diseases (OR: 2 15;95% CI: (1 36, 3 41)) remained significantly different between patients who underwent repeated testing and those who did not After adjusting for both patient demographic factors and NSES, hospitalization (OR: 7 44;95% CI: (4 92, 11 41)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6 97;95% CI: (4 48, 10 98)) were significantly associated with repeated testing Of these 1167 patients, 306 got repeated testing and 1118 tests were done on these 306 patients, of which 810 (72 5%) were done during inpatient stays, substantiating that most repeated tests for test positive patients were done during hospitalization or ICU care Additionally, using repeated testing dat we estimate the ""real world"" false negative rate of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was 23 8% (95% CI: (19 5%, 28 5%)) Conclusions and Relevance This study sought to quantify the pattern of repeated testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset of patients (2324, 14 6% of the population who got tested) underwent multiple rounds of testing (5,944 tests were done in total on these 2324 patients, with an average of 2 6 tests per person), with 10 or more tests for five patients Both hospitalizations and ICU care differed significantly between patients who underwent repeated testing versus those only tested once as expected These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding

HACPs provide guidance on treatment escalation and limitation for individual patients, in the event that they become acutely unwell. In the Old Age Psychiatry Department at NHS Lanarkshire, HACP standards are as follows:HACP forms should be completed within 2 weeks of admissionHACP information leaflets should be provided to relatives/carersHACPs should be discussed with relatives/carersIf a patient without an HACP becomes acutely unwell, an HACP should be made, and the responsible Consultant informedHACP should be discussed within the multi-disciplinary team (MDT)HACPs should be regularly reviewedHACP and DNACPR forms should be kept at the front of the notesSuperseded HACPs should be marked as obsoleteMethodInpatient notes were reviewed in October 2019 and compared against the above standards.The findings were presented at the Clinical Governance Meeting and Old Age Psychiatry Teaching Group in December 2019.An ‘HACP Checklist’ was also created to prompt good practice.Inpatient notes were reviewed again in July 2020.Data from both time periods were compared.ResultThere was an improvement in:The proportion of patients who had an HACP - from 59% to 96%The proportion of patients who had an HACP made within 2 weeks of admission - from 35% to 78%Documentation of HACP discussions with relatives/carers - documented for 77% of patients (from 47%)Timing of HACP discussions with relatives/carers - took place within 2 weeks for 52% of patients (from 29%)Documentation of HACP discussion by MDT - documented for 73% of patients (from 29%)HACP Information Leaflets were only distributed to one patient's relatives/carers across both time pointsMedical emergencies for patients with no HACP were infrequent and so comparison could not be madeHACPs were reviewed less frequently in July 2020 than in October 2019HACP forms and DNACPR forms were always filed appropriatelySuperseded HACP forms were always appropriately marked as obsoleteConclusionHACP practice mostly improved from October 2019 to July 2020. This may have been due to increased awareness of HACP Standards, following the presentation of initial data to inpatient teams.A much larger influence, however, was likely to be the COVID-19 pandemic and associated efforts to improve HACP practice throughout the Health Board.","Brennan, Sarah Routh Rajdeep",BJPsych Open,,483
238620,Reimagining learning outcomes to teach laboratory courses without a lab,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with persistent social and structural factors contributing to these disparities. At the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender, women of color may be disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 outcomes due to their role as essential workers, their higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, their increased stress and anxiety from the loss of wages and caregiving, and domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors among adult women residing in the United States. METHODS: Between May and June 2020, women were recruited into the Capturing Women's Experiences in Outbreak and Pandemic Environments (COPE) Study, a web-based cross-sectional study, using advertisements on Facebook; 491 eligible women completed a self-administered internet-based cross-sectional survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine racial and ethnic differences (White; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black; Hispanic, Latina, or Spanish Origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native; multiracial or some other race, ethnicity, or origin) on COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Among our sample of women, 16% (73/470) reported COVID-19 symptoms, 22% (18/82) were concerned about possible exposure from the people they knew who tested positive for COVID-19, and 51.4% (227/442) knew where to get tested; yet, only 5.8% (27/469) had been tested. Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with racial/ethnic minority women being less likely to know where to get tested. Significant differences in race/ethnicity were observed for select stressors (food insecurity, not enough money, homeschooling children, unable to have a doctor or telemedicine appointment) and prevention behaviors (handwashing with soap, self-isolation if sick, public glove use, not leaving home for any activities). Although no racial/ethnic differences emerged from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for some of the individual scale items (eg, being afraid of getting COVID-19, sleep loss, and heart racing due to worrying about COVID-19). CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of COVID-19 testing and knowledge of where to get tested indicate a critical need to expand testing for women in the United States, particularly among racial/ethnic minority women. Although the overall prevalence of engagement in prevention behaviors was high, targeted education and promotion of prevention activities are warranted in communities of color, particularly with consideration for stressors and adverse mental health.","Stockman, Jamila K; Wood, Brittany A; Anderson, Katherine M",J Med Internet Res,,483

Of the 148 cases, 129 (87.2%) were male with mean and median ages of 30 and 28, respectively. The most common manner of death (MOD) in males was homicide (65 of 129) and accident (49 of 129). The most common MOD in females was accident (15 of 19). Regarding racial demographics, Black homicide deaths accounted for 59 of 67 (88.1%) of total homicides. The most prevalent cause of death for homicides was gunshot wounds (63 of 67, 94.0%). Homicide prevalence was high in the first decade of the study (53 of 88, 60.2%), sharply dropping off after 2011. White accidental deaths made up most of the accidental deaths (45 of 64, 70.3%). Since 2015, accidental deaths with MDMA began to rise (40 of 60, 66.7%), most with other coingestants. MDMA concentrations (median, mean ± SD) between homicide (290, 450 ± 490 ng/mL) and accidental (250, 680 ± 1120 ng/mL) deaths were similar. MDMA concentrations were elevated in central blood compared to peripheral blood from unmatched cases. MDMA was detected in a variety of decedents during the two decades, with primarily young Black male gunshot wound homicide victims in the first decade and primarily young White male accidental polydrug victims in the second decade. This study demonstrates that MDMA is no longer confined to a party setting, but can also be found in different socio-economic strata, including its association with violent homicidal deaths.","Armenian, Patil; Rodda, Luke N",J. anal. toxicol,,483

240506,Possible medium-term scenarios of dynamics of Russia’s energy resource exports after the economic crisis of 2020,2021,"Objectives. To compare presentation of infectious keratitis during COVID-19 lockdown with previous years, assess relative severity, and compare outcomes between COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 era groups. Methods. Acute presentations of infectious keratitis during a strict government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown period were analysed retrospectively (March–May 2020). Data were compared with the same periods in 2018-2019. The clinical notes of patients undergoing corneal scrapes were reviewed, and data were collected on treatment, culture growth, surgical interventions, visual outcomes, admission rates, and risk factors. Results. There were 37% fewer presentations of infectious keratitis to the ED in 2020 (N = 29, 47, and 45, respectively). Risk factor profiles and microbial data were similar across all periods. Admission rates and use of fortified antibiotics were lower in 2020. COVID-19 era cases recovered less vision (LogMAR 0.26, 0.67, and 0.45, respectively;p = 0.04) and were more likely to require surgical intervention (10%, 4%, and 2%, respectively;OR 3.4 (CI 0.7–17.9, p = 0.1)). Conclusion. A concerning fall in presentations of infectious keratitis to ED during the pandemic lockdown was observed. Though societal behaviour changed during the lockdown, our data suggest it is unlikely that the incidence of infectious keratitis fell significantly. It is unclear how and where these patients were treated. We postulate that lower levels of visual recovery and higher rates of surgical intervention may have been caused by delays in accessing care. To minimise avoidable ocular morbidity as COVID-19 resurges, we must communicate clearly with patients and health professionals on how to access available emergency eye care services.

240981,Portfolio Rankings on Social Trading Platforms in Uncertain Times,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Diabetes, as well as other cardiovascular comorbidities, has been recognized as a major risk factor for outcomes and mortality in adults with COVID-19, particularly in the elderly with type 2 diabetes. Based on these conclusions, COVID-19 data on adults have been generalized to youth with diabetes. Nevertheless, experience from pediatric diabetes practices in China (Wuhan), Italy, Spain (Catalonia), and the United States (San Francisco Bay Area) consistently report only a single severe case of COVID-19 in a 20-year-old female youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) that was hospitalized for bilateral pneumonia and was subsequently discharged without complications. In Italy, information on COVID-19 in all children with diabetes is collected on a weekly basis and those with positive swab test or infection-related symptoms reported to a dedicated national registry. Of a total of 15 500 children tested, 11 subjects with T1D (age 8-17y) tested positive for COVID-19; 6/11 were asymptomatic and the rest presented with mild symptoms. In the rest of locations, youths with T1D diagnosed with COVID-19 were based on clinical suspicion and a confirmatory PCR test (Wuhan:0; Catalonia-HSJD:3; California-Stanford:2). All of them were asymptomatic or had a mild course. We suggest that COVID-19 data from adults should not be generalized to children, adolescents, and youth with diabetes as their outcomes and prognosis seem to be similar to their non-diabetic-peers and consistently milder than adults with diabetes.","Cardona-Hernandez, Roque; Cherubini, Valentino; Iafusco, Dario; Schiaffini, Riccardo; Luo, Xiaoping; Maahs, David M",Pediatr. diabetes,,483

Limited testing is cited as the key driver behind minimal information on the COVID-19 pandemic. While expanded testing is laudable, measurement error and selection bias are the two greatest problems limiting our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic; neither can be fully addressed by increased testing capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate their impact on estimation of point prevalence and the effective reproduction number. We show that estimates based on the millions of molecular tests in the US has the same mean square error as a small simple random sample. To address this, a procedure is presented that combines case-count data and random samples over time to estimate selection propensities based on key covariate information. We then combine these selection propensities with epidemiological forecast models to construct a doubly robust estimation method that accounts for both measurement-error and selection bias. This method is then applied to estimate Indiana's prevalence using case-count, hospitalization, and death data with demographic information, a statewide random molecular sample collected from April 25--29th, and Facebook's COVID-19 symptom survey. We end with a series of recommendations based on the proposed methodology.","Dempsey, Walter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10425v2.pdf,483

We therefore sought to identify any unequal effects of the California stay-at-home orders between races and insurance statuses in a multicenter study utilizing trauma volume data. METHODS: A posthoc multicenter retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 centers in Southern California between the dates of January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, was performed. The number of trauma patients of each race/insurance status was tabulated per day. We then calculated the changes in trauma volume related to stay-at-home orders for each race/insurance status and compared the magnitude of these changes using statistical resampling. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there was a 40.1% drop in total trauma volume, which occurred 20 days after stay-at-home orders. During stay-at-home orders, the average daily trauma volume of patients with Medicaid increased by 13.7 ± 5.3%, whereas the volume of those with Medicare, private insurance, and no insurance decreased. The average daily trauma volume decreased for White, Black, Asian, and Latino patients with the volume of Black and Latino patients dropping to a similar degree compared to White patients. CONCLUSION: This retrospective multicenter study demonstrated that patients with Medicaid had a paradoxical increase in trauma volume during stay-at-home orders, suggesting that the most impoverished groups remain disproportionately exposed to trauma during a pandemic, further exacerbating existing health disparities.","Yeates, Eric O; Juillard, Catherine; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Penaloza-Villalobos, Liz; Lin, Ann; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Yeates, Todd O; Nahmias, Jeffry",Surgery (St. Louis),,483

We present the impact of different dissemination strategies to collect data from a non-probabilistic convenience sample and outline post-stratification weighting schemes, to provide guidance for future multi-country survey studies. METHODS: Description and comparison of dissemination strategies for five exemplary countries (Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Spain) participating in the Alcohol Use and COVID-19 Survey. Comparison of the sample distribution with the country's actual population distribution according to sociodemographics, and development of weighting schemes. RESULTS: The dissemination of online surveys through national newspapers, paid social media adverts and dissemination with the support of national health ministries turned out to be the most effective strategies. Monitoring the responses and adapting dissemination strategies to reach under-represented groups, and the application of sample weights were helpful to achieve an analytic sample matching the respective general population profiles. CONCLUSION: Reaching a large pan-European convenience sample, including most European countries, in a short time was feasible, with the support of a broad scientific network.","Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Allebeck, Peter; Barták, Miroslav; Braddick, Fleur; Gual, Antoni; Matrai, Silvia; Petruzelka, Benjamin; Rogalewicz, Vladimir; Rossow, Ingeborg; Schulte, Bernd; Stelemekas, Mindaugas; Manthey, Jakob",Int. j. methods psychiatr. res.

METHODS: We analysed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (from 24 March 2020 to 12 April 2021). We investigated b/tsDMARD use for RA at the clinical onset of COVID-19 (baseline): abatacept (ABA), rituximab (RTX), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), interleukin 6 inhibitors (IL-6i) or tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, reference group). The ordinal COVID-19 severity outcome was (1) no hospitalisation, (2) hospitalisation without oxygen, (3) hospitalisation with oxygen/ventilation or (4) death. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the OR (odds of being one level higher on the ordinal outcome) for each drug class compared with TNFi, adjusting for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: Of 2869 people with RA (mean age 56.7 years, 80.8% female) on b/tsDMARD at the onset of COVID-19, there were 237 on ABA, 364 on RTX, 317 on IL-6i, 563 on JAKi and 1388 on TNFi. Overall, 613 (21%) were hospitalised and 157 (5.5%) died. RTX (OR 4.15, 95% CI 3.16 to 5.44) and JAKi (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.65) were each associated with worse COVID-19 severity compared with TNFi. There were no associations between ABA or IL6i and COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: People with RA treated with RTX or JAKi had worse COVID-19 severity than those on TNFi. The strong association of RTX and JAKi use with poor COVID-19 outcomes highlights prioritisation of risk mitigation strategies for these people.","Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S; Seet, Andrea M; Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Izadi, Zara; Hyrich, Kimme L; Strangfeld, Anja; Gossec, Laure; Carmona, Loreto; Mateus, Elsa F; Lawson-Tovey, Saskia; Trupin, Laura; Rush, Stephanie; Katz, Patricia; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Wise, Leanna; Gilbert, Emily L; Duarte-García, Ali; Valenzuela-Almada, Maria O; Pons-Estel, Guillermo J; Isnardi, Carolina A; Berbotto, Guillermo A; Hsu, Tiffany Y-T; D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Patel, Naomi J; Kearsley-Fleet, Lianne; Schäfer, Martin; Ribeiro, Sandra Lúcia Euzébio; Al Emadi, Samar; Tidblad, Liselotte; Scirè, Carlo Alberto; Raffeiner, Bernd; Thomas, Thierry; Flipo, René-Marc; Avouac, Jérôme; Seror, Raphaèle; Bernardes, Miguel; Cunha, Maria Margarida; Hasseli, Rebecca; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Müller-Ladner, Ulf; Specker, Christof; Souza, Viviane Angelina de; Mota, Licia Maria Henrique da; Gomides, Ana Paula Monteiro; Dieudé, Philippe; Nikiphorou, Elena; Kronzer, Vanessa L; Singh, Namrata",Ann. rheum. dis,,483

249147,Benefits and Challenges of a Virtual Laboratory in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering: Students' Experiences in Fermentation,2021,"Methanol poisoning has been a significant public health challenge for several decades in Iran. Even though alcohol use is highly criminalized, people consume illicit alcohol, which tends to be predominantly homemade and often contains methanol. Consequently, thousands of individual poisonings and hundreds of deaths annually are attributable to methanol poisoning. From February 19, 2020 through April 27, 2020, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic rapidly expanded in Iran, and has been associated with 90,481 confirmed cases and 5710 confirmed deaths. Secondary to misinformation about the potential for alcohol to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there has also been a significant escalation in methanol-related morbidity and mortality, with over 5000 people poisoned and over 500 confirmed deaths for the same period from February through April 2020. In some provinces, the case-fatality rate of methanol poisoning was higher than that from COVID-19. The high morbidity and mortality associated with methanol poisoning preceding and exacerbated by COVID-19 highlight the potential population level health impacts of the implementation of evidence-based education and harm reduction strategies focused on alcohol use across Iran.","Shokoohi, Mostafa; Nasiri, Naser; Sharifi, Hamid; Baral, Stefan; Stranges, Saverio",Alcohol,,483

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMS) delayed operations to protect themselves, patients, and staff. This manuscript presents (1) institution's experience in management of pediatric craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma during COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) suggests recommendations to decrease transmission. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective review of children 18 years or younger who had an operation at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) in Atlanta, GA from March to August 2020. Patients were: (1) 18 years old or younger, (2) had one or more maxillofacial fractures, and (3) had an operation by OMS, Otolaryngology, or Plastic Surgery. Medical records were reviewed regarding: (1) fracture location (2) COVID status, (3) timing, (4) personal protection equipment (PPE), and (5) infection status. Descriptive statistics were computed. Results 58 children met inclusion criteria. Most commonly injured maxillofacial location was nose. Operations occurred 50.9 hours after admission. Specific prevention perioperative guidelines were used with all patients with no transmission from a patient to a healthcare worker. Conclusions With our recommendations, there was no transmission to health care workers. We hope that these guidelines will assist OMS during COVID-19 pandemic.","Abramowicz, Shelly Amin Dina Goudy Steven L.; Austin, Thomas M.; Santore, Matthew T.; Milder, Megan J.; Roser, Steven M.","Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology and Oral Radiology",,483
250188,Worship in a post-lockdown context: A ritual-liturgical perspective,2020,"(1) Background: The implementation of effective control measures in a timely fashion is crucial to control the epidemic outbreak of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to analyze the control measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as evaluating the responses and outcomes at different phases for epidemic control in Taiwan. (2) Methods: This case study reviewed responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of a range of control measures implemented for epidemic control in Taiwan and assessed all laboratory-confirmed cases between 11 January until 20 December 2020, inclusive of these dates. The confirmation of COVID-19 infection was defined as the positive result of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction test taken from a nasopharyngeal swab. Test results were reported by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence rate, mortality rate, and testing rate were compiled, and the risk ratio was provided to gain insights into the effectiveness of prevention measures. (3) Results and Discussion: This study presents retrospective data on the COVID-19 incidence rate in Taiwan, combined with the vital preventive control measures, in a timeline of the early stage of the epidemic that occurred in Taiwan. The implementation of multiple strategy control measures and the assistance of technologies to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan led to a relatively slower trend in the outbreak compared to the neighboring countries. In Taiwan, 766 confirmed patients were included, comprised of 88.1% imported cases and 7.2% local transmission cases, within the studied period. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the studied period was 32 per million people, with a mortality rate of 0.3 per million people. Our analysis showed a significantly raised incidence risk ratio in the countries of interest in comparison to Taiwan during the study period; in the range of 1.9 to 947.5. The outbreak was brought under control through epidemic policies and hospital strategies implemented by the Taiwan Government. (4) Conclusion: Taiwan's preventive strategies resulted in a drastically lower risk for Taiwan nationals of contracting COVID-19 when new pharmaceutical drug or vaccines were not yet available. The preventive strategies employed by Taiwan could serve as a guide and reference for future epidemic control strategies.","Tan, Ting Wan; Tan, Han Ling; Chang, Man Na; Lin, Wen Shu; Chang, Chih Ming",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,483

To curb the spread of the virus, an accurate, cost-effective, and quick testing for large populations is exceedingly important in order to identify, isolate, and treat infected people. Current testing methods commonly use PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) based equipment that have limitations on throughput, cost-effectiveness, and simplicity of procedure which creates a compelling need for developing additional coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) testing mechanisms, that are highly sensitive, rapid, trustworthy, and convenient to use by the public. We propose a COVID-19 testing method using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on MALDI-ToF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight) data extracted from 152 human gargle samples (60 COVID-19 positive tests and 92 COVID-19 negative tests). Our AI-based approach leverages explainable-AI (X-AI) methods to explain the decision rules behind the predictive algorithm both on a local (per-sample) and global (all-samples) basis to make the AI model more trustworthy.

In the United States, 22% of the population is made up of infants, children, and adolescents aged <18 years (children) (3). Data from China suggest that pediatric COVID-19 cases might be less severe than cases in adults and that children might experience different symptoms than do adults (4,5); however, disease characteristics among pediatric patients in the United States have not been described. Data from 149,760 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States occurring during February 12-April 2, 2020 were analyzed. Among 149,082 (99.6%) reported cases for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) were among children aged <18 years. Data were available for a small proportion of patients on many important variables, including symptoms (9.4%), underlying conditions (13%), and hospitalization status (33%). Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath compared with 93% of adults aged 18-64 years during the same period; 5.7% of all pediatric patients, or 20% of those for whom hospitalization status was known, were hospitalized, lower than the percentages hospitalized among all adults aged 18-64 years (10%) or those with known hospitalization status (33%). Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis. These data support previous findings that children with COVID-19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as do adults (4). Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group. Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission (6,7).",,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,483

258278,Implementation of ICAP principles through technology tools: Exploring the alignment between pedagogy and technology,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease characterized by cough, fever, and fatigue and 20% of cases will develop into severe conditions resulting from acute lung injury with the manifestation of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that accounts for more than 50% of mortality. Currently, it has been reported that some comorbidities are linked with an increased rate of severity and mortality among COVID-19 patients. To assess the role of comorbidity in COVID-19 progression, we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis on the relationship of COVID-19 severity with 8 different underlying diseases. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched for articles investigating the prevalence of comorbidities in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. A total of 41 studies comprising 12,526 patients were included. RESULTS: Prevalence of some commodities was lower than that in general population such as hypertension (19% vs 23.2%), diabetes (9% vs 10.9%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (2% vs 9.5%), chronic liver diseases (CLD) (3% vs 24.8%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (3% vs 8.6%), while some others including cancer (1% vs 0.6%), cardiovascular disease (6% vs 1.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (2% vs 0.9%) exhibited greater percentage in COVID-19. Cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.70, 95%CI 2.51-5.45) was found to be the strongest risk factor in disease exacerbation, followed by CKD (OR = 3.60, 95%CI 2.18-5.94), COPD (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.35-4.19), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.76, 95% CI 2.18-3.49), malignancy (OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.75-3.95), diabetes (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 2.10-2.96) and hypertension (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.81-2.51). We found no correlation between CLD and increased disease severity (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.96-1.82). CONCLUSION: The impact of all eight underlying diseases on COVID-19 deterioration seemed to be higher in patients outside Hubei. Based on different comorbidities, COVID-19 patients tend to be at risk of developing poor outcomes to a varying degree. Thus, tailored infection prevention and monitoring and treatment strategies targeting these high-risk subgroups might improve prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yin, Tingxuan; Li, Yuanjun; Ying, Ying; Luo, Zhijun",BMC Infect Dis,,483

Some reports have demonstrated conflicting results. We performed a robust, ecologic analysis comparing COVID-19 related mortality (CRM) between strictly selected countries based on BCG vaccination program status utilizing publicly available databases and machine learning methods to define the association between active BCG vaccination programs and CRM. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CRM was lower for the majority of countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15 years (BCG15). CRM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. A higher total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CRM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15 years, but not other vaccination programs, and CRM. BCG vaccination programs continued to be associated with decreased CRM even for populations < 40 years old where CRM events are less frequent.","Brooks, Nathan A; Puri, Ankur; Garg, Sanya; Nag, Swapnika; Corbo, Jacomo; Turabi, Anas El; Kaka, Noshir; Zemmel, Rodney W; Hegarty, Paul K; Kamat, Ashish M",Sci Rep,,483

Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease. Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale. Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm. The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.","Zareifopoulos, Nicholas; Lagadinou, Maria; Karela, Anastasia; Platanaki, Christina; Karantzogiannis, Gerasimos; Velissaris, Dimitrios",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,483

Therefore, in this study, we choose 85 flavonoid compounds and screened them to determine their in-silico interaction with protein targets crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The five important targets chosen were the main protease (Mpro), Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), RNA - dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12), non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) spike-RBD binding domain. The compounds were initially docked at the selected sites and further evaluated for binding free energy, using the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. The three compounds with the best binding scores were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The compound, tribuloside, had a high average binding free energy of -86.99 and -88.98 kcal/mol for Mpro and Nsp12, respectively. The compound, legalon, had an average binding free energy of -59.02 kcal/mol at the ACE2 spike-RBD binding site. The compound, isosilybin, had an average free binding energy of -63.06 kcal/mol for the Spike-RBD protein. Overall, our results suggest that tribuloside, legalon and isosilybin should be evaluated in future studies to determine their efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Mishra, Ganesh Prasad; Bhadane, Rajendra N; Panigrahi, Debadash; Amawi, Haneen A; Asbhy, Charles R; Tiwari, Amit K",Comput Biol Med,,483

As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a databases of ~4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including 3 natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 form H-bonds to all the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to ~ 2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our results could contribute to the development of potentials drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.","Ngo, Son Tung; Quynh Anh Pham, Ngoc; Thi Le, Ly; Pham, Duc-Hung; Vu, Van V",,,483

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRIO (""Prevention and Integrative Oncology"") Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020. Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. RESULTS: A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients. Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves.

271664,Faster or slower decarbonization? Policymaker and stakeholder expectations on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy transition,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our study hypothesizes that the fear and panic of COVID-19 triggers cyberchondria (CYB) in students thus increasing health anxiety. In this way, we aim to determine the effect of the belief of previously having had and not having had COVID-19 on health anxiety and CYB levels of the university students. METHODS: Our study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The target population of our study consisted of 950 students who were continuing their education in the Vocational School of Health Services, an associate degree program of a university, and the samples consisted of 794 students (85.5%) who filled out our questionnaire (n = 794). The questionnaire form included the information regarding sociodemographic characteristics and the symptoms of COVID-19, and the obtained data were electronically collected altogether with Cyberchondria Scale (CS) and Health Anxiety Inventory. FINDINGS: Health anxiety mean scores were significantly higher in people who lived alone, had a chronic disease, searched for symptoms online, and took herbal supplements against COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The mean total scores of Health Anxiety Inventory, CS, Anxiety-Increasing Factors Subscale of the students who believe they have had COVID-19 were significantly lower compared to the scores of those who believe they have not had COVID-19. Nevertheless, women and people living alone and in cities had significantly high CS scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The increase in infodemia can be prevented with the services offered by specialists through mental health helpline or websites to people with high health anxiety or CYB levels, especially to women, and to people living alone and in urban areas.","Kurcer, Mehmet A; Erdogan, Zeynep; Cakir Kardes, Vildan",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,483

272749,Guest editorial,2021,"ABSTRACT Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency medicine (EM) residency programs have transitioned from traditional in-person to virtual synchronous didactics to comply with social distancing guidelines. This study explores the perceptions of EM residents and faculty regarding this new virtual format. Methods This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study at five EM residencies using a mixed-methods approach to investigate resident and faculty perceptions of virtual didactics. Institutions selected reflect different program lengths and geographic locations. Quantitative data measured on a Likert scale were summarized as percentages. Differences were calculated using Welch?s t-test and chi-square, where p&lt;.05 was significant. Open-ended responses were analyzed qualitatively. Results Our response rate was 64% (n=141) for residents and 48% (n=108) for faculty. Fifty-one percent of faculty and 54% of residents felt that they are more likely to attend virtually than in-person. Among residents, 77% felt that they are more likely to attend virtual conferences during vacation or elective rotations. Perceived retention of information from virtual sessions was perceived to be the same or better for 69% of residents and 58% of faculty. Residents felt they paid more attention in the virtual format (29% vs. 26%, p=.037). Both groups missed the social interactions of in-person conference (86% of faculty, 75% of residents). Respondents from both groups felt that &lt;20% of total didactic time should remain virtual once social distancing recommendations are lifted. Qualitative analysis revealed recommendations from residents and faculty to optimize lecture style and interactivity. Decreased commute time and ability to multitask at home increased wellness for both groups. Conclusions While benefits of virtual didactics were acknowledged, residents and faculty missed the social interaction of in-person conference and preferred &lt;20% of future didactics to be virtual. Further research should assess the difference in knowledge acquisition and retention between conference models.","Tsyrulnik, Alina Gottlieb Michael Coughlin Ryan F.; Bod, Jessica Della-Giustina David Greenberger Sarah von Reinhart Anna Heinrich Scott Rotoli Jason Goldflam Katja",AEM Education and Training,,483

273012,Setting up a Language Learning Environment in Microsoft Teams,2020,"AimsThe primary aim of the project was to improve attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine in forensic mental health staff at a large regional tertiary forensic psychiatry unit. The main variable examined was attitudes towards safety of the vaccine. Secondary aims included decreasing misinformation about the vaccine and improving vaccine uptake.MethodPaper questionnaires were distributed to willing staff members across 6 forensic inpatient wards within the North London Forensic Service. Participants included a range of allied health professionals including nurses, health care assistants, ward managers, occupational therapists, assistant therapists and administrative staff. Questionnaires used a mixture of Likert scale for agreement/disagreement with statements and yes/no questions.Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology was utilised in implementing changes, and repeat questionnaires used to measure changes in attitude and behaviour. Change ideas implemented included the creation of ‘mythbusters’ posters which target vaccine misinformation, the creation and distribution of posters of staff members who had already taken their vaccine, the creation of vaccine champions to aid engagement in conversation about the vaccine, vaccine information packs being distributed to all wards and the opportunity for staff to ‘drop-in’ to clinics for information about the vaccine.ResultVaccine uptake improved from 7% before interventions to 69% after interventions.The proportion of people very unlikely or unlikely to get the vaccine reduced from 25% to just 9%. The proportion of those feeling neutral reduced from 32% to 6%. The proportion of those either likely or very likely to get the vaccine increased from 34% to 85%.Before interventions only 20% felt that the vaccine was either safe or very safe. This improved to 63% after interventionsBefore interventions, only 27% of respondents felt they had received enough information by the trust to make an informed decision. After interventions, 80% said they had received enough information.The project was successful in reducing misinformation in every domain. Particularly reassuring was the reduction to zero of some of the most harmful misinformation claims, such as the presence of a tracking chip in the vaccine and the belief that COVID does not exist.71% of respondents indicated the interventions we set out changed their view on the COVID-19 vaccine.ConclusionThe changes implemented lead to clear improvements in all domains measured, suggesting targeted information is an effective strategy in improving uptake and attitudes around the vaccination program.","Howarth, Harrison Stevens Toby Gostick Benjamin Stock Lisanne Stone David",BJPsych Open,,483

276584,Perceiving Humans: From Monocular 3D Localization to Social Distancing,2021,"Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often have vitamin D deficiency, a known risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. Alveolar macrophage-derived cytokines contribute to the inflammation underlying pulmonary disease in COVID-19. We sought to determine if basal macrophage activation, as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, was present in PCOS and, if so, was further enhanced by vitamin D deficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 99 PCOS and 68 control women who presented sequentially. Plasma levels of a macrophage-derived cytokine panel were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Vitamin D was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: Vitamin D was lower in PCOS women (p<0.0001) and correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS (r=0.28, p=0.0046). Basal macrophage activation markers CXCL5, CD163 and MMP9 were elevated, whilst protective CD200 was decreased (p<0.05); changes in these variables were related to, and fully accounted for, by BMI. PCOS and control women were then stratified according to vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased CD80 and IFN-Î³ in PCOS and IL-12 in both groups (p<0.05). These factors, important in initiating and maintaining the immune response, were again accounted for by BMI. Conclusion: Basal macrophage activation was higher in PCOS with macrophage changes related with increased infection risk associating with vitamin D; all changes were BMI dependent, suggesting that obese PCOS with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk of more severe COVID-19 infection, but that it is obesity-related rather than an independent PCOS factor.","Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Butler, Alexandra E; Atkin, Stephen L",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,483

277383,An Ensemble Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Effect of a Global Pandemic on Twitter Users' Attitudes,2021,"The main purpose of this paper is to discuss how COVID-19 has impacted Korean families. The economic well-being of Korean families has been threatened because many family members lost their jobs or earned reduced incomes due to the pandemic. COVID-19 substantially changed the work environment and has provided the momentum for the growth of flexible work including telecommuting in Korea, which was not commonly used before the pandemic. However, the work-from-home arrangements created an ambiguous boundary between work and family, particularly among employed mothers because childcare facilities and schools were closed during COVID-19. The postponed 2020 school year started with online schooling in April, and children in secondary schools often continued private education during the pandemic. Although COVID-19 provided an opportunity to build emotional ties for some families, many Korean families who were stuck at home experienced relational difficulties. Socioeconomic and gender inequality along with discrimination against certain groups were heightened. Our analysis of social media posts showed that childcare, schooling, and religion were important domains of family life during the pandemic. We conclude that COVID-19 has changed the meaning of home in Korea from a place to sleep to a basecamp involving numerous major activities related to work, schooling, parenting, housework, shopping, leisure, and religion. Korean families have found it challenging to spend intensive time with their family, to share gendered family responsibilities, and to support other families. Thus, we suggest that professional and policymakers develop a new service model that is more effective for the changing family climate.Alternate abstract: L'objectif principal de cet article est de discuter de l'impact du COVID-19 sur les familles coréennes. Le bien-être économique des familles coréennes a été menacé parce que de nombreux membres de la famille ont perdu leur emploi ou gagné des revenus réduits en raison de la pandémie. L'impact a été le plus grave parmi ceux des petites entreprises, du commerce de détail et des services. COVID-19 a considérablement modifié l'environnement de travail et a donné l'impulsion à la croissance du travail flexible, y compris le télétravail en Corée, qui n'était pas couramment utilisé avant la pandémie. Cependant, les dispositions du travail à domicile ont créé une frontière ambiguë entre le travail et la famille, en particulier chez les mères employées car les garderies et les écoles ont été fermées pendant la COVID-19. L'année scolaire reportée de 2020 a commencé avec la scolarité en ligne en avril, et les enfants des écoles secondaires ont souvent poursuivi l'enseignement privé pendant la pandémie. Un autre impact de COVID-19 a été le changement de la signification de la maison d'un espace au sommeil à un espace pour toutes les activités quotidiennes. De plus, de nombreuses familles coréennes coincées à la maison ont connu des difficultés relationnelles. Les inégalités socioéconomiques et entre les sexes ainsi que la discrimination contre certains groupes ont été accentuées. Notre analyse des publications sur les réseaux sociaux a montré que la garde des enfants, la scolarisation et la religion étaient des domaines importants de la vie familiale pendant la pandémie. Les familles coréennes ont eu du mal à passer du temps intensif en famille, à partager les responsabilités familiales liées au sexe et à soutenir d'autres familles. Ainsi, nous suggérons que les professionnels et les décideurs politiques développent un nouveau modèle de service qui soit plus efficace pour le climat familial changeant.","Lee, Jaerim Chin Meejung Sung Miai",Journal of Comparative Family Studies,,483

Materials and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was designed using Google forms to collect data. Participants were recruited using a convenience snowballing technique. The questionnaire contained 3 sections on Socio-demographic data, the Fear of COVID-9 scale, and an open-ended question on suggested ways to mitigate anxiety towards COVID-19. For the open-ended question, scores were grouped based on the similarity of thematic content. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0. Results: A total of 1011 respondents completed the survey. The Mean Sum Fear of Corona was 18.28±5.909 out of a possible maximum score of 35. More than half (53.6%, n = 542) of the respondents had ‘Low fear’ of COVID-19. There was an increasing fear of COVID-19 with increasing educational qualification, however, this was not statistically significant. Respondents with health-related occupations had less anxiety towards COV-ID-19 compared to people in non-health related occupations (17.83±5.85 Vs. 18.54±5.91). When respondents were asked to suggest ways anxiety towards COVID-19 could be reduced, one-third of them (34%, n =344) responded that public enlightenment programs with accurate information on the virus should be embarked on. Conclusion: Overall, there was a low fear of COVID-19 among the general Nigerian population surveyed in this study. Public enlightenment and limited consumption of news on COVID-19 were the most suggested ways to abate fear of the virus. © 2021 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.","Aluh, D.

279475,"A practical approach to adult-onset white matter diseases, with illustrative cases",2020,"Rationale: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who develop AKI and multi organ failure face a high mortality rate and in those progressing to renal replacement therapy (RRT) mortality rates may exceed 50%. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe COVID-19 often results in multi system involvement and may particularly affect the kidneys. The incidence of AKI in this setting is unclear and has varied widely in reports based on population evaluated. There is limited data on the incidence and outcomes of severe AKI necessitating RRT in COVID-19 patients who progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). We conducted a retrospective study in order to determine the incidence and outcomes associated with need for RRT in patients with COVID-19 that progressed to need MV. Methods: We reviewed the records of all COVID-19 patients who were intubated for respiratory failure in our hospital between March and May 2020. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of RRT while outcomes in these subjects (e.g. hospital mortality, length of stay and recovery of renal function) served as secondary endpoints. We examined the relationship between our endpoints and baseline demographics, pre-existing co-morbidities, severity of illness identified by vasopressor requirement, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, plateau pressure, fluid balance in the first three days, and treatment with full strength anticoagulation and/or tocilizumab. Results: Our final cohort consisted of 135 patients of which 46 (34.0%) required RRT. Patients who required RRT had similar baseline characteristics to those who did not. Patients treated with RRT had a higher fluid balance in the first 72 hours (+4761 vs +3076, p=0.040). The mortality rate was higher in those requiring RRT (69.6% vs 39.3%, p=0.001), while the median ICU and hospital stay was lower in this subgroup. Amongst hospital survivors evaluated by the end of our study, 43.0% continued to require RRT, 7.0% no longer required RRT but still had some degree of renal dysfunction, and 50.0% had complete recovery of renal function. Conclusion: There is high incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 who require MV and one third of these patients develop renal failure requiring RRT. The mortality in these patients is high and exceeds that reported in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome from other causes who need RRT. Complete renal function recovery often occurs in survivors.","Chaturvedi, M.; Mahmood, S.; Kohli, A.; Oweis, E. S.; Woods, C. J.; Shorr, A.

Background: In the context of the pandemic, hospitals must be able to care for COVID-19 patients within a very short timeframe. OBJECTIVE: Description of the setting up of a cohort ward for patients with COVID-19 on a surgical ward including the development of the nursing team. METHODS: The intrinsic retrospective case study describes the situation, identifies special phenomena in a reflective manner and links them to existing knowledge. Data were anecdotal, routine data were collected in the context of nursing practice development. RESULTS: Setting up the cohort ward in a Swiss hospital consisted of structural and technical planning, infection control measures, the establishment of interprofessional structures, and internal communication. During the four-week operation, 71 patients were treated. The use of practice development methodology initiated a cultural change. The reflection describes a field of tension between ""dream and distress"": As a dream, the lived experience of optimal care, with well-functioning processes, sufficient material, sufficient personnel and a very good interprofessional cooperation was evaluated. Distress in the form of high infection rates as well as psychological and physical stress did not occur. After the cohort ward was closed, there was a risk working back in normal operations based on existing economical and organizational conditions, with the knowledge that a different cooperation and organization is possible. CONCLUSIONS: Positive experiences from the ""crisis mode"" should be used to further develop essential operations during normal times.","Rabes, Clemens; Bläuer, Cornelia; Büche, Volker; Gisler Ries, Isabelle; Knüppel Lauener, Susanne; Kuehl, Richard; Osthoff, Michael; Pfeiffer, Marlen; Probst, Silvia; Todorov, Victor; Panfil, Eva-Maria",Pflege,,483

We investigated admission rates, treatment and mortality of BAME with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during COVID-19. METHODS: Using multisource national healthcare records, patients hospitalised with AMI in England during 1 February-27 May 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, whereas patients admitted during the same period in the previous three consecutive years were included in a pre-COVID-19 group. Multilevel hierarchical regression analyses were used to quantify the changes in-hospital and 7-day mortality in BAME compared with whites. RESULTS: Of 73 746 patients, higher proportions of BAME patients (16.7% vs 10.1%) were hospitalised with AMI during the COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID-19. BAME patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were younger, male and likely to present with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. COVID-19 BAME group admitted with non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction less frequently received coronary angiography (86.1% vs 90.0%, p<0.001) and had a longer median delay to reperfusion (4.1 hours vs 3.7 hours, p<0.001) compared with whites. BAME had higher in-hospital (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.28) and 7-day mortality (OR 1.81 95% CI 1.31 to 2.19) during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 period. CONCLUSION: In this multisource linked cohort study, compared with whites, BAME patients had proportionally higher hospitalisation rates with AMI, less frequently received guidelines indicated care and had higher early mortality during COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID-19 period.

283015,"“We aren't your reincarnation!” workplace motivation across X, Y and Z generations",2020,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that needs continuous medical care. During COVID-19, delivering medical service was negatively affected. AIMS: To describe the impact of COVID-19 on psoriasis healthcare delivery, management, and practice. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 197 dermatologists using a validated online questionnaire. The survey evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on the decisions, prescription patterns, appointments rescheduling, and healthcare delivery for psoriasis patients by dermatologists. The questionnaire was developed and validated with a reliability score >0.7. RESULTS: During the pandemic, most dermatologists delayed initiating biological/immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis unless urgently needed by the patient. For patients already receiving biologics or immunosuppressive treatment, most dermatologists favored continuation of therapy. Almost half (44.2%) of participants do not perform SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening before initiating biologics/immunosuppressive therapy. Dermatologists also reported an increased prescription of topical medications (79.2%), natural sunlight (28.4%), acitretin (26.9%), and home UVB (21.3%). Opinions regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment/prophylaxis for psoriasis patients were controversial. Intervals between face-to-face follow-up visits were prolonged by 71.6% of dermatologists. More than half of participants reported that their patients discontinued treatment without medical consultation. More than three fourth of responders either agreed or strongly agreed that COVID-19 negatively affected psoriasis patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on psoriasis management and healthcare delivery. Dermatologists are cautious about using biologics and immunosuppressive drugs during the pandemic, making case-by-case decisions. Psoriasis patients need compliance monitoring, and psychological support during the pandemic, which can be facilitated by teledermatology.","El-Komy, Mohamed H M; Abdelnaby, Asmaa; El-Kalioby, Mona",J Cosmet Dermatol,,483
283763,Towards Post-Pandemic Sustainable and Ethical Food Systems,2021,"Three highly pathogenic ß-coronaviruses have crossed the animal-to-human species barrier in the past two decades: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the possibility of identifying antibodies with broad neutralizing activity, we isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, that cross-reacts with eight ß-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting ß-coronaviruses. B6 broadly neutralizes entry of pseudotyped viruses from lineages A and C, but not from lineage B, and the latter includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and membrane fusion assays reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery. The data indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with the spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with ß-coronaviruses from three lineages, along with a proof of concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination. This study unveils an unexpected target for next-generation structure-guided design of a pan-ß-coronavirus vaccine.","Sauer, Maximilian M; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Park, Young-Jun; Walls, Alexandra C; Homad, Leah; Acton, Oliver J; Bowen, John E; Wang, Chunyan; Xiong, Xiaoli; de van der Schueren, Willem; Quispe, Joel; Hoffstrom, Benjamin G; Bosch, Berend-Jan; McGuire, Andrew T; Veesler, David",Nat Struct Mol Biol,,483

Experiential apprentice-style training is traditionally recognised as an important aspect of obtaining competency. In March 2020 they were stood down from their general practice placements in the context of a national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute conversion of their general practice education from experiential clinical exposure to online and offsite learning was required. This paper describes the steps taken and the underlying theoretical foundations for our expediently developed online course. Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum. Within this theory, we propose a five-stage model of learning. Learning from this experience contributes to the body of knowledge around online education, particularly in meeting the needs of a clinical attachment traditionally grounded in experiential learning. It is hoped that the mechanisms described here might be useful to other educators facing similar challenges.","Roskvist, Rachel; Eggleton, Kyle; Goodyear-Smith, Felicity",Educ Prim Care,,483

287087,Behind COVID-19 Contact Trace Apps: The Google-Apple Partnership,2020,"We study the problem of quickest detection of a change in the mean of an observation sequence, under the assumption that both the pre- and post-change distributions have bounded support. We first study the case where the pre-change distribution is known, and then study the extension where only the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution are known. In both cases, no knowledge of the post-change distribution is assumed other than that it has bounded support. For the case where the pre-change distribution is known, we derive a test that asymptotically minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all post-change distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. We then study the limiting form of the optimal test as the gap between the pre- and post-change means goes to zero, which we call the Mean-Change Test (MCT). We show that the MCT can be designed with only knowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution. We validate our analysis through numerical results for detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution. We also demonstrate the use of the MCT for pandemic monitoring.","Liang, Yuchen; Veeravalli, Venugopal V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05423v1.pdf,483

As the number of coronavirus infections has exceeded 100,000 with toll deaths of about 5000 worldwide as of early March, 2020, scientists and researchers are racing to investigate the nature of this virus and evaluate the short and long term effects of this disease. Despite its negative impacts that obliged the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the rate of mortality of this infection has not exceeded 3.4% globally. On the other hand, the mortality rate caused by ambient air pollution has contributed to 7.6% of all deaths in 2016 worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced China to lockdown its industrial activities and hence dropped its NO2 and carbon emissions by 30 and 25%, respectively. This work reports on the first case study that compares the air quality status before and after the crisis. It sheds light on the facts related to the demographics of deaths by gender, age and health status before infection. The historical data on air quality, estimates of annual deaths and its economic burden have been presented and analyzed. The actual daily deaths due to COVID-19 have been obtained from the official records of the daily Situation Reports published by World Health Organization as of March 11th. The rate of mortality due to COVID-19 was impacted by two factors: age and health status. Results show that 75% of deaths were related to cases that had underlying present diseases with the majority aged of 80+ years. The reported figures were compared with the average daily mortality due to poor air quality which reached up to 3287 deaths due to high levels of NO2, O3 and PM. The air quality status before the crisis was compared with the current situation showing that COVID-19 forced-industrial and anthropogenic activities lockdown may have saved more lives by preventing ambient air pollution than by preventing infection.","Isaifan, R.

Patients with more severe symptoms may require intensive care treatments and face a high mortality risk. Also, thrombotic complications such as pulmonary embolisms and disseminated intravascular coagulation are frequent in these patients. Indeed, COVID-19 is characterized by an abnormal inflammatory response resembling a cytokine storm, which is associated to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular complications. To date, no specific treatments are available for COVID-19 and its life-threatening complication. Immunomodulatory drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and interleukin-6 inhibitors, as well as antithrombotic drugs such as heparin and low molecular weight heparin, are currently being administered with some benefit. Ozone therapy consists in the administration of a mixture of ozone and oxygen, called medical ozone, which has been used for over a century as an unconventional medicine practice for several diseases. Medical ozone rationale in COVID-19 is the possibility of contrasting endothelial dysfunction, modulating the immune response and acting as a virustatic agent. Thus, medical ozone could help to decrease lung inflammation, slow down viral growth, regulate lung circulation and oxygenation and prevent microvascular thrombosis. Ozone-therapy could be considered a feasible, cost-effective and easy to administer adjuvant therapy while waiting for the synthesis of a therapy or the development of the vaccine.","Ranaldi, Giovanni Tommaso; Villani, Emanuele Rocco; Franza, Laura",Med Gas Res,,483

Further, in China, early intervention policy has been enacted since February. Whether early intervention contributes to swift recovery is still unknown. Hence, in this study, we focused on the patients from an isolated area, investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of four serial passages of the virus. METHODS: From January 25 to February 29, 2020, all patient data on the SARS-CoV-2 passages in this isolated area were traced, and the patients were grouped according to the passaging of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical characteristics of patients, including laboratory, radiology, treatment and outcomes, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients with four passages of virus transmission were included in this study. One patient transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to 8 patients (passage 2, P2), who next infected 23 patients (passage 3, P3), and then 46 patients (passage 4, P4). P2 received antiviral treatment when they had symptom, whereas P4 received antiviral treatment during their asymptomatic period. The incubation periods for P2, P3 and P4 patients were 7 days (IQR:2-12), 8 days (IQR:4-13) and 10 days (IQR:7-15), respectively. P2 patients showed lymphocytopenia (0.79 × 109/L), decreased lymphocyte percentages (12.15%), increased white blood cell count (6.51 × 109/L), increased total bilirubin levels (25% of P2 patients), increased C-reactive protein levels (100% of P2 patients) and abnormal liver function. By chest CT scans, all P2 patients (100%), 15 of P3 patients (65.22%) and 16 of P4 patients (34.78%) showed abnormality with typical feature of ground glass opacity. All of P2 patients (100%) received oxygen therapy, and in contrast, 19 of P4 patients (41.3%) received oxygen therapy. Further, significant decreased nucleic acid positive periods was found in P4 group (16 days, IQR: 10-23), compared with that of P2 group (22 days, IQR: 16-27). Moreover, the severity ratios were sharply decreased from 50% (P2 patients) to 4.35% (P4 patients), and the case fatality rate is zero.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a university outpatient clinic of obstetric and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who was prescribed a mobile meditation app for 30 days, or the control group, which received standard care. The primary outcome was self-reported perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included self-reported depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with the meditation app. A sample size of 80 participants (40 per group) was calculated to achieve 84% power to detect a 3-point difference in the primary outcome. RESULTS: From April to May 2020, 101 women were randomized in the study-50 in the meditation app group and 51 in the control group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Most characteristics were similar between groups. Perceived stress was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (mean difference 4.27, 95% CI 1.30-7.24, P=.005, d=0.69 and mean difference 4.28, 95% CI 1.68-6.88, P=.002, d=0.69, respectively). Self-reported depression and anxiety were significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (depression: P=.002 and P=.04; anxiety: P=.01, and P=.04, respectively). Sleep disturbance was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively). More than 80% of those in the intervention group reported high satisfaction with the meditation app, and 93% reported that mindfulness meditation improved their stress. CONCLUSION: Outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients who used the prescribed consumer-based mobile meditation app during the COVID-19 pandemic had significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance compared with standard care.

294482,Green Stimulus in a Post-pandemic Recovery: the Role of Skills for a Resilient Recovery,2020,"Background: During the first two waves of COVID-19, several physical restriction measurements were imposed in Belgium. Our aim was to explore the impact of these restriction measures on the number of tests and positivity rate of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) before, during, and after the two lockdowns in Belgium. Methods: Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae molecular data of a Belgian STI clinic were extracted for 2019 and 2020, and both years were divided into four periods (pre-lockdown 1, lockdown 1, after lockdown 1, and lockdown 2). Weekly testing rates and positivity rate for both STIs were estimated, and mixed-effects logistic regression was used to explore statistical significant changes between both years, and the different periods were compared with the corresponding time period in 2019. The same analysis was done for pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP) users only. Results: No overall significant changes in positivity rate were found for either CT (8.0% in 2019 and 7.8% in 2020) or NG (4.5% in 2019 and 5.5% in 2020). Besides a significant drop in the number of CT/NG tests during lockdown 1 (decrease of 87%) and a subsequent increase in NG positivity rate (p > 0.05), no changes in CT/NG positivity rate were found in the other periods. The highest positivity rate for either CT or NG was found in lockdown 2 (15.1% vs 12.4% in 2019). The number of CT/NG tests in lockdown 2 was still 25% lower than 2019 levels. Subanalysis of only PrEP users revealed the same trend; however, the number of CT/NG tests in lockdown 2 was exactly the same as in 2019. Conclusion: Despite a significant decline in absolute CT or NG cases in lockdown 1, which was most likely a consequence of both physical distancing and reduced testing, CT/NG testing and positivity rates returned to pre-corona levels in lockdown 2, which may depict physical distancing fatigue.","De Baetselier, Irith; Apers, Ludwig; Platteau, Tom; Buyze, Jozefien; Florence, Eric; Kenyon, Chris; Van den Bossche, Dorien",Int J STD AIDS,,483
296153,Using blockchain-enabled solutions as sdg accelerators in the international development space,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans. METHODS: This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18-50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5â×â109 viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5â×â1010 viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5â×â1010 viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-Î³-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578. FINDINGS: Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5â×â1010 viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66-81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18-33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11-17·42], p<0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p<0·003) and IgG (p<0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19-73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58-93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

This study examined the mediating effect of COVID-19 coping strategies on the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. Participants (70% females) included 4624 adults (M age = 30.29 ± 10.97 years) collected through an online survey using a convenience sampling approach. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded a one-factor structure for the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CFI = .98, TLI = .96, SRMR = .02, RMSEA = .09), COVID-19 Coping Scale (CFI = .97, TLI = .97, SRMR = .03, RMSEA = .12), and General Health Scale (CFI = .99, TLI = .97, SRMR = .01, RMSEA = .04) which were developed for the purpose of this study and exhibited satisfactory reliability. Findings showed that COVID-19 anxiety was negatively related with COVID-19 coping and general health. COVID-19 coping had a positive relationship with general health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that COVID-19 coping partially mediated the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. These findings shed more light on the mechanism underlying between COVID-19 anxiety and health. The findings are important for tailoring and implementing coping-based intervention strategies to reduce the impact of COVID-19 anxiety on general health.","Yildirim, Murat; Akgül, Ömer; Geçer, Ekmel",Int J Ment Health Addict,,483

However, puncture of the foramen ovale by conventional single-plane fluoroscopy can be difficult in cases of local anatomic abnormalities. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 49-year-old woman diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia refractory to pharmacological treatment. After failure of puncture by conventional fluoroscopy for percutaneous gasserian ganglion balloon compression due to a narrow foramen ovale, the patient was submitted to puncture guided by computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Alternative imaging methods, such as computed tomography, should be considered when puncture of the foramen ovale by conventional single-plane fluoroscopy fails, to minimize the risk of potential complications triggered by frustrated puncture attempts.","Mendes, Plinio Duarte; Martins da Cunha, Pedro Henrique; Monteiro, Kalinio de Kassio Oliveira; Quites, Lucas Viana; Fonseca Filho, Gilberto de Almeida",Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,,483

298517,Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on micromobility transportation,2021,"Aggregated community-scale data could be harnessed to allow insights into the disparate impacts of managed power outages, burst pipes, and food inaccessibility during extreme weather events. During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, Texas power-generating plant operators resorted to rolling blackouts to prevent wider collapse of the whole power grid when power demand overwhelmed supply. In this study, we collected community-scale big data (e.g., digital trace and crowdsourced data) in the context of the winter storm, which brought historically low temperatures, snow, and ice to the entire state of Texas. By analyzing this data, we can infer the extent of disparities in storm-related impacts on vulnerable populations. In addition to assessing disparate impacts of the managed power outage, this study also examined the extent of burst pipes and disrupted access to food. Using statistical and trend classification analyses, the results highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of impacts for subpopulations in Harris County, Texas, within which the city of Houston is located. In particular, findings show significant disparity in the extent and duration of power outages experienced by low-income and minority groups. This finding suggests that the existence of inequality in the management and implementation of the power outage. Also, the extent of burst pipes and disrupted food access were more severe for low-income and minority groups. These findings suggest implications for understanding the disparate impacts of extreme weather events on vulnerable populations; in particular, the findings could provide insights allowing infrastructure operators to enhance social equality considerations during managed service disruptions in such events. The results and findings demonstrate the value of community-scale big data sources for rapid impact assessment in the aftermath of extreme weather events.","Lee, Cheng-Chun; Maron, Mikel; Mostafavi, Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06046v3.pdf,483
298654,"Towards a resilient society - Technology 5.0, risks and ethics",2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Telephone-based assessment may be a valuable and cost-effective approach to improve monitoring and follow-up assessments in patients and research participants. Telephone-based assessment may be of particular value during times when it is important to reduce in-person contract, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent validity of the telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND for the assessment of manual ability in individuals with stroke. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, participants with stroke were invited to answer the ABILHAND questionnaire on 2 randomized occasions, face to face and by telephone, 5 to 7 days apart. The mean difference (MD) between the interviews was calculated (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) to investigate the concurrent validity. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and weighted &#954; coefficients were used to investigate the agreement between face-to-face and telephone-based administration. RESULTS: One hundred two participants (50 men; mean age = 65 years, SD = 13 years) were included. No significant differences were observed between the mean scores obtained with face-to-face and telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND (MD = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.60). Very high agreement was found between face-to-face and telephone-based administration (ICC = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) on the ABILHAND total scores. Most of the individual items had moderate or substantial &#954; agreement. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND is valid for the assessment of manual ability after stroke. Clinicians and researchers may use the ABILHAND for monitoring manual ability in persons with stroke and/or screening potential research participants.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A318).","Avelino, Patrick R; Menezes, Kênia K P; Nascimento, Lucas R; Tenório, Ruani A; Cândido, Gabriela N; Christovão, Isabela S; Teixeira-Salmela, Luci F",J Neurol Phys Ther,,483

Thus, we sought to determine the clinical roles of ACE2 (the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). TCGA, GEO and TIP datasets, and immunohistochemistry and western blot results were used to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological characteristics of ACE2. ACE2 expression was down-regulated in ccRCC tissues and cell lines. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results indicated that increased ACE2 expression was independent predictor of longer OS (HR: 0.8259, 95%CI: 0.7734-0.8819, P<0.0001) and RFS (HR: 0.8023, 95%CI: 0.7375-0.8729, P<0.0001) in ccRCC patients. Lower ACE2 expression was also associated with advanced tumor stage, higher histological grade and pathological stage, and metastasis. Besides, ACE2 expression was significantly positively and negatively correlated with CD4 Naïve infiltration and CD4 Memory infiltration, respectively. Moreover, higher CD4 Naïve and lower CD4 Memory infiltration levels were associated with better pathological features and longer OS and RFS. Furthermore, high ACE2 expression group in decreased CD4 Naïve, enriched CD4 Naïve and enriched CD4 memory cohort had favorable prognosis. These findings identified that AEC2 was significantly reduced in ccRCC, and decreased ACE2 was related to worse pathological features and poor prognosis. Low ACE2 expression in ccRCC may partially affect the prognosis due to altered immune cells infiltration levels.","Yang, Wuping; Li, Lei; Zhang, Kenan; Ma, Kaifang; Xie, Haibiao; Gong, Yanqing; Zhou, Jingcheng; Gong, Kan",Int J Biol Sci,,483

We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed with the targeted and controlled delivery of thrombolytic drugs or precision drug delivery. A porous and magnetic microbubble platform is developed to formulate tPA. This system can maintain the tPA activity during circulation, be magnetically guided to the thrombi, and then remotely activated for drug release. The ultrasound stimulation also improves the drug penetration into thrombi. In a mouse model of venous thrombosis, the residual thrombus decreased by 67.5% when compared to conventional injection of tPA. The penetration of tPA by ultrasound was up to several hundred micrometers in thrombi. This strategy not only improves the therapeutic efficacy but also accelerates the lytic rate, enabling it to be promising in time-critical thrombolytic therapy.","Wang, Siyu; Guo, Xixi; Xiu, Weijun; Liu, Yang; Ren, Lili; Xiao, Huaxin; Yang, Fang; Gao, Yu; Xu, Chenjie; Wang, Lianhui",Sci.

The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) in females is higher than in males. METHODS: We have retrospectively collected all female patients undergone to surgery for breast or thyroid cancer in 2010The aim of the study was to value the incidence of BC in patients with a personal history of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and conversely, the incidence of DTC in patients with previous BC within 5 years from the diagnosis of the first tumor in 2010. RESULTS: Among 76 BC patients, 11 were death and 22 didn't answer the phone call or refused to re-submit to thyroid ultrasound so they were excluded from the study and only 43 BC were further considered. Thyroid ultrasound was performed in 2010 and in 2016 and it described nodules in 13 (30%) patients in 2010 and in 21 (49%) patients in 2016. In 2010 no FNA was needed while in 2016 6 (14%) patients underwent to FNA with a benign response (Thyr 2). Among 61 DTC patients, 11 didn't answer the phone or the questions so 50 patients were included in the study. Breast cancer family history was reported in 14 (28%) patients and thyroid cancer family history in 8 (16%) patients. No relapse was reported during follow up.All patients underwent to mammography in 2015 or in 2016 within screening programs and no breast cancer were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: The female predominance of diseases of the thyroid and breast makes difficult the separation of an expected association with a casual linkageThe relationship between the co-occurrence of breast and thyroid cancer remains controversial and inconclusive.

Concurrently a 20% increase in sales of mandatory national angling licenses was reported in Denmark, suggesting an increase in angling participation. Here, we use data collected from a citizen science platform for recreational anglers to a) explore whether the increase in participation affected multiple characteristics of the anglers that registered to the citizen science platform in spring 2020, and b) explore changes in in angling effort and catch patterns during the lockdown as reported to the platform. The results indicate that the platform was able to detect a change in the characteristics of the participants in the Danish recreational angling during the Covid-19 lockdown, i.e. participants were younger, more likely to live in urban areas, less experienced, stated angling as a less important hobby, and less likely to be from outside of Denmark. The spring 2020 participants did not conduct more fishing trips compared to previous years, but their effort patterns differed i.e., a shift in fishing activity from weekend to weekday and, during the day, a shift in angling activity from midday to early evening. These changes most likely reflect the extraordinary conditions that most Danes experienced during the lockdown. We found relatively lower catch rates and a trend towards retaining more fish, among the participants that registered in spring 2020. The results are discussed in relation to biological implications and lessons learned about data collection from citizen science platforms.","Gundelund, Casper Skov Christian",Marine Policy,,483
306032,Emergence of and Learning Processes in a Civic Group Resuming Prescribed Burning in Norway,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of mobile apps to manage and promote health is becoming increasingly popular. Mobile apps are gaining popularity particularly in educational and interventional settings owing to their perceived advantages including support for and engagement of individuals with reading difficulties. In the context of COVID-19, the need for technology-based tools has increased. For practitioners and educators who wish to use apps in their practice or recommend apps to individuals with reading difficulties, it is challenging to identify high-quality apps in app stores. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a systematic search, selection, and appraisal process for tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills. This protocol aimed to (1) provide a systematic method for identifying tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills in the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store and (2) describe an evidence-based approach for quality appraisal of these apps by using structured tools. METHODS: This protocol describes an evidence-based method guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to systematically search, select, and appraise apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills, present in Google Play and the App Store. We intend to perform a systematic and comprehensive search and a 2-step process for screening: (1) broad screening (app titles) and (2) narrow screening (marketing descriptions). Quality appraisal of the included apps will involve two structured appraisal tools: (1) the Mobile Application Rating Scale and (2) the Appraising Apps for Reading Checklist. RESULTS: This method will help determine the number of apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness, present on the Android and iOS platforms. The content, quality, and usability of these apps will be determined using structured appraisal tools. We have planned to conduct searches on Google Play and the App Store in January-March 2021; broad and focused screening, from April 2021; and data extraction and quality appraisal in October 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides a basis for locating and evaluating apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills. This protocol will support practitioners, educators, and families to make informed decisions when purchasing apps for instructional use.

306293,SARS-CoV-2 and learning: The impact of a global pandemic on undergraduate learning experiences,2021,"Background: . Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has emerged as a pandemic by end-January 2020. Of the infected patients, 10%-15% may develop severe or critical illness. So far, no definite treatment is available for Covid-19. Cytokine release syndrome may underlie the pathogenesis of severe and critical disease. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 therapies are being tried to improve clinical outcomes. Methods: . We did a systematic review to identify the available literature on anti-IL-6 therapies in the treatment of Covid-19 and used the GRADE method to assess the quality of evidence. Results: . Four case series and 10 case reports were identified. On critical assessment, we found that these studies reported some beneficial effect of anti-IL-6 therapy, but all the studies had a high risk of bias. The pooled estimate showed that 42% of patients improved but with a very wide confidence interval (CI) (95% CI 1%-91%) and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 95%). The overall quality of evidence was graded as 'very low'. Conclusions: . Although promising, anti-IL-6 therapy for Covid-19 needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials to provide robust evidence.","Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar; Seth, Tulika; Madan, Karan; Nischal, Neeraj; Soneja, Manish; Sharma, Atul; Garg, Pramod; Prasad, Kameshwar",Natl Med J India,,483

306812,Digital tools to promote remote lesson study,2021,"Psoralen is the principal bioactive component in the dried fruits of Cullen corylifolium (L.) Medik (syn. Psoralea corylifolia L), termed “Buguzhi” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Recent studies have demonstrated that psoralen displays multiple bioactive properties, beneficial for the treatment of osteoporosis, tumors, viruses, bacteria, and inflammation. The present review focuses on the research evidence relating to the properties of psoralen gathered over recent years. Firstly, multiple studies have demonstrated that psoralen exerts strong anti-osteoporotic effects via regulation of osteoblast/osteoclast/chondrocyte differentiation or activation due to the participation in multiple molecular mechanisms of the wnt/β-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the Protein Kinase B(AKT)/activator protein-1 (AP-1) axis, and the expression of miR-488, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, the antitumor properties of psoralen are associated with the induction of ER stress-related cell death via enhancement of PERK: Pancreatic Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK)/activating transcription factor (ATF), 78kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and 94kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP94)/CHOP signaling, and inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or ATPase that overcomes multidrug resistance. Furthermore, multiple articles have shown that the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of psoralen are a result of its interaction with viral polymerase (Pol), destroying the formation of biofilm, and regulating the activation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), interleukin 4/5/6/8/12/13 (IL-4/5/6/8/12/13), GATA-3, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Finally, the toxic effects and mechanisms of action of psoralen have also been reviewed.","Ren, Yali; Song, Xiaominting; Tan, Lu; Guo, Chuanjie; Wang, Miao; Liu, Hui; Cao, Zhixing; Li, Yuzhi; Peng, Cheng",Front.

309231,Medical Tourism Markets: Models of Sustainability. The Case of Spain and The Costa del Sol (Malaga),2020,"Several related viral shell disorder (disorder of shell proteins of viruses) models were built using a disorder predictor via AI. The parent model detected the presence of high levels of disorder at the outer shell in viruses, for which vaccines are not available. Another model found correlations between inner shell disorder and viral virulence. A third model was able to positively correlate the levels of respiratory transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs). These models are linked together by the fact that they have uncovered two novel immune evading strategies employed by the various viruses. The first involve the use of highly disordered ""shape-shifting"" outer shell to prevent antibodies from binding tightly to the virus thus leading to vaccine failure. The second usually involves a more disordered inner shell that provides for more efficient binding in the rapid replication of viral particles before any host immune response. This ""Trojan horse"" immune evasion often backfires on the virus, when the viral load becomes too great at a vital organ, which leads to death of the host. Just as such virulence entails the viral load to exceed at a vital organ, a minimal viral load in the saliva/mucus is necessary for respiratory transmission to be feasible. As for the SARS-CoV-2, no high levels of disorder can be detected at the outer shell membrane (M) protein, but some evidence of correlation between virulence and inner shell (nucleocapsid, N) disorder has been observed. This suggests that not only the development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike HIV, HSV and HCV, is feasible but its attenuated vaccine strain can either be found in nature or generated by genetically modifying N.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Foster, James A; Uversky, Vladimir N",Pac Symp Biocomput,,483

Concurrent social media posts reflected a wider range of symptoms of COVID-19 besides these three symptoms. Because social media data have a potential application in the early identification novel virus symptoms, this study aimed to explore what symptoms mentioned in COVID-19-related social media posts during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We collected COVID-19-related Twitter tweets posted in English language between March 30, 2020 and April 19, 2020 using search terms of COVID-19 synonyms and three common COVID-19 symptoms suggested by the CDC in March. Only unique tweets were extracted for analysis of symptom terms. RESULTS: A total of 36 symptoms were extracted from 30,732 unique tweets. All the symptoms suggested by the CDC for COVID-19 screening in March, April, and May were mentioned in tweets posted during the early stages of the pandemic. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study revealed that many COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned in Twitter tweets earlier than the announcement by the CDC. Monitoring social media data is a promising approach to public health surveillance.","Guo, Jia-Wen; Radloff, Christina L; Wawrzynski, Sarah E; Cloyes, Kristin G",Public Health Nurs,,483

An empirical model for the description of the temperature dependentR2relaxation rate is proposed by taking into account the temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization. The temperature sensitivity of the MNP magnetization (Î·) and the temperature sensitivity of theR2relaxation rate (&#954;) are simulated with the proposed empirical models to investigate their dependence on the magnetic field and the particle size. Simulation results show the existence of optimal magnetic fieldsH&#959;Î·andH&#959;&#954;that maximize the temperature sensitivitiesÎ·and&#954;. Furthermore, simulations and experiments demonstrate that the optimal magnetic fieldH&#959;Î·(H&#959;&#954;) decreases with increasing the particle size. Experiments on temperature dependentR2relaxation rate are performed at different magnetic fields for MNP samples with different iron concentration. Experimental results show that the proposed MR thermometry using MNPs as temperature sensors allows a temperature estimation accuracy of about 0.05 °C. We believe that the achieved approach of highly accurate MR thermometry is of great interest and significance to biomedicine and biology.","Zhang, Yapeng; Guo, Silin; Zhang, Pu; Zhong, Jing; Liu, Wenzhong",,,483

Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.","Okuonghae, D.; Omame, A.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,483

Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 days. The studies showed that while Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 days, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection. The studies also demonstrated significant challenges to measuring Cr(VI) below 100 ng/L, as the results can be subject to positive bias or contamination that may not be readily apparent.

Within such a context, digital technology may provide a welcome source of alternative forms of connection and entertainment. Indeed, streaming services showed a remarkable increase in membership subscriptions throughout the period considered. However, excessive involvement in watching TV series has recently become a subject of scholarly concern as it may represent an emerging form of addictive behavior with the features of what has been labeled as ""binge-watching"" (i.e., watching multiple episodes of TV series in a single session). The current study aimed to assess TV series watching behaviors and related motivations, as well as their relationships with depression, stress and anxiety, in a sample of Italian adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, we aimed to explore which patterns of motivations and emotional states influenced either a high but healthy engagement in watching TV series, or promoted problematic and uncontrolled watching behavior under such circumstances. A total of 715 adults (M = 31.70, SD = 10.81;71.5% female) from all over Italy were recruited (from 1st to 30th April 2020) through advertisements via social media platforms of Italian university communities and other online groups. Two multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed with non-problematic and problematic TV series watching set as dependent variables. Results showed that people spent more time watching TV series during the pandemic lockdown, especially women who also reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than men. Moreover, both non-problematic (R &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.56;p &lt; 0.001) and problematic (R &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.33;p &lt; 0.001) TV series watching behaviors were equally induced by anxiety symptoms and escapism motivation, thereby suggesting that watching TV series during the COVID-19 lockdown probably served as a recovery strategy to face such a stressful situation. Finally, our findings also suggest that enrichment motives may protect from uncontrolled and potentially addictive watching behaviors. These findings, therefore, hold important implications, particularly for avoiding the over-pathologization of excessive involvement in online activities emerging as a result of specific distressing situations.","Boursier, V.; Musetti, A.; Gioia, F.; Flayelle, M.; Billieux, J.; Schimmenti, A.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,483

Review of the mechanistic entry, sexual transmission and viral impacts for patients during major recent viral outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV), and SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) (the virus which causes COVID-19) provides a framework to discuss this potential. AIM: Comparative analysis of prior viral presence on seminal fluid against current (preliminary) findings for SARS-CoV-2 to predict biological implications of the novel coronavirus upon current sexual transmissibility, viral presence, and reproductive health. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. ZIKV and EBOV were found to be present in semen and to be sexually transmitted, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to update their guidelines on prevention of the two viruses to include refraining from sexual contact. There are conflicting studies regarding the presence of SARS-CoV in male reproductive tissue, but it has been linked to testicular atrophy and orchitis. To date, two studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen, while seven studies have reported no positive detection. CONCLUSIONS: Though unlikely in the majority of cases, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be present in seminal fluid, although there are no reports of sexual transmission to date. Prior epidemics raise significant concerns regarding the long-term reproductive health capacity for patients who are affected by entry of Sars-CoV-2 into the reproductive tract, therefore more study is needed to clarify the impacts to reproductive health.","Pike, James Frederick W; Polley, Emily L; Pritchett, David Y; Lal, Arnav; Wynia, Blake A; Roudebush, William E; Chosed, Renee J",Reprod Health,,483

Methods: Data for everyone who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway by end of June 2020 (N = 8569) were linked at the individual level to hospitalization, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death measured to end of July 2020. Underlying comorbidity was proxied by hospital-based in- or outpatient treatment during the two months before the SARS-CoV-2 test. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess risk ratios (RRs). Results: Risk of hospitalization was particularly high for elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-12.7; comparison group aged below 50), Norwegian residents born in Asia, Africa or Latin-America (RR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-2.4; comparison group born in Norway), patients with underlying comorbidity (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.8) and men (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2-1.5). Men and residents born in Africa, Asia and Latin-America were also at higher risk of receiving ventilation treatment and dying, but the mortality risk was especially high for the elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 607.9; 95% CI 145.5-2540.1; comparison group aged below 50) and residents in nursing homes (RR 4.2; 95% CI 3.1-5.7). Conclusions: High age was the most important predictor of severe disease and death if infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nursing home residents were at particularly high risk of death.","Telle, Kjetil E; Grøsland, Mari; Helgeland, Jon; Håberg, Siri E",Scand J Public Health,,483

Our objective was to describe characteristics of a predominantly outpatient population tested for SARS-CoV-2 in an area receiving comprehensive testing. METHODS: We extracted data on demographic characteristics and clinical data for all patients (91% outpatient) tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March 10 through April 24, 2020. We manually extracted data on symptoms and exposures from a subset of patients, and we calculated the adjusted odds of receiving a positive test result by demographic characteristics and clinical risk factors. RESULTS: Of 17 662 people tested, 1006 (5.7%) received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. Hispanic/Latinx people were twice as likely as non-Hispanic White people to receive a positive test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.1), although the severity at presentation did not explain this discrepancy. Young people aged 0-19 years had the lowest rates of receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 (<4 cases per 10 000 population), and adults aged 70-79 and 40-49 had the highest rates of hospitalization per 100 000 population among people who received a positive test result (16 and 11, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We found disparities by race/ethnicity and age in access to testing and in receiving a positive test result among outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Further research and public health outreach on addressing racial/ethnic and age disparities will be needed to effectively combat the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United States.","Ahmed, Sharia M; Shah, Rashmee U; Fernandez, Valerie; Grineski, Sara; Brintz, Benjamin; Samore, Matthew H; Ferrari, Matthew J; Leung, Daniel T; Keegan, Lindsay T",Public Health Rep,,483
315871,The Determinants of Tourist Expenditure Per Capita in Thailand: Potential Implications for Sustainable Tourism,2021,"BACKGROUND: Oxygen therapy, using supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia), is routinely administered to patients who require respiratory support including mechanical ventilation (MV). However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in acute lung injury (ALI) and accumulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in the airways. We previously showed that airway HMGB1 mediates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a mouse model of ALI. Cholinergic signaling through the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#945;7nAChR) attenuates several inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether 3-(2,4 dimethoxy-benzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride, GTS-21, an &#945;7nAChR partial agonist, inhibits hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 accumulation in the airways and circulation, and consequently attenuates inflammatory lung injury. METHODS: Mice were exposed to hyperoxia (&#8805;99% O2) for 3 days and treated concurrently with GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) or the control vehicle, saline. RESULTS: The systemic administration of GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly decreased levels of HMGB1 in the airways and the serum. Moreover, GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury, as indicated by the decreased total protein content in the airways, reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils into the lung tissue and airways, and improved lung injury histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GTS-21 can attenuate hyperoxia-induced ALI by inhibiting extracellular HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses. This suggests that the &#945;7nAChR represents a potential pharmacological target for the treatment regimen of oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving oxygen therapy.","Sitapara, Ravikumar A; Gauthier, Alex G; Valdés-Ferrer, Sergio I; Lin, Mosi; Patel, Vivek; Wang, Mao; Martino, Ashley T; Perron, Jeanette C; Ashby, Charles R; Tracey, Kevin J; Pavlov, Valentin A; Mantell, Lin L",Mol Med,,483
315901,Levél a szerkesztoséghez,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the light of its rapid global spreading, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Interestingly, the global spreading of the disease is not uniform, but has so far left some countries relatively less affected. The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed. Here we discuss the plausibility of two of them: the universal vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ). Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse. Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence and severity.","Sharma, Abhibhav; Kumar Sharma, Saurabh; Shi, Yufang; Bucci, Enrico; Carafoli, Ernesto; Melino, Gerry; Bhattacherjee, Arnab; Das, Gobardhan",Cell Death Dis,,483
316228,Aerosol distribution in the cabin and cockpit of an ambulance helicopter,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Alarming rates of anxiety and burnout in pre-clinical health profession trainees are now challenged by additional COVID-19 stressors. This study explored COVID-related stressors among first-year medical, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and veterinary medical students. The authors examined associations between resilience, news monitoring, and COVID stress. METHODS: Students completed an online questionnaire that included the Brief Resilience Scale at their matriculation in August 2019. Survey results were linked to demographic information collected by all schools. A follow-up survey in May 2020 included original questions on COVID-19 stressors and news monitoring. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Across schools, 74% (266/360) provided consent for the 2019 survey, and 76% (201/264) responded to COVID-19 questions in the follow-up 2020 survey. Students were ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about family members getting infected (n = 71, 76% School of Medicine (SOM);n = 31, 76% School of Nursing (SON);n = 50, 75% School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM)) and curriculum schedule changes (n = 72, 78%, SOM;n = 28, 68% SON;n = 52, 79% SVM). Greater frequency of COVID news monitoring was associated with greater COVID-related stress (p = 0.02). Higher resilience at matriculation was associated with lower COVID-related stress ten months later (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Amid COVID-19 uncertainty, health science schools should address the immense student stress regarding curriculum disruptions. The results of this study underscore the powerful role of resilience in protecting against stress not only during the known academic rigor of health professions training but also during unprecedented crises.","Yu, A.; Wilkes, M.; Iosif, A.

Vastly different results can be obtained amongst observers which can greatly affect the resulting joint kinematics. The aim of this study is to introduce an objective method for calculating functional CS definitions for bones in joints that observe three-cylindrical-joint kinematic chain decomposition methods and to apply the method on tibiofemoral joint specimens. This method is driven by low resistance joint motion during loading profiles and not from anatomical landmark selection. Two anatomical CS definitions were established from points collected by five observers, for twelve knees. The knees underwent passive flexion and internal/external rotation using the anatomical CSs. The kinematics from these profiles were used in linear least squares minimization of off-axis motions to redefine the tibia and femur origins, the femur flexion axis and the tibia internal rotation axis. Significant improvements in reproducibility of 7.4 mm (tibia origin, p < 0.001), 3.4 mm (femur origin, p < 0.001), and 2.9° (femur FE-axis, p < 0.001) between the two functional CSs compared to the two anatomical CSs were observed. Functional CSs led to significant decreases in off-axis motion during discrete passive flexion profiles. This new strategy for establishing functional CSs provides an objective approach that will reduce the effects of observer error in establishing CSs. Additionally, functional CSs allow for better interpretations of kinematic responses due to loading because effects of kinematic cross-talk is minimized.","Nagle, Tara F; Erdemir, Ahmet; Colbrunn, Robb W",J Biomech,,483

318196,Guest Editorial,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose an unprecedented threat and challenge to public health around the world. Lacking sufficient human resources, nurses are required to undertake an increased workload at the clinical frontline of this epidemic. Additionally, nurses are at a high risk due to their working within close proximity to COVID-19 patients. As a result, they experience increased job stress. Objective: To explore the current situation and influencing factors of job stress among clinical first-line nurses fighting COVID-19. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey with 110 nurses who were on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic in a hospital in Wuhan. Results: The job stress scores of clinical nurses on the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic were collected (91.42 ± 26.09); the dimensions of work environment and resources as well as workload and time pressure were ranked first and second, respectively. The results of a multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that working hours per day, service years, number of night shifts per week, and level of academic qualification were the main factors affecting the job stress levels of nursing staff. Conclusions: The job stress of nurses on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic was found to be at a medium level. Nursing leaders and hospital managers should pay attention to the impact of job stress on frontline nurses, while taking positive and effective measures aimed at eliminating the source of nursing work pressures to stabilize their nursing teams and promote their work in the fight against this epidemic.","Zhan, Yufang; Ma, Shuang; Jian, Xiangdong; Cao, Yingjuan; Zhan, Xiangqiao",Front Public Health,,483
318365,Social Distancing in Robot Swarms: Modulating Exploitation and Exploration Without Signal Exchange,2020,"Importance: The current rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection justifies the global effort to identify effective preventive strategies and optimal medical management. While data are available for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), limited reports have analyzed pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To evaluate currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence Review: An extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, by combining the terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Retrospective cross-sectional and case-control studies, case series and case reports, bulletins, and national reports about the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The risk of bias for eligible observational studies was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. Findings: A total of 815 articles were identified. Eighteen studies with 1065 participants (444 patients were younger than 10 years, and 553 were aged 10 to 19 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. All articles reflected research performed in China, except for 1 clinical case in Singapore. Children at any age were mostly reported to have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or were asymptomatic. Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features, and these findings were also reported in asymptomatic patients. Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant. No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years. Available data about therapies were limited. Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Castagnoli, Riccardo; Votto, Martina; Licari, Amelia; Brambilla, Ilaria; Bruno, Raffaele; Perlini, Stefano; Rovida, Francesca; Baldanti, Fausto; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",JAMA pediatr.

324019,Monitoring Social-distance in Wide Areas during Pandemics: a Density Map and Segmentation Approach,2021-04-07,"The Covid-19 pandemic emerged and evolved so quickly that societies were not able to respond quickly enough, mainly due to the nature of the Covid-19 virus' rate of spread and also the largely open societies that we live in. While we have been willingly moving towards open societies and reducing movement barriers, there is a need to be prepared for minimizing the openness of society on occasions such as large pandemics, which are low probability events with massive impacts. Certainly, similar to many phenomena, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us its own geography presenting its emergence and evolving patterns as well as taking advantage of our geographical settings for escalating its spread. Hence, this study aims at presenting a data-driven approach for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of the pandemic over a regional scale, i.e., Europe and a country scale, i.e., Denmark, and also what geographical variables potentially contribute to expediting its spread. We used official regional infection rates, points of interest, temperature and air pollution data for monitoring the pandemic's spread across Europe and also applied geospatial methods such as spatial autocorrelation and space-time autocorrelation to extract relevant indicators that could explain the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, we applied statistical methods, e.g., ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, as well as machine learning methods, e.g., random forest for exploring the potential correlation between the chosen underlying factors and the pandemic spread. Our findings indicate that population density, amenities such as cafes and bars, and pollution levels are the most influential explanatory variables while pollution levels can be explicitly used to monitor lockdown measures and infection rates at country level. The choice of data and methods used in this study along with the achieved results and presented discussions can empower health authorities and decision makers with an interactive decision support tool, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protectives measures using historical data.","Hass, Frederik Seeup; Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,483

The significance of basic reproductive number (R0), growth rate (Gr) and doubling time (Td) of COVID-19 with HI and UVI was determined. RESULTS: Both indices show a significant positive correlation (at 5% significance level) to R0, Td and Gr of COVID-19 patients. Our results showed that the minimum threshold temperature of 33°C for HI (with a positive variation of 3 to 5°C) put a significant impact on new cases.

328179,Using a DEA–AutoML approach to track SDG achievements,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic uniquely represents an unprecedented health crisis that has permeated all aspects of human society. Given the technological affordances of social media to disseminate fact-based as well as purposefully misinformed and/or conspiratorial information, this paper examines the serious and strategic messaging on Instagram posts tagged with #civilwar2. Results from a critical discourse analysis show that within modern American conspiratorial thinking and given the problematic politicization of COVID-19, healthy scepticism is replaced with conspiracy absent of theory. When extreme political and socio-cultural polarization occurs, this tendency is exacerbated by the bifurcation of meaning as expressed by those who seek to promote a particular angle of a given story or event. While this may be somewhat common in so-called old media, online in discursive spaces such as Instagram, the challenge to understand the mediated message is compounded by visual referents, which are often remixed to include adjunct information, such as mashups, hashtags, inserted text, or images, etc. Results include the identification of two main categories of Instagram memes tagged with #civilwar2. These categories are analysed following three primary characteristics of discourse: genre, discourse/representation, and style.","Wiggins, Bradley E.",Social Semiotics,,483

Generally, COVID-19 has three possible transmission routes, including pre-symptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, among which the last one has brought a severe challenge for the containment of the disease. One core scientific question is to understand the influence of asymptomatic individuals and of the strength of control measures on the evolution of the disease, particularly on a second outbreak of the disease. To explore these issues, we proposed a novel compartmental model that takes the infection of asymptomatic individuals into account. We get the relationship between asymptomatic individuals and critical strength of control measures theoretically. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of our model and the accuracy of the theoretical analysis by using the real confirmed cases of COVID-19 contamination. Our results, showing the importance of the asymptomatic population on the control measures, would provide useful theoretical reference to the policymakers and fuel future studies of COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaochen; Wang, Shengfeng; Lan, Yueheng; Tao, Xiaofeng; Xiao, Jinghua",Nonlinear Dyn,,483

331207,Open educational resources in Canada 2020,2020,"The precise mechanisms by which Covid-19 infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. The spike glycoprotein binds to respiratory epithelium through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which endogenously interacts with Angiotensin (Ang) II to yield Angiotensin 1-7. Stimulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by Ang II leads to increased mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE), respectively. Total sulfated GAGs, increased sulfotransferase activity, and increased expression of the proteoglycans biglycan, syndecan-1, perlecan, and versican followed treatment by Ang II. Candesartan, an Angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb), largely, but incompletely, inhibited these increases, and the differences from baseline remained significant. These results suggest that another effect of Ang II also contributes to the increased expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases, total sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans. We hypothesize that activation of ACE2 may contribute to these increases and suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with ACE2 may also increase chondroitin sulfotransferases, sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans and thereby contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to respiratory compromise in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tobacman, Joanne Bhattacharyya Sumit Kotlo Kumar",The FASEB Journal,,483

332039,Instantaneous contact tracing,2020,"Objective: Internalizing and externalizing problems are prevalent in disaster-exposed children but few studies have investigated these problems in relation to parental factors. This study examined how parental worry and family-based disaster education related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method: Parents reported parental worry, family-based disaster education and their children's (5-8-year-old young elementary schoolchildren [n = 245] and 245 9-13-year-old early adolescents [n = 245]) internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Data analysis showed that (a) across ages, parental worry related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems significantly and positively; (b) the significant and negative relationships between family-based disaster education and internalizing and externalizing problems were only supported in young elementary schoolchildren; and (c) high level of parent worry attenuated the negative link between family-based disaster education and young elementary schoolchildren's internalizing problems. Conclusion: This study expands our knowledge about relationships between parental worry and children's disaster-related well-being, and highlights the importance of adapting family-based disaster education to different ages. Data suggest that parents of young elementary schoolchildren and early adolescents both should avoid showing excessive worry in front of their children during the pandemic to help reduce their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Effective family-based disaster education can mitigate young elementary schoolchildren's emotional distress and behavioral problems, the effect of which may be maximized if parents can avoid being overly worried. Parents of early adolescents should support their children in acquiring pandemic-related information independently and encourage them to seek support outside the family.

333272,Effect of wearing face masks on the carbon dioxide concentration in the breathing zone,2021,"BACKGROUND: After two months of implementing a partial lockdown, the Indonesian government had announced the ""New Normal"" policy to prevent a further economic crash in the country. This policy received many critics, as Indonesia still experiencing a fluctuated number of infected cases. Understanding public perception through effective risk communication can assist the government in relaying an appropriate message to improve people's compliance and to avoid further disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study observed how risk communication using social media platforms like Twitter could be adopted to measure public attention on COVID-19 related issues ""New Normal"". METHOD: From May 21 to June 18, 2020, we archived all tweets related to COVID-19 containing keywords: ""#NewNormal"", and ""New Normal"" using Drone Emprit Academy (DEA) engine. DEA search API collected all requested tweets and described the cumulative tweets for trend analysis, word segmentation, and word frequency. We further analyzed the public perception using sentiment analysis and identified the predominant tweets using emotion analysis. RESULT: We collected 284,216 tweets from 137,057 active users. From the trend analysis, we observed three stages of the changing trend of the public's attention on the ""New Normal"". Results from the sentiment analysis indicate that more than half of the population (52%) had a ""positive"" sentiment towards the ""New Normal"" issues while only 41% of them had a ""negative"" perception. Our study also demonstrated the public's sentiment trend has gradually shifted from ""negative"" to ""positive"" due to the influence of both the government actions and the spread of the disease. A more detailed analysis of the emotion analysis showed that the majority of the public emotions (77.6%) relied on the emotion of ""trust"", ""anticipation"", and ""joy"". Meanwhile, people were also surprised (8.62%) that the Indonesian government progressed to the ""New Normal"" concept despite a fluctuating number of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer an opportunity for the government to use Twitter in the process of quick decision-making and policy evaluation during uncertain times in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rahmanti, Annisa Ristya; Ningrum, Dina Nur Anggraini; Lazuardi, Lutfan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,483

The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients.

However, how ambient temperature may influence the transmissibility of COVID-19 remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We explore the association between ambient temperature and transmissibility of COVID-19 in different regions across China. METHODS: The surveillance data on COVID-19 and meteorological factors were collected from 28 provincial level regions in China, and estimated the instantaneous reproductive number (Rt). The generalized additive model was used to assess the relationship between mean temperature and Rt. RESULTS: There were 12,745 COVID-19 cases collected in the study areas. We report the associated effect of temperature on Rt is likely to be negative but not of statistical significance, which holds for most Chinese regions. CONCLUSIONS: We found little statistical evidence for that the higher temperature may reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19. Since intensive control measures against the COVID-19 epidemics were implemented in China, we acknowledge this may impact the underlying effect size estimation, and thus cautiousness should be taken when interpreting our findings.","Wang, Qingan; Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Yajuan; Qiu, Jiangwei; Li, Juan; Yan, Ni; Li, Nan; Zhang, Jiaxing; Tian, Di; Sha, Xiaolan; Jing, Jinyun; Yang, Chan; Wang, Kairong; Xu, Rongbin; Zhang, Yuhong; Yang, Huifang; Zhao, Shi; Zhao, Yi",Environ Res,,483

The emergence of resistance to those antibiotics, mainly due to the production of bacterial enzymes called β-lactamases, has been partially solved by the introduction of β-lactamase inhibitors, which restore the activity of otherwise obsolete molecules. This solution is limited because currently available β-lactamase inhibitors only work against serine β-lactamases, whereas metallo-β-lactamases continue to spread, evolve, and confer resistance to all β-lactams, including carbapenems. Furthermore, the increased use of antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial pneumonia in severely sick patients with COVID-19 might exacerbate the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In this Personal View, we summarise the main advances accomplished in this area of research, emphasise the main challenges that need to be solved, and the importance of research on inhibitors for metallo-B-lactamases amidst the current pandemic.","Mojica, Maria F.; Rossi, Maria-Agustina Vila Alejandro J.; Bonomo, Robert A.",The Lancet Infectious Diseases,,483

342287,Looking Beyond the Rainy Days of April,2021,"Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) result from viral or bacterial pathogens that infect the upper airways.1 URTIs comprise a range of conditions and symptoms such as cough, sore throat, acute otitis media (AOM), pharyngitis, tonsillitis, rhinitis, common cold, influenza, and sinusitis.1 While serious complications are rare, patients can develop pneumonia and associated adverse sequelae.1 A substantial proportion of health care visits to primary care and other family medicine settings are due to suspected URTIs.2 Most URTIs are viral in origin, meaning they are unlikely to benefit from antibiotics and can often be effectively managed remotely with supportive treatments. Despite this knowledge, antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed.3 , 4 A descriptive analysis in Ontario estimated unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in primary care at rates of 48.4% for acute sinusitis and 52.6% for acute bronchitis.5 Further, more than 80% of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions were attributed to respiratory tract conditions and infections.5 Overprescribing contributes to excessive use, unwanted side effects (e.g., allergic reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms, emergency department visits),6 and antibiotic resistance.7 Antibiotic resistance is a global public health threat and its reduction is a priority.8 Initiatives such as Choosing Wisely aim to reduce antibiotic overuse and advise against using antibiotics for URTIs that are viral in origin.7 However, while the risks of inappropriate and overuse are established, antibiotic prescribing is challenging and providers must balance the pressure of diagnostic uncertainty, time constraints, and patient expectations and preferences against the undesirable consequences of overprescribing.8 Thus, there is interest in management approaches that aid decision-making and reduce excessive prescribing and use. Various interventions are available that address inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and the pressures of providing in-person care for patients with URTIs. These include delayed (post-dated) antibiotic prescriptions9 and different interventions to guide the use of antibiotics (e.g., clinical decision support tools, rapid point-of-care testing [POCT], viral prescription pads). 10 The desired outcome is to reduce the overprescribing of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and potentially to improve clinical outcomes (e.g., reduce harms from antibiotics) and reduce health care utilization such as hospital and emergency department visits. Changes to health care service delivery and organization due to the COVID-19 pandemic mean providers in primary care face difficulty in caring for patients with URTIs.7 Practical guidance and interventions continue to be required to assist clinicians in making care decisions for patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Resources such as the Using Antibiotics Wisely campaign's updated The Cold Standard toolkit provide resources for clinicians to support virtual and in-person management.11 However, there continues to be an interest and need for evaluating contemporary evidence to identify which interventions might be most effective for supporting shared decision-making and optimizing the care of people with URTIs. This report aims to summarize the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of delayed antibiotic prescription-filling interventions and other family medicine interventions to influence the use of antibiotics for suspected acute URTIs.","Thompson, W.; McCormack, S.",Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.

In the Netherlands, the national screening programs, including for breast cancer, were halted temporarily. This posed a challenge to breast cancer care, because â¼40% of cases are detected through national screening. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with breast cancer in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of COVID-19 on patients with breast cancer who had undergone surgery from March 9 to May 17, 2020. The primary endpoints were the number of surgical procedures performed during the study period, tumor characteristics, surgery type, and route of referral. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 217 consecutive patients with breast cancer requiring surgery were included. We found an overall decrease in the number of patients with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. The most significant decline was seen in surgery for T1-T2 and N0 tumors. A decline in the number of referrals from both the national screening program and general practitioners was observed. The incidence of postoperative complications remained stable during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The temporary halt of the national screening program for breast cancer resulted in fewer surgical procedures during the study period and a pronounced decrease in surgery of the lower tumor stages.","Filipe, Mando D; van Deukeren, Désirée; Kip, Marijn; Doeksen, Annemiek; Pronk, Apollo; Verheijen, Paul M; Heikens, Joost T; Witkamp, Arjen J; Richir, Milan C",,,483
343396,The Open Innovation in Science research field: a collaborative conceptualisation approach,2020,"Spontaneous abscesses involving the rotator cuff muscles are a rare surgical occurrence. Patients with such abscesses are often initially misdiagnosed or there is a significant diagnostic delay. Herein, we report one case of a spontaneous intramuscular abscess involving the subscapularis muscle and a second case of an abscess involving the supraspinatus muscle. There is a multitude of predisposing risk factors to developing an intramuscular abscess formation, which includes immunodeficiency, trauma, injection drug use, concurrent infection, and malnutrition. The most significant risk factor in our cases was poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Poorly controlled diabetes is known to cause impaired clearance of pathogens, predisposing patients to abscess formation. Both patients also delayed presenting to the hospital due to concerns surrounding the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We describe the use of a deltoid-pectoral approach to access the subscapular abscess allowing surgical drainage. The supraspinatus abscess was drained by direct incision. We advocate utilising common and familiar approaches with or without arthroscopy where possible. These cases highlight the importance of early imaging in patients presenting with the physiological signs of infection and idiopathic shoulder pain.","East, Jamie; Piper, Danielle; Chan, Sam",Cureus,,483

345742,Reducing the psychological burden of isolated oncological patients by means of decision trees,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection, is strongly associated with various coagulopathies that may result in either bleeding and thrombocytopenia or hypercoagulation and thrombosis. Thrombotic and bleeding or thrombotic pathologies are significant accompaniments to acute respiratory syndrome and lung complications in COVID-19. Thrombotic events and bleeding often occur in subjects with weak constitutions, multiple risk factors and comorbidities. Of particular interest are the various circulating inflammatory coagulation biomarkers involved directly in clotting, with specific focus on fibrin(ogen), D-dimer, P-selectin and von Willebrand Factor (VWF). Central to the activity of these biomarkers are their receptors and signalling pathways on endothelial cells, platelets and erythrocytes. In this review, we discuss vascular implications of COVID-19 and relate this to circulating biomarker, endothelial, erythrocyte and platelet dysfunction. During the progression of the disease, these markers may either be within healthy levels, upregulated or eventually depleted. Most significant is that patients need to be treated early in the disease progression, when high levels of VWF, P-selectin and fibrinogen are present, with normal or slightly increased levels of D-dimer (however, D-dimer levels will rapidly increase as the disease progresses). Progression to VWF and fibrinogen depletion with high D-dimer levels and even higher P-selectin levels, followed by the cytokine storm, will be indicative of a poor prognosis. We conclude by looking at point-of-care devices and methodologies in COVID-19 management and suggest that a personalized medicine approach should be considered in the treatment of patients.","Grobler, Corlia; Maphumulo, Siphosethu C; Grobbelaar, L Mireille; Bredenkamp, Jhade C; Laubscher, Gert J; Lourens, Petrus J; Steenkamp, Janami; Kell, Douglas B; Pretorius, Etheresia",,,483

345812,Mining Hidden Topics from Newspaper Quotations: The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic affects the processes of routine care for chronic patients. A better understanding helps to increase resilience of the health system and prepare adequately for next waves of the pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in 16 primary care practices: 6 solo working, 4 monodisciplinary and 7 multidisciplinary. Twenty-one people (doctors, nurses, dieticians) were interviewed, using semi-structured video interviews. A thematic analysis was done using the domains of the Chronic Care Model (CCM). RESULTS: Three themes emerged: changes in health care organization, risk stratification and self-management support. All participating practices reported drastic changes in organization with a collective shift towards COVID-19 care, and reduction of chronic care activities, less consultations, and staff responsible for self-management support put on hold. A transition to digital support did not occur. Few practitioners had a systematic approach to identify and contact high-risk patients for early follow-up. A practice with a pre-established structured team collaboration managed to continue most chronic care elements. Generally, practitioners expected no effects of the temporary disruption for patients, although they expressed concern about patients already poorly regulated. CONCLUSION: Our findings show a disruption of the delivery of chronic care in the Belgium prim care context. In such contexts, the establishment of the CCM can facilitate continuity of care in crisis times. Short term actions should be directed to facilitate identifying high-risk patients and to develop a practice organization plan to organize chronic care and use digital channels for support, especially to vulnerable patients, during next waves of the epidemic.","Danhieux, Katrien; Buffel, Veerle; Pairon, Anthony; Benkheil, Asma; Remmen, Roy; Wouters, Edwin; van Olmen, Josefien",BMC Fam Pract,,483

A limitation, however, is that it requires a hundred million cells per experiment, which hampers its broad application in biomedical research, particularly in studies in which it is impractical to obtain a large number of cells from rare samples. To reduce the required input cell number while retaining high data quality, we developed an in situ ChIA-PET protocol, which requires as few as 1 million cells. Here, we describe detailed step-by-step procedures for performing in situ ChIA-PET from cultured cells, including both an experimental protocol for sample preparation and data generation and a computational protocol for data processing and visualization using the ChIA-PIPE pipeline. As the protocol significantly simplifies the experimental procedure, reduces ligation noise, and decreases the required input of cells compared to previous versions of ChIA-PET protocols, it can be applied to generate high-resolution chromatin contact maps mediated by various protein factors for a wide range of human and mouse primary cells. © 2021 The Authors.

We performed a cross-sectional survey to investigate the psychological status and self-efficacy of nurses in public hospital during COVID-19 outbreak between 16th and 25th February 2020. A total of 223 nurses participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 40.8% (CI 95%: 34.4%-47.2%) and 26.4% (CI 95%: 20.6%-42.2%), respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among demographic variables. There was significant differences in the prevalence of depression symptoms according to professional titles (P = .020). The mean score of self-efficacy was 25.90 ± 7.55. The self-efficacy was negatively correlated with anxiety (r = -0.161, P < .05). The psychological status of nurses in public hospital during COVID-19 outbreak needs our attention. Improving nurses' self-efficacy in dealing with emerging infectious diseases may be helpful to their psychology.","Xiong, Huan; Yi, Shuanglian; Lin, Yufen",Inquiry,,483

The results of this study parallel many of the headlines in the popular press at the time. We found that about three-quarters of respondents were simply buying the food they could get due to out of stock situations and about half the participants bought more food than usual. As a result of foodservice closures, consumers indicated purchasing more groceries than normal. Consumers attempted to avoid shopping in stores, relying heavily on grocery delivery and pick-up services during the beginning of the pandemic when no clear rules were in place. Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe. Food consumption patterns for major food groups seemed to stay the same for the majority of participants, but a large share indicated that they had been snacking more since the beginning of the pandemic which was offset by a sharp decline in fast food consumption.","Chenarides, Lauren; Grebitus, Carola; Lusk, Jayson L; Printezis, Iryna",,,483

We present promising data from in silico docking studies of new Methisazone compounds (modified with calcium, Ca; iron, Fe; magnesium, Mg; manganese, Mn; or zinc, Zn) designed to bind more strongly to key proteins involved in replication of SARS-CoV-2. In this in silico molecular docking study, we investigated the inhibiting role of Methisazone and the modified drugs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins: ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, papain-like protease (PlPr), and main protease (MPro). We found that the highest binding interactions were found with the spike protein (6VYB), with the highest overall binding being observed with Mn-bound Methisazone at -8.3 kcal/mol, followed by Zn and Ca at -8.0 kcal/mol, and Fe and Mg at -7.9 kcal/mol. We also found that the metal-modified Methisazone had higher affinity for PlPr and MPro. In addition, we identified multiple binding pockets that could be singly or multiply occupied on all proteins tested. The best binding energy was with Mn-Methisazone versus spike protein, and the largest cumulative increases in binding energies were found with PlPr. We suggest that further studies are warranted to identify whether these compounds may be effective for treatment and/or prophylaxis.","Abdelaal Ahmed Mahmoud M Alkhatip, Ahmed; Georgakis, Michail; Montero Valenzuela, Lucio R; Hamza, Mohamed; Farag, Ehab; Hodgkinson, Jaqui; Hosny, Hisham; Kamal, Ahmed M; Wagih, Mohamed; Naguib, Amr; Yassin, Hany; Algameel, Haytham; Elayashy, Mohamed; Abdelhaq, Mohamed; Younis, Mohamed I; Mohamed, Hassan; Abdulshafi, Mohammed; Elramely, Mohamed A",Int. j. mol. sci.

It is composed of 3 different subdimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). In the last years, interest in BS in the neurosurgical community has increased. Here we investigated burnout among neurosurgeons and residents in neurosurgery. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. A search of bibliographic databases was conducted from study inception to February 2020. A total of 16,377 studies were found. Six articles were included in our final analysis. Their references were checked for additional studies, but none were found. RESULTS: From the initial 16,377 studies identified, only 6 met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 3310 physicians. The general prevalence of BS was 48%. The prevalence in neurosurgeons was 51.1%, higher than that recorded in neurosurgical residents (45.4%). Regarding subdimensions, personal accomplishment seemed to be the most influential factor for burnout development among neurosurgeons (42.57%) and residents (51.56%) alike. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery is a rewarding career choice, but numerous challenges and stressors can lead to lower levels of satisfaction and dangerously increased levels of burnout. We hope that our results will generate discussion, raise awareness, stimulate further studies, and lead to programs designed to mitigate excessive stress and burnout in neurosurgeons.","Zaed, Ismail; Jaaiddane, Youssef; Chibbaro, Salvatore; Tinterri, Benedetta",World neurosurgery (Online),,483

Age- and gender-based characterizations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with regard tohigher fatality rates in males, and in the older population with comorbidities. The invasion-mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, involves binding of its spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors; MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), whereas H1N1 influenza is equipped with hemagglutinin protein.

Although no effective commercial vaccine is available for any of the viruses, those against SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at an unprecedented speed. Until now, only Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine has received temporary authorization from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Given the frequent emergence of viral pandemics in the 21st century, proper understanding of their characteristics and modes of action are essential to address the immediate and long-term health consequences.","Roychoudhury, Shubhadeep; Das, Anandan; Sengupta, Pallav; Dutta, Sulagna; Roychoudhury, Shatabhisha; Choudhury, Arun Paul; Ahmed, A B Fuzayel; Bhattacharjee, Saumendra; Slama, Petr",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,483

357387,Guest editorial,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to explore the impact of elective-surgery deferment on the United States health-care system and subsequent recovery after COVID-19 containment. Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment. CONCLUSIONS: The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system. As part of disaster mitigation, it is critical to start planning for recovery now.","Jain, Amit; Jain, Punya; Aggarwal, Shruti",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,483
357466,Covid-19 Pandemic: A New Era of Cyber Security Threat and Holistic Approach to Overcome,2020,"Wild-type cells of Candida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen, are able to grow at very low micromolar concentrations of potassium in the external milieu. One of the reasons behind that behaviour is the existence of three different types of K+ transporters in their plasma membrane: Trk1, Acu1 and Hak1. This work shows that the transporters are very differently regulated at the transcriptional level upon exposure to saline stress, pH alterations or K+ starvation. We propose that different transporters take the lead in the diverse environmental conditions, Trk1 being the ""house-keeping"" one, and Acu1/Hak1 dominating upon K+ limiting conditions. Heterologous expression of the genes coding for the three transporters in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking its endogenous potassium transporters showed that all of them mediated cation transport but with very different efficiencies. Moreover, expression of the transporters in S. cerevisiae also affected other physiological characteristics such as sodium and lithium tolerance, membrane potential or intracellular pH, being, in general, CaTrk1 the most effective in keeping these parameters close to the usual wild-type physiological levels.","Ruiz-Castilla, Francisco J; Bieber, Jan; Caro, Gabriel; Michán, Carmen; Sychrova, Hana; Ramos, José",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,,483

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non-mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. METHODS: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ""economic stress,"" ""isolation,"" and ""home,"" while others such as ""motion"" significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (&#961;=-0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged. CONCLUSIONS: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.","Low, Daniel M; Rumker, Laurie; Talkar, Tanya; Torous, John; Cecchi, Guillermo; Ghosh, Satrajit S",J Med Internet Res,,483

361605,Lessons from covid-19 and seoul: Effects of reduced human activity from social distancing on urban co2 concentration and air quality,2021,"The purpose of the article is to analyse the trends of labour migration from Ukraine under the global economic crisis caused by COVID-19. The subject of the research is international labour migration in Ukraine. The study should predict the consequences of the coronavirus crisis for labour migration and place of Ukraine in the world labour market in the nearest future. Methodological basis of the research comprised the list of theoretical and empirical methods of research;there was provided the analysis of recent research publications subject under the discussion, compared the results obtaining with statistical data, suggested the practical recommendations that were received on the base of survey results. Researches in a number of OECD countries have found that the risk of infection among migrants is at least two times higher as among locals. The number of international migrants is declined in 2020 for the first time in recent history, as the number of new migrants slows down and re-emigration rates substantially increased. Ukraine has the highest rates of permanent immigrants among European countries. In 2019, there was among approximately 5 million people of foreign origin in Ukraine, the largest migration groups were from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Uzbekistan. At the same time, Ukraine ranked 8th in the world and 2nd in Europe for emigration in 2019. Ukraine was the largest country of origin of refugees in Europe amounted to 93 thousand people at the end of 2018. In 2019, as in previous decades, the largest migration corridors in Europe were in Ukraine, including the Russia-Ukraine and Ukraine-Russia corridors, which held the first positions in the volume of migration in this part of the world. The military conflict in the East of Ukraine has strengthened the current trend towards reorienting of Ukrainian migration to the West. The employment structure of Ukrainian labour migrants is mostly inefficient, as only 26.8% of Ukrainian workers are employed abroad according to the qualifications obtained. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected virtually all spheres of public life;it has affected emigration from Ukraine, a crucial factor of which has been the introduction of lockdown in key host countries of Ukrainian labour migration, in particular, in the EU. However, the existence of an unconditional demand for Ukrainian workers in the labour-importer countries has led to the solution of problems with access of workers in an ad hoc manner in the first half of 2020, in particular, through the organization of workers transportation from Ukraine for seasonal work. The results of the study have shown that despite the fact that the structure of permanent migration from Ukraine is dominated by migration to the Russian Federation, trends in long-term and especially in temporary labour migration since 2014 and until now, clearly indicate a change in the vector of labour movement towards the EU. Labour emigration is not able to solve the problem of Ukraine's economic development;it just solves the task of maintaining the welfare of the migrant families and provides the opportunities to develop the human capital of migrant children, primarily through funding by means of migration capital their education in Ukraine. Analysis of the current global and national economic situation, regulatory measures, both in Ukraine and in the countries of migration destination, which directly or indirectly affect migration flows, indicates that in the medium term we cannot predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly affect large-scale labour migration.","Shnyrkov, O.; Mazurenko, V.; Stakanov, R.",Baltic Journal of Economic Studies,,483

Its quality strongly depends on the choice of known data. Optimising their spatial location -- the inpainting mask -- is challenging. A commonly used tool for this task are stochastic optimisation strategies. However, they are slow as they compute multiple inpainting results. We provide a remedy in terms of a learned mask generation model. By emulating the complete inpainting pipeline with two networks for mask generation and neural surrogate inpainting, we obtain a model for highly efficient adaptive mask generation. Experiments indicate that our model can achieve competitive quality with an acceleration by as much as four orders of magnitude. Our findings serve as a basis for making diffusion-based inpainting more attractive for various applications such as image compression, where fast encoding is highly desirable.","Alt, Tobias; Peter, Pascal; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02636v1.pdf,483

364627,COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hospital emergency departments play a crucial role in the initial assessment and management of suspected COVID-19 infection. This needs to be guided by studies of people presenting with suspected COVID-19, including those admitted and discharged, and those who do not ultimately have COVID-19 confirmed. We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Mean age was 58.4 years, 11200 (50.4%) were female and 11034 (49.6%) male. Adults (age >16 years) were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score of 4), frequently had limited performance status (46.9%) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.5%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Similar numbers of men and women presented to the ED, but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.2% v 13.0%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to have impaired performance status (43.1%, 26.8% and 51.6%), be admitted to hospital (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.6%, 11.2%, 16.4%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 had similar age, performance status and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.1% v 15.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist between patient groups presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19. Adults and children differ markedly and require different approaches to emergency triage. Admission and adverse outcome rates among adults suggest that policies to avoid unnecessary ED attendance achieved their aim.

365607,Coronavirus in Spain: Fear of ‘Official’ fake news boosts WhatsApp and alternative sources,2020,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to determine whether severe COVID-19 patients harbour a higher risk of ICU-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective multicentre cohort study comprised all consecutive patients admitted to seven ICUs for severe COVID-19 pneumonia during the first COVID-19 surge in France. Inclusion criteria were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation for 48 h or more. Control groups were two historical cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU for bacterial or non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia. The outcome of interest was the development of ICU-acquired pneumonia. The determinants of ICU-acquired pneumonia were investigated in a multivariate competing risk analysis. RESULT: One hundred and seventy-six patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the ICU between March 1st and 30th June of 2020 were included into the study. Historical control groups comprised 435 patients with bacterial pneumonia and 48 ones with viral pneumonia. ICU-acquired pneumonia occurred in 52% of COVID-19 patients, whereas in 26% and 23% of patients with bacterial or viral pneumonia, respectively (p < 0.001). Times from initiation of mechanical ventilation to ICU-acquired pneumonia were similar across the three groups. In multivariate analysis, the risk of ICU-acquired pneumonia remained independently associated with underlying COVID-19 (SHR = 2.18; 95 CI 1.2-3.98, p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears an independent risk factor of ICU-acquired pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia. Whether this is driven by immunomodulatory properties by the SARS-CoV-2 or this is related to particular processes of care remains to be investigated.","Llitjos, Jean-François; Bredin, Swann; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Soumagne, Thibaud; Cojocaru, Mariana; Leclerc, Maxime; Lepetit, Arnaud; Gouhier, Albin; Charpentier, Julien; Piton, Gaël; Faron, Matthieu; Stoclin, Annabelle; Pène, Frédéric",Ann Intensive Care,,483
365615,Controlling COVID-19 Transmission due to Contaminated Imported Frozen Food and Food Packaging,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the global epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), China has made progress in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played a key role in dealing with the disease's effects on the respiratory system. This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluated the clinical efficacy and prognosis of Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills and Lianhua Qingwen granules in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 283 patients participated in this clinical trial, and participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1) Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills and Lianhua Qingwen granules or 2) Linahua granules, both combined with western medicine, or 3) western medicine alone for 14 days. At the end of the trial, the improvement and resolution rates of clinical symptoms and the rate of patients who progressed to severe disease status were evaluated. RESULTS: After 14 days of treatment, there was no significant difference in the improvement rate of clinical symptoms among the three groups (P > 0.05). Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills combined with Lianhua Qingwen granules has advantages in the treatment of nausea, vomiting and limb soreness. During treatment, all participants were treated with western medicine, and there was a significant difference in the use of macrolides among the three groups (P < 0.05). Specifically, the utilization rate of antibiotics in the western medicine group was significantly greater than that of the other two groups. Among the 182 diagnosed patients who completed this clinical trial, 13 patients progressed to severe disease, including one case in the Huoxiang + Lianhua group (1.6 %), five cases in the Lianhua group (8.6 %), and seven cases in the western medicine group (11.1 %). There was no statistical differences in this rate among the three groups (P > 0.05). However, the proportion of patients who progressed to severe disease in the Huoxiang + Lianhua group was the lowest, suggesting that the combination of TCM with western medicine has a potential advantage in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The use of Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills and Lianhua Qingwen granules combined with western medicine may have clinical advantages for COVID-19 patients in improving clinical symptoms, reducing utilization rate of anti-infective drugs, and improving patient prognosis, which could pave the way for the use of complementary medicine in treating this infection.","Xiao, Mingzhong; Tian, Jiaxing; Zhou, Yana; Xu, Xi; Min, Xiaojun; Lv, Yi; Peng, Miao; Zhang, Ying; Yan, Dengying; Lang, Suping; Zhang, Qing; Fan, An; Ke, Jia; Li, Xiuyang; Liu, Binbin; Jiang, Manhong; Liu, Quan; Zhu, Jinyue; Yang, Lu; Zhu, Zheng; Zeng, Kun; Li, Chengyin; Zheng, Yujiao; Wu, Haoran; Lin, Jiaran; Lian, Fengmei; Li, Xiaodong; Tong, Xiaolin",Pharmacol Res,,483

With the increase in cases & mortality rate, various health issues viz., stress, mental disorders and altered health-related quality of life have been noted as a result of pandemic and lockdowns. This study aimed to assess the association of COVID-19 pandemic stress with health-related quality of life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional analytical study. Subjects included 878 citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia aged 18 years and above. Convenience, non-probability sampling technique was used. A web-based, self-administered, electronic questionnaire in Arabic language having three sections; Sociodemographic & clinical profile, Standard PSS-10, and Standard SF-12 was used as the study tool and distributed through various social media means. The study period was of 2 months. Data were analyzed using SPS version 25. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, independent sample t-test and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed for suitable statistical analysis. Results: Almost two-thirds of the subjects were between the age of 18 to < 40 and majority (74.1%) being females. Majority (83.0%) reported as having no chronic diseases, and 69.5% had no contact history with COVID-19 cases. The mean of MCS & PCS was (32.34 ± 25.30) & (41.65 ± 11.82), respectively. Majority (67.6%) had a moderate level of COVID-19 stress. A significant negative relationship between total stress scores and HRQOL domains was observed. Conclusion: Majority subjects had a moderate level of stress related to COVID-19 lockdown. Stress during COVID-19 has a significant negative association with both physical and mental HRQOL in which MCS was significantly lower than PCS.

367631,The role of media coverage on pandemic containment: Empirical analysis of the COVID-19 case,2020,"AIM: To compare the risk of diabetes development in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Adult patients with new onset of AF, treated with NOACs or warfarin between 2012 and 2016, were included. The NOAC cohort was further divided into dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban groups. The primary outcome was incident diabetes requiring treatment with antidiabetic drugs. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Propensity score matching was performed for each head-to-head comparison. RESULTS: A total of 10 746 new-onset AF patients were included in our study. During the mean 2.4-year follow-up, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes than warfarin (aHR = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.94, P = .007). Subgroup analyses confirmed that dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban each had a reduced diabetes risk. Stratified analyses showed that the lower risk of diabetes associated with NOAC treatment was specific to patients aged 65 years or older (aHR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.89, P = .002) and those with good medication adherence (aHR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58-0.84, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Taking an NOAC was associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes than taking warfarin in patients with AF.","Huang, Huei-Kai; Liu, Peter Pin-Sung; Lin, Shu-Man; Hsu, Jin-Yi; Peng, Carol Chiung-Hui; Munir, Kashif M; Wu, Ting-Yu; Yeh, Jih-I; Loh, Ching-Hui; Tu, Yu-Kang",Diabetes obes. metab,,483

With other African countries, the DRC faces the challenge of striking a balance between easing public health lockdown measures to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and minimizing both economic hardships for large sectors of the population and negative impacts on health services for other infectious and noninfectious diseases. The DRC recently controlled its tenth Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, but COVID-19 and a new EVD outbreak beginning on June 1, 2020 in the northwest Équateur Province have added an additional burden to health services. Although the epidemiology and transmission of EVD and COVID-19 differ, leveraging the public health infrastructures and experiences from coordinating the EVD response to guide the public health response to COVID-19 is critical. Building on the DRC's 40 years of experience with 10 previous EVD outbreaks, we highlight the DRC's multi-sectoral public health approach to COVID-19, which includes community-based screening, testing, contact-tracing, risk communication, community engagement, and case management. We also highlight remaining challenges and discuss the way forward for achieving control of both COVID-19 and EVD in the DRC.","Nachega, Jean B; Mbala-Kingebeni, Placide; Otshudiema, John; Mobula, Linda M; Preiser, Wolfgang; Kallay, Oscar; Michaels-Strasser, Susan; Breman, Joel G; Rimoin, Anne W; Nsio, Justus; Ahuka-Mundeke, Steve; Zumla, Alimuddin; Muyembe Tam-Fum, Jean-Jacques",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,483

There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84 ± 2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02 ± 12.46). RESULTS: we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males. Concerning the psycho-emotional aspects, about one-third of our sample showed depressive or anxious symptoms. The results of our study may provide support for the implementation of some interventions for well-being in pandemic condition.","Marelli, Sara; Castelnuovo, Alessandra; Somma, Antonella; Castronovo, Vincenza; Mombelli, Samantha; Bottoni, Daniela; Leitner, Caterina; Fossati, Andrea; Ferini-Strambi, Luigi",J. neurol,,483

369780,Patterns amidst the turmoil: COVID-19 and cities,2021,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many patients refrained from inpatient medical care. For those inflicted with heart failure (HF), the risk of repeat hospitalizations is particularly high in case of infection. This presents an important opportunity for remote monitoring of haemodynamic data for these patients, in order to detect and treat accordingly. The aim of the present case is to report of the first measurements of a novel wireless left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system, the V-LAP&#8482; (Vectorious Medical Technologies, Ltd), during the COVID-19 pandemic. The V-LAP&#8482; Left Atrium Monitoring systEm for Patients With Chronic sysTOlic & Diastolic Congestive heart Failure (VECTOR-HF) is a first-in-man clinical study assessing the safety and feasibility of the V-LAP&#8482; monitoring system. Our first patient, a 59-year-old man with severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction -30%) was enrolled prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. As per protocol, both the patient and the medical team were blinded to the results in the first 3 months after implantation. We were able to witness the LAP during the pandemic, as the patient remained undertreated, demonstrating a gradual increase from a mean pressure of 6.56 to 19.4 mmHg, as well as prominent V waves, before the data became available to the medical team and the patient was treated accordingly. Thereafter, pressures have returned to low values. This case demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of LAP using the V-LAP&#8482; system, as well as the potential benefit of remote care of HF patients.","Perl, Leor; Ben Avraham, Binyamin; Vaknin-Assa, Hana; Ben Gal, Tuvia; Kornowski, Ran",ESC Heart Fail,,483

Understanding how and by whom the virus is transmitted can help implement better disease control strategies. Here we have described the use of a noninvasive mask sampling method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory particles expelled by COVID-19 patients and discussed its relationship to transmission risk. Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling <100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling >1000 viral copies). The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals. The results conform to reported secondary infection rates and transmission and also suggest that mask sampling could be explored as an effective tool to assess individual transmission risks, at different time points and during different activities.","Sriraman, Kalpana; Shaikh, Ambreen; Parikh, Swapneil; Udupa, Shreevatsa; Chatterjee, Nirjhar; Shastri, Jayanthi; Mistry, Nerges",PLoS One,,483
371542,Online Design Education: Meta-Connective Pedagogy,2020,"The established processes for ensuring safe outpatient surveillance of patients with known heart valve disease (HVD), echocardiography for patients referred with new murmurs and timely delivery of surgical or transcatheter treatment for patients with severe disease have all been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic. This has created a large backlog of work and upstaging of disease with consequent increases in risk and cost of treatment and potential for worse long-term outcomes. As countries emerge from lockdown but with COVID-19 endemic in society, precautions remain that restrict 'normal' practice. In this article, we propose a methodology for restructuring services for patients with HVD and provide recommendations pertaining to frequency of follow-up and use of echocardiography at present. It will be almost impossible to practice exactly as we did prior to the pandemic; thus, it is essential to prioritise patients with the greatest clinical need, such as those with symptomatic severe HVD. Local procedural waiting times will need to be considered, in addition to usual clinical characteristics in determining whether patients requiring intervention would be better suited having surgical or transcatheter treatment. We present guidance on the identification of stable patients with HVD that could have follow-up deferred safely and suggest certain patients that could be discharged from follow-up if waiting lists are triaged with appropriate clinical input. Finally, we propose that novel models of working enforced by the pandemic-such as increased use of virtual clinics-should be further developed and evaluated.","Shah, Benoy Nalin; Schlosshan, Dominik; McConkey, Hannah Zelie Ruth; Buch, Mamta Heena; Marshall, Andrew John; Cartwright, Neil; Dobson, Laura Elizabeth; Allen, Christopher; Campbell, Brian; Khan, Patricia; Savill, Peter John; Briffa, Norman Paul; Chambers, John Boyd",Heart,,483

The Complement System is activated during viral infection, being a central protagonist of innate and acquired immunity. Here, we report some interactions between these three coronaviruses and the Complement System, highlighting the central role of C3 with the severity of these infections. Although it can be protective, its role during coronavirus infections seems to be contradictory. For example, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, Complement System can control the viral infection in asymptomatic or mild cases; however, it can also intensify local and systemic damage in some of severe COVID-19 patients, due to its potent proinflammatory effect. In this last condition, the activation of the Complement System also amplifies the cytokine storm and the pathogenicity of coronavirus infection. Experimental treatment with Complement inhibitors has been an enthusiastic field of intense investigation in search of a promising additional therapy in severe COVID-19 patients.","Santiesteban-Lores, Lazara Elena; Amamura, Thais Akemi; da Silva, Tiago Francisco; Midon, Leonardo Moura; Carneiro, Milena Carvalho; Isaac, Lourdes; Bavia, Lorena",Life Sci,,483

However, researchers around the globe are working hard to find a solution e.g. synthetic vaccine. Here, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes to extract the potential conserved regions for identifying peptide based synthetic vaccines, viz. epitopes with high immunogenicity and antigenicity. In this regard, different multiple sequence alignment techniques are used to align the SARS-CoV-2 genomes separately. Subsequently, consensus conserved regions are identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned result of alignment techniques. Further, the consensus conserved regions are refined considering that their lengths are greater than or equal to 60nt and their corresponding proteins are devoid of any stop codons. Subsequently, their specificity as query coverage are verified using Nucleotide BLAST. Finally, with these consensus conserved regions, T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores which are then used to rank the conserved regions. As a result, we have ranked 23 consensus conserved regions that are associated with different proteins. This ranking also resulted in 34 MHC-I and 37 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 16 and 19 unique HLA alleles and 29 B-cell epitopes. After ranking, the consensus conserved region from NSP3 gene is obtained that is highly immunogenic and antigenic. In order to judge the relevance of the identified epitopes, the physico-chemical properties and binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit; Saha, Sudipto",Int Immunopharmacol,,483

Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Tahir, Ahsen; Sheikh, Zakariya; Hussain, Zain; Domínguez Hernández, Andrés; Harrison, Ewen; Williams, Robin; Sheikh, Aziz; Hussain, Amir",J Med Internet Res,,483

The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions on smoking habits using data collected within the Lost in Italy project. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 6003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years. Study subjects were recruited from 27 April to 3 May 2020 and were asked to report changes in smoking habits before the lockdown and at the time of interview. RESULTS: During the lockdown, 5.5% of the overall sample quit or reduced smoking, but 9.0% of the sample started, relapsed smoking or increased their smoking intensity. In total, the lockdown increased cigarette consumption by 9.1%. An improvement in smoking habits was associated with younger age, occasional smoking and unemployment, whereas a worsening was mainly associated with mental distress. In particular, an increase in cigarette consumption during lockdown was more frequently reported among those with worsening quality of life (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.80), reduction in sleep quantity (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.07) and increased anxiety (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.43) and depressive symptoms (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.71). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown had a huge impact on smoking consumption of the Italian general population. The main concern is for smokers who increase their cigarette consumption due to an increased mental distress. Providing greater resources for cessation services capable of reducing mental health symptoms in smokers is urgently needed.","Carreras, Giulia; Lugo, Alessandra; Stival, Chiara; Amerio, Andrea; Odone, Anna; Pacifici, Roberta; Gallus, Silvano; Gorini, Giuseppe",Tob. control,,483

The World Health Organization has stated that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted from person-to-person close contact, as well as by small aerosol respiratory droplets. Moreover, the results of some recent studies about the role of air pollution on the spread and lethality of the novel coronavirus suggest that air contaminants could be also a transmission pathway of the virus. On the other hand, indirect transmission of the virus cannot be discarded. Among many sources of indirect transmission, there is the contamination of inert/inanimate surfaces. This manuscript was aimed at reviewing the scientific literature currently available in PubMed and Scopus. The results of the reviewed studies point out that SARS-CoV-2 can last on different surfaces from hours to a few days. However, rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by applying commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces. Consequently, although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces can represent a potential route of transmission, appropriate disinfection measures should reduce the possibilities of coronavirus transmission, and hence, significantly decrease the risks of COVID-19.","Marquès, Montse; Domingo, José L",Environ Res,,483

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a novel beta-coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly affects the respiratory system. Recently, there have been some reports of extra-respiratory symptoms such as neurological manifestations in COVID-19. According to the increasing reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome following COVID-19, we mainly focused on SARS-CoV-2 infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome in this review. We tried to explain the possibility of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome and potential pathogenic mechanisms based on current and past knowledge.","Shoraka, Shahrzad; Ferreira, Maria Lucia Brito; Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Ghaemi, Amir",Front Immunol,,483

The model distinguishes four stages in the disease: infected, sick, seriously sick, and better. The model was preliminarily parameterized based on observations of the spread of the disease. The model is consistent with a mortality rate of 1.5 %. Preliminary simulations with the model indicate that concepts such as""herd immunity""and""flattening the curve""are highly misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. As R0 values estimated with the model range from 2.82 worldwide outside of China and 3.83 in the Western world in late February - early March 2020, this means social distancing with effectiveness greater than 65 % (worldwide) or 75 % (Western world) are needed to combat the virus successfully.","Visscher, Alex De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08824v2.pdf,483

DESIGN: cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: using a new information system developed during the pandemic, we gathered data on the number of daily deaths in the population residing in the provinces of Milan and Lodi by Local Health Unit (ASST) and age groups. To describe the case fatality of COVID-19, we performed a record linkage with a database specially constructed during the epidemic to identify deaths that occurred in confirmed cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: mortality and excess mortality were analysed by comparing the number of observed deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 with the average deaths of the years 2016-2019 in the same calendar period and with expected deaths, estimated using a Poisson model. Furthermore, a measure of relative risk was calculated as observed/expected ratio with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: the increase in mortality for all causes occurring in the study population in the first 4 months of 2020 was 48.8%, 30.8% for ages between 60 and 69, 43.9% for ages between 70 and 79, and 56.7% for subjects above 80 years of age. Focusing on the epidemic period, from 1 March to 30 April, the excess is quantifiable as more than 2-fold and mainly concerns the population over 60 years of age. The excess mortality was observed in all local health units (ASSTs). The highest increments were in the province of Lodi and the North-East of Milan (ASST Nord). In the ASSTs of Lodi and Melegnano-Martesana the mortality excess was detectable from March 15th, while for the other ASSTs the increase began in the first week of April. CONCLUSIONS: evaluation of overall mortality in the provinces of Milan and Lodi during the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a significant excess compared to the first 4 months of the years 2016-2019, mainly in the population over 60 years of age. However, this excess cannot be completely attributed directly to COVID-19 itself. This phenomenon was more intense in the Lodi ASST, with daily deaths up to 5 times higher than expected.","Sandrini, Monica; Andreano, Anita; Murtas, Rossella; Tunesi, Sara; Riussi, Antonio; Guido, Davide; Greco, Maria Teresa; Gattoni, Maria Elena; Gervasi, Federico; Consolazio, David; Adreoni, Laura; Decarli, Adriano; Russo, Antonio Giampiero",Epidemiol Prev,,483

In India, the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown came into force on March 25, 2020, which was later continued in the next phases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the result of lockdown on air quality of major metropolitan cities-Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Lucknow-from March 25 to May 3, 2020. For this study, the concentration of six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3) and air quality index during the COVID-19 lockdown period was compared with the same period of the previous year 2019. The results indicate a substantial improvement in air quality with a drastic decrease in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, while there is a moderate reduction in SO2 and O3 concentration. During the lockdown period, the maximum reduction in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 was observed to be - 49% (Lucknow), - 57% (Delhi), - 75% (Mumbai), - 68% (Kolkata), - 48% (Mumbai), and - 29% (Hyderabad), respectively. The value of the air quality index (AQI) also dwindled significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The maximum decline in AQI was observed - 52% in Bengaluru and Lucknow.

Also, it signifies the importance of the disease to the community. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran and its different provinces. Methods: This study was conducted on the data of COVID-19 patients in Iran from February 21 to March 8, 2020. To determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran, the serial interval and β value were first determined using linear regression analysis. Then, the net reproductive number values were calculated for Iran and its different provinces. Results: The results of this study showed that the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran was 1.31. Using the available data up to March 15, 2020, the highest net reproductive number was in Mazandaran, Yazd, Isfahan, Qazvin, and Zanjan provinces, with values of 2.07, 1.86, 1.84, and 1.76, respectively. The net reproductive number also showed an increasing trend in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province. Conclusion: It seems that although the net reproductive number of the virus had a decreasing trend in the provinces, it is still high. Therefore, sanitary measures in these provinces should be pursued more seriously. On the other hand, social distancing is a topic that should be taken into consideration, that is, social gatherings and contacts should be avoided as much as possible and strategies and facilities for this action should be developed by the government and health policymakers.","Moradi, Yousef; Eshrati, Babak",Med.

Tapes cannot be cleaned or disinfected; yet, several clinicians may use a given roll for any number of patients. Reports of tape contamination associated with clinical infection have been published. PURPOSE: We reviewed the literature reporting microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and nosocomial outbreaks associated with the use of medical tapes and other adhesive devices to assess the prevalence of this problem. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for cross-contamination due to medical tape use in 6 databases in June 2020 using indexing terms for surgical tape, adhesive agent, adhesives or the keyword for tape. We compiled available evidence on tape contamination as a cause for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). MAIN FINDINGS: Forty-two publications reported relevant microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and/or nosocomial outbreaks. Results demonstrated that tape rolls handled with questionable practices can harbor pathogens. Some studies showed the association between contaminated tape and HAIs, which in some cases even led to death. CONCLUSIONS: The time has come to establish national guidelines to help reduce the risk of cross-contamination from medical tapes. We offer suggested elements for these guidelines.

Harmful pathogens adhere to a variety of surfaces and infect personnel on contact, thereby promoting transmission to new hosts. This is particularly worrisome in the case of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which constitute a growing threat to human health worldwide and require new preventative routes of disinfection. In this study, we have incorporated different loading levels of a porphyrin photosensitizer capable of generating reactive singlet oxygen in the presence of O2 and visible light in a water-soluble, photo-cross-linkable polymer coating, which was subsequently deposited on polymer microfibers. Two different application methods are considered, and the morphological and chemical characteristics of these coated fibers are analyzed to detect the presence of the coating and photosensitizer. To discern the efficacy of the fibers against pathogenic bacteria, photodynamic inactivation has been performed on two different bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli, with population reductions of >99.9999 and 99.6%, respectively, after exposure to visible light for 1 h. In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we also confirm that these coated fibers can inactivate a human common cold coronavirus serving as a surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Peddinti, Bharadwaja S T; Morales-Gagnon, Nicolas; Pourdeyhimi, Behnam; Scholle, Frank; Spontak, Richard J; Ghiladi, Reza A",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,483

Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-Cov-2,"" and/or ""novel coronavirus."" Study Selection: Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed. Results: Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that that 12% of patients with COVID-19 will manifest GI symptoms; however, SAR-CoV-2 shedding was observed in 40.5% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the need to better understand what measures are needed to prevent further spread of this highly contagious pathogen.","Parasa, Sravanthi; Desai, Madhav; Thoguluva Chandrasekar, Viveksandeep; Patel, Harsh K; Kennedy, Kevin F; Roesch, Thomas; Spadaccini, Marco; Colombo, Matteo; Gabbiadini, Roberto; Artifon, Everson L A; Repici, Alessandro; Sharma, Prateek",JAMA Netw Open,,483

We applied different and well-known computational methods like Euler Maruyama, stochastic Euler, and stochastic Runge Kutta to study the dynamics of the model mentioned above. Unfortunately, these computational methods do not restore the dynamical properties of the model like positivity, boundedness, consistency, and stability in the sense of biological reasoning, as desired. Then, for the given stochastic model, we developed a stochastic non-standard finite difference method. Following that, several theorems are presented to support the proposed method, which is shown to satisfy all of the model's dynamical properties. To that end, several simulations are presented to compare the proposed method's efficiency to that of existing stochastic methods.","Aslam Noor, Muhammad Raza Ali Shoaib Arif Muhammad Rafiq Muhammad Sooppy Nisar Kottakkaran Khan Ilyas Abdelwahab Sayed F.",Alexandria Engineering Journal,,483

METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to all women's healthcare providers, including physicians, mid-level providers and nurses, in all subspecialties of obstetrics and gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) at a large tertiary care university-affiliated hospital. RESULTS: Of the 278 eligible providers, the survey response rate was 45% (n = 127). Participants represented 8 Ob/Gyn subspecialties and all professional levels. Participants age 18-30 years were significantly more likely to feel that women should have access to infertility treatment despite the burden level of COVID-19 in respective community/states (p = 0.0058). Participants within the subspecialties of general Ob/Gyn, maternal foetal medicine and gynecologic oncology were significantly more likely to disagree that all women should refrain from planned conception during the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison to those in urogynecology and reproductive endocrinology and infertility (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the immediate and unknown long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility care delivery, a better understanding of perceptions regarding infertility management during this time is important. Our study shows overall support for the initial ASRM recommendations, representing a wide spectrum of women's health providers.","Wiltshire, Ashley; Jackson-Bey, Tia; Walker, Zachary; Chiang, Jasmine L; MacLennan, Paul A; Gunn, Deidre; Hurd, William W",J. assist. reprod. genet,,483

How Governments and Citizens Contest the Meaning of Contact Tracing through Sociomaterial Practices to Achieve Societal Resilience (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: As the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the United States, policy makers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of web-based crowdfunding to defray these costs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the web-based crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States to understand the incidence of initiation of COVID-19-related campaigns and compare them to non-COVID-19-related campaigns. METHODS: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns that contained narratives and were created between January 1 and May 10, 2020, on GoFundMe. We identified the subset of COVID-19-related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored the incidence of COVID-19-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time, and we compared the characteristics of the campaigns to those of non-COVID-19-related campaigns after March 11, when the pandemic was declared. We then used a natural language processing algorithm to cluster campaigns by narrative content using overlapping keywords. RESULTS: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe web-based crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-19-related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 case declined more than tenfold across all states. The states with the earliest disease burden had the fewest campaigns per case, indicating a lack of a case-dependent response. COVID-19-related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based crowdfunding appears to be a stopgap for only a minority of campaigners. The novelty of an emergency likely impacts both campaign initiation and crowdfunding success, as it reflects the affective response of a community. Crowdfunding activity likely serves as an early signal for emerging needs and societal sentiment for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.","Saleh, Sameh Nagui; Lehmann, Christoph U; Medford, Richard J",J Med Internet Res,,483
405942,Individualism in Collective Crises: Big Data Analytics of COVID-19 Responses,2020,"The COVID-19 crisis has shown that we can only prevent the risk of mass contagion through timely, large-scale, coordinated, and decisive actions. This pandemic has also highlighted the critical importance of generating rigorous evidence for decision-making, and actionable insights from data, considering further the intricate web of causes and drivers behind observed patterns of contagion diffusion. Using mobility, socioeconomic, and epidemiological data recorded throughout the pandemic development in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, we seek to understand the observed patterns of contagion. We characterize human mobility patterns during the pandemic through different mobility indices and correlate such patterns with the observed contagion diffusion, providing data-driven models for insights, analysis, and inferences. Through these models, we examine some effects of the late application of mobility restrictions in high-income urban regions that were affected by high contagion rates at the beginning of the pandemic. Using augmented synthesis control methods, we study the consequences of the early lifting of mobility restrictions in low-income sectors connected by public transport to high-risk and high-income communes. The Santiago Metropolitan Region is one of the largest Latin American metropolises with features that are common to large cities. Therefore, it can be used as a relevant case study to unravel complex patterns of the spread of COVID-19.","Herrera, Mauricio Godoy-Faúndez Alex",Future Internet,,483

We examined whether concerns regarding transmission of COVID-19 to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were associated with HCWs' distress. We tested whether living with others modified these associations. METHOD: HCWs at a New York City academic medical center (N = 767; 80.7% female, 58.5% White) enrolled in the COVID-19 Health Care Provider Study and completed a web-based survey between April 9, 2020 and May 11, 2020. RESULTS: Controlling for demographics, distress regarding potential transmission to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were each significantly associated with higher odds of a positive screen for acute stress, depression, and anxiety (ORs = 1.29-1.59, all ps < .01). Living with others was associated with lower odds of a positive screen for depression and anxiety, though the protective effect for anxiety was evident only for HCWs with no distress regarding transmission concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission concerns and social distancing from loved ones were associated with greater odds of psychological distress, whereas living with others was associated with lower odds of distress. Interventions should consider ways to facilitate the ability of HCWs to receive social support from loved ones, while simultaneously protecting their family's health.

Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The Drosophila larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on the anterior lobe progenitors (AP), ignoring the posterior progenitors (PP) from the posterior lobes. Using in situ expression mapping, developmental and transcriptome analysis we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated, promoting survival. Stat92E knockdown or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.","Rodrigues, Diana; Renaud, Yoan; VijayRaghavan, K; Waltzer, Lucas; Inamdar, Maneesha S",eLife (Cambridge),,483

413889,David Oliver: Silencing NHS staff who speak out is sheer stupidity,2020,"The concept of the effective infection opportunity population (EIOP) was incorporated into the SIQR model, and it was assumed that this EIOP would change with the spread of infection, and this was named as the effective SIQR model. When calculated with this model, the uninfected population S decreases with the passage of time. However, when the EIOP N increases because of any reason, the infection threshold becomes larger than 1. Even after the first wave seems to have subsided, the infection begins to spread again. Firstly, we find the curve of EIOP change so that the calculation result by this model matches the data of the first and second waves. Then, we use this curve to fit with only the data of the second wave alone, and the third wave is predicted. In the case of new coronavirus infection, there are various restrictions on data collection to identify individual coefficients of mathematical models, and the true value is almost unknown. Therefore, the discussion in this paper is only about data fitting for predictive calculation. Therefore, the simulation on the true value is not aimed. However, since the data of infected persons reflect the true values, the results of data fitting can be used for the prediction of infected persons, isolated care recipients, inpatients, and severely ill persons. They are useful for a qualitative understanding of infection. The idea of EIOP is important in the sense that it connects the mean-field and the non-mean field, but the existence of data is essential, and the theory alone cannot simulate the non-mean field. We have developed two methods for treating the non-mean field cases where we don't have enough data.

This study, therefore, aims to assess the operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in response to epidemics and provides implications for controlling COVID-19 in Vietnam. Methods: An online cross-sectional study using the respondent-driven sampling technique was conducted with 6029 health professionals and medical students in Vietnam from December 2019 to February 2020. The operational readiness capacities of the health system were assessed by the sufficiency of health professionals, administrative and logistics staffs, equipment and facilities, and general capacity of health professionals. Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher exact test and &#967;2 test were employed to identify the differences among variables. Tobit and censored regression models were operated to determine associated factors. Results: The operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system for four assessed criteria were at moderate levels, ranging from 6.3 to 6.8 over 10. In Vietnam, the grassroots health system in rural areas, in the South, and at the district level were more likely to be vulnerable compared to their counterparts. Conclusions: According to empirical data, this study reveals the vulnerability of the grassroots health system in Vietnam and provides the rationality of prompt and vigorous actions of the Vietnamese Government against COVID-19. Findings also offer useful insights for effective strategies to strengthen the grassroots health system in the long term. In the short term, practicing precautionary measures and mobilizing human resources, as well as medical equipment, are needed to successfully contain COVID-19 in Vietnam.","Tran, Bach Xuan; Hoang, Men Thi; Pham, Hai Quang; Hoang, Chi Linh; Le, Huong Thi; Latkin, Carl A; Ho, Cyrus Sh; Ho, Roger Cm",J Glob Health,,483

415556,Il contact tracing digitale: la rete dei corpi integrati./ [Digital contact tracing: the network of integrated bodies.],2020,"OBJECTIVE: Nasal airway obstruction affects up to one-third of Americans and is one of the most common complaints by patients to otolaryngologists. Nasal airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are closely related. The aim of this study was to use the 3D imaging software, ITK-SNAP as a platform to define a gold standard for anatomically accurate boundaries of the nasal airway in 3D CBCT and to create a more reliable and precise 3D CBCT segmentation of the nasal airway for assisting diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of nasal airway obstruction and OSAS. METHOD AND MATERIALS: After review of the literature to identify established parameters using CBCT and CT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway, and the existing drawbacks, a gold standard for locating the anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway using CBCT is proposed. This new method aims at standardization of segmentation and quantification, allowing for more reliable comparison between studies. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment three CBCT samples of healthy patients aged 21 to 59 years, who were patients of record, with CBCT obtained for either orthodontic, endodontic, or prosthodontic treatment planning purposes. <br />Results: The literature search identified 11 studies describing nasal airway parameters utilizing CBCT and CT. A great variation was detected on where the anatomical boundaries for the nasal airway were selected. A new standard in the identification of anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway is proposed for consistent segmentation and quantification using 3D CBCT by using the following landmarks: the inferior ANS-PNS border, the anterior nares border, the posterior sella-PNS border, and superiorly the border in alignment with the base of the skull (excluding the ostia, frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal air cells). The three segmented samples were volumetrically measured, and statistically analyzed. The mean average Hounsfield unit intensity using the CBCT samples in this study was 629 with a standard deviation of 190. <br />Conclusion: The literature indicates a lack of a gold standard using CBCT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway. With the proposed standard in this study, it is possible to quantify the nasal airway volume and thereby its reduction. For the general dental practitioner, this is an important aspect during the evaluation of overall airway assessment.

415901,Extended producer responsibility in the Australian construction industry,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metformin has antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects and several cohort studies have shown that metformin lower mortality in the COVID population in a majority white population. There is no data documenting the effect of metformin taken as an outpatient on COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Our aim was to evaluate if metformin decreases hospitalization and severe COVID-19 among minority Medicare patients who acquired the SARS-CoV2 virus. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly minority Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, demographic data, as well as clinical and echocardiographic data. We classified those using metformin as those patients who had a pharmacy claim for metformin and non-metformin users as those who were diabetics and did not use metformin as well as non-diabetic patients. Our primary outcome was hospitalization. Our secondary outcomes were mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: We identified 1139 COVID-19 positive patients of whom 392 were metformin users. Metformin users had a higher comorbidity score than non-metformin users (p < 0.01). The adjusted relative hazard (RH) of those hospitalized for metformin users was 0.71; 95% CI 0.52-0.86. The RH of death for metformin users was 0.34; 95% CI 0.19-0.59. The RH of ARDS for metformin users was 0.32; 95% CI 0.22-0.45. Metformin users on 1000 mg daily had lower mortality, but similar hospitalization and ARDS rates when compared to those on 500-850 mg of metformin daily. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is associated with lower hospitalization, mortality and ARDS among a minority COVID-19 population. Future randomized trials should confirm this finding and evaluate for a causative effect of the drug preventing disease.","Ghany, Reyan; Palacio, Ana; Dawkins, Elissa; Chen, Gordon; McCarter, Daniel; Forbes, Emancia; Chung, Brian; Tamariz, Leonardo",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,483
416227,Knowledge Creation in Information Technology and Tourism: A Critical Reflection and an Outlook for the Future,2020,"OBJECTIVE: No data exist regarding the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk factors of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This study aimed to stratify risk factors of SUDEP in relation to COVID-19 lockdown, among patients with epilepsy (PWE) in Cairo University epilepsy unit (CUEU). Therefore, we can detect risk factors and mitigate such factors in the second wave of the virus. METHODS: an observational, cross-sectional study carried on 340 Egyptian patients with active epilepsy. Individual risk identification and stratification was done by using The SUDEP and seizure Safety Checklist, after which sharing risk knowledge to PWE and their caregivers was undertaken. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 29.72 ± 12.12. The median of the static factors was 4 (IQR 3-5) whereas, the median of the modifiable factors was 2 (IQR 1-3). Epilepsy emergencies (serial seizures or status epilepticus) were reported in 24.1 % of patients, for which non-compliance was the commonest cause, followed by deferral of epilepsy surgery for patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that use of anxiolytic medications, non-compliance, keeping patients with DRE on dual anti-seizure medications (ASMs), or adding third medication increased the odds of increased seizure frequency by 2.7, 3.5, 16.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 related issues had influenced the risk of seizure worsening including postponing epilepsy surgery for patients with DRE, non-compliance, and psychiatric comorbidities. Special attention should be paid to these issues to mitigate the risk of SUDEP.","Magdy, Rehab; Kishk, Nirmeen A; Fouad, Amr M; Alsayyad, Enas",Epilepsy Res,,483
416532,ReINTEL Challenge 2020: Exploiting Transfer Learning Models for Reliable Intelligence Identification on Vietnamese Social Network Sites,2021-02-22,"OBJECTIVE: A pandemic afflicts the entire world. The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy's potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES: COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS: All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION: This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. Larger studies are likely to define the role of HBOT in the treatment of this novel disease.","Thibodeaux, Kerry; Speyrer, Marcus; Raza, Amer; Yaakov, Raphael; Serena, Thomas E",J Wound Care,,483

Intratumoral Tregs in DLBCL (n = 70) were evaluated by double-stained CD25 and FOXP3 lymphocytes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and correlated with clinicopathologic features. We found that increased numbers of intratumoral FOXP3+ lymphocytes (>2.4/HPF) and CD25 + FOXP3+ lymphocytes (>0.8/HPF) are favorable prognosticators (p = .004 and p < .001, respectively) in DLBCL patients, along with age <70 years, stage I-II disease, normal serum LDH level and low IPI scores (p < .001, .002, .002, and <.001, respectively). On multivariate analyses, a higher number of CD25 + FOXP3+ lymphocytes retained prognostic significance (p = .040). Interestingly, higher Treg infiltration correlated with increased infiltration by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (Î³ = 0.294, p = .038) and nodal location (Î³ = 0.390, p = .004), but not with infiltration by CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which were reported to induce Tregs with immune tolerance. Therefore, congruent with literature meta-analyses, higher intratumoral CD25 + FOXP3+ lymphocytes have a beneficial impact on DLBCL.","Chang, Chen; Chen, Ya-Ping; Medeiros, L Jeffrey; Chen, Tsai-Yun; Chang, Kung-Chao",Leuk Lymphoma,,483
418312,Knowledge sharing in business education,2021,"Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) affect 1 in 3000 people worldwide. There are more than 150 different types of NMDs, where the common feature is the loss of muscle strength. These disorders are classified according to their neuroanatomical location, as motor neuron diseases, peripheral nerve diseases, neuromuscular junction diseases, and muscle diseases. Over the years, numerous studies have pointed to protein homeostasis as a crucial factor in the development of these fatal diseases. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining protein homeostasis, being involved in protein degradation, among other cellular functions. Through a cascade of enzymatic reactions, proteins are ubiquitinated, tagged, and translocated to the proteasome to be degraded. Within the ubiquitin system, we can find three main groups of enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligases). Only the ubiquitinated proteins with specific chain linkages (such as K48) will be degraded by the UPS. In this review, we describe the relevance of this system in NMDs, summarizing the UPS proteins that have been involved in pathological conditions and neuromuscular disorders, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), or Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), among others. A better knowledge of the processes involved in the maintenance of proteostasis may pave the way for future progress in neuromuscular disorder studies and treatments.","Bachiller, Sara; Alonso-Bellido, Isabel M; Real, Luis Miguel; Pérez-Villegas, Eva María; Venero, José Luis; Deierborg, Tomas; Armengol, José Ángel; Ruiz, Rocío",,,483

425259,Science & Tech Spotlight: Contact Tracing Apps,2020,"BACKGROUND: National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of suspension due to the severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures in place to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. METHODS: We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14-267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85â000 (4900-546â000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75â000 (4400-483â000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20-60 years) is 769 (148-2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14-307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0-10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3000 (182-21â000). INTERPRETATION: The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CONCLUSIONS: The David procedure revealed low mid-term reoperation risk and excellent survival independent of adjunctive cusp interventions/valve morphology and is comparable with that of the age- and gender-matched general population.","Liebrich, Markus; Charitos, Efstratios; Stadler, Charlotte; Roser, Detlef; Merk, Denis R; Doll, Nicolas; Hemmer, Wolfgang; Voth, Vladimir",Eur. j. cardiothorac. surg,,483
433158,Baseline update for U.S. farm income and the farm balance sheet,2020,"Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative factor of viral infection called COVID-19 that belongs to the zoonotic beta coronavirus family known to cause respiratory disorders or viral pneumonia, followed by an extensive attack on organs that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Human transmission of this virus occurs via respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which are released into the environment after sneezing or coughing. These droplets are capable of staying in the air as aerosols or surfaces and can be transmitted to persons through inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces. Thus, there is an urgent need for advanced theranostic solutions to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. The development of such fit-for-purpose technologies hinges on a proper understanding of the transmission, incubation, and structural characteristics of the virus in the external environment and within the host. Hence, this article describes the development of an intrinsic model to describe the incubation characteristics of the virus under varying environmental factors. It also discusses on the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 structural nucleocapsid protein properties via computational approaches to generate high-affinity binding probes for effective diagnosis and targeted treatment applications by specific targeting of viruses. In addition, this article provides useful insights on the transmission behavior of the virus and creates new opportunities for theranostics development.","Sabbih, Godfred O; Korsah, Maame A; Jeevanandam, Jaison; Danquah, Michael K",Biotechnol Prog,,483
434190,The Measurement Of Usability Using Use Questionnaire On The Google Classroom Application As E-Learning Media (A Case Study: SMK Negeri 1 Bandung),2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is an immediate major public health concern. The search for the understanding of the disease spreading made scientists around the world turn their attention to epidemiological studies. An interesting approach in epidemiological modeling nowadays is to use agent-based models, which allow to consider a heterogeneous population and to evaluate the role of superspreaders in this population. In this work, we implemented an agent-based model using probabilistic cellular automata to simulate SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics using COVID-19 infection parameters. Differently to the usual studies, we did not define the superspreaders individuals a priori, we only left the agents to execute a random walk along the sites. When two or more agents share the same site, there is a probability to spread the infection if one of them is infected. To evaluate the spreading, we built the transmission network and measured the degree distribution, betweenness, and closeness centrality. The results displayed for different levels of mobility restriction show that the degree reduces as the mobility reduces, but there is an increase of betweenness and closeness for some network nodes. We identified the superspreaders at the end of the simulation, showing the emerging behavior of the model since these individuals were not initially defined. Simulations also showed that the superspreaders are responsible for most of the infection propagation and the impact of personal protective equipment in the spreading of the infection. We believe that this study can bring important insights for the analysis of the disease dynamics and the role of superspreaders, contributing to the understanding of how to manage mobility during a highly infectious pandemic as COVID-19.","Lima, L L; Atman, A P F",PLoS One,,483

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

Against this backdrop, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional challenge of insufficient hospital beds and human resource for health needed to deliver hospital-based COVID-19 care. Emerging evidence from high-income countries suggests that a 'virtual ward' (VW) system can provide adequate home-based care for selected patients with COVID-19, thereby reducing the need for admissions and mitigate additional stress on hospital beds. We established a VW at the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a biomedical research institution located in The Gambia, a low-income west African country, to care for members of staff and their families infected with COVID-19. In this practice paper, we share our experience focusing on the key components of the system, how it was set up and successfully operated to support patients with COVID-19 in non-hospital settings. We describe the composition of the multidisciplinary team operating the VW, how we developed clinical standard operating procedures, how clinical oversight is provided and the use of teleconsultation and data capture systems to successfully drive the process. We demonstrate that using a VW to provide an additional level of support for patients with COVID-19 at home is feasible in a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa. We believe that other low-income or resource-constrained settings can adopt and contextualise the processes described in this practice paper to provide additional support for patients with COVID-19 in non-hospital settings.","Wariri, Oghenebrume; Okomo, Uduak; Cerami, Carla; Okoh, Emmanuel; Oko, Francis; Jah, Hawanatu; Bojang, Kalifa; Susso, Bubacarr; Olatunji, Yekini; Nkereuwem, Esin; Akemokwe, Fatai Momodou; Jobe, Modou; Agboghoroma, Orighomisan Freda; Kebbeh, Bunja; Sowe, Ghata; Gilleh, Thomas; Jobe, Naffie; Usuf, Effua; Clarke, Ed; Brotherton, Helen; Forrest, Karen",,,483

N6-methylation of adenosine (m6A) in RNA regulates many physiological and disease processes. Here, we investigate m6A modification of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in regulating the host cell innate immune response. Our data show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has m6A modifications that are enriched in the 3' end of the viral genome. We find that depletion of the host cell m6A methyltransferase METTL3 decreases m6A levels in SARS-CoV-2 and host genes, and m6A reduction in viral RNA increases RIG-I binding and subsequently enhances the downstream innate immune signaling pathway and inflammatory gene expression. METTL3 expression is reduced and inflammatory genes are induced in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

439011,Smart Tourism City: Developments and Transformations,2020,"Educators who design and manage study abroad programs face a series of ethical responsibilities. Meeting these responsibilities is critical in the field of global health, where study abroad programs are often designed to provide healthcare services in under-resourced communities. Leaders in global health have thus formed working groups to study the ethical implications of overseas programming and have led the way in establishing socially responsible best practices for study abroad. Their recommendations include development of bidirectional programming that is designed for mutual and equitable benefits, focused on locally identified needs and priorities, attentive to local community costs, and structured to build local capacity to ensure sustainability. Implementation remains a key challenge, however. Sustainable, bidirectional programming is difficult and costly. In the present study, authors questioned how technology could be used to connect students of global health in distant countries to make socially responsible global health programming more accessible. Drawing on empirical research in the learning sciences and leveraging best practices in technology design, the authors developed a Virtual Exchange in Global Health to connect university students in the U.S. with counterparts in Lebanon, who worked in teams to address humanitarian problems in Syrian refugee camps. Early results demonstrate the value of this approach. At dramatically lower cost than traditional study abroad—and with essentially no carbon footprint—students recognized complementary strengths in each other through bidirectional programming, learned about local needs and priorities through Virtual Reality, and built sustaining relationships while addressing a difficult real-world problem. The authors learned that technology could effectively facilitate socially responsible global health programming and do so at low cost.

439137,Guest Editorial,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health concern, and new treatment strategies are needed 1. Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4), and its mouse homologue, caspase-11 (CASP11), are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2-infected Casp11-/- mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) and gasdermin-D knock out (Gsdmd-/-) mice. GSDMD is a downstream effector of CASP11 and CASP1. Notably, viral titers were similar in the three genotypes. Global transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected WT, Casp11-/- and Gsdmd-/- lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in Casp11-/- mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta}, IL6, and CXCL1, and neutrophil functions, were reduced in Casp11-/- lungs. Additionally, Casp11-/- lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11, promotes detrimental SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.","Eltobgy, Mostafa; Zani, Ashley; Kenney, Adam; Estfanous, Shady; Kim, Eunsoo; Badr, Asmaa; Carafice, Cierra; Daily, Kylene; Whitham, Owen; Pietrzak, Maciej; Webb, Amy; Kawahara, Jeffrey; Eddy, Adrian; Denz, Parker; Lu, Mijia; Mahesh, KC; Peeples, Mark; Li, Jianrong; Zhu, Jian; Que, Jianwen; Robinson, Richard; Mejia, Oscar Rosas; Rayner, Rachael; Hall-Stoodley, Luanne; Seveau, Stephanie; Gavrilin, Mikhail A; Tedeschi, Andrea; Partida-Sanchez, Santiago; Roberto, Frank; Hemann, Emily; Abdelrazik, Eman; Forero, Adriana; Nimjee, Shahid; Boyaka, Prosper; Cormet-Boyaka, Estelle; Yount, Jacob; Amer, Amal",,,483

Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas RT-PCR based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications.

We review known population genetic effects of different mutation types and show how these may be connected to different evolutionary outcomes.

Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical self-similarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep U-Net [1] segmentation network that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-glass opacity and consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net and 24.4% points compared to current state of art methods [2].","Rajamani, Kumar T; Siebert, Hanna; Heinrich, Mattias P",J Biomed Inform,,483

446338,Access to information technology of households and secondary school students in Turkey,2021,"This article explores the impact of COVID-19 on the developers and players of Pokémon GO through the lens of nostalgia. Focusing on the game as a nostalgic text that works to remediate physical and social spaces, we examine how game-play has changed in response to players’ restricted mobility and isolation during the 2020 global pandemic. The release of Pokémon GO in 2016 was a watershed moment in the development of mobile augmented reality games. Building on a popular culture franchise familiar to many, it fused cutting-edge technology with memories of the past. Previous studies suggest playing Pokémon GO is associated with dreamlike nostalgia for childhood adventures. But these experiences were intimately linked with physical movement, proximity to others, and the exploration of outdoor spaces. Confined to their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, once free-roaming players are now being encouraged to embrace isolated, sedentary play. There is an additional layer of nostalgia in operation as players and developers alike reminisce about socializing and playing in the world outside the home. This article therefore explores how Pokémon GO mediates player experiences and unpacks its role in negotiating both memory and contemporary societal trauma. © 2020, Intellect Ltd.

446690,"Contact-tracing apps help reduce COVID infections, data suggest",2021,"AIM: This paper aims to demonstrate how the rationale and delivery of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), in those countries with long term established standards of practice, has changed over the past eight decades. METHODS: A narrative report based on the evolution of key published guidelines, systematic reviews and medical policies since the 1940s. RESULTS: Case reports of the value of exercise in cardiac disease can be dated back to 1772. Formative groundwork for exercise-based CR was published between 1940 and 1970. However, it was not until the late 1980s that a large enough data set of controlled trials was available to show significant reductions in premature all-cause and cardiac mortality. Since the mid 1990s, cardiac mortality has been greatly reduced due to enhanced public health, emergency care and more sensitive diagnostic techniques and aggressive treatments. As a result, there appears to be an associated reduced potency of CR to affect mortality. New rationales for why, how and where CR is delivered have emerged including: adapting to a longer surviving ageing multi-morbid population, where healthcare cost savings and quality of life have become increasingly important. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these results, an emerging focus for CR, and in some cases ""pre-habilitation"", is that of a chronic disability management programme increasingly delivered in community and home settings. Within this delivery model, the use of remote personalised technologies is now emerging, especially with new needs accelerated by the pandemic of COVID-19.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWith continued advances in medical science and better long term survival, the nature of cardiac rehabilitation has evolved over the past eight decades. It was originally an exercise-focused intervention on short term recovery and reducing cardiac and all-cause mortality, to now being one part of a multi-factor lifestyle, behavioural, and medical chronic disease management programme.Throughout history, the important influence of psycho-social well-being and human behaviour has, however, always been of key importance to patients.The location of rehabilitation can now be suited to patient need, both medically and socially, where the same components can be delivered in either a traditional outpatient clinic, community settings, at home and more recently all of these being supported or augmented with the advent of mobile technology.","Buckley, John P",Disabil Rehabil,,483

Methods: A joint investigation team of emergency response for COVID-19 epidemic by CDC professional workers of Liaocheng city and district at two levels on January 30, 2020. According to a indicator case from ZH supermarkets, close contacts and related subjects were tracked and screened on February 1, including ZH supermarket employees, family members having contact history with related cases during January 13-26, supermarket clients during January 16-30 and family members of related cases. an epidemiological investigation was carried on and their swab of nose /throat were collected and were sent to Liaocheng CDC laboratory, real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2. Results: a total of 8 437 people were screened during January 30 to February 9, 2020 (120 employees of supermarket, 93 family members, and 8224 clients of supermarket). The epidemic was caused by ZH cases and brought clustered cases in four families. A total 25 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the total infection rate of subjects was 0.30% (25/8 437) with 22 confirmed cases (0.26%, 22/8 437) and 3 asymptomatic patients (0.04%, 3/8 437), asymptomatic patients accounted for 12.00% (3/25) of all infection cases. The infection rates of supermarket employees, family members of confirmed cases and supermarket clients were 9.17% (11/120), 12.90% (12/93) and 0.02% (2/8 224). Conclusions: This was a cluster epidemic caused by one imported case of COVID-19 in a supermarket of Liaocheng city. Prevention and control of cluster epidemic should be focused on chain of community transmission and family cluster cases. It must also be an attention for transmission risk of asymptomatic patients.","Zhang, J Z; Zhou, P; Han, D B; Wang, W C; Cui, C; Zhou, R; Xu, K X; Liu, L; Wang, X H; Bai, X H; Jiang, X K",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,483

Older adults and individuals who have pre-existing chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. Hypovitaminosis D is attributed to the increased risk of lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as diabetes, cardiovascular events and associated comorbidities, which are the main causes of severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. Considering the defensive role of vitamin D, mediated through modulation of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as inhibition of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), vitamin D supplementation might boost the immune system of COVID-19 patients and reduce severity of the disease in vitamin D deficient individuals.","Honardoost, Maryam; Ghavideldarestani, Maryam; Khamseh, Mohammad E",Arch Physiol Biochem,,483

Evaluation of public perceptions, attitudes and the individuals' experience towards mask-wearing is integral to ensuring reasonable compliance and allows authorities to address concerns held by the population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of lay-people was conducted within a high volume tertiary level institution in Singapore, from 16 October to 16 November 2020. Surveys administered evaluated five questions: 1) duration of mask wear per day, 2) mask-type used, 3) perceived necessity, 4) discomfort level experienced and 5) causes for discomfort. RESULTS: Out of 402 respondents, 67.2% primarily wore disposable surgical masks. 72% felt mask-wearing was necessary to control COVID-19 transmission. 78.4% reported discomfort while wearing masks, with mean discomfort levels of 4.21 out of 10. Impairment to breathing and communication difficulties were the most common discomforts faced. Younger respondents complained of higher incidence of dermatological issues and sweating (p < 0.05). Respondents who wore masks for longer duration reported higher incidence of dermatological issues (p = 0.001) and sweating (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Even with an available vaccine, adjunctive public health measures such as mask-wearing will likely continue in order to curb COVID-19 transmission. Experience from past pandemics is likely to propagate self-protective behavior within a community. Our study identified several common mask-wearing discomforts, allowing respective organizations valuable market feedback for research and development. With appropriate public attitudes, effective mask-wearing compliance can be attained in a concerted effort against the coronavirus.","Cheok, Gideon J W; Gatot, Cheryl; Sim, Craigven H S; Ng, Y H; Tay, Kenny X K; Howe, T S; Koh, Joyce S B",Infect Dis Health,,483

449348,Active learning-based STEM education for in-person and online learning,2021,"The last two decades have witnessed two large-scale pandemics caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). At the end of 2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Wuhan, a city in the center of China, and subsequently spread rapidly to the whole world. Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2. Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control. However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Zhao, N; Zhou, Z-L; Wu, L; Zhang, X-D; Han, S-B; Bao, H-J; Shu, Y; Shu, X-G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,483

450008,Distance teaching-learning experience in early childhood education teachers during the Coronavirus pandemic,2021,"Surging dismissal of plastics into water resources results in the splintered debris generating microscopic particles called microplastics. The reduced size of microplastic makes it easier for intake by aquatic organisms resulting in amassing of noxious wastes, thereby disturbing their physiological functions. Microplastics are abundantly available and exhibit high propensity for interrelating with the ecosystem thereby disrupting the biogenic flora and fauna. About 71% of the earth surface is occupied by oceans, which holds 97% of the earth's water. The remaining 3% is present as water in ponds, streams, glaciers, ice caps, and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Microplastics can accumulate harmful pollutants from the surroundings thereby acting as transport vectors; and simultaneously can leach out chemicals (additives). Plastics in marine undergo splintering and shriveling to form micro/nanoparticles owing to the mechanical and photochemical processes accelerated by waves and sunlight, respectively. Microplastics differ in color and density, considering the type of polymers, and are generally classified according to their origins, i.e., primary and secondary. About 54.5% of microplastics floating in the ocean are polyethylene, and 16.5% are polypropylene, and the rest includes polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyester, and polyamides. Polyethylene and polypropylene due to its lower density in comparison with marine water floats and affect the oceanic surfaces while materials having higher density sink affecting seafloor. The effects of plastic debris in the water and aquatic systems from various literature and on how COVID-19 has become a reason for microplastic pollution are reviewed in this paper.","Issac, Merlin N; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,483

Although pedagogical strategies have been developed and implemented rapidly to support cognitive and affective domains of learning in HPE, less progress has occurred in psychomotor skills acquisition. Psychomotor skills, referred to as technical skills training, are underpinned by educational theories and conceptual frameworks. Considering the widening gap in learning domains, this editorial provides an overview and recommendations for developing and implementing remote training supported by educational theories, such as deliberate practice, and conceptual frameworks in technical skills acquisition in HPE. We begin by discussing the unique curricular needs for remote psychomotor skills in medical teaching-learning contexts and subsequently present a theory-driven and evidence-based model for remote psychomotor skills acquisition.","Dubrowski, A.; Kapralos, B.; Peisachovich, E.; Da Silva, C.; Torres, A.",Cureus,,483

This study aims to discover the naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors from herbal constituents, as well as to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the newly identified efficacious SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Following screening of the inhibitory potentials of eighty herbal products against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBLE) was found with the most potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activity (IC50 = 6.68 µg/mL). Inhibition assays demonstrated that the ginkgolic acids (GAs) and the bioflavones isolated from GBLE displayed relatively strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities (IC50 < 10 µM). Among all tested constituents, GA C15:0, GA C17:1 and sciadopitysin displayed potent 3CLpro inhibition activities, with IC50 values of less than 2 µM. Further inhibition kinetic studies and docking simulations clearly demonstrated that two GAs and sciadopitysin strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLprovia a reversible and mixed inhibition manner. Collectively, this study found that both GBLE and the major constituents in this herbal product exhibit strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities, which offer several promising leading compounds for developing novel anti-COVID-19 medications via targeting on 3CLpro.","Xiong, Yuan; Zhu, Guang-Hao; Wang, Hao-Nan; Hu, Qing; Chen, Li-Li; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Li, Hui-Liang; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Tang, Hui; Ge, Guang-Bo",Fitoterapia,,483

The genus of Aspergillus consist of various complexes, causing a wide spectrum of diseases from superficial infections in immunocompetent hosts to life-threatening disseminated infections among immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to identify Aspergillus species by phenotypic (total isolates) and molecular tests (35 isolates), obtained from patients in Isfahan (the third-largest city of Iran) between 2010 and 2018, and determine the susceptibility of 35 clinical isolates to itraconazole (ITR), amphotericin-B (AMB), and voriconazole (VOR). Patients and Methods: Based on clinical signs, a total of 2385 suspected cases were included in this retrospective study from January 2010 to December 2018. Direct microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide, sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, and czapekdox agar media was applied to identify etiologic agents. Thirty-five Aspergillus species collected from January 2016 to December 2018 were identified by PCR-sequencing of ITS1-5.8SrDNA-ITS2 region, and their susceptibility to ITR, AMB, and VOR was determined using E-test. Results: Based on direct microscopy and positive culture, 132 out of 2385 suspected cases had Aspergillus infection (5.5%). Fifty-four patients were male, and 78 patients were female. Patients in the age groups of 41-50 and 21-30 years had the highest and lowest frequencies, respectively. Aspergillus flavus/oryzae (n=54), A. fumigatus (n=24), A. niger (n=15), and A. terreus (n=12) were the most prevalent Aspergillus species, respectively. Among 35 Aspergillus species, the MIC ranges of AMB, ITR, and VOR for A. flavus/oryzae, A. niger, and A. terreus were (0.5-4 µg/mL; 0.5-16 µg/mL; 0.25-8 µg/mL), (1 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL), and (4-4 µg/mL, 0.5-1 µg/mL, 0.5-1 µg/mL), respectively. Conclusion: Aspergillus infections have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and often occur in immunocompromised patients. Accurate identification at the species level is essential since the emergence of cryptic species is connected to different patterns of AFST that affect patient treatment outcomes. Azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. is a global concern, and the detection of the route of resistance is pivotal to prevent and control infection.","Chadeganipour, Mostafa; Mohammadi, Rasoul",Infect Drug Resist,,483

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 100 asymptomatic Lebanese subjects that have tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Fifty patients received standard preventive treatment, mainly supplements, and the experimental group received a single dose (according to body weight) of ivermectin, in addition to the same supplements the control group received. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p = 0.06) between Ct-values of the two groups before the regimen was started (day zero), indicating that subjects in both groups had similar viral loads. At 72 h after the regimen started, the increase in Ct-values was dramatically higher in the ivermectin than in the control group. In the ivermectin group, Ct increased from 15.13 ± 2.07 (day zero) to 30.14 ± 6.22 (day three; mean ± SD), compared to the control group, where the Ct values increased only from 14.20 ± 2.48 (day zero) to 18.96 ± 3.26 (day three; mean ± SD). Moreover, more subjects in the control group developed clinical symptoms. Three individuals (6%) required hospitalization, compared to the ivermectin group (0%). CONCLUSION: Ivermectin appears to be efficacious in providing clinical benefits in a randomized treatment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects, effectively resulting in fewer symptoms, lower viral load and reduced hospital admissions.

We review different biomarkers to systematically analyzed these values to evaluate whether are they are correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease and so their ability to be a predictor for progression. METHODS: The current meta-analysis was carried out to identify relevant articles using eight different databases regarding the values of biomarkers and risk factors of significance that predict progression of mild or moderate cases into severe and critical cases. We defined the eligibility criteria using a PICO model. RESULTS: Twenty-two relevant articles were selected for meta-analysis the following biomarkers C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, LDH, neutrophil, %PD-1 expression, D-dimer, creatinine, AST and Cortisol all recorded high cut-off values linked to severe and critical cases while low lymphocyte count, and low Albumin level were recorded.

More studies are needed on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on a larger scale to establish clearer threshold values that predict progression from mild to severe cases. In addition, more biomarkers testing also help in building a scoring system for the prediction and guiding for proper timely treatment.","Khodeir, Mostafa M; Shabana, Hassan A; Alkhamiss, Abdullah S; Rasheed, Zafar; Alsoghair, Mansour; Alsagaby, Suliman A; Khan, Muhammad I; Fernández, Nelson; Al Abdulmonem, Waleed",J Infect Public Health,,483
458713,Impact of covid-19 on the air quality over china and india using long-term (2009-2020) multi-satellite data,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic is characterized by a global sense of uncertainty, partly driven by the paucity of real-life clinical data. This study assessed whether admission patient characteristics were associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. METHODS: The observational study included consecutive patients admitted to a large community teaching hospital with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 between March 6, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Comparisons were made based on the need for ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were admitted, 42 of whom (26.9%) required ICU admission and 114 (73.1%) did not. No difference in age (61.9 years vs 60.5 years, P = 0.67), race/ethnicity, or comorbidities were noted, except that patients requiring ICU care had lower serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts and higher liver function tests, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count on admission. The average time from admission to death was similar (10 days in an ICU subset vs 9.2 days in a non-ICU subset, P = 0.78), yet patients necessitating ICU care had longer hospital lengths of stay (10.2 vs 5.1 days, P = 0.0002). At the time of data extraction, 15 patients in the ICU had died, 7 were discharged from the hospital, and 20 were still admitted while 5 patients died in the non-ICU cohort with 97 discharged and 12 patients admitted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study assessing clinical differences based on the need for ICU admission in inpatients with SARS-CoV-2. It found few major differences in clinical variables between subsets. Among patients admitted to the ICU, outcomes were generally poor.","Snipelisky, David; Johnson, Rachel; Prasad, Rajnish; Lakhani, Baqir; Ellington, Jeffrey",South Med J,,483

However, state-of-the-art microscopy techniques and continuum modelling approaches focus on large length and time scales. Here, we perform component-based computer simulations of polar filaments and molecular motors linking microscopic interactions and activity to self-organisation and dynamics from the two-filament level up to the mesoscopic domain level. Dynamic filament crosslinking and sliding, and excluded-volume interactions promote formation of bundles at small densities, and of active polar nematics at high densities. A buckling-type instability sets the size of polar domains and the density of topological defects. We predict a universal scaling of the active diffusion coefficient and the domain size with activity, and its dependence on parameters like motor concentration and filament persistence length. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of cytoplasmic streaming in cells and help to develop design strategies for novel engineered active materials.","Vliegenthart, Gerrit; Ravichandran, Arvind; Ripoll, Marisol; Auth, Thorsten; Gompper, Gerhard",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07904v1.pdf,483

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of depression seems to be increasing in the general population.It is likely that depression will be even more of a problem for CVD patients in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.New studies confirm the independent association of depression with later incident CVD, although perhaps not as strong as suggested by some previous studies.Depression seems to be becoming even more prevalent in CVD patients, with new data for stroke and peripheral arterial disease patients.Cardiologists rarely screen for depression and most do not believe that they have a responsibility for detecting or treating depression.There are new data suggesting that patients who are more in control of their lives have better outcomes and that change is possible. SUMMARY: Depression is preventable and treatable. It is imperative to detect and manage depression in CVD patients. Additional research is required to see whether or not comprehensive patient screening for depression translates into both better quality of life and improved clinical outcomes.","Hare, David L",Curr Opin Lipidol,,483

While the main focus of these committees has been on setting up strategies that facilitate the swift distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, the role of effective public health awareness should not be ignored. Countries must devise strategies on how best to enhance public understanding and curb misinformation about the vaccines. With this viewpoint, we unpack the threat of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and offer recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine communication strategies in the South African and Zimbabwean contexts.","Dzinamarira, Tafadzwa; Nachipo, Brian; Phiri, Bright; Musuka, Godfrey",,,483
462626,Teaching in times of corona: a look at the challenges from the perspective of research on learning and instruction,2020,"Understanding the drivers of plant phenology is critical to predict the impact of future warming on terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling and feedbacks to climate. Using indoor growth chambers, air humidity is reported to influence spring phenology in temperate trees. However, previous studies have not investigated the effect of air humidity on the spring phenology using long-term and large-scale ground observations. Therefore, the role of humidity in spring phenology in temperate trees still remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized 229,588 records of leaf unfolding dates in eight temperate tree species, including four early-successional and four late-successional species, at 1716 observation sites during 1951-2015 in Europe, and comprehensively analyzed the effect of humidity on the spring phenology. We found that rising humidity significantly delayed spring leaf unfolding for all eight temperate tree species. Leaf unfolding was more sensitive to humidity in early-successional species compared to late-successional species. In addition, the delaying effect of humidity on leaf unfolding increased as temperature warmed over the past 65 years. Our results provide evidence that spring leaf unfolding of temperate trees was significantly delayed by rising humidity. The delaying effect of humidity may restrict earlier spring phenology induced by warming, especially for early-successional species, under future climate warming scenarios in temperate forests.","He, Xujian; Chen, Shanshan; Wang, Jinmei; Smith, Nicholas G; Rossi, Sergio; Yang, Hongjun; Liu, Jianquan; Chen, Lei",Sci Total Environ,,483

As members of the journal's editorial board, we are strongly supportive of open debate in science, which is essential even on highly contentious issues. However, we must also be thorough in our examination of the facts and open to changing our minds when new information arises. In this commentary, we document several important errors in the manuscript by Dr. Risch, review the literature he presented and demonstrate why it is not of sufficient quality to support scale up of HCQ+AZ, and then discuss the literature that has been generated since his publication, which also does not support use of this therapy. Unfortunately, the current scientific evidence does not support HCQ+AZ as an effective treatment for COVID-19, if it ever did; and even suggests many risks. Continuing to push the view that it is an essential treatment in the face of this evidence is irresponsible and harmful to the many people already suffering from infection.","Fox, Matthew P; D039,; Agostino McGowan, Lucy; James, Bryan D; Lessler, Justin; Mehta, Shruti H; Murray, Eleanor J",Am J Epidemiol,,483

A retrospective study was conducted that consisted of a primary cohort with 315 COVID-19 patients and two validation cohorts with 69 and 123 patients, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent risks of progression to critical. An individualized prediction model was developed, and calibration, decision curve, and clinical impact curves were used to assess the performance of the model. External validations for the predictive nomogram were also provided. The variables of age, comorbid diseases, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, d-dimer, C-reactive protein, and platelet count were estimated to be independent predictors of progression to critical, which were incorporated to establish a model of the nomogram. It demonstrated good discrimination (with a C-index of 0.923) and calibration. Good discrimination (C-index, 0.882 and 0.906) and calibration were also noted on applying the nomogram in two validation cohorts. The clinical relevance of the nomogram was justified by the decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis. This study presents an individualized prediction nomogram incorporating six clinical characteristics, which can be conveniently applied to assess an individual's risk of progressing to critical COVID-19.","Xu, Ranran; Cui, Junwei; Hu, Liu; Wang, Yiru; Wang, Tao; Ye, Dawei; Lv, Yongman; Liu, Qingquan",J. med. virol,,483

This new approach works well even when there are many more features than countries and is not affected by high correlation of features. It is inspired by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure from linear algebra. We study the number of deaths, which is more reliable than the number of cases at the onset of the pandemic, during Apr/May 2020. This is while countries started taking measures, so more light will be shed on the root causes of the pandemic rather than on its handling. The analysis is done against a comprehensive list of roughly 3,200 features. We find that globalization is the main contributing cause, followed by calcium intake, economic factors, environmental factors, preventative measures, and others. This analysis was done for 20 different dates and shows that some factors, like calcium, phase in or out over time. We also compute row explainability, i.e. for every country, how much each feature explains the death rate. Finally we also study a series of conditions, e.g. comorbidities, immunization, etc. which have been proposed to explain the pandemic and place them in their proper context. While there are many caveats to this analysis, we believe it sheds light on the possible causes of the Covid-19 pandemic. One-Sentence SummaryWe use a novel feature importance technique to find that globalization, followed by calcium intake, economic factors, environmental factors, and some aspects of societal quality are the main country-level data that explain early Covid-19 death rates.","Gonnet, Gaston; Stewart, John; Lafleur, Joseph; Keith, Stephen; McLellan, Mark; Jiang-Gorsline, David; Snider, Tim",,,483

In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing. RESULTS: Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1400 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63 (91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff. CONCLUSIONS: Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to reopening.","Gillespie, Darria L; Meyers, Lauren A; Lachmann, Michael; Redd, Stephen C; Zenilman, Jonathan M",J Sch Health,,483

Due to its diverse range of applications and the use of natural radiation, muography is being applied across many fields such as geology, archaeology, civil engineering, nuclear reactor monitoring, nuclear waste characterization, underground surveys, etc. Muons can be detected using various detector technologies, among which, resistive plate chambers (RPC) are a very cost effective choice. RPCs are planar detectors which use ionization in a thin gas gap to detect cosmic muons, already used since years in major particle accelerator experiments. We have developed a muon telescope (or muoscope) composed of small scale RPCs. The design goal for our muoscope is to be portable and autonomous, in order to take data in places that are not easily accessible. The whole setup is light and compact, such to be easily packed in a car trunk. Individual RPCs are hosted in gas-tight aluminium cases. There is no need for gas bottles, once the chambers are filled. The muoscope can be controlled from a reasonable distance using wireless connection. In this paper, we summarize the guiding principles of our project and present some recent developments and future prospects, including a long-term stability study of the resistivity of the semiconductive coating obtained with serigraphy.","Gamage, R.M.I.D; Basnet, S.; Gil, E.

OBJECTIVE: To attempt to establish incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients in an international cohort. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective, multicenter study of consecutive patients admitted with AIS and COVID-19 was undertaken from March 1 to May 1, 2020 at 12 stroke centers from 4 countries. Out of those 12 centers, 9 centers admitted all types of strokes and data from those were used to calculate the incidence rate of AIS. Three centers exclusively transferred LVO stroke (LVOs) patients and were excluded only for the purposes of calculating the incidence of AIS. Detailed data were collected on consecutive LVOs in hospitalized patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) across all 12 centers. RESULTS: Out of 6698 COVID-19 patients admitted to 9 stroke centers, the incidence of stroke was found to be 1.3% (interquartile range [IQR] 0.75%-1.7%). The median age of LVOs patients was 51 yr (IQR 50-75 yr), and in the US centers, African Americans comprised 28% of patients. Out of 66 LVOs, 10 patients (16%) were less than 50 yr of age. Among the LVOs eligible for MT, the average time from symptom onset to presentation was 558 min (IQR 82-695 min). A total of 21 (50%) patients were either discharged to home or discharged to acute rehabilitation facilities. CONCLUSION: LVO was predominant in patients with AIS and COVID-19 across 2 continents, occurring at a significantly younger age and affecting African Americans disproportionately in the USA.","Khandelwal, Priyank; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Tiwari, Ambooj; Singla, Amit; Dmytriw, Adam A; Piano, Mariangela; Quilici, Luca; Pero, Guglielmo; Renieri, Leonardo; Limbucci, Nicola; Martínez-Galdámez, Mario; Schüller-Arteaga, Miguel; Galván, Jorge; Arenillas-Lara, Juan Francisco; Hashim, Zafar; Nayak, Sanjeev; Desousa, Keith; Sun, Hai; Agarwalla, Pankaj K; Nanda, Anil; Roychowdhury, J Sudipta; Nourollahzadeh, Emad; Prakash, Tannavi; Gandhi, Chirag D; Xavier, Andrew R; Lozano, J Diego; Gupta, Gaurav; Yavagal, Dileep R",Neurosurgery,,483

We hypothesized that radiation departments would adjust their work patterns and RT protocols in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Materials and methods: An electronic survey was sent during April 2020 to an international sample of radiation oncologists. The survey explored various aspects of departmental preparedness, and changes to their institutional RT protocols. Results: A total of 68 radiation oncologists from 13 countries answered the survey. Healthcare systems were at least moderately affected in 76%. Most institutes appeared well prepared for the outbreak: regarding the availability of personal protective equipment, tests, and telemedicine/videoconference facilities. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 was applied in 59% of responders. Modification of RT protocols were minor in 66%, significant in 19% and no changes made in 15%. The extent to which protocols were modified correlated with overall healthcare disruption (p = 0.028). Normal fractionation was recommended to continue in 83% and 85% of head & neck, and cervical cancers vs. 64% of lung cancers (p = 0.001). In case the pandemic worsens, there was strong agreement to prioritize RT for aggressive cancers (80%), delay RT for slow-growing tumors (78%) and change to evidance-based hypofractionations protocols (79.4%). The option of delayed/omitted adjuvant RT (not site specific) was selected in 47%. Conclusion: This international survey concludes that, by making significant organizational adjustments and minor protocol modifications, RT may be safely continued during this pandemic. If the crisis worsens, there was strong agreement to continue the treatment of aggressive tumors and utilize evidence-based hypofractionated protocols.","Appel, S.; Lawrence, Y.

469171,Review of Whole System Simulation Methodologies for Assessing Mobility as a Service (MaaS) as an Enabler for Sustainable Urban Mobility,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study, conducted in China, evaluated the effectiveness of four different themes of health warning labels (HWLs) that used both text and pictures: (1) self-harm from using cigarettes, (2) harming family or children with secondhand smoke, (3) reinforcing compliance with existing smoke-free policies and (4) anticigarette gift giving practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional randomised experimental survey was conducted among 3247 adult (aged 18+ years) participants in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2017, using quotas for age group, gender and smoking status. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four HWL themes. Each participant viewed eight HWLs and rated how effective these themed-labels were in terms of credibility, raising awareness of health harms of smoking on family and children, improving compliance with public smoking bans, stopping the practice of gifting cigarettes, thinking about quitting and preventing smoking using a 10-point scale, with 10 being most effective. Analysis of variance and independent t-tests were used to analyse these data. FINDINGS: All four HWL themes performed well for each outcome with average ratings >6.5. Harming family or children with secondhand smoke was the theme that received the highest ratings for each outcome, with credibility (8.0, 95% CI 7.86 to 8.09) and prevention of smoking (8.8, 95% CI 8.63 to 8.91) outcomes being significantly higher (p<0.05). Overall, analysis of ratings by gender, income and education did not impact outcomes. CONCLUSION: All four HWL themes tested could be effective in China; the theme of secondhand smoke harming family or children may be a particularly credible/effective theme.","Nian, Qinghua; Hardesty, Jeffrey J; Cohen, Joanna E; Xie, Xiangqiang; Kennedy, Ryan David",Tob. control,,483

DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: Five community hospitals within 1 urban health system. PATIENTS: Adult patients whom received tocilizumab between March 27th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020 for severe COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen patients in total were evaluated from the 5 community hospitals. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 53.9 ± 9.2 years, 56% were men, and the most common comorbidities present on admission were hypertension (31%) and diabetes mellitus (25%). All patients received at least 1 other treatment modality for COVID-19 (steroids, hydroxychloroquine, or convaslescent plasma). Additionally, all patients on admission to intensive care units had severe COVID-19 with 56% requiring mechanical ventilation with a pre-tocilizumab median (IQR) Pao2: Fio2 of 84 (69 - 108.6), 19% requiring vasopressor support, and inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6) were elevated. The median (IQR) tocilizumab dose was 400 mg (400-600) which correlated with a weight-based mean (± SD) dose of 5.4 mg/kg ± 1.3. Of the 16 patients that received tocilizumab, 8 (50%) were discharged home, 7 (44%) died, and 1 (6%) was still hospitalized at the end of data collection. Patients who died were more likely to be older 62 ± 2 years, female (57%), had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation (86%) and vasopressors (43%) use at baseline, and had a higher median (IQR) IL-6 level prior to tocilizumab administration 550 pg/mL (IQR 83-1924).

472680,ACDC-Tracing: Towards Anonymous Citizen-Driven Contact Tracing,2020-04-16,"COVID-19-related disruptions led to a historic rise in the spread between livestock and wholesale meat prices. Concerns about concentration and allegations of anticompetitive behavior have led to several inquiries and civil suits by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Justice, with increases in price differentials serving as a focal point. This article notes the difference between price spreads and marketing margins, outlines corresponding economic theory, and describes the empirical evidence on wholesale meat and livestock price dynamics in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions. At one point during the pandemic, beef and pork packers were both operating at about 60% of the previous year's processing volume. We explore how such a massive supply shock would be expected to affect marketing margins even in the absence of anti-competitive behavior. Moreover, we document how margin measurements are critically sensitive to the selection of data and information utilized. Finally, we conclude with some discussion around policy proposals that would pit industry concentration against industry coordination and economies of scale.","Lusk, Jayson L; Tonsor, Glynn T; Schulz, Lee L",,,483

A recent study used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify the composition of the gut microbiome and identify predictive biomarkers of infection with limited taxonomic resolution. METHODS: To achieve increased resolution of gut microbial factors associated with V. cholerae susceptibility and identify predictors of symptomatic disease, we applied deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing to a cohort of household contacts of patients with cholera. RESULTS: Using machine learning, we resolved species, strains, gene families, and cellular pathways in the microbiome at the time of exposure to V. cholerae to identify markers that predict infection and symptoms. Use of metagenomic features improved the precision and accuracy of prediction relative to 16S sequencing. We also predicted disease severity, although with greater uncertainty than our infection prediction. Species within the genera Prevotella and Bifidobacterium predicted protection from infection, and genes involved in iron metabolism also correlated with protection. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the power of metagenomics to predict disease outcomes and suggest specific species and genes for experimental testing to investigate mechanisms of microbiome-related protection from cholera.","Levade, Inès; Saber, Morteza M; Midani, Firas; Chowdhury, Fahima; Khan, Ashraful I; Begum, Yasmin A; Ryan, Edward T; David, Lawrence A; Calderwood, Stephen B; Harris, Jason B; LaRocque, Regina C; Qadri, Firdausi; Shapiro, B Jesse; Weil, Ana A",J. infect. dis,,483

In the absence of a vaccine, natural selection will favor variants with higher transmissibility rates. However, when a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated, natural selection will shift towards favoring variants that can resist the vaccine. These variants can therefore become dominant and even cancel out the benefit of the vaccine. This paper develops a compartmental model which simulates this phenomenon and shows how various vaccination strategies can lead to the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants.","Bongiorno, Christian; Cagnol, John",,,483

Social media is increasingly used to share news and opinions about it. A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.","Furqan, Rustam Madiha Khalid Waqar Aslam Rupapara V.; Arif, Mehmood Choi GyuSang",PLoS ONE,,483

An illustrated and curiosity-driven public engagement campaign was designed to advertise survey participation, and performance compared with a standard approach using randomised controlled A/B Split tests. The 'Caretoon' approach featured comic illustrations, appealed to goodwill and was intended to pique curiosity. This linked to an illustrated version of the survey which, upon completion, gave a personalised comic summary showing how respondent's answers compared with national averages. The standard ad and survey were not illustrated with comics, and did not provide a personalised comic summary on completion. Both approaches were cost- and time-effective, together resulting in 18,788 responses over six days. The Caretoon approach outperformed the standard approach in terms of the number of people reached, engaged, survey link clicks, gender and ethnic diversity amongst respondents, and cost-effectiveness of advertising. This came at the expense of a small reduction in the proportion of completed surveys and male respondents. The research evidences objective value of public engagement activity, comics and curiosity as tools which can support Public Health research on a national scale.","Kearns, Ciléin; Kearns, Nethmi; Braithwaite, Irene; Shortt, Nick; Eathorne, Allie; Semprini, Alex; Beasley, Richard",J Vis Commun Med,,483

However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it.

Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis-involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single-atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to the LA Nursery registry. Appropriate use of PPE in each of the five clinical scenarios was defined by the authors based on CDC guidelines. The scenarios ranged from communal hospital space to carrying out Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP). 1760 HCP participated between June-July 2020. RESULTS: The average adherence in LA was lowest for carrying out AGPs scenario at 39.5% compliance and highest for patient contact when COVID-19 not suspected scenario at 82.8% compliance. Adherence among parishes varied widely. Commentary to suggest a shortage of PPE supply and the practice of re-using PPE was strong. CONCLUSIONS: Use of appropriate PPE varied by setting. It was higher in scenarios where only face masks (or respirators) were the standard (i.e., community hospital or when COVID-19 not suspected) and lower in scenarios where additional PPE (e.g., gloves, eye protection, and isolation gown) were required. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: As HCP are at the forefront of efforts to contain the coronavirus, the factors underlying variable adherence to CDC protocols in LA need to be further analyzed and addressed.","Aggarwal, A.; Darwish, O.

Reflexively, we wondered how the youth, families, and issues we were connected to would be impacted by the pandemic. We were pulled into both ethical and methodological questions. While the procedural ethics of maintaining safety were clear, what became less clear were the relational ethics. What was brought into question were our own social positions and our roles and responsibilities in our relationships with the youth. For both ethical and methodological reasons, we decided to expand the original research scope from in-person interviews to include a photovoice to be executed using online, remote methods.

In view of the rapid spread of the virus, it is necessary to study the sociodemographic characteristics, hygiene habits, activity and mobility, and comorbidities of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be able to implement prevention strategies. For this purpose, a survey including the variables of interest was designed to try to understand the exponential spread of the virus despite the implemented severe restrictive mobility measures during the period of maximum confinement in Spain. This study conducted throughout the Spanish territory aims to clarify other routes of transmission of the COVID-19 during confinement, risk factors, and the effectiveness of the recommended hygiene measures to detect critical points of exposure to the virus and thus reduce its spread in this and possible future pandemics that could compromise public health. Our results show that living with a COVID-19 patient increased the risk of contagion by 60 times. Among all the sociodemographic variables analyzed, walking the dog have shown to have the strongest effect by increasing the risk by 78%. The most effective hygiene measure reducing the prevalence of the disease was the disinfection of products purchased from the market upon arrival home (which reduced the risk by 94%), above other hygiene measures, such as wearing masks, gloves, ethanol disinfection, bleaching and others. The mobility variable studied that showed the largest increase in the prevalence of the disease was working on site at the workplace (increased the risk by 76%). A significant higher prevalence of the disease was also detected among respondents who used the modality of acquiring basic commodities using home delivery service compared to those who chose in-store shopping.","Rodríguez-Barranco, Miguel; Rivas-García, Lorenzo; Quiles, José L; Redondo-Sánchez, Daniel; Aranda-Ramírez, Pilar; Llopis-González, Juan; Sánchez Pérez, María José; Sánchez-González, Cristina",Environ Res,,483
488800,Collecting money through blockchain technologies: first insights on the determinants of the return on Initial Coin Offerings,2020,"Interactive Student Activities Management System (iSAMS) is a web-based system in Universiti Teknologi MARA Cawangan Melaka that provides information on student bodies and activities. iSAMS developed to react as an integrated management platform during the COVID-19 outbreak since student activities are essential and need to carry out. This research's main objective was to investigate how the iSAMS interface and functions affect users' intentions and attitudes when using the system. Thus, we explored the key predictors of user acceptance of iSAMS and proposed the theoretical model for user acceptance. A conceptual structural model was developed by integrating heuristic evaluation (HE) and technology acceptance model (TAM) to identify which key predictors influence the user acceptance of iSAMS. We adopted HE and TAM in developing the model, and as the outcome, we categorized HE into three categories: system support, user interface design, and navigation. Then, we identified three of TAM’s predictors, which are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioural intention to use. The hypothesis supported each of the predictors as the measurement since we required improvements for the iSAMS usability. The proposed research framework is simple to implement and can be adapted for other developed systems since it is essential in determining the system's usability and user acceptance. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

489635,"Re-visioning Ideological Assemblages Through De-punctualizing and Activist Science, Mathematics and Technology Education",2021,"Arsenic (As) is widely used in the modern industry, especially in the production of pesticides, herbicides, wood preservatives, and semiconductors. The sources of As such as contaminated water, air, soil, but also food, can cause serious human diseases. The complex mechanism of As toxicity in the human body is associated with the generation of free radicals and the induction of oxidative damage in the cell. One effective strategy in reducing the toxic effects of As is the usage of chelating agents, which provide the formation of inert chelator-metal complexes with their further excretion from the body. This review discusses different aspects of the use of metal chelators, alone or in combination, in the treatment of As poisoning. Consideration is given to the therapeutic effect of thiol chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, penicillamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other recent agents against As toxicity. The review also considers the possible role of flavonoids, trace elements, and herbal drugs as promising natural chelating and detoxifying agents.","Bjørklund, Geir; Oliinyk, Petro; Lysiuk, Roman; Rahaman, Md Shiblur; Antonyak, Halyna; Lozynska, Iryna; Lenchyk, Larysa; Peana, Massimiliano",Arch Toxicol,,483

In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the geriatric psychiatric population in particular is vulnerable to both the physical and mental toll COVID-19 may cause. Recently, socially assistive robots have gained attention for their ability to aid in the care of the geriatric psychiatry population and are being explored as a realistic way to deliver certain elements of psychiatric care that have the potential to be safe even in the setting of COVID-19. The results of this review indicate that robots are in the early stages of clinical applicability, they display usability for a range of psychiatric indications, and their impact on clinical care is notable. We project that in the next few years, robotic applications will be tailored to address clinical outcomes with a greater degree of precision and efficacy.","Kulpa, Emily; Rahman, Aniqa T; Vahia, Ipsit V",Int Rev Psychiatry,,483

This is a comprehensive meta-analysis of the prevalence of depression in HIV-infected MSM. METHODS: Relevant publications were systematically searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Comparative and epidemiological studies with prevalence of depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were included. The prevalence of depression was pooled using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies with 7653 MSM with HIV and 3395 MSM without HIV were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in MSM living with HIV was 43% (95%CI: 32%-53%). Compared to MSM without HIV, MSM living with HIV were more likely to be depressed (ORâ¯=â¯1.46, 1.05-2.03). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that different CES-D cut-off values and survey year had significant moderating effects on the prevalence of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Depression was common in MSM living with HIV. Considering the negative effects of depression on health outcomes and wellbeing, regular screening for depression and effective treatment and interventions should be developed for this vulnerable population.","Xiao, Le; Qi, Han; Wang, Yuan-Yuan; Wang, Di; Wilkinson, Meredith; Hall, Brian J; Ungvari, Gabor S; Wang, Gang; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,483

The author intents to use this model to predict the COVID19 cases by using daily reported data from Michigan, New York City, U.S.A and other countries. The piece wise Crow-AMSAA (CA) model fits the data very well for the infected cases and deaths at different phases during the start of the COVID19 outbreak. The slope β of the Crow-AMSAA line indicates the speed of the transmission or death rate. The traditional epidemiological model is based on the exponential distribution, but the Crow-AMSAA is the Non Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) which can be used to modeling the complex problem like COVID19, especially when the various mitigation strategies such as social distance, isolation and locking down were implemented by the government at different places.This paper is to use piece wise Crow-AMSAA method to fit the COVID19 confirmed cases in Michigan, New York City, U.S.A and other countries.","Wang, Yanshuo",Infect.

We use it to evaluate expected shortages under different configurations commonly seen for supply chains of generic injectable oncology drugs. We also consider two proposed policies: improving component quality to reduce disruptions and decreasing the time to recovery. In either case, with a lean supply chain, we observe that expected shortages could drop to 5%, from a baseline of 10%. We also consider the profitability of different configurations and present the breakeven prices for different levels of reliability. The results from our analyses could lead to immediate policy impact, providing evidence of the benefits of redundancy and improving facility quality.

Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan.","Rodriguez, Thalia; Dobrovolny, Hana M",Virus Res,,483
501502,Repositioning Sustainability,2020,"Respiratory rate (RR) is a clinical sign representing ventilation. An abnormal change in RR is often the first sign of health deterioration as the body attempts to maintain oxygen delivery to its tissues. There has been a growing interest in remotely monitoring of RR in everyday settings which has made photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring wearable devices an attractive choice. PPG signals are useful sources for RR extraction due to the presence of respiration-induced modulations in them. The existing PPG-based RR estimation methods mainly rely on hand-crafted rules and manual parameters tuning. An end-to-end deep learning approach was recently proposed, however, despite its automatic nature, the performance of this method is not ideal using the real world data. In this paper, we present an end-to-end and accurate pipeline for RR estimation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to reconstruct respiratory signals from raw PPG signals. Our results demonstrate a higher RR estimation accuracy of up to 2$\times$ (mean absolute error of 1.9$\pm$0.3 using five fold cross validation) compared to the state-of-th-art using a identical publicly available dataset. Our results suggest that CycleGAN can be a valuable method for RR estimation from raw PPG signals.","Aqajari, Seyed Amir Hossein; Cao, Rui; Zargari, Amir Hosein Afandizadeh; Rahmani, Amir M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00594v2.pdf,483

503822,Digital contact tracing: Large-scale geolocation data as an alternative to bluetooth-based apps failure,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 threatens global public health, and there is an urgent public health need to assess acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests might provide results that can be complementary to or confirm suspected COVID-19 cases and reveal previous infection. The performance of serological assays (sensitivity and specificity) has to be evaluated before their use in the general population. The neutralisation capacity of the produced antibodies also has to be evaluated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We set up a prospective, multicentric clinical study to evaluate the performance of serological kits among a population of healthcare workers presenting mild symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four hundred symptomatic healthcare workers will be included in the COVID-SER study. The values obtained from a control cohort included during the prepandemic time will be used as reference. A workflow was set up to study serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate antibody neutralisation capacity in patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests will be assessed using molecular detection of the virus as a reference. The measurement of IgM and IgG antibodies will be performed once per week for 6 consecutive weeks and then at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after the diagnosis. The kinetics of IgM and IgG will determine the optimal period to perform serological testing. The proportion of false negative PCR tests in symptomatic subjects will be determined on the basis of subsequent seroconversions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the national review board for biomedical research in April 2020 (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée I, Marseille, France) (ID RCB 2020-A00932-37).

504050,Resilience of the Milan distribution network in presence of extreme events: Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan would improve preparation for and prevention of a massive outbreak. METHODS: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was developed using the LINE app to evaluate the current Japanese epidemiological situation. LINE users could participate in the system either though a QR code page in the prefectures' websites or a banner at the top of the LINE app screen. COOPERA asked participants questions regarding personal information, preventive actions, and non-specific symptoms related to COVID-19 and their duration. We calculated daily cross correlation functions between the reported number of infected cases confirmed using polymerase chain reaction and the symptom-positive group captured by COOPERA. RESULTS: We analyzed 206,218 participants from three prefectures reported between March 5 and 30, 2020. The mean age of participants was 44.2 (standard deviation, 13.2) years. No symptoms were reported by 96.93% of participants, but there was a significantly positive correlation between the reported number of COVID-19 cases and self-reported fevers, suggesting that massive monitoring of fever might help to estimate the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in real time. CONCLUSIONS: COOPERA is the first real-time system being used to monitor trends in COVID-19 in Japan and provides useful insights to assist political decisions to tackle the epidemic.","Yoneoka, Daisuke; Kawashima, Takayuki; Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Ejima, Keisuke; Shi, Shoi; Eguchi, Akifumi; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Sakamoto, Haruka; Kunishima, Hiroyuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Miyata, Hiroaki",J Epidemiol,,483

We performed network meta-analyses to determine differences in blood cells, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical stages. METHODS: Databases were systematically searched to May 2, 2020, and updated on June 1, 2020. Network meta-analyses were conducted via Stata 15.0, and the mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI were used as the effect values of the pooled analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-one studies were included involving 8647 COVID-19 patients, White blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEUT), IL-6, and IL-10 counts increased significantly with worsening of the COVID-19, while lymphocyte (LYM) counts decreased. The levels of platelet (PLT), CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells in severe and critical patients were significantly lower than those in mild patients. IL-1ß count was significantly elevated in critical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Immune suppression and inflammatory injury play crucial roles in the progression of COVID-19, and the identification of susceptible cells and cytokines provide guidance for the early and accurate treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Yan, Wu; Chen, Danrong; Bigambo, Francis Manyori; Wei, Hongcheng; Wang, Xu; Xia, Yankai",BMC Infect Dis,,483
505090,Influencing subjective well-being for business and sustainable development using big data and predictive regression analysis,2020,"Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection is a global public health issue, that has now affected more than 200 countries worldwide and caused a second wave of pandemic. Severe adult respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is associated with a high risk of mortality. However, prognostic factors predicting poor clinical outcomes of individual patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia remain under intensive investigation. We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to four hospitals in Wuhan, China from December 2019 to February 2020. Mortality at the end of the follow up period was the primary outcome. Factors predicting mortality were also assessed and a prognostic model was developed, calibrated and validated. The study included 492 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were divided into three cohorts: the training cohort (n = 237), the validation cohort 1 (n = 120), and the validation cohort 2 (n = 135). Multivariate analysis showed that five clinical parameters were predictive of mortality at the end of follow up period, including advanced age [odds ratio (OR), 1.1/years increase (p < 0.001)], increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [(NLR) OR, 1.14/increase (p < 0.001)], elevated body temperature on admission [OR, 1.53/°C increase (p = 0.005)], increased aspartate transaminase [OR, 2.47 (p = 0.019)], and decreased total protein [OR, 1.69 (p = 0.018)]. Furthermore, the prognostic model drawn from the training cohort was validated with validation cohorts 1 and 2 with comparable area under curves (AUC) at 0.912, 0.928, and 0.883, respectively. While individual survival probabilities were assessed, the model yielded a Harrell's C index of 0.758 for the training cohort, 0.762 for the validation cohort 1, and 0.711 for the validation cohort 2, which were comparable among each other. A validated prognostic model was developed to assist in determining the clinical prognosis for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Using this established model, individual patients categorized in the high risk group were associated with an increased risk of mortality, whereas patients predicted to be in the low risk group had a higher probability of survival.","Mei, Qi; Wang, Amanda Y; Bryant, Amy; Yang, Yang; Li, Ming; Wang, Fei; Zhao, Jia Wei; Ma, Ke; Wu, Liang; Chen, Huawen; Luo, Jinlong; Du, Shangming; Halfter, Kathrin; Li, Yong; Kurts, Christian; Hu, Guangyuan; Yuan, Xianglin; Li, Jian",Sci Rep,,483

Using hybrids approach, we constructed a novel series of cationic surfactant-sulfonamide conjugates (3a-g) through quaternization of the as-prepared sulfonamide derivatives (2a-g) with n-hexadecyl iodide followed by structural characterization by spectroscopy (IR and NMR). Being collective properties required in petroleum-processing environment, the petro-collecting/dispersing capacities on the surface of waters with different degrees of mineralization, and the antimicrobial performance against microbes and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) that mitigate microbiological corrosion were investigated for the synthesized conjugates. Among these conjugates, 3g (2.5% aq. solution) exhibited the strongest ability to disperse the thin petroleum film on the seawater surface, whereas KD is 95.33% after 96 h. In diluted form, 3f collected the petroleum layer on distilled water surface (Kmax = 32.01) for duration exceeds 4 days. Additionally, almost all compounds revealed high potency and comparable action with standard antimicrobials, especially 3b and 3f, which emphasize their role as potential biocides. Regarding biocidal activity against SRB, 3g causes a significant reduction in the bacterial count from 2.8 × 106 cells/mL to Nil. Moreover, the conducted molecular docking study confirms the strong correlation between RNA polymerase binding with bioactivity against microbes over other studied proteins (threonine synthase and cyclooxygenase-2).","Tantawy, Ahmed H; Shaban, Mahmoud M; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Man-Qun; Mohamed, Hany I",J Mol Liq,,483

Notwithstanding, strategic management scholars have made little progress in understanding the reasons for these differences in performance, particularly in unstable macroeconomic environments such as Latin America. In this study, we link literatures on entrepreneurship and improvisation to create an integrative model that indicates characteristics and capabilities that enable a firm to adapt successfully to the recessionary environment. We use survey data from Brazilian firms on the 2008-2009 global recession, and we find that the firms that have superior performance in recessions are those that had, before the recession, 1) a propensity to recognize opportunities and 2) improvisation capabilities for fast and creative actions.

508352,Frontline Employees’ Display of Fake Smiles and Angry Faces: When and Why They Influence Service Performance,2020,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, a new human infectious disease. While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Thus, assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and tight control of hemodynamic parameters upon admission are crucial to minimize mortality and morbidity in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with central nervous system symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke.","Wang, Haili; Tang, Xiaojia; Fan, Hongyang; Luo, Yuhan; Song, Yuxia; Xu, Yao; Chen, Yingzhu",Aging (Albany NY),,483

512984,A knowledge hiding approach to cope with COVID-19: A Comparison between Spain and China,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought restriction to the movement of people due to the implementation of lockdown across various regions around the world. In India, most of the patients belong to rural areas and hence were unable to come for a follow-up visit. Hence, we reached out to patients on oral anticoagulation using telemedicine with aim of communicating with the patient concerning drug compliance, titration of dose of anticoagulation, health education, and identification of high-risk patients needing referral to the nearest health facility/our institute. This study was conducted at the Hero DMC heart institute (a tertiary care center for cardiac diseases). The study design is cross-sectional and involves a comparison of the pre-COVID-19 phase with the COVID-19 phase. We asked a five-component (Likert scale) questionnaire from patients for satisfaction after the consult. All symptoms, need for hospitalization and clinical events were recorded. The events were compared in both groups. RESULTS: We contacted 628 patients through telemedicine and 600 patients gave consent for participation in the study. For comparison, we analyzed data of 614 patients in the pre-COVID-19 phase. The mean age during the pre-COVID-19 phase was 55.27 + 17.09 years and the COVID-19 phase was 56.97 + 15.09 years with males more than females in both groups. There was no significant difference in the number of patients on oral anticoagulants and novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC). However, there were higher number of patients on antiplatelets in the pre-COVID phase (p value0.01). 37% in the pre-COVID-19 phase and 40.31 % in the COVID-19 phase were noted to have out of target range INR (International normalized ratio). There was no difference in the number of bleeding or thromboembolic events seen. Patient response as assessed by a questionnaire (Likert scale) showed that >75% of patients were satisfied. CONCLUSION: Through telemedicine, we were able to approach our patients on oral anticoagulation and achieved titration of anti-coagulation, and health education similar to pre-COVID-19 times. During pandemics, telemedicine offers a promising option for patient management with chronic cardiac conditions. It also provides us an opportunity for the management of patients on oral anticoagulation involving titration of drug dosages (anti-coagulation), identification of high-risk patients, and health education.","Singh, Gurbhej; Kapoor, Samir; Bansal, Vasu; Grewal, Mehtab; Singh, Bhupinder; Goyal, Abhishek; Tandon, Rohit; Chhabra, Shibba Takkar; Aslam, Naved; Wander, Gurpreet Singh; Mohan, Bishav",Egypt Heart J,,483

Prospective memory (PM) is reliably impaired in HIV disease and is related to laboratory-based measures of medication management capacity in other populations. This study examined whether PM shows veridicality in relationship to online pharmacy navigation skills in persons with HIV disease. METHOD: Participants included 98 persons with HIV disease age 50 and older who completed the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) and the Medication-Management Test-Revised (MMT-R) as part of a neuropsychological study. Participants also completed the Test of Online Pharmacy Skills (TOPS), which required them to navigate a simulated, experimenter-controlled online pharmacy to perform several naturalistic tasks (e.g., refill an existing prescription). RESULTS: Lower PM had medium associations with poorer MMT-R and TOPS accuracy scores that were not better explained by other neurocognitive functions. The association between PM and TOPS accuracy was driven by errors of omission and did not vary meaningfully based on whether the intention was cued by time or an event. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PM cue detection processes show veridicality with online pharmacy navigation skills.

Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy. The characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD remain unclear. DESIGN: This Italian prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19. Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death). RESULTS: Between 11 and 29 March 2020, 79 patients with IBD with COVID-19 were enrolled at 24 IBD referral units. Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died. Four patients (6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were being hospitalised for a severe flare of IBD. Age over 65 years (p=0.03), UC diagnosis (p=0.03), IBD activity (p=0.003) and a CCI score >1 (p=0.04) were significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas concomitant IBD treatments were not. Age over 65 years (p=0.002), active IBD (p=0.02) and higher CCI score were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS: Active IBD, old age and comorbidities were associated with a negative COVID-19 outcome, whereas IBD treatments were not. Preventing acute IBD flares may avoid fatal COVID-19 in patients with IBD.

590593,"Nature of “STEM”?: Epistemic Underpinnings of Integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics in Education",2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND: To fight against COVID-19, many policymakers are wavering on stricter public health interventions. Examining the different strategies both in and out of China’s Hubei province, which contained the epidemic in late February 2020, could yield valuable guidance for the management of future pandemics. This study assessed the response process and estimated the time-varying effects of the Hubei control strategy. Analysis of these strategies provides insights for the design and implementation of future policy interventions. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the spread and control of COVID-19 between China’s Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and non-Hubei areas using data that includes case reports, human mobility, and public health interventions from 1 January to 29 February 2020. Static and dynamic risk assessment models were developed to statistically investigate the effects of the Hubei control strategy on the virus case growth after adjusting importation risk and policy response timing with the non-Hubei strategy as a control. RESULTS: The analysis detected much higher but differential importation risk in Hubei. The response timing largely coincided with the importation risk in non-Hubei areas, but Hubei areas showed an opposite pattern. Rather than a specific intervention assessment, a comprehensive comparison showed that the Hubei control strategy implemented severe interventions characterized by unprecedentedly strict and ‘monitored’ self-quarantine at home, while the non-Hubei strategy included physical distancing measures to reduce contact among individuals within or between populations. In contrast with the non-Hubei control strategy, the Hubei strategy showed a much higher, non-linear and gradually diminishing protective effect with at least 3 times fewer cases. CONCLUSIONS: A risk-based control strategy was crucial to the design of an effective response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our study demonstrates that the stricter Hubei strategy achieves a stronger controlling effect compared to other strategies. These findings highlight the health benefits and policy impacts of precise and differentiated strategies informed by constant monitoring of outbreak risk.

592738,"Introduction: Being smarter for productivity, livability, and sustainability",2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity score–matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control. Among COVID-19 survivors (mean [SD] age: 46.3 [19.8], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p < 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity.","Taquet, Maxime; Dercon, Quentin; Luciano, Sierra; Geddes, John R.; Husain, Masud; Harrison, Paul J.",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582441/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003773,483

Endophytic bacteria that are especially associated with medicinal plants presents a reservoir of therapeutic compounds. Fagonia indica has been recently investigated by numerous researchers because of its striking therapeutic potential especially in cancer. It is also reported that endophytes play a vital role in the biosynthesis of various metabolites; therefore we believe that endophytes associated with F. indica are of crucial importance in this regard. The present study aims successful isolation, molecular identification of endophytic bacteria and their screening for bioactive metabolites quantification and in vitro pharmacological activities. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for the identification of isolated endophytic bacteria. Methanolic extracts were evaluated for total phenolic contents (TPC), total flavonoids contents (TFC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity, reducing power and total anti-oxidant assays were performed. And also screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities by disc diffusion method and their MIC were calculated by broth dilution method using microplate reader. Further, standard protocols were followed for antileishmanial activity and protein kinase inhibition. Analysis and statistics were performed using SPSS, Table curve and Origin 8.5 for graphs. RESULTS: Bacterial strains belonging to various genera (Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Erwinia and Stenotrophomonas) were isolated and identified. Total phenolic contents and total flavonoids contents varies among all the bacterial extracts respectively in which Bacillus subtilis showed high phenolic contents 243 µg/mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed high flavonoids contents 15.9 µg/mg quercitin equivalents (QA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) 37.6 µg/mg of extract, reducing power (RP) 206 µg/mg of extract and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity with 98.7 μg/mL IC(50) value. Although all the extracts tested were active to inhibit growth of selected pathogenic microbes (bacteria and fungi), but significant antibacterial activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumonia and B. subtilis. An Enterobacter cloaca was active against Leishmania tropica with IC(50) value of 1.4 µg/mg extracts. B. subtilis and Bacillus tequilensis correspondingly exhibit significant protein kinase inhibition of 47 ± 0.72 and 42 ± 1.21 mm bald zones, indicating anti-infective and antitumor potential.

594893,When Science Denial Meets Epistemic Understanding: Fostering a Research Agenda for Science Education,2021-03-17,"This study explored the associations of individual factors (demographic characteristics, self-confidence in responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and self-rated physical and mental health) and environmental factors (perceived confidence in COVID-19 management by the regional government and adequacy of resources and support available to address the COVID-19 pandemic) with worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety among people in Taiwan. The Chi-square was used to compare difference for worry and anxiety among categorical variables. The logistic regression was used to examine the associations between worry as well as anxiety and individual as well as environmental factors. In total, 1970 respondents were recruited and completed an online survey on worry regarding COVID-19, general anxiety during the pandemic, and individual and environmental factors. In total, 51.7% and 43.4% of respondents reported high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety, respectively. Exhibited worse self-rated mental health, lower self-confidence in COVID-19 management, and insufficient mental health resources were significantly associated with high levels of both worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety. Lower perceived confidence in COVID-19 management by the regional government was associated with a higher level of worry toward COVID-19. Lower perceived social support was associated with a higher level of general anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were prevalent during the outbreak. This suggests health care providers need additional surveillance of worry and anxiety during the pandemic. Multiple individual and environmental factors related to worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were identified. Factors found in the present study can be used for the development of intervention programs, supportive services, and government policy to reduce worry and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Lu, Wei-Hsin; Ko, Nai-Ying; Chang, Yu-Ping; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Wang, Peng-Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142975/,483
596094,Do we need a contact tracing app?,2020-11-19,"INTRODUCTION: Our previous preclinical experiments show that under specific and monitored conditions, ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure reduces certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses including coronavirus-229E without harming mammalian columnar epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and effects of narrow-band UVA therapy administered by a novel device via endotracheal tube in critically ill subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Newly intubated, mechanically ventilated adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and an endotracheal tube size of at least 7.50 mm were eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects were treated with UVA for 20 min daily for 5 days and followed for 30 days. RESULTS: Five subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.60 years, three male). At baseline, all subjects scored 9/10 on the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical severity scale (10 = death), with predicted mortality ranging from 21% to 95%. Average endotracheal viral load significantly reduced from baseline to day 5 (− 2.41 log; range − 1.16 to − 4.54; Friedman p = 0.002) and day 6 (− 3.20; range − 1.20 to − 6.77; Friedman p < 0.001). There were no treatment-emergent adverse events, with no changes in oxygenation or hemodynamics during the 20-min treatments. One subject died 17 days after enrollment due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining subjects clinically improved and scored 2, 4, 5, and 7 on the WHO scale at day 30. In these subjects, clinical improvement correlated with reduction of viral load (Spearman’s rho = 1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this first-in-human study, endotracheal narrow-band UVA therapy, under specific and monitored settings, appears to be safe and associated with a reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden over the treatment period. UVA therapy may provide a novel approach in the fight against COVID-19. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT04572399.

METHODS: A 6MWT was performed in 26 discharge-ready COVID-19 patients without chronic pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. Heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), respiratory rate, and subjective dyspnea measured on the Borg CR-10 scale were measured before and immediately after the 6MWT, with continuous monitoring of SpO(2) and heart rate during the 6MWT. The 6MWT was terminated if SpO(2) dropped below 90%. A historical cohort of 204 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was used for comparison. RESULTS: 13 (50%) of the COVID-19 patients developed exercise-induced hypoxia (SpO(2) < 90%) during the 6MWT, of which one third had pulmonary embolism. COVID-19 patients experienced less hypoxia-related dyspnea during the 6MWT compared with patients with IPF. CONCLUSION: The 6MWT is a potential tool in the diagnosis of asymptomatic exercise-induced hypoxia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients prior to discharge. Due to important methodological limitations, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate their clinical consequences.","Fuglebjerg, Natascha Josephine Ulstrand; Jensen, Tomas Oestergaard; Hoyer, Nils; Ryrsø, Camilla Koch; Lindegaard, Birgitte; Harboe, Zitta Barrella",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220305579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663601/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305579,483

The results showed that total REE contents in the ash samples ranged from 10.2 to 78.9 mg/kg. REEs in bottom ash were apparently higher than those in fly ash. Average REE contents in the ashes followed the sequence of Ce > La > Nd > Y > Gd > Pr > Sm > Dy > Er > Yb > Ho > Eu > Tb > Lu > Tm. Some of the elements, such as Sm, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb in the ash samples were in normal or nearly normal distribution, but Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, Tm, Lu were not normally distributed, indicating some of the ash samples were enriched with these elements. Crust-normalized REE patterns indicated that two types of the MW ashes were obviously enriched with Gd and La. Sequential extraction results showed that REEs in the ash mainly presented as residual fraction, while exchangeable and carbonate fractions were relatively low.

METHODS: Data from post-session surveys were analyzed to assess participant satisfaction, knowledge gaps, change in knowledge, and anticipated changes in practice as a result of Project ECHO COVID-19. A content analysis was conducted of the 243 questions and concerns posted by over 2000 participants in the Question and Answer function of Zoom during the first 8 sessions (March 4-April 29, 2020). RESULTS: Of 5243 registrants, 49% attended at least one session. Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that didactic sessions (97%) and case presentations (96%) met their learning needs; 93% reported gaining new knowledge, and 88% would implement that knowledge. Only 32% and 53% of respondents anticipated changing workflows and adapting to telehealth, respectively, despite the need for both as the pandemic continued. The content analysis identified 3 categories: clinical operations (eg, testing, triage, telehealth, billing); patient care (diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, management of high-risk vulnerable populations); and epidemiology (viral spread, implications for public health). CONCLUSIONS: Care of vulnerable populations and clinical operations should be addressed when planning education and clinical interventions for public health crises. Adapting the Project ECHO model to be more scalable was an effective means of creating a community of practice among health professionals when evidence-based guidance was not available to manage the implications of a pandemic.","Thies, Kathleen M.; Gonzalez, Melanie; Porto, Ariel; Ashley, Karen L.; Korman, Stephanie; Lamb, Mandy",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036832/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211019286,483

Here, using bovine coronavirus (BCoV)‐defective interfering (DI) RNA, we showed that (a) a poly(A) tail with a length of 15 nucleotides (nt) was sufficient to initiate efficient (−)‐strand RNA synthesis and (b) substitution of the poly(A) tail with poly(U), (C) or (G) only slightly decreased the efficiency of (−)‐strand synthesis. The findings indicate that in addition to the poly(A) tail, other factors acting in trans may also participate in (−)‐strand synthesis. The BCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, an RNA‐binding protein, was therefore tested as a candidate. Based on dissociation constant (K(d)) values, it was found that the binding affinity between N protein, but not poly(A)‐binding protein, and the 3′‐terminal 55 nt plus a poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail correlates with the efficiency of (−)‐strand synthesis. Such an association was also evidenced by the binding affinity between the N protein and 5′‐ and 3′‐terminal cis‐acting elements important for (−)‐strand synthesis. Further analysis demonstrated that N protein can act as a bridge to facilitate interaction between the 5′‐ and 3′‐ends of the CoV genome, leading to circularization of the genome. Together, the current study extends our understanding of the mechanism of CoV (−)‐strand RNA synthesis through involvement of N protein and genome circularization and thus may explain why the addition of N protein in trans is required for efficient CoV replication.","Lo, Chen‐Yu; Tsai, Tsung‐Lin; Lin, Chao‐Nan; Lin, Ching‐Hung; Wu, Hung‐Yi",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034708/; https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.14863,483

The practice of endocrinology is suited to provide virtual care to patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. In this survey, we aimed to gauge the adoption of telehealth practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among endocrinologists in the United States (U.S.). Methods: This was a cross-sectional, online survey-based study. Members of the Facebook group “Endocrinologists” were invited to participate in the survey. Characteristics of respondents and their rates of adoption of telehealth were described and analyzed for statistically significant associations using the Pearson chi-square test. Results: A total of 181 physicians responded to the survey. The majority of respondents were females (75%), younger than or equal to 40 years of age (51%), employed (72%) either by a private group/hospital or by an academic setting, worked in an urban area (88.4%), and were adult endocrinologists (93%). With the COVID-19 outbreak, more than two-fifths (44.2%) of participants switched to completely virtual visits, and an additional 44.2% switched to a majority of virtual visits, with some in-person visits in the outpatient setting. Additionally, there was a significantly higher adoption rate of telehealth among endocrinologists younger than or equal to 40 years of age (P = .02) and among those who practiced in northeastern, midwestern, and the western geographic regions of the U.S. (P = .04). Conclusion: The majority of the responding endocrinologists from the U.S. appeared to have swiftly adapted by using telehealth within a few weeks of COVID-19 being declared a national emergency.

We studied whether patients prescribed these drugs had altered risks of contracting severe COVID-19 disease and receiving associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study using routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England with 8.28 million participants aged 20–99 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive adjusted HRs for exposure to ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs adjusted for sociodemographic factors, concurrent medications and geographical region. The primary outcomes were: (a) COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnosed disease and (b) COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU care. FINDINGS: Of 19 486 patients who had COVID-19 disease, 1286 received ICU care. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.74) but no increased risk of ICU care (adjusted HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06) after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Adjusted HRs for ARBs were 0.63 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.67) for COVID-19 disease and 1.02 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.25) for ICU care. There were significant interactions between ethnicity and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for COVID-19 disease. The risk of COVID-19 disease associated with ACE inhibitors was higher in Caribbean (adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28) and Black African (adjusted HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.59) groups than the white group (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.70). A higher risk of COVID-19 with ARBs was seen for Black African (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58) than the white (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.62) group. INTERPRETATION: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with reduced risks of COVID-19 disease after adjusting for a wide range of variables. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are associated with significantly increased risks of receiving ICU care. Variations between different ethnic groups raise the possibility of ethnic-specific effects of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity which deserves further study.","Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Young, Duncan; Coupland, Carol; Channon, Keith M; Tan, Pui San; Harrison, David A; Rowan, Kathryn; Aveyard, Paul; Pavord, Ian D; Watkinson, Peter J",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737124/,483

Our study explored COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates in eight different countries around the globe. We analyzed convenience sample data collected between March 2020 and January 2021 as part of the iCARE cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (≤29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings. Country-level analyses are warranted to understand the complex psychological, socio-environmental, and cultural factors associated with vaccine hesitancy.","Stojanovic, Jovana; Boucher, Vincent G.; Gagne, Myriam; Gupta, Samir; Joyal-Desmarais, Keven; Paduano, Stefania; Aburub, Ala’ S.; Sheinfeld Gorin, Sherri N.; Kassianos, Angelos P.; Ribeiro, Paula A.

607259,Hydralazine-induced liver injury: a review and discussion,2021,"[Image: see text] Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, clinical laboratories worldwide are overwhelmed with SARS-CoV-2 testing using the current gold standard: real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The large numbers of suspected cases led to shortages in numerous reagents such as specimen transport and RNA extraction buffers. We try to provide some answers on how strongly preanalytical issues affect RT-PCR results by reviewing the utility of different transport buffer media and virus inactivation procedures and comparing the literature data with our own recent findings. We show that various viral inactivation procedures and transport buffers are available and are less of a bottleneck for PCR-based methods. However, efficient alternative lysis buffers remain more difficult to find, and several fast RT-PCR assays are not compatible with guanidine-containing media, making this aspect more of a challenge in the current crisis. Furthermore, the availability of different SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-PCR kits with different sensitivities makes the definition of a general cutoff level for the cycle threshold (Ct) value challenging. Only a few studies have considered how Ct values relate to viral infectivity and how preanalytical issues might affect viral infectivity and RNA detection. We review the current data on the correlation between Ct values and viral infectivity. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in its own is not sufficient proof of infectivity and caution is needed in evaluation of the infectivity of samples. The correlation between Ct values and viral infectivity revealed an RT-PCR cutoff value of 34 cycles for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity using a laboratory-developed RT-PCR assay targeting the RdRp gene. While ideally each clinical laboratory should perform its own correlation, we believe this perspective article could be a reference point for others, in particular medical doctors and researchers interested in COVID-19 diagnostics, and a first step toward harmonization.","Engelmann, Ilka; Alidjinou, Enagnon Kazali; Ogiez, Judith; Pagneux, Quentin; Miloudi, Sana; Benhalima, Ilyes; Ouafi, Mahdi; Sane, Famara; Hober, Didier; Roussel, Alain; Cambillau, Christian; Devos, David; Boukherroub, Rabah; Szunerits, Sabine",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c00166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748564/,483

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at high risk to develop cognitive impairment which leads to poor quality of life, difficulty in adhering to medications, increased risk of mortality, and health resource utilization. However, there is no study done on the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among chronic kidney disease patients in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among chronic kidney disease patients at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized and Felege Hiwot Referral Hospitals in 2020, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An institution-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized and Felege Hiwot Referral Hospitals in 2020. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using standard tools. Data were checked for its completeness and entered into Epi data version 3.0 then exported into STATA 14. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify associated factors of cognitive impairment among CKD patients, and variables having a p-value of ≤0.05 were declared as significant. RESULTS: In this study, 116 CKD patients and 116 age, sex, and educational level matched controls were included with a response rate of 100%. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 49.1% [95% CI (40%, 58.3%)] among CKD patients and 28.4% [95% CI (20.9%, 37.5%)] among controls. Independent predictors of cognitive impairment among CKD patients were estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) <60mL/min/m(2) [AOR=3.9, 95% CI (1.1–14.74)], proteinuria [AOR=6.0, 95% CI (1.83–20.3)], age greater than 65 years [AOR=4.0, 95% CI (1.12–14.64)], and educational level of grade 8 and less [AOR= 4.7, 95% CI (1.22 -18.47)]. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among CKD patients was higher than healthy controls. Cognitive impairment was higher among CKD patients with eGFR <60mL/min/m(2), proteinuria, educational level of grade 8 and less, and age greater than 65 years. Therefore, there is a need to have a regular evaluation and follow-up of CKD patients for cognitive impairment.","Gela, Yibeltal Yismaw; Getu, Ayechew Adera; Adane, Aynishet; Ayal, Bezawit Mulat; Akalu, Yonas; Ambelu, Adugnaw; Diress, Mengistie; Yeshaw, Yigizie",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s304543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040375/,483

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) complicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and causes multi-organ failure which can subsequently lead to mortality in COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, has shown to salvage patients with cytokine release storm. In this study, we aim to evaluate therapeutic response of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. A single-arm retrospective review of 40 patients with COVID-19, admitted to The Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from March 2020 to May 2020 was performed. Selection of patients for use of Tocilizumab was based on severity of disease, rapid clinical deterioration, presence of CRS and absence of any absolute contraindication to Tocilizumab. Improvement after Tocilizumab was defined as improvement in oxygen requirement and inflammatory parameters. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines like C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels were monitored before and after administering Tocilizumab. Mean age was 62.4 years and 33 (82.5%) were male. 19 (47.5%) patients were critically sick, 18 (45%) were severely sick and 3 (7.5%) were moderately sick. 29 (77.5%) patients showed significant improvement in oxygen requirement, inflammatory parameters and chest x-rays, out of which 28 patients were discharged home. The mean duration between administration of Tocilizumab and overall improvement was 4.3 ± 3.2 days. Hence, Tocilizumab can be used as a possible treatment option in patients with COVID-19 induced CRS but needs monitoring for its adverse effects.","Zain Mushtaq, Muhammad; Bin Zafar Mahmood, Saad; Jamil, Bushra; Aziz, Adil; Ali, Syed Ahsan",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920319238?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889236/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920319238; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106926,483

610037,Online Portfolio: An Alternative to a Research Paper as a Final Assessment,2021-03-31,"Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.","Gonzalez-Granadillo, Gustavo; Menesidou, Sofia Anna; Papamartzivanos, Dimitrios; Romeu, Ramon; Navarro-Llobet, Diana; Okoh, Caxton; Nifakos, Sokratis; Xenakis, Christos; Panaousis, Emmanouil",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21165493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450935/,483

EPIDEMIOLOGY: The most frequent causes of acquired infection in the community that require admission to the ICU are respiratory infections, urinary tract infections and infections of the central nervous system. Among the infections acquired in the ICU, devices-associated infections are the most frequent. ETIOLOGY: The most frequent in ICU are Gram negative pathogens. ETIOPATHOGENESIS: In the critical patient, several factors are combined making them especially vulnerable to infections. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: Depends on the location of the infection. DIAGNOSIS: It must be early due to its increased mortality. PROGNOSIS: Nosocomial infections are associated with an increase in mortality and in the length of stay.

612661,How changes in human activities during the lockdown impacted air quality parameters: A review,2021-05-10,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions caused major global disruption. Individuals with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) are at higher risk of severe illness and often subject to the strictest pandemic guidance, so may be disproportionally affected. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore how living with a LTC during the COVID-19 pandemic affected mental health and wellbeing. Sample and methods: 32 participants, mean age 57 (SD 13) years, 66% female and 72% white British, who reported having LTCS (most commonly cancer, respiratory conditions or cardiovascular diseases), participated in telephone/video call interviews based on a semi-structured topic guide. Key themes and subthemes were determined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Results: There were four overarching themes specific to living with a LTC. These were 1) high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, 2) impact of shielding/isolation on mental health and wellbeing, 3) experience of healthcare during the pandemic and 4) anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Fourteen subthemes were identified, including concerns about accessing essential supplies and the importance of social support. Individuals who lived alone and were advised to shield could be profoundly negatively affected. Conclusions: This study found that there were a number of aspects of living with a LTC during the pandemic that had a significant impact on mental health and well-being. There should be focus on how best to provide practical and social support to people with LTCs during a pandemic, particularly if they have to shield or isolate.","Fisher, A.; Roberts, A.; McKinlay, A.

Understanding changing characteristics of patients with HCV allows for targeted programs that increase linkage to care. We investigated changes in demographic and clinical characteristics of patients registered in the German Hepatitis C-Registry (DHC-R) from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019. The DHC-R is an ongoing, noninterventional, multicentre, prospective, observational cohort registry including 327 German centres. Patient characteristics were analysed over time in 7 phases for all patients completing a screening visit. Overall, 14,357 patients were enrolled. The percentage of treatment-naïve/non-cirrhotic patients increased from 34.4% in phase 1 (1 January-31 December 2014) to 68.2% in phase 7 (1 August-31 December 2019). The proportion of migrants, alcohol users, people who inject drugs, and those receiving opiate substitution therapy increased in later registry phases. Most patients (60.1%) were receiving comedication at baseline. The most prescribed comedications were drugs used to treat opioid dependence which increased from 9.2% in phase 1 to 24.0% in phase 7. The patients' mean age decreased from 52.3 years in phase 1 to 48.7 years in phase 7. From 2014 to 2019, the proportion of at-risk patients enrolling in the registry increased. To eliminate viral hepatitis as a major public health threat, a continued commitment to engaging underserved populations into the HCV care cascade is needed.","Hüppe, Dietrich; Stoehr, Albrecht; Buggisch, Peter; Mauss, Stefan; Klinker, Hartwig; Teuber, Gerlinde; Hidde, Dennis; Lohmann, Kristina; Bondin, Mark; Wedemeyer, Heiner",J Viral Hepat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339561/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13586,483

Results from a field experiment,2021-09-16,"Background: Understanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes. Objective: The study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Results: Having moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [≥] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [≥] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039). Conclusions: Being old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and death can be prevented.

The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were retrieved from the antimicrobial peptide database (APD3) and shortlisted based on certain important physicochemical properties. The binding mode of the shortlisted peptides was measured based on the number of clusters which forms in a protein-peptide docking using Piper. As a result, we identified a list of putative AMPs which binds to the spike protein of MERS-CoV, which may be crucial in providing the inhibitory action. It is observed that seven putative peptides have good binding score based on cluster size cutoff of 208. We conclude that seven peptides, namely, AP00225, AP00180, AP00549, AP00744, AP00729, AP00764, and AP00223, could possibly have binding with the active site of the MERS-CoV spike protein.

616554,Towards Post-Pandemic Sustainable and Ethical Food Systems,2021-01-23,"Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24–48 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection.","Karlsson, Oskar E.; Larsson, Jenny; Hayer, Juliette; Berg, Mikael; Jacobson, Magdalena",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982708/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151481,483

Given the vast numbers of individuals affected, it is urgent to design a strategy to prevent a second wave of late mortality associated with COVID-19 PF as a long-term consequence of such a devastating pandemic. Available antifibrotic therapies, namely nintedanib and pirfenidone, might have a role in attenuating profibrotic pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection but are not economically sustainable by national health systems and have critical adverse effects. It is our opinion that the mesenchymal stem cell secretome could offer a new therapeutic approach in treating COVID-19 fibrotic lungs through its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic factors.","Bari, Elia; Ferrarotti, Ilaria; Saracino, Laura; Perteghella, Sara; Torre, Maria Luisa; Richeldi, Luca; Corsico, Angelo Guido",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10051203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068958/,483

618039,A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience in CRISPR-Cas9 Experimental Design to Support Reverse Genetic Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana,2021-07-30,"Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented a major challenge to clinical laboratories during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite the implementation of automated detection systems and previous efficiencies, including barcoding, electronic data transfer, and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weakly positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weakly positive specimens. Additionally, the frequencies of occurrence of weakly positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weakly positive specimens, with threshold cycle (C(T)) values of 33 or higher, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter, and remaining level since August. At all times, weakly positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to >80% for C(T) values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies, however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered. Accessioning, result data management, electronic data transfer, reporting, and billing are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.","Griesemer, Sara B.; Van Slyke, Greta; St. George, Kirsten",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01261-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468607/,483

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5’ untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.","Schubert, Katharina; Karousis, Evangelos D.; Jomaa, Ahmad; Scaiola, Alain; Echeverria, Blanca; Gurzeler, Lukas-Adrian; Leibundgut, Marc; Thiel, Volker; Mühlemann, Oliver; Ban, Nenad",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191676,483

METHODS: In all, 381 patients scheduled for telemedicine visits with three orthopaedic surgeons in a large academic practice from 1 April 2020 to 12 June 2020 were asked to participate in a telephone survey using a standardized Institutional Review Board-approved script. An unsuccessful telemedicine visit was defined as patient-reported difficulty of use or reported dissatisfaction with teleconferencing. Patient barriers were defined as explicitly reported barriers of unsatisfactory visit using a process-based satisfaction metric. Statistical analyses were conducted using analysis of variances (ANOVAs), ranked ANOVAs, post-hoc pairwise testing, and chi-squared independent analysis with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 39.9% (n = 152). The mean age of patients was 51.1 years (17 to 85), and 55 patients (38%) were male. Of 146 respondents with completion of survey, 27 (18.5%) reported a barrier to completing their telemedicine visit. The majority of patients were satisfied with using telemedicine for their orthopaedic appointment (88.8%), and found the experience to be easy (86.6%). Patient-reported barriers included lack of proper equipment/internet connection (n = 13; 8.6%), scheduling difficulty (n = 2; 1.3%), difficulty following directions (n = 10; 6.6%), and patient-reported discomfort (n = 2; 1.3%). Barriers based on patient characteristics were age > 61 years, non-English primary language, inexperience with video conferencing, and unwillingness to try telemedicine prior to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The barriers identified in this study could be used to screen patients who would potentially have an unsuccessful telemedicine visit, allowing practices to provide assistance to patients to reduce the risk of an unsuccessful visit.

We aimed to analyze outcomes associated with obesity in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study at a tertiary care health system of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m 2) cohorts. Primary outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1983 patients were included of whom 1031 (51.9%) had obesity and 952 (48.9%) did not have obesity. Patients with obesity were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001) and African American (P < 0.001) compared to patients without obesity. Multivariable logistic models adjusting for differences in age, sex, race, medical comorbidities, and treatment modalities revealed no difference in 60-day mortality and 30-day readmission between obese and non-obese groups. In these models, patients with obesity had increased odds of ICU admission (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07−1.76; P = 0.012) and intubation (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04−1.80; P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in patients with COVID-19 is independently associated with increased risk for ICU admission and intubation. Recognizing that obesity impacts morbidity in this manner is crucial for appropriate management of COVID-19 patients.","Suresh, Suraj; Siddiqui, Mohammad; Abu Ghanimeh, Mouhanna; Jou, Jessica; Simmer, Stephen; Mendiratta, Vivek; Russell, Sarah; Al-Shammari, Mustafa; Chatfield, Abigail; Alsheik, Eva; Dang, Duyen; Genaw, Jeffrey; Zuchelli, Tobias",Obes Res Clin Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871403X21000326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2021.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653666/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871403X21000326?v=s5,483
630441,Measuring Students’ Use of Zoom Application in Language Course Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM),2021-01-05,"Influenza virus affects the respiratory tract by direct viral infection or by damage from the immune system response. In humans, the respiratory epithelium is the only site where the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule is effectively cleaved, generating infectious virus particles. Virus transmission occurs through a susceptible individual’s contact with aerosols or respiratory fomites from an infected individual. The inability of the lung to perform its primary function of gas exchange can result from multiple mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity from direct epithelial cell killing, and degradation of the critical extracellular matrix. Approximately 30–40% of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza are diagnosed with acute pneumonia. These patients who develop pneumonia are more likely to be < 5 years old, > 65 years old, Caucasian, and nursing home residents; have chronic lung or heart disease and history of smoking, and are immunocompromised. Influenza can primarily cause severe pneumonia, but it can also present in conjunction with or be followed by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Influenza is associated with a high predisposition to bacterial sepsis and ARDS. Viral infections presenting concurrently with bacterial pneumonia are now known to occur with a frequency of 30–50% in both adult and pediatric populations. The H3N2 subtype has been associated with unprecedented high levels of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Influenza A is the predominant viral etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Risk factors independently associated with ARDS are age between 36 and 55 years old, pregnancy, and obesity, while protective factors are female sex, influenza vaccination, and infections with Influenza A (H3N2) or Influenza B viruses. In the ICU, particularly during the winter season, influenza should be suspected not only in patients with typical symptoms and epidemiology, but also in patients with severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis with or without bacterial co-infection, as well as in patients with encephalitis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis.","Kalil, Andre C.; Thomas, Paul G.",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324202/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-019-2539-x,483

DESIGN AND METHOD: We conducted two cross‐sectional studies (Study 1 N = 762, Study 2 N = 229) on a French population, measuring conspiracy mentality, compliance with preventive health measures, and perceived risks related to COVID‐19. We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2. RESULTS: We show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non‐normative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government‐driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: Conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which, in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non‐normative prevention behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may (dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individuals’ compliance.","Marinthe, Gaëlle; Brown, Genavee; Delouvée, Sylvain; Jolley, Daniel",Br J Health Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32583540/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12449,483

BACKGROUND: As COVID‐19 vaccine becomes available worldwide, attention is being directed to community vaccine uptake, to achieve population‐wide immunity. A number of factors have been reported to influence vaccine intention. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of COVID‐19 vaccination intention related literature published on or before 31 December 2020 from seven databases was undertaken. RESULTS: Thirty articles were included in this systematic review. Overall COVID‐19 vaccination intention during the first year of the pandemic ranged from 27.7% to 93.3%. Findings highlighted that socio‐demographic differences, perceptions of risk and susceptibility to COVID‐19 and vaccine attributes influenced vaccination intention. Healthcare professionals particularly, nurses have higher vaccine hesitancy reportedly due to concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and mistrust of health authorities. Negative information about COVID‐19 vaccines in the social media and low confidence in the health system were associated with lower acceptability among the community. Interestingly, cumulative increase in COVID‐19 caseloads of countries over time was not associated with vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: The significant variability in vaccine intention rates worldwide would hamper efforts to achieve immunity against COVID‐19. Nurses’ concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy need to be addressed to increase vaccine acceptance and maximise their influence on vaccination decision in the community. As misinformation through social media negatively impacts vaccination uptake, authoritative and reliable information on vaccine attributes, disease risks and vaccination benefits are needed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy including misinformation are important contributors to vaccine hesitancy. Addressing these factors, particularly among nurses who are considered trusted influencers of vaccination decisions in the community is an important strategy for pandemic preparedness.","Al‐Amer, Rasmieh; Maneze, Della; Everett, Bronwyn; Montayre, Jed; Villarosa, Amy R.; Dwekat, Entisar; Salamonson, Yenna",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227179/,483

Measures to counter COVID-19, including social distancing and lockdowns, created an unusual situation that had the potential to impact a variety of behaviours, including sleep, which is crucial for health and well-being. Data were obtained through an online survey. The total sample comprised 19,482 participants from the UK. Participants were asked several questions regarding sleep quality and quantity. Each participant completed the questionnaires once during a data collection period spanning January 20 to March 31, 2020. Data provided by different participants during different weeks (spanning time-periods just before COVID-19 was identified in the UK and during the early weeks following its arrival) were compared using analysis of variance tests and regressions. Regression analyses controlling for age, sex and ethnicity revealed significant associations of small magnitude between date of survey completion and sleep quality, sleep latency, number of awakenings and composite score of poor sleep quality. These analyses also indicated small increases in eveningness tendency as the study progressed. There was no change in sleep duration or time spent awake at night. The COVID-19 outbreak did not appear to impact negatively sleep in a substantial manner during the early stages in the UK. The small increases in sleep quality variables (except for time spent awake at night and sleep duration) and eveningness are nonetheless of interest.

There is a paucity of data regarding the practice of regional anesthesia in low- and middle-income countries. Using access data from a free Android app with curated regional anesthesia learning modules, we aimed to estimate global interest in regional anesthesia and potential applications to clinical practice stratified by World Bank income level. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data collected from the free Android app “Anesthesiologist” from December 2015 to April 2020. The app performs basic anesthetic calculations and provides links to videos on performing 12 different nerve blocks. Users of the app were classified on the basis of whether or not they had accessed the links. Nerve blocks were also classified according to major use (surgical block, postoperative pain adjunct, rescue block). RESULTS: Practitioners in low- and middle-income countries accessed the app more frequently than in high-income countries as measured by clicks. Users from low- and middle-income countries focused mainly on surgical blocks: ankle, axillary, infraclavicular, interscalene, and supraclavicular blocks. In high-income countries, more users viewed postoperative pain blocks: adductor canal, popliteal, femoral, and transverse abdominis plane blocks. Utilization of the app was constant over time with a general decline with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The use of an in app survey and analytics can help identify gaps and opportunities for regional anesthesia techniques and practices. This is especially impactful in limited-resource areas, such as lower-income environments and can lead to targeted educational initiatives.","Moll, Vanessa; Mariano, Edward R.; Kitzman, Jamie M.; O'Reilly-Shah, Vikas N.; Jabaley, Craig S.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524031/,483

Very little is known about the effectiveness of stepped-down physical activity (PA) programs for military service veterans. OBJECTIVE: This study will test Active Choices, a stepped-down behavioral support program designed to help Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents who are clients of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, transition from treatment by an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to self-managed PA. METHODS: The study is a parallel-group, randomized trial, with city-based exercise physiology or physiotherapy practices that recruit eligible Department of Veterans’ Affairs clients assigned to Active Choices or a comparison program. The study aims to recruit 52 participants (26 in each group). The Active Choices program will consist of 2 face-to-face (Weeks 1, 12) and 2 telephone (Weeks 4 and 8) consultations. During these sessions, the participant and Active Choices consultant will utilize an evidence-based resource booklet to review the key benefits of an active lifestyle, build an action plan for PA preferences, set and review goals, self-monitor progress relative to set goals, and discuss strategies to overcome PA barriers. Linking participants to local PA communities to overcome social isolation will be a program priority. The comparison program will consist of 2 consultations (Weeks 1 and 12) and use fewer behavioral support strategies (education, self-monitoring, and action planning only) than Active Choices. Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, end-intervention (12 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks) to assess changes in moderate intensity self-managed PA, psychological well-being, and social connectedness. We will also measure health service utilization and costs as well as PA choices across the intervention period. End-intervention interviews will capture participant experiences. RESULTS: Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human research activities in Australia, participant recruitment will commence when it is safe and feasible to do so. CONCLUSIONS: Findings will provide valuable pilot data to support up-scaling of the program and larger effectiveness trials with regional and rural as well as city-based Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents.

In this paper, we empirically investigate the ecologic association between long-term concentrations of area-level fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and excess deaths in the first quarter of 2020 in municipalities of Northern Italy. The study accounts for potentially spatial confounding factors related to urbanization that may have influenced the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 mortality. Our epidemiological analysis uses geographical information (e.g., municipalities) and negative binomial regression to assess whether both ambient PM(2.5) concentration and excess mortality have a similar spatial distribution. Our analysis suggests a positive association of ambient PM(2.5) concentration on excess mortality in Northern Italy related to the COVID-19 epidemic. Our estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in PM(2.5) concentration (µg/m(3)) is associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval: 6–12%) increase in COVID-19 related mortality.","Coker, Eric S.; Cavalli, Laura; Fabrizi, Enrico; Guastella, Gianni; Lippo, Enrico; Parisi, Maria Laura; Pontarollo, Nicola; Rizzati, Massimiliano; Varacca, Alessandro; Vergalli, Sergio",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00486-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836855/,483

The high error rate of RNA synthesis and reverse‐transcription confers genome plasticity, enabling the remarkable adaptability of RNA viruses to antiviral intervention. However, this property is coupled to fundamental constraints including limits on the size of information available to manipulate complex hosts into supporting viral replication. Accordingly, RNA viruses employ various means to extract maximum utility from their informationally limited genomes that, correspondingly, may be leveraged for effective host‐oriented therapies. Host‐oriented approaches are becoming increasingly feasible because of increased availability of bioactive compounds and recent advances in immunotherapy and precision medicine, particularly genome editing, targeted delivery methods and RNAi. In turn, one driving force behind these innovations is the increasingly detailed understanding of evolutionarily diverse host–virus interactions, which is the key concern of an emerging field, neo‐virology.

However, the rapidly growing SARS-CoV-2 variants might compromise existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. Although there are valuable experimental studies about the potential threats from emerging variants, the results are limited to a handful of mutations and Eli Lilly and Regeneron mAbs. The potential threats from frequently occurring mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to many mAbs in clinical trials are largely unknown. We fill the gap by developing a topology-based deep learning strategy that is validated with tens of thousands of experimental data points. We analyze 261,348 genome isolates from patients to identify 514 non-degenerate RBD mutations and investigate their impacts on 16 mAbs in clinical trials. Our findings, which are highly consistent with existing experimental results about variants from the UK, South Africa, Brazil, US-California, and Mexico shed light on potential threats of 95 high-frequency mutations to mAbs not only from Eli Lilly and Regeneron but also from Celltrion and Rockefeller University that are in clinical trials.

Rising food demand leads both producers and consumers to search for alternative food sources with high nutritional value. However, food products may never be completely safe. The oxidation reaction may alter both the physicochemical and immunological properties of food products. Maillard and caramelization nonenzymatic browning reactions can play a pivotal role in food acceptance through the ways they influence quality factors such as flavor, color, texture, nutritional value, protein functionality, and digestibility. There is a multitude of adulterated foods that portray adverse risks to the human condition. To maintain food safety, the packaging material is used to preserve the quality and freshness of food products. Food safety is jeopardized by plenty of pathogens by the consumption of adulterated food resulting in multiple foodborne illnesses. Though different analytical tools are used in the analysis of food products, yet, adulterated food has repercussions for the community and is a growing issue that adversely impairs human health and well-being. Thus, pathogenic agents' rapid and effective identification is vital for food safety and security to avoid foodborne illness.

Coagulopathy manifested predominantly as hypercoagulability that correlated directly with systemic inflammation, disease severity, comorbidities, and mortality risk. The prolonged clotting tests in about ¼ of cases were associated with high levels of C-reactive protein and antiphospholipid antibodies, which impeded coagulation in vitro. Contraction of blood clots was hindered in about ½ of patients, especially in severe and fatal cases, and correlated directly with prothrombotic parameters. A decrease in platelet contractility was due to moderate thrombocytopenia in combination with platelet dysfunction. Clots with impaired contraction were porous, had a low content of compressed polyhedral erythrocytes (polyhedrocytes) and an even distribution of fibrin, suggesting that the uncompacted intravital clots are more obstructive but patients could also be prone to bleeding. The absence of consumption coagulopathy suggests the predominance of local and/or regional microthrombosis rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation. The results obtained (i) confirm the importance of hemostatic disorders in COVID-19 and their relation to systemic inflammation; (ii) justify monitoring of hemostasis, including the kinetics of blood clot contraction; (iii) substantiate the active prophylaxis of thrombotic complications in COVID-19.","Litvinov, Rustem I.; Evtugina, Natalia G.; Peshkova, Alina D.; Safiullina, Svetlana I.; Andrianova, Izabella A.; Khabirova, Alina I.; Nagaswami, Chandrasekaran; Khismatullin, Rafael R.; Sannikova, Svetlana S.; Weisel, John W.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381066/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95397-6,483

656207,Digital contact-tracing and pandemics: Institutional and technological preparedness in Africa,2020-08-02,"Background and Objectives: Affective disorders, namely bipolar (BDs) and depressive disorders (DDs) are characterized by high prevalence and functional impairment. From a dimensional point of view, BDs and DDs can be considered as psychopathological entities lying on a continuum. A delay in treatment initiation might increase the burden associated with affective disorders. The aim of this study is to analyze the correlates of a long duration of untreated illness (DUI) in these conditions. Materials and Methods: Subjects with BDs and DDs, both in- and outpatients, were recruited. Long DUI was defined according to previous research criteria as >2 years for BDs or >1 year for DDs. Socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the recruited subjects were collected. Bivariate analyses were performed to compare subjects with a long and short DUI (p < 0.05). Results: In our sample (n = 61), 34.4% of subjects presented a long DUI. A long DUI was significantly associated with longer overall illness duration (p = 0.022) and a higher rate of psychiatric (p = 0.048) and physical comorbidities (p = 0.023). As for psychopathological features, depressive symptoms were more severe in the long DUI subgroup, as demonstrated by a higher score at the Clinical Global Impression-severity of depression (p = 0.012) item and at the anxiety/depression factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (p = 0.041). Furthermore, subjects with a long DUI displayed more severe disruption of circadian rhythms, as evaluated by the Biological Rhythms Interview for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry total (p = 0.044) and social domain (p = 0.005) scores and by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale diurnal variation items (18a: p = 0.029, 18b: p = 0.047). Conclusions: A long DUI may underpin higher clinical severity, as well as worse illness course and unfavorable prognosis in affective disorders. Intervention strategies targeting comorbidities, depressive symptoms and circadian rhythms may decrease disease burden in subjects with a long DUI.","Menculini, Giulia; Verdolini, Norma; Brufani, Francesca; Pierotti, Valentina; Cirimbilli, Federica; Di Buò, Agata; Spollon, Giulio; De Giorgi, Filippo; Sciarma, Tiziana; Tortorella, Alfonso; Moretti, Patrizia",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066782/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57050459,483

The secondary objective was to identify the risk association of sex, race, presence of nephritis, and use of various immunomodulators with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data of individuals with lupus with and without COVID-19 between January 2020 to May 2021 was retrieved from the TriNetX. A one-to-one matched COVID-19 positive control was selected using propensity score(PS) matching. We assessed several outcomes, including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, severe COVID, acute kidney injury (AKI), Haemodialysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and sepsis were assessed. RESULTS: We identified 2140 SLE patients with COVID-19, 29,853 SLE without COVID-19 and 732,291controls. Mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was comparable among SLE and controls [RR-1.26; 95%CI-0.85,1.8]. SLE with COVID-19 had a higher risk of hospitalisation [RR-1.28; 95% CI 1.14–1.44], ICU admission [RR-1.35; 95% CI 1.01–1.83], mechanical ventilation [RR- 1.58 95% CI 1.07–2.33], stroke [RR-2.18; 95% CI 1.32,3.60], VTE [RR-2.22; 95% CI 1.57–03.12] and sepsis [RR-1.37; 95% CI 1.06–1.78].Individuals with SLE who contracted COVID-19 had higher mortality, hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, AKI, VTE and sepsis (p < 0.001) compared to SLE without COVID-19. Males with SLE had a higher risk of AKI [RR-2.05; 95% CI 1.27–3.31] than females. Lupus nephritis was associated with higher risk of hospitalisation [RR-1.36; 95% CI 1.05–1.76], AKI [RR-2.32; 95% CI 1.50–3.59] and sepsis [RR-2.07; 95% CI-1.12–3.83]. CONCLUSION: The mortality of individuals with SLE due to COVID-19 is comparable to the general population but with higher risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, stroke, VTE and sepsis.

We sought to assess the sensitivity of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We obtained sera from 36 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. We evaluated samples collected at around 21 days ({+/-}14 days) after their initial PCR test using 3 commercially available ELISA assays, two anti-spike (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros, and Euroimmun) and one anti-nucleocapsid (Abbott Architect), and a Yale-developed anti-spike ELISA test. We determined the sensitivity of the tests and compared their results. The Euroimmun and Yale ELISA had an equivocal and indeterminate category, which were considered as both negative and positive. Results: Among the 36 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean age was 43 ({+/-}13) years and 19 (53%) were female. The sensitivities of the tests were not significantly different (Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, Euroimmmun, and Yale assays: 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-95), 94% (95% CI, 81-99), 86% (95% CI, 71-95), and 94% (95% CI, 81-99), respectively; p-value=0.464). The sensitivities of the Euroimmun and Yale ELISA tests increased when the equivocal/indeterminate results were considered positive (97% [95% CI, 85-100] and 100% [95% CI, 90-100], respectively), but were not significantly different from other tests (p=0.082). The cross-correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85-0.98 between three anti-spike protein assays (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, Yale) and was 0.58-0.71 between the three anti-spike protein assays and the anti-nucleocapsid assay (Abbott). Conclusion: The sensitivities of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein assays did not significantly differ, although the sample size was small. Sensitivity also depended on the interpretation of equivocal and indeterminate results. The strongest correlations were present for the three anti-spike proteins assays. These findings suggest that individual test characteristics and the correlation between different tests should be considered when comparing or aggregating data across different populations studies for serologic surveillance of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mahajan, S.; Redlich, C.

To screen for antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1-10 M. Mechanistic studies showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), inhibited Ca2+-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus entry. These candidate drugs showed broad-spectrum efficacy against the entry of several coronavirus pseudotypes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614, S-G614, N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2]) in different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549). Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells confirmed that four of the drugs (SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine, SC171, and SC185/neferine) reduced cytopathic effect and supernatant viral RNA load. Among them, cepharanthine showed the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Collectively, this study offers new lead compounds for coronavirus antiviral drug discovery.","He, Chang-Long; Huang, Lu-Yi; Wang, Kai; Gu, Chen-Jian; Hu, Jie; Zhang, Gui-Ji; Xu, Wei; Xie, You-Hua; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ai-Long",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.13.420406,483

We found that GL treatment leads to a clear reduction in the number of IAV-infected human lung cells as well as a reduction in the CCID50 titer by 90%. The antiviral effect, however, was limited to one or two virus replication cycles. Analysis of different GL treatment protocols suggested that the antiviral effect of GL was limited to an early step in the virus replication cycle. A direct inhibitory action of GL on IAV particles could be excluded and GL did not interact with virus receptor binding either. The antiviral effect of GL was abolished by treatment 1 h after virus infection, whereas pre-treatment and treatment during and after virus adsorption led to a reduction in the cytopathic effect, reduced viral RNA within the cells and in the cell supernatants, and reduced viral hemagglutination titers. Detailed virus uptake analyses unambiguously demonstrated reduced virus uptake in various GL-treated cells. These observations lead to the conclusion, that the antiviral activity of GL is mediated by an interaction with the cell membrane which most likely results in reduced endocytotic activity and hence reduced virus uptake. These insights might help in the design of structurally related compounds leading to potent anti-influenza therapeutics.","Wolkerstorfer, Andrea; Kurz, Harald; Bachhofner, Nicole; Szolar, Oliver H.J.",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209003222; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.04.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209003222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416738/,483

This study examines the impact of cancer rate changes over the 20-year period 1996–2015, for people aged under 75 years. RESULTS: The overall age-standardised cancer incidence rate increased from 350.7 in 1995 to 364.4 per 100,000 in 2015. Over the period 1996–2015, there were 29,226 (2.0%) more cases (males: 5940, 0.7%; females: 23,286, 3.7%) than expected numbers based on 1995 rates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 ± 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% ± 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple ground glass opacity, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results.

Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9 ng/ml (95%CI [−9.5, −2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000 IU/d, from one week to 12 months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (OR = 0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000 IU/d, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.","Bassatne, Aya; Basbous, Maya; Chakhtoura, Marlene; Zein, Ola El; Rahme, Maya; Fuleihan, Ghada El-Hajj",Metabolism,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049521000536; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2021.154753; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049521000536?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774074/,483

METHODS: Data on COVID-19 infection and mortality of medical physicians in Iran was actively gathered through the Iranian Medical Council (IRIMC). Population COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality data were extracted from WHO situation analysis reports and data on Iranian population were obtained from the Statistical Center of Iran. RESULTS: As of Jul 27(th) 2020, COVID-19 infection and mortality rates were 0.680% and 0.0396% among 131223 physicians. The highest cumulative infection rates as of 27(th) July 2020, were observed in specialists of infectious diseases (3.14%) followed by neurology (2.18%), and internal medicine (2.13%). The highest cumulative mortality rates as of Nov 3(rd) 2020 were observed in specialties of forensic medicine (0.314%), anesthesiology (0.277%), urology (0.237%), and infectious diseases (0.20%). Male physicians comprised 95% of cumulative mortality as of Nov 3(rd). The physicians’ COVID-19 mortality in July and November were 49% and 23% higher than the general population respectively. CONCLUSION: Infection and mortality rates in Iranian physicians were higher than the general population, however the magnitude of difference was narrowing in longitudinal investigation. Provision of personnel protective equipment should be prioritized to specialists of infectious diseases, forensic medicine, anesthesiology, internal and emergency medicine, and urology.","Basiri, Abbas; Zafarghandi, Mohammadreza; Golshan, Shabnam; Eshrati, Babak; Fattahi, Ali; Kashi, Amir Hossein",Iran J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v50i7.6632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568181/,483

678074,Memory and forgetfulness in tourism crisis research,2020-08-29,"The standard growth model of epidemic evolution such as the Richards generalized logistic function is remarkably successful because it agrees with almost all previous epidemic data. Yet, it fails to explain intervention measures for mitigations of the ongoing coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It also fails to replicate an endemic phase that occurs in many countries epidemic curves (time series data of daily new cases). These discrepancies demonstrate that new epidemic laws are required to understand, predict and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that almost all COVID-19 evolution can be modeled by three innovative epidemic laws. Specifically, based on the world COVID-19 data, we first divide an epidemic curve into three phases: an exponential growth phase, an exponential decay phase, and a constant endemic phase. We next integrate the growth and the decay phases into the first epidemic law with interventions as a model parameter. This law is completely opposite to the Richards generalized logistic function in terms of intervention measures. We then combine the first epidemic law with the endemic phase to form the second epidemic law, which makes the curve of cumulative cases increase linearly as time tends to infinity. The third epidemic law states if an epidemic is composed of multiple epidemic waves, the superposition principle applies. These laws were confirmed by the COVID-19 data from 18 countries including undeveloped, developing and developed countries. Finally, we pave the way for future research to incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model. We anticipate that the results from this research can provide a scientific base for governments to mitigate the COVID-19 and other epidemic disasters.","Guo, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20238253v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.20238253,483
678892,Safety and efficacy of BNT162b mRNA Covid19 Vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,2021-07-29,"SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is thought to release its RNA genome at either the cell surface or within endosomes, the balance being dependent on spike protein stability, and the complement of receptors, co-receptors and proteases. To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, 3 histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilising in pre-fusion (all 3) and post-fusion (2 of 3) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions, and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290 – R273 and R355 – D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilising in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilised in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.","Warwicker, Jim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.31.363176,483

METHODS: An online survey questionnaire including the health anxiety questionnaire was administered to 1578 eligible adults from the general population of 19 governorates of Iraq. RESULTS: Self-reported compliance with home confinement was reported by a majority of respondents (83%) and was followed to a larger extent by young adults (62.2%), females (53.9%), unmarried individuals (56.7%), university graduates (54.5%), unemployed individuals (48.6%), and inhabitants of the northern provinces (50.2%). Compliance was significantly correlated to the level of personal knowledge on COVID-19. The quarantined individuals experienced greater health anxieties and preoccupations and exhibited increased reassurance-seeking behaviour. Higher knowledge of COVID-19 was a protective factor against health anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: A significant mental health burden is discovered among Iraqis during the quarantine period. Based on the insights gleaned from this study, psychological education and interventions should be prioritized to diminish the psychological impact of the quarantine experience, especially among the high-risk groups. Improvement in compliance to quarantine can be approached by providing better information regarding the novel infection.","Taha, Perjan Hashim",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309501/,483

METHODS: Data were collected on presentations of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes as well as on all paediatric presentations to the emergency department of a tertiary centre between 2015 and 2020. Data from the period of initial COVID restrictions in Australia (March to May 2020) were compared to the period March to May of the previous 5 years (pre‐pandemic periods). RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes was comparable in the pandemic period and pre‐pandemic periods (11 in 2020 vs range 6–10 in 2015–2019). The frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis was significantly higher in the pandemic period compared to the pre‐pandemic periods (45% vs 5%; P <0.003), odds ratio 16.7 (95% CI 2.0, 194.7). The overall frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis was also significantly higher during the pandemic period (73% vs 26%; P <0.007), odds ratio 7.5 (95% CI 1.7, 33.5). None of the individuals tested positive for COVID‐19. Presentations of people aged <18 years to the emergency department decreased by 27% in the pandemic period compared to the average of the pre‐pandemic periods (4799 vs 6550; range 6268 to 7131). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation of type 1 diabetes was observed during the initial period of COVID‐19 restrictions. We hypothesize that concern about presenting to hospital during a pandemic led to a delay in diagnosis. These data have important implications for advocacy of seeking healthcare for non‐pandemic‐related conditions during a global pandemic.","Lawrence, C.; Seckold, R.; Smart, C.; King, B.

All clinical and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients with definite outcomes were reviewed. For every measure, COVID-19 patients were grouped into quartiles according to the baseline levels of serum cystatin C. The highest cystatin C level was significantly related to more severe inflammatory conditions, worse organ dysfunction, and worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 (P values < 0.05). In the adjusted logistic regression analyses, the highest cystatin C level and ln-transformed cystatin C levels were independently associated with the risks of developing critically ill COVID-19 and all-cause death either in overall patients or in patients without chronic kidney disease (P values < 0.05). As a potential inflammatory marker, increasing baseline levels of serum cystatin C might independently predict adverse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Serum cystatin C could be routinely monitored during hospitalization, which showed clinical importance in prognosticating for adult patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Dan; Sun, Wenwu; Li, Jia; Wei, Bohua; Liu, Wei; Wang, Xiaopin; Song, Fan; Chen, Liangkai; Yang, Junhui; Yu, Li",Mediators Inflamm,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3764515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061826/,483
685518,Primary Science Education in Australian Universities: An Overview of Context and Practice,2021-09-18,"The studies on the mechanisms of viral–host interactions in infections have been focusing on protein-coding sequences of the genome. Although it is essential to consider the nonprotein-coding part that represents approximately 80% of the human genome. Thus advances in sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of thousands of RNAs with low or no capacity to encode proteins but are exhibiting crucial biological functions. Long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of these ncRNAs that are longer than 200 nt. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the involvement of these molecules in development and physiological processes, especially through their regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are encoded in mammalian cells as well as in microorganisms and viruses. Several studies have found differential expressions of lncRNAs in response to viral infection of emerging viruses, which suggest important roles. In fact, they are involved in promoting viral replication, evading host immunity and regulating the host response to the infection. In addition, lncRNAs do not induce immune response compared to viral proteins; thus viruses might employ them as an effective strategy to invade their hosts. In this chapter, we discuss particularly the emerging virus–host interaction associated lncRNAs through addressing their involvement in the mechanisms underlying emerging viral infections as well as in the pathways of immune system in response to these infections. We also discuss the promising role of these noncoding transcripts as biomarkers for diagnosing viral pathologies.","Lamsisi, Maryame; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149669000068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149669000068,483

690128,"The Epidemiological Characteristics of an Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) — China, 2020",2020-02-21,"Background: Data is lacking about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectiveness in patients with cancer, particularly those on systemic therapy. This retrospective cohort study in the US national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system reports the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients on and off active therapy during the first 140 days following administration. Methods: This is a multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated Veterans vaccinated during the period from 12/15/2020 to 5/4/2021. Veterans with solid or hematologic malignancy who received systemic cancer-directed therapy at the VA at least one time between 8/15/2010 to 5/4/2021 were included. Vaccinated patients were exactly matched 1:1 to an unvaccinated control on race, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment timing and modality with minimum distance matching on age. The primary exposure was receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls. Results: 184,485 patients met eligibility criteria and 113,796 were vaccinated during the study period. Of these, 29,152 vaccinated patients were matched 1:1 to 29,152 unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 days of follow-up, overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39 to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients on chemotherapy within three months prior to first vaccination dose exhibited a 14-day post-second dose effectiveness of 57% (95% CI -23 to 90%), versus 76% (95% CI 50 to 91%) for those on endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI 29 to 100%) for those off systemic therapy for at least six months prior. Conclusions: Vaccination is an effective strategy for preventing COVID-19 in cancer patients. However, effectiveness may be reduced in patients actively receiving immunosuppressive systemic therapy. Future study is needed to determine if these patients would benefit from post-vaccination serologies and/or a booster vaccination following completion of therapy.
