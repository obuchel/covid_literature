2087,Abdominal Muscle Activity during Mechanical Ventilation Increases Lung Injury in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2016-01-08,"OBJECTIVE: It has proved that muscle paralysis was more protective for injured lung in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the precise mechanism is not clear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35–60 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427±47 vs. 366±38 ml) and oxygenation index (293±36 vs. 226±31 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6±48.0 vs. 297.5±71.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8±78.2 vs. 357.5±69.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0±3.8 vs. 21.2±3.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9±6.8 vs. 29.5±7.9) in lung tissues. In addition, less lung histopathology injury were revealed in the BIPAP(AP) group (22.5±2.0 vs. 25.2±2.1). CONCLUSION: Abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation is one of the injurious factors in severe ARDS, so abdominal muscle paralysis might be an effective strategy to minimize ventilator-induce lung injury.","Zhang, Xianming; Wu, Weiliang; Zhu, Yongcheng; Jiang, Ying; Du, Juan; Chen, Rongchang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712828/,338
2975,Possible therapeutic effect of orally administered ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in an immunocompetent patient: a case report,2017-12-20,"BACKGROUND: Human respiratory syncytial virus usually causes self-limiting upper respiratory infection and occasionally causes pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Respiratory syncytial virus-induced severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults has been rarely described. Unfortunately, optimal treatment has not been established for this potentially fatal condition. We report a case of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome occurring in a previously healthy man successfully treated with orally administered ribavirin. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old previously healthy Korean man presented with cough, dyspnea, and febrile sensation. He had hypoxemia with diffuse ground glass opacity evident on chest radiography, which progressed and required mechanical ventilation. All microbiological tests were negative except multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimen, which was positive for human adenovirus. Under the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, orally administered ribavirin was administered and he recuperated completely without complications. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the potential usefulness of orally administered ribavirin as a therapeutic option for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, at least in an immunocompetent host.","Yoon, Byung Woo; Lee, Seung Hyeun",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5738173/,338
6751,Heat shock protein 70 and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,2005,"Due to growing interest in murine functional genomics research, there is an increasing need for physiological stable in vivo murine models. Of special importance is support and control of ventilation by artificial respiration, which is difficult to execute as a consequence of the small size of the animal and the technically demanding breathing pattern. In addition, numerous genetically altered mice show depressed spontaneous ventilation or impaired respiratory responses. After an introduction in murine respiratory physiology we describe options for ventilatory support, its monitoring and the potential side effects. This review will provide an overview on current possibilities in the field of airway support in mouse research.","Schwarte, L.A.; Zuurbier, C.J.; Ince, C.",Basic Res Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102075/,338

17899,A Case of STEMI Masquerading Brugada Syndrome: Emphasizing the Importance of Clinical Decision Making in Emergencies,2021-05-20,"Regular physical activity is an important component of physical health of children and has been associated with increasing skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength. Children with low levels of physical activity may experience health problems, such as loss of muscle mass, later in life. Thus, it may be valuable to identify declining physical function in children who do not perform the recommended amount of physical activity. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the amount of physical activity performed for ≥60 min per day for ≥5 days per week and the skeletal muscle mass index and physical function in young children. In total, 340 typically developing children aged 6–12 years (175 girls; average age, 9.5±1.9 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. We evaluated the proportion of children performing the recommended minimum of 60 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at least 5 days per week. The skeletal muscle mass and Gait Deviation Index scores, gait speed, grip strength, Five Times Sit-to-Stand test results, Timed Up-and-Go test results, one-leg standing time, and gait efficiency were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with the skeletal muscle mass index, percent body fat, and physical function, after controlling for confounding factors (age and sex). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the skeletal muscle mass index was independently associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (odds ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–4.71; P = 0.017). Performance of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for ≥5 days per week for ≥60 min per day was associated with the skeletal muscle mass index score of Japanese children. Our findings highlighted the importance of performing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for the development of skeletal muscle mass in children.","Ito, Tadashi; Sugiura, Hideshi; Ito, Yuji; Noritake, Koji; Ochi, Nobuhiko",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153420/,338

The model assumes that the interest rate is driven by economic and environmental conditions described by a homogenous Markov chain and that the stochastic force of mortality is modeled by the sum of a regime-switching Gompertz–Makeham model and a regime-switching shot-noise process. Using the conditional Laplace transform of the regime-switching shot-noise process, we give a formula for the longevity bond price in terms of a couple of system partial differential equations. The pricing formula is also derived by using the concept of stochastic flows and the idea of change of measure.","Dong, Yinghui; Yuen, Kam C.; Wu, Chongfeng",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149022/,338

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Ambulatory Antibiotic Use in an Academic Health System,2020-12-31,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have a shorter life expectancy than the general population primarily due to cardiovascular comorbidities. Objectives: To characterize arterial aging in RA. Patients and Methods: Coronary calcium score (CCS) were available from 112 RA patients; out of these patients, follow-up CCS were measured for 54 randomly selected individuals. Control CCS were obtained from the MESA database (includes 6,000 < participants); arterial age was calculated from CCS. Results: RA patients were significantly older (10.45 ± 18.45 years, p < 0.001) in terms of the arterial age than the age-, gender-, and race-matched controls. The proportion of RA patients who had zero CCS was significantly less (p < 0.01) than that of those in the MESA reference group. Each disease year contributed an extra 0.395 years (p < 0.01) on the top of the normal aging process. However, the rate of the accelerated aging is not uniform, in the first years of the disease it is apparently faster. Smoking (p < 0.05), previous cardiovascular events (p < 0.05), and high blood pressure (p < 0.05) had additional significant effect on the aging process. In the follow-up study, inflammatory disease activity (CRP > 5 mg/L, p < 0.05) especially in smokers and shorter than 10 years of disease duration (p = 0.05) had the largest impact. Conclusion: Arterial aging is faster in RA patients than in control subjects, particularly in the first 10 years of the disease. Inflammation, previous cardiovascular events, and smoking are additional contributing factors to the intensified coronary atherosclerosis progression. These data support that optimal control of inflammation is essential to attenuate the cardiovascular risk in RA.","Mong, Nikolett; Tarjanyi, Zoltan; Tothfalusi, Laszlo; Bartykowszki, Andrea; Nagy, Aniko Ilona; Szekely, Anett; Becker, David; Maurovich-Horvat, Pal; Merkely, Bela; Nagy, Gyorgy",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7774279/,338

Early Clinical Outcomes with Tocilizumab for Covid-19: A Two-Center Retrospective Study,2020-12-31,"Despite growing recognition among journalists and political pundits, the concept of victimhood has been largely ignored in empirical social science research. In this article, we develop a theory about, and use unique nationally-representative survey data to estimate, two manifestations of victimhood: an egocentric one entailing only perceptions of one’s own victimhood, and one focused on blaming “the system.” We find that these manifestations of victimhood cut across partisan, ideological, and sociodemographic lines, suggesting that feelings of victimhood are confined to neither “actual” victims nor those partisans on the losing side of elections. Moreover, both manifestations of victimhood, while related to candidate support and various racial attitudes, prove to be distinct from related psychological constructs, such as (collective) narcissism, system justification, and relative deprivation. Finally, an experiment based on candidate rhetoric demonstrates that some political messaging can make supporters feel like victims, which has consequences for subsequent attitudes and behavior.

Economic and workload impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physicians in the United States: results of a national survey,2020-12-31,"This is the first study investigating the changes in some gene expressions related to the TLR pathway in vivo in sheep. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) molecules were administrated separately and in combination to the Akkaraman lambs via intranasal route. For this purpose, 28 lambs were distributed into four groups (LPS, LTA, LPS + LTA, and control, n = 7). Blood samples were collected to isolate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at 24 h and on day 7. Expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-10, NF-κß, and IFN-γ genes were determined by qRT-PCR. Increases were determined in the expression data of TLR2 [LPS (P < 0.05) and LTA + LPS (P < 0.01)], TLR4 [LTA + LPS (P < 0.05)], TNF-α, IL-10 [LTA + LPS (P < 0.05)], and IFN-γ genes in all groups in the mRNA expression analysis of PBMCs isolated at 24 h whereas decreases were determined in the expression levels of these genes on day 7. The combination of LPS + LTA stimulated lamb PBMCs more effectively than separate administration of LPS and LTA at 24 h. Therefore, this article may contribute to the understanding the host-pathogen interaction of respiratory-transmitted bacterial diseases concerning PBMCs at 24 h and on day 7. Also this study may contribute to the dose adjustment for bacterial vaccine studies in sheep. Experimental application doses will be helpful for in vivo and in vitro drug and vaccine development studies in the fields of pharmacology and microbiology.","Aksel, Esma Gamze; Akyüz, Bilal",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779097/,338

43978,387. Markers for Mortality in COVID-19 Patients with Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 causes lung inflammation and lesions, and chest X-ray and computed tomography images are remarkably suitable for differentiating the new disease from patients with other lung diseases. In this paper, we propose a computer model to classify X-ray images of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Chest X-ray exams were chosen over computed tomography scans because they are low cost, results are quickly obtained, and X-ray equipment is readily available. METHODS: A new CNN network, called CNN-COVID, has been developed to classify X-ray patient’s images. Images from two different datasets were used. The images of Dataset I is originated from the COVID-19 image data collection and the ChestXray14 repository, and the images of Dataset II belong to the BIMCV COVID-19+ repository. To assess the accuracy of the network, 10 training and testing sessions were performed in both datasets. A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the model’s performance and calculate the following metrics: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP). In addition, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) were also considered. RESULTS: After running 10 tests, the average accuracy for Dataset I and Dataset II was 0.9787 and 0.9839, respectively. Since the weights of the best test results were applied in the validation, it was obtained the accuracy of 0.9722 for Dataset I and 0.9884 for Dataset II. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the CNN-COVID is a promising tool to help physicians classify chest images with pneumonia, considering pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and pneumonia due to other causes.","de Sousa, Pedro Moisés; Carneiro, Pedro Cunha; Oliveira, Mariane Modesto; Pereira, Gabrielle Macedo; da Costa Junior, Carlos Alberto; de Moura, Luis Vinicius; Mattjie, Christian; da Silva, Ana Maria Marques; Patrocinio, Ana Claudia",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781433/,338

The three-way decisions offer a novel study perspective to solve this problem. Firstly, we describe some relevant attributes of the enterprise with double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets, and construct double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic information systems for each enterprise. Secondly, we get the weights of attributes with the entropy weight method, and take the weighted aggregation of attributes information as the conditional probability that the enterprise is in a safe state. Next, we classify each enterprise according to its size. Considering the influence of different sizes of enterprises, we put forward the corresponding loss function matrix. Then we get the decision results about work resumption based on the principle of minimizing the loss, which demonstrates the practicability and effectiveness of our method. Finally, we compare the method proposed by us with the other method and discuss the advantages and limitations of our proposed method.","Li, Xiang; Wang, Hai; Xu, Zeshui",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781655/,338

Implementing a Follow-up Call Program for Ambulatory patients with COVID-19 in a Tertiary Center in Mexico City,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19 pneumonia, is associated with heterogenous presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. METHODS: We included adult patients admitted to the hospital with clinical and radiographic findings of pneumonia and a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of admission. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load status groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) ≥35) intermediate (25< Ct< 35) and high (Ct ≤25) using real-time PCR. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of death, intubation and/or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Secondary outcomes included severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Sensitivity analyses were performed to include Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the composite outcome and varying Ct classification breakpoints. RESULTS: Of 457 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 assay from March 31(st) to April 10(th) 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21–28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p< 0.001) and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, high genomic load remained an independent predictor of primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Flow Chart [Image: see text] Prediction of Outcomes Based on Genomic Load [Image: see text] Prediction of Outcomes Based on Genomic Load and Pneumonia Severity Index [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: High genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples at the time of admission is independently associated with mortality and intubation. This finding should prompt further research on the role of viral load as a clinical predictor and possible modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes as treatment strategies evolve in this global pandemic.

Antiretroviral Laboratory Monitoring and Implications for HIV Clinical Care in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 most commonly report respiratory symptoms, with a minority reporting gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in currently available reports. Additionally, little is known about the symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia anecdotally seen in COVID-19 patients, which may be considered both GI and sensory/neurological manifestations of infection. METHODS: We interviewed 7 patients via oral inquiries and a questionnaire, collecting data on subject symptoms and their durations. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm 2 of these cases. RESULTS: We report a familial cluster of 7 COVID-19 cases, 5 of whom reported sensory symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia (5/7), ageusia/hypogeusia (5/7), and/or dysgeusia (3/7). All 7 cases reported GI involvement with one or more symptom of: nausea (5/7), diarrhea (4/7), abdominal pain (3/7), anorexia (3/7), and emesis (2/7). Figure 1. Timeline of Symptoms and Exposure to Index Case in Familial COVID-19 Cluster [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This frequency of GI symptoms is high relative to currently available epidemiological reports, which also infrequently report on sensory symptoms. The mechanistic underpinnings of GI and sensory symptoms in COVID-19 warrant close consideration and analysis, especially as it relates to reducing disease transmission.

44083,"364. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Southwest Georgia, U.S. – an interim analysis of an early hot spot",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) and is associated with respiratory failure and death in severe disease. This is associated with high levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha which are predictors of severe outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome which results in secretion of the cytokine IL-1ß. While high levels of IL-1ß are not observed in most patients with severe COVID-19, there is a subset of patients with high IL-1ß levels. Here we sought to characterize these patients and determine whether high IL-1ß levels are associated with adverse outcomes and death in COVID-19. METHODS: We identified 90 patients with high IL-1ß levels (greater or equal to 2 pg/ml) and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in our hospital system in New York March 12 and May 8, 2020. We collected baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory values, COVID-19 treatment, and outcomes from this group and the group with IL-1ß levels below 2 pg/ml. Baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Comparing patients by IL-1ß level had similar demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status and comorbid disease prevalence). The group had comparable levels of adverse markers of disease severity but the patients with high IL-1ß had increased inflammatory biomarkers including IL-8 (629 vs. 68 pg/ml, p< 0.0001), TNF-alpha (30 vs. 51 pg/ml, p< 0.0001), IL-6 (173 vs. 5075 pg/ml, p< 0.0001), CRP (141 vs. 178, p=0.0007), d-dimer (2.6 vs. 4 p=0.0002), and increased rates of death (30% vs. 20%, p=0.008). CONCLUSION: Demographic and comorbid conditions are not effective at predicting high IL-1ß serum levels in COVID-19 patients, however those individuals with high levels are at risk for adverse outcomes of severe disease and death. Further investigation is required to probe the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1ß signaling and the role of this cytokine in mediated inflammation and death in COVID-19.

44097,692. Secondary Infections and Coinfections in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: More than 360,000 people infected with COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) by the end of May 2020.The spatial variations of prevalence across the counties in NYS suggested that variations in county-level factors might contribute to the statewide COVID-19 outbreak. However, no study to date investigates such variations and the relevant predictors. We leveraged multiple public datasets and machine learning approaches to construct the county-level spatial-temporal prediction model of COVID-19 in NYS. Findings generating from this study help identify counties with high prevalence, county-level predictors, and promising next steps for policy efforts to control the second wave of statewide COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: Cumulative confirmed case rates (CCCR) of COVID-19 by county in NYS were extracted from the US Health Data system at four critical time points including March 17(th) (state of emergency, 4.40 per 100,000 people), April 18(th) (coronavirus peak, 310.10 per 100,000 people), April 25(th) (expand testing, 393.90 per 100,000 people), and May 11(th) (daily increased rate back to the level in March, 505.30 per 100,000 people. A total of 28 county-level predictors were used to construct the prediction model, and the generalized linear mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to select the predictors of COVID-19 outbreak across the counties in NYS with adjusting for time effect. RESULTS: The CCCR by the final timepoint was 1,850.3 per 100,000 people. Rockland County had the highest CCCR than any other counties, with a rate of 3,856.82 per 100,000 people, while Chautauqua and Franklin counties had the lowest CCCR (0.03 per 100,000 people). LASSO regression revealed counties with a larger proportion of non-citizen (β=9537.97, p=0.02) had a higher CCCR of COVID-19 across the time. In contrast, counties with a lower proportion of people with at least high school education (β=-6157.89, p=0.025) and a larger proportion of houses with less than 3 people (β=-5995.79471, p=0.01) had lower CCCR. CONCLUSION: We identified immigrant status, education level and household type influenced the spatial variations of COVID-19 outbreak in NYS.

44099,382. Incidence of Hospital-Acquired and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Patients with Severe COVID 19 on High Flow Oxygen,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many questions arose regarding risks for hospital-acquired or nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs), techniques that can generate infectious, virus-laden aerosols, could potentially amplify transmission among healthcare workers (HCWs). Thus, it was widely recommended that HCWs use airborne precautions when performing AGMPs. However, in clinical settings it is often unclear what procedures constitute AGMPs and how the risk varies by procedure or pathogen. We set out to further define AGMPs and assess the risk for nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other high-risk viruses via AGMPs. METHODS: We identified potential AGMPs and emerging viruses that were high-risk for nosocomial transmission through reviewing experimental and clinical data. Potential AGMPs were those associated with previous virus transmission or mechanically capable of transmission. High-risk viruses were defined as those that cause severe disease in humans for which limited therapies or interventions exist, are infectious via aerosols in humans or non-human primates (NHPs), found in the respiratory tract of infected humans or NHPs, and had previous evidence of nosocomial transmission. RESULTS: We identified multiple potential AGMPs, which could be divided into those that generate aerosols or induce a patient to form aerosols, as well as eight families of high-risk viruses. All of the viruses were emerging zoonotic RNA viruses. In the family Coronaviridae, we identified potential evidence for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission via AGMPs. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were also found to be similarly stable when aerosolized. CONCLUSION: Multiple emerging zoonotic viruses pose a high risk for nosocomial transmission through a variety of AGMPs. Given the similar stability of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-1 when aerosolized and prior nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-1 via AGMPs, we suspect that certain AGMPs pose an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Additional experimental studies and on-site clinical sampling during AGMPs are necessary to further risk stratify AGMPs.

Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Among People Living with HIV: Cohort from a Large Academic Center,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric patients, unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration with or without following cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) are rare events, but can be caused by any of several etiologies, including infectious diseases. The most common cause of out-of-hospital CPA in children ≤12 years old was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), whereas infectious diseases were responsible for approximately 10% of the CPA cases. However, the role of infection may have been underestimated as triggers of SIDS or CPA. This study aimed to investigate the infectious etiologies in pediatric patients with unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration using next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: A total of 16 pediatric patients who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration with or without following CPA were enrolled. Ten bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and six transtracheal aspirates (TTA) samples obtained in the acute phase were used to prepare NGS libraries. The libraries were sequenced on HiSeq and analyzed using metagenome analysis tools. RESULTS: In ten of 16 patients, one or more bacterial/viral pathogens were detected in the BALF or TTA specimens using NGS. Compared to the conventional culture and viral antigen test results, an additional 6 bacterial (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis) and 4 viral pathogens (e.g., coxsackievirus A6 and human coronavirus NL63) were identified by NGS in four of ten patients in whom no causative pathogen had been identified by conventional culture and viral antigen tests. A summary of the detected pathogens is listed in Table 1. Notably, sequencing results allowed us to define genotypes for all of the detected viruses in a single NGS assay per patient. Furthermore, based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region, the coxsackievirus A6 strain detected in this study belongs to lineage E2 and harbors an amino acid change (T283A), a substitution that has potential to cause severe illness. Table 1 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that viral and bacterial infection are common triggers in unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration in pediatric patients. NGS has the potential to contribute to the clarification of the etiology of pediatric critical illness.

44124,61. Using Machine Learning for Prediction of Poor Clinical Outcomes in Adult Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus responsible for the ongoing global pandemic and associated respiratory disease. Rapid development and implementation of molecular diagnostic testing solutions has been imperative to meet the enormous and urgent public health needs, and remains a key component of the US emergency response. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), with emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA, have been subject to significant supply chain shortages. This study aims to comparatively assess several commercially available substitutive mastermix reagents for the CDC SARS-CoV-2 EUA test and the TIB Mol Biol LightMix Modular (RUO) test. METHODS: Positive control material included with each testing kit was used directly as DNA template for all manually assembled reactions and comparative evaluation. Additionally, these tests were evaluated similarly using the cobas omni Optimization kit, the first step in assessing suitability on the cobas® omni Utility Channel for high-volume user-defined molecular testing on the fully automated cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. All PCR was performed per the manufacturer’s instructions using the User Defined Workflow (UDF; open channel) on the cobas® z 480 analyzer. RESULTS: Robust amplification of the commercial control material was observed with each mastermix for all gene targets within the CDC and LightMix tests. Modest but significant (ANOVA, p< 0.05) target-specific Ct-value impacts were observed among the mastermixes assessed in this study. Using the cobas® omni optimization kit, Ct values for each target within the CDC and LightMix tests were consistently and significantly lower (ANOVA, p< 0.05) than the comparator mastermixes. CONCLUSION: Each mastermix may be a useful alternative to the recommended mastermix for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Additionally, these findings suggest the CDC and LightMix tests may be adapted for fully-automated, high-throughput testing on the 6800/8800 Systems.

Geographical Disparities in Clinical Outcomes of Severe COVID-19 Patients Treated with Remdesivir,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Due to the emergence of COVID-19 and resulting pandemic, there is an increased demand for palliative care and hospice care services. However, the impact of COVID-19 on the hospice and palliative agencies is unknown. METHODS: An electronic survey was disseminated via the Hospice & Palliative Nurses Association newsletter, posted to the Sigma Theta Tau Hospice and Palliative Care Community Group discussion board and advertised through social media from May 7–28, 2020. Summary statistics were computed. RESULTS: We collected 36 surveys representing all U.S. regions. Most respondents (78%) reported that their agency has cared for confirmed COVID-19 patients. Only half of agencies had access to laboratory facilities for surveillance and detection of the presence of outbreaks in both patients and staff (58%) and the ability to test patients and providers for COVID-19 (55%). Due to COVID-19, participants stated that the agency added new protocols regarding aerosol-generating procedures policies (58%), use of surface barriers (61%) and PPE usage (e.g. donning and doffing) in patient homes (56%). The majority (76%) reported that their agency required field clinicians to call ahead to ascertain COVID-19 exposure/symptoms before a home visit. More than half (58%) reported that their agency lacked supplies, including N95 respirators (45%), cleaning/disinfectant product (23%), alcohol based sanitizer (18%), eye protection (18%), gowns (18%), and surgical masks (14%). Overall, participants shared that field clinicians had to reuse (76%), extend (73%) or ration (30%) PPE supplies. Respondents reported that their agency accessed supplemental PPE through state/local resources (67%), private/community donations (67%), and do-it-yourself efforts (55%). One third (31%) reported that their agency was experiencing staffing shortages due to COVID-19; of these, 60% reported that shortages were due to staff infected with/quarantined due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has presented significant challenges for palliative care and hospice agencies as they provide care to patients and families at an unprecedented rate.

Utility of Tracheal Aspirates in Guiding Antibiotic Use in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 transmission from mother to infant suggests that vertical and horizontal transmission of COVID-19 are possible. Here we describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women and their newborns. Summarized Characteristics of 19 COVID-19 Positive Mothers that Delivered 3/31/20–6/17/20 at Boston Medical Center [Image: see text] METHODS: We collected data from the electronic medical records of pregnant women. Data composed of maternal demographics and morbidities, and symptoms of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Women had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing done by nasopharyngeal swabs. Each newborn was tested for SARS_CoV-2 by RT_PCR with a nasopharyngeal swab at 24 hours, 48 hours, and day 5 of life. RESULTS: 36 women met criteria to be included in this study. 22% had chronic hypertension, 8% had asthma, one had chronic HIV and hepatitis C, 30% had pregnancy-related morbidities including pregnancy-induced hypertension (19%), cholestasis of pregnancy (8%) and gestational diabetes(3%) (Table1) Of the 32 deliveries to date, 17 (53% delivered vaginally and 15 (47%) via C-section. Of the 15 C-sections, 6 (40%) were due to complications related to COVID-19. 38% (14/36) women developed hypoxia. Five newborns (15%) born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers had positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. 2 of them were born prematurely and by C section secondary to COVID 19 infection respiratory deterioration. One premature infant tested positive for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on days 1, 2, and 5. The other one was positive on day 2. The two full-term newborns who tested positive by PCR for COVID 19 after delivery, were not delivered secondary to COVID 19 complications. One infant who was separated from his mother was negative by PCR at days 1,2 and 5 but tested positive later after being in contact with his mother. CONCLUSION: Our population of pregnant mothers had a high incidence of cesarean section secondary to COVID 19 infection complications. They also had a high frequency of chronic health conditions. Infants born to mothers with COVID-19 can have positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that both, vertical and horizontal mother to infant transmission is possible. Infants had negative tests before positive tests, suggesting false negative testing may have occurred.

44145,76. Effect of Early Administration of Systemic Corticosteroids on Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected people experiencing homelessness (PEH) residing in shelters. Initial and regular testing of PEH in communities with moderate or substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission may limit spread in shelters. We analyzed factors associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody tests for PEH staying in shelters or encampments in Denver, Colorado. METHODS: In May 2020, Denver Public Health collaborated with local leaders to identify 4 homeless shelters and 3 outdoor encampments for voluntary, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing. At each testing event, a short questionnaire including sociodemographic factors and symptoms was administered to PEH who consented to testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs; antibody testing was performed on venous blood samples. PEH reporting a prior positive RT-PCR test were not retested but were eligible for antibody testing. Statistical calculations were performed with an α of 0.05; all tests were two-sided. RESULTS: From June 2–July 28, 2020, 931 PEH were approached. A total of 863 RT-PCR tests were performed at 14 testing events, and 334 antibody tests were performed at 5 testing events. Overall, 604 and 259 RT-PCR tests were conducted in 4 shelters and 3 encampments, respectively; 189 and 145 antibody tests were conducted in 3 shelters and 2 encampments, respectively. PEH tested in shelters were older, more often men, less often Native American, and less likely to report COVID-19 symptoms than those tested at encampments (Table 1). Overall, 9% of PEH tested in shelters tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 3% of PEH tested in encampments (p=0.002); 8% of men had positive RT-PCR results compared to 2% of women (p=0.03) (Table 2). PEH tested at shelters had a higher percentage of detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those tested in encampments (24% vs 8%, p=0.0002; Table 3). Neither RT-PCR nor antibody test results differed significantly by race or ethnicity. Table 1. Demographics of participants residing in encampments compared with shelters in Denver, Colorado, May-July 2020 (n=931) [Image: see text] Table 2.

A sustainable science diplomacy requires the capacity for empathy and compassion, an ability to build and foster working relationships, and an awareness of the importance of cooperation between scientists and politicians/diplomats. Scientists and politicians together need to develop and apply a public information strategy in support of their common efforts to manage crisis and solve problems. We need to restructure concepts, constructs, techniques, and strategies of public policy and diplomacy, adapting them to this new era of global communication that shapes the public context within which events unfold as the COVID-19 experience has showed. More precisely, the focus will be on science diplomacy as a useful means to give a strategic impetus to international relations and on how the science of applied cognitive psychology could help shed new light on adaptive decision-making and have an effective impact on connecting the worlds of science and diplomacy.","Galluccio, Mauro",Science and Diplomacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981038/,338

VI and blindness are an important cause of years lived with disability. However, the association of VI and blindness with mortality, including the risk of bias in published studies and certainty of the evidence, has not been adequately studied in an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Databases, including MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid and Global Health, will be searched for relevant studies. Two reviewers will then screen studies and review full texts to identify studies for inclusion. Data extraction will be performed, and for included studies, the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence will be assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The prognostic factor in this study is visual function, which must have been measured using a standard objective ophthalmic clinical or research instrument. We will use standard criteria from WHO to categorise VI and blindness. All-cause mortality may be assessed by any method one or more years after baseline assessment of vision. Results from included studies will be meta-analysed according to relevant sections of the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will only include published data; therefore, ethics approval will not be sought. The findings of this review and meta-analysis will be published in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal and will be included in the ongoing Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health.","Ehrlich, Joshua R; Ramke, Jacqueline; Macleod, David; Swenor, Bonnielin K; Burn, Helen; Lee, Chan Ning; Waldock, William J; Zhang, Justine H; Gordon, Iris; Congdon, Nathan; Burton, Matthew; Evans, Jennifer R",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565478/,338
75513,"Editorial Comment on ""Imaging Findings in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19"".",2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND In Germany, widespread full closures of schools and day care facilities were part of lockdown measures to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia closures took place on March 16, 2020 and were gradually eased from end of April 2020 until beginning of June 2020. OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 among children and adolescents during the reopening period of schools and day care facilities in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It further depicts medical history and results of physical examinations of pediatric patients undergoing a test for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was carried out by a naso- and / or oropharyngeal swab by local pediatricians at the time of presentation. Samples were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Medical history and physical examination results were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS 525 children and adolescents presented mainly with mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Their medical history and examination results did not stand out from the other patients. CONCLUSION A precautious stepwise opening of schools and day care facilities was not associated with the occurrence of a relevant prevalence of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. However, a low general prevalence of COVID-19 at the end of the observation period has to be taken into account. Systematic testing might enable adjusted regulations in favor of full closures, especially in the light of increasing evidence for pediatric patients constituting a low-risk group for COVID-19.","Körner, Robert Walter; Weber, Lutz Thorsten",Klinische Padiatrie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1341-9530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461226/,338
77052,A recently explored aspect of the iceberg named COVID-19: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).,2021-01-01,"A previous paper published in this journal proposed a model for evaluating the location of fingermarks on two-dimensional items (de Ronde, van Aken, de Puit and de Poot (2019)). In this paper, we apply the proposed model to a dataset consisting of letters to test whether the activity of writing a letter can be distinguished from the alternative activity of reading a letter based on the location of the fingermarks on the letters. An experiment was conducted in which participants were asked to read a letter and write a letter as separate activities on A4- and A5-sized papers. The fingermarks on the letters were visualized, and the resulting images were transformed into grid representations. A binary classification model was used to classify the letters into the activities of reading and writing based on the location of the fingermarks in the grid representations. Furthermore, the limitations of the model were studied by testing the influence of the length of the letter, the right- or left-handedness of the donor and the size of the paper with an additional activity of folding the paper. The results show that the model can predict the activities of reading or writing a letter based on the fingermark locations on A4-sized letters of right-handed donors with 98 % accuracy. Additionally, the length of the written letter and the handedness of the donor did not influence the performance of the classification model. Changing the size of the letters and adding an activity of folding the paper after writing on it decreased the model's accuracy. Expanding the training set with part of this new set had a positive influence on the model's accuracy. The results demonstrate that the model proposed by de Ronde, van Aken, de Puit and de Poot (2019) can indeed be applied to other two-dimensional items on which the disputed activities would be expected to lead to different fingermark locations. Moreover, we show that the location of fingermarks on letters provides valuable information about the activity that is carried out.","de Ronde, Anouk; van Aken, Marja; de Poot, Christianne J; de Puit, Marcel",Forensic science international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818849/,338

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: • in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; • in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Special precautions should be taken and procedures followed when performing invasive medical procedures in endoscopic laboratories in patients with specific or clinically probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 xylitol studies and one erythritol study were reviewed. The review identified nine xylitol studies with a fair or high quality, four conducted in children and five in adults, all demonstrating a decrease in MS levels in association with habitual consumption of xylitol. The three microbiota studies employing multispecies probe approaches revealed no effects for xylitol on the microbiota. The only erythritol study fulfilling the inclusion criteria showed no consistent effects on MS levels.Conclusions: Xylitol consumption is likely to decrease MS counts but it may not change the overall microbiota. Xylitol shows thus properties of an oral prebiotic.

Because widespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is critical to end the pandemic, addressing vaccine hesitancy is an important public health priority. Between April 1, 2020 and March 16, 2021, we have repeatedly surveyed a nationally representative online panel of adults and have tracked their stated likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccinations. We present new evidence that in recent months disparities in self-reported likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination have narrowed by race/ethnicity, with an increasing proportion of Black individuals and Hispanic individuals indicating that they are likely to get a vaccine. At the same time, younger adults have progressively become less likely than older adults to state they will get a COVID-19 vaccine. Most vaccine-hesitant individuals are concerned about both vaccine efficacy and safety and do not trust the vaccine development or vaccine approval process. We conclude that outreach efforts to minority populations may be achieving their objectives in raising confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, but special outreach efforts are needed to address both vaccine hesitancy among younger adults and mistrust in the vaccine development and approval process.","Szilagyi, Peter G; Thomas, Kyla; Shah, Megha D; Vizueta, Nathalie; Cui, Yan; Vangala, Sitaram; Kapteyn, Arie",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1929695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170793/,338

Technologies that enable carbon capture and conversion of greenhouse gases into useful products will help mitigate climate change by enabling a new circular carbon economy. Gas fermentation using carbon-fixing microorganisms offers an economically viable and scalable solution with unique feedstock and product flexibility that has been commercialized recently. We review the state of the art of gas fermentation and discuss opportunities to accelerate future development and rollout. We discuss the current commercial process for conversion of waste gases to ethanol, including the underlying biology, challenges in process scale-up, and progress on genetic tool development and metabolic engineering to expand the product spectrum.

All individuals aged 12 years or older, who were admitted to a Medical University Hospital between August 2014 and December 2016, were asked to fill out the BSRS-5 at admission. The study was conducted in a medical inpatient setting, excluding Intensive Care Units and the Emergency Service Department. The 93,129 participants were recruited for analysis. Pearson's correlation, regression analysis and path analysis were performed to test the association between SI and each item of psychopathology and to determine the discrimination validity of individual BSRS-5 items for predicting SI. The prevalence rate was 2.3% for SI and 2.0% for PM among all participants. PM was more prevalent in females and those aged 25-54 years. Individuals with PM had a significantly higher rate of SI (44.6%) than did others (1.4%). The prevalence of PM was varied by department, e.g., Psychiatry (44.3%), Rehabilitation Medicine (7.9%), and Nephrology (5.2%). The regression analysis and path analysis with structural equation model indicated that depression, hostility, anxiety, and inferiority were significant independent predictors of SI. The BSRS-5 is an efficient and useful screening tool to identify psychological distress and SI among inpatients in a general hospital. Its integration into the electronic medical chart facilitates identifying patients at risk.","Lee, Jia-In; Burdick, Katherine E; Ko, Chih-Hung; Liu, Tai-Ling; Lin, Yi Chun; Lee, Ming-Been",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/kjm2.12336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336553/,338

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of the use of both defect size reduction with sutures and secondary healing with delayed reconstruction with full-thickness skin grafts in NMSC patients. In total, 18 (42.8%) male and 24 (57.2%) female patients with NMSC were operated. Defect size was measured both after excision and just before repair, and the approximate defect area was calculated with ImageJ software. Reconstruction was performed after 14 days in all patients in the second session, using free skin grafts. There were 18 (42.8%) male and 24 (57.2%) female patients. The mean age was 70.5 (45-82) years. The mean follow-up period was 40.3 (16-68) months. The mean defect area measured after excision was 8.44 ± 1.91 cm2. After 14 days of delay, the mean defect area was 5.51 ± 1.28 cm2 (34.8% reduction) (p < 0.05). Defect-reduction methods applied during the first session, together with proper interval prior to placement of graft, have been shown to be beneficial and acceptable methods, providing an advantage in reconstruction with free skin graft.","Sezgin, Baha; Kaya, Isa; Turhal, Goksel; Apaydin, Fazil",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937673/,338

Physical distancing recommendations to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV2-19 virus increase the risk of social isolation and loneliness, which are associated with negative outcomes including anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and mortality. Taken together, social isolation and additional psychological impacts of the pandemic (e.g., worry, grief) underscore the importance of intervention efforts to older adults. This narrative review draws upon a wide range of evidence to provide a comprehensive overview of appropriate remotely-delivered interventions for older adults that target loneliness and psychological symptoms. These include interventions delivered by a range of individuals (i.e., community members to mental health professionals), and interventions that vary by implementation (e.g., self-guided therapy, remotely-delivered interventions via telephone or video call). Recommendations to overcome barriers to implementation and delivery are provided, with consideration given to the different living situations.","Gorenko, Julie A; Moran, Chelsea; Flynn, Michelle; Dobson, Keith; Konnert, Candace",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820958550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914668/,338

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of fatal primary liver cancers worldwide. This study aims to determine whether lncRNA SNHG7 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 7) functions in the metastasis of HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the SNHG7 expression in HCC cells and tissue samples. Moreover, function assays were performed in vitro to identify the role of SNHG7 in metastasis of HCC cells. Western blot assay was used to explore the possible mechanism. RESULTS SNHG7 expression was remarkably higher in HCC tissues than that in adjacent tissues. Moreover, HCC migration and invasion were suppressed after silence of SNHG7 in HCC cells. Moreover, after silence of SNHG7, RBM5 was upregulated in HCC cells. Besides, the expression of RBM5 in tumor tissues was negatively correlated to the expression of SNHG7. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that SNHG7 could promote cell invasion and migration in HCC cells through downregulating RBM5, which may offer a new therapeutic intervention for HCC patients.","Sun, B-Z; Ji, D-G; Feng, Z-X; Wang, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201907_18307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298322/,338

In the UK, units have cancelled elective surgery and a decrease in aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) was favoured. Centres around the world advocate the use of negative pressure environments for AGPs in reducing the spread of infectious airborne particles. We present an overview of operating theatre ventilation systems and the respective evidence with relation to surgical site infection (SSI) and airborne pathogen transmission in light of COVID-19. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases. Search terms included ""COVID-19"", ""theatre ventilation"", ""laminar"", ""turbulent"" and ""negative pressure"". FINDINGS Evidence for laminar flow ventilation in reducing the rate of SSI in orthopaedic surgery is widely documented. There is little evidence to support its use in general surgery. Following previous viral outbreaks, some centres have introduced negative pressure ventilation in an attempt to decrease exposure of airborne pathogens to staff and surrounding areas. This has again been suggested during the COVID-19 pandemic. A limited number of studies show some positive results for the use of negative pressure ventilation systems and reduction in spread of pathogens; however, cost, accessibility and duration of conversion remain an unexplored issue. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to advocate large scale conversion at this time. Nevertheless, it may be useful for each centre to have its own negative pressure room available for AGPs and high risk patients.","Theodorou, C; Simpson, G S; Walsh, C J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645287/,338

As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries. Oncologists in the United States facing unprecedented decisions about prioritization can draw on ethical frameworks and lessons learned from real-world cancer care priority setting in resource-constrained environments.","DeBoer, Rebecca J; Fadelu, Temidayo A; Shulman, Lawrence N; Van Loon, Katherine",JAMA oncology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.2976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761149/,338

A survey of HKCFP members.,2020-06-01,"Bimetallic Fe- and Mo-embedded N-enriched porous biochar (Fe-Mo@N-BC) is developed and serves as a cost-effective and highly efficient catalyst for mineralization of non-biodegradation organic contaminants. Fe-Mo@N-BC was prepared by pyrolysis of complex Fe/Mo -containing precursors. Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping suggested that Fe and Mo are uniformly dispersed in nitrogen-doped biochar with hierarchical mesopores. In comparison to Fe@N-BC and Mo@N-BC, Fe-Mo@N-BC exhibited a superior activity for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The stable activity was ascribed to N-doping and synergistic effect of Fe and Mo species, where both Fe-Nx and Mo-Nx can simultaneously serve as the active sites and N-BC can act as a carrier and an activator as well as an electron mediator. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments indicated that HO•, O2•- and 1O2 were responsible for organic degradation. The effects of PMS dosage, initial Orange II concentration, temperature, solution pH, coexisting anions and humic acids on organic degradation were also investigated. With the assistance of an external magnet, Fe-Mo@N-BC can be easily separated after reaction and remains stable in the reusability tests. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy towards the fabrication of Fe, Mo-embedded N-enriched porous biochar catalysts for the detoxification of organic contaminants.","Yao, Yunjin; Hu, Huanhuan; Zheng, Hongda; Hu, Hongwei; Tang, Yinghao; Liu, Xiaoyan; Wang, Shaobin",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399226/,338

However, cEEG is more resource-consuming, and its relationship to outcome compared to repeated rEEG has only been formally assessed very recently in a randomized controlled trial, which did not show any significant difference in terms of long-term mortality or functional outcome. Awaiting more refined trials, it seems therefore that using repeated rEEG in ICU patients may represent a reasonable alternative in resource-limited settings. Prolonged EEG has been used recently in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, the proportion of seizures seems albeit relatively low, and similar to ICU patients with medical conditions. As in any case a timely EEG recording is recommended in the ICU, r ecent technical developments may ease its use in clinical practice.","Rossetti, Andrea O; Lee, Jong W",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15473-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688697/,338

By measuring the arising times of these local extrema from the time-resolved harmonic signals, the rotational temperature and pump intensity can be accurately measured. We have demonstrated our method using N2 molecules.

146943,Deletion of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F in renal tubules downregulates SGLT2 expression and attenuates hyperfiltration and kidney injury in a mouse model of diabetes.,2021-08-09,"INTRODUCTION It was determined recently that [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(2)(X(-))(CO(3))(3)] could strongly bind to the CN group, allowing direct labeling of CN in vitamin B(12) despite the presence of a benzimidazole group. The aim of this paper was to perform a critical study of this potentiality, coupling quantum chemical calculations to experimental evidence. METHODS Computational methods: Within the density functional theory calculations, the 6-31+G basis set (C, H, O, N atoms) and the LANL2DZ basis set (Tc,Re) were used. Stability calculations of the [RCNM(CO)(3)](+)) (M=Tc,Re) complexes were performed with the Gaussian 03 suite of programs, while for the evaluation of relative stability substitution reactions were used. Radiochemistry: Vitamin B(12), 4-hydroxy-benzylcyanide and 4-methoxy-benzonitrile were labeled at 100 degrees C during 30 min. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed using radioactive and UV detection. RESULTS Computational methods: The influence of different ligands on the stability yielded a sequence: imidazole>tBuCN>NH(3) approximately CH(3)CN>HCN (mimicking the best CoCN)>H(2)O. The transmetalation reaction indicates that all ligands prefer Re to Tc. The preference for the nitrogen atom of imidazole to the cyanide nitrogen atom for complex formation with [Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)](+) is interpreted in terms of the hard and soft acid and base properties principle. Radiochemistry: 4-Hydroxy-benzylcyanide and 4-methoxy-benzonitrile did not show any labeling. An excess of acetonitrile did not inhibit the labeling of vitamin B(12) as expected if the CN group should be involved, indicating that the labeling occurs on a stronger complexing group present like benzimidazole. CONCLUSION Both theory and experiments prove that [CN-Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)((2-x))L(x)](+) complexes are weak and that in vitamin B(12) most probably the benzimidazole group is involved.","Safi, Benasser; Mertens, John; Kersemans, Ken; Geerlings, Paul",Nuclear medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2008.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848659/,338

These professionals have been exposed to numerous new risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study describes how the COVID-19 pandemic is perceived by CHWs who work in poor communities or slums in Brazil. METHODS We conducted an online survey with a random sample of 775 CHWs operating in 368 municipalities of the 26 Brazilian states. At a confidence level of 95% , results of the survey were subject to a maximum sampling error of 4% . RESULTS Our data indicate that the negationist agenda increases the challenges to the performance of CHWs within low-income communities, preventing the consensus on the necessity of social distancing, business closures and other measures to face the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The pandemic imposes unexpected challenges on the usual modes of interaction of public health officers with poor communities. This study provides evidence that these challenges have been ignored or minimized in Brazilian policy prescriptions for primary care in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","do Rosário Costa, Nilson; Bellas, Hugo; da Silva, Paulo Roberto Fagundes; de Carvalho, Paulo Victor Rodrigues; Uhr, Deborah; Vieira, Cristine; Jatobá, Alessandro",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427724/,338

Here, we analyse the criteria and processes that ten of the largest public and non-profit research funders use to choose between competing grant applications. Our data suggest that research funders rarely instruct reviewers to consider disease burden or to prioritise research for sicker or more disadvantaged populations, and typically only include scientists in the review processes. This is liable to undermine efforts to link research funding to health needs.","Pierson, Leah; Millum, Joseph",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1922731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938386/,338
152243,Immune pathogenesis of COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND The morbidity and mortality of stroke is disproportionately high in developing countries owing to the poor health care system and poor neurologic interventions. Though a number of studies were conducted to estimate the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia, the lack of a nationwide study that determines the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke is an important research gap. Meta-analysis is key to improve the accuracy of estimates through the use of more data sets. Thus, this study was aimed to determine the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia. METHODS This study was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. We searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies. Each of the original studies was assessed using a tool for the risk of bias adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data were pooled and a random effect meta-analysis model was fitted to provide the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke. Also, the subgroup analyses were performed to examine how the in-hospital mortality rate varies across different groups of studies. RESULTS In this study, the overall magnitude of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation among stroke patients were 47% (95%CI: 40-54), 8% (95CI%:6-12), and 10% (95%CI: 5-19), respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality of stroke in Ethiopia was 18% (95%:14-22). The highest magnitude of in-hospital mortality of stroke was observed in SNNPR and the lowest was noted in Tigray region. In addition, the magnitude of the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke was 15.1% (95%CI: 11.3-19.4), and 19.6%(95%CI: 14.1-25.7), among studies published before and after 2016, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our pooled result showed that nearly one-fifth of stroke patients have died during hospitalization. The most common risk factor of stroke among the included studies was hypertension followed by atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. There is a need for a better understanding of the factors associated with high blood pressure, especially in countries with a high risk of stroke.","Alene, Muluneh; Assemie, Moges Agazhe; Yismaw, Leltework; Ketema, Daniel Bekele",BMC neurology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01870-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814556/,338

However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. The aims of this study were to determine whether dexmedetomidine preconditioning (DexP) modulates pulmonary I/R-induced lung injury through the alteration in KGF-2 expression. In our I/R-modeled mice, DexP significantly inhibited pathological injury, inflammatory response, and inflammatory cell infiltration, while promoted endothelial barrier integrity and KGF-2 promoter activity in lung tissues. Bioinformatics prediction and ChIP-seq revealed that I/R significantly diminished the level of H3K4me3 modification in the KGF-2 promoter, which was significantly reversed by DexP. Moreover, DexP inhibited the expression of histone demethylase JMJD3, which in turn promoted the expression of KGF-2. In addition, overexpression of JMJD3 weakened the protective effect of DexP on lung injury in mice with I/R. Collectively, the present results demonstrated that DexP ameliorates endothelial barrier dysfunction via the JMJD3/KGF-2 axis.","Hong, Huisuo; Huang, Qingqing; Cai, Yaoyao; Lin, Tingting; Xia, Fangfang; Jin, Zhousheng",Experimental cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352276/,338

160369,Pulmonary tuberculosis presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2021-01-25,"BACKGROUND In late March 2009, an outbreak of a respiratory illness later proved to be caused by novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was identified in Mexico. We describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of persons hospitalized for pneumonia at the national tertiary hospital for respiratory illnesses in Mexico City who had laboratory-confirmed S-OIV infection, also known as swine flu. METHODS We used retrospective medical chart reviews to collect data on the hospitalized patients. S-OIV infection was confirmed in specimens with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS From March 24 through April 24, 2009, a total of 18 cases of pneumonia and confirmed S-OIV infection were identified among 98 patients hospitalized for acute respiratory illness at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. More than half of the 18 case patients were between 13 and 47 years of age, and only 8 had preexisting medical conditions. For 16 of the 18 patients, this was the first hospitalization for their illness; the other 2 patients were referred from other hospitals. All patients had fever, cough, dyspnea or respiratory distress, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and bilateral patchy pneumonia. Other common findings were an increased creatine kinase level (in 62% of patients) and lymphopenia (in 61%). Twelve patients required mechanical ventilation, and seven died. Within 7 days after contact with the initial case patients, a mild or moderate influenza-like illness developed in 22 health care workers; they were treated with oseltamivir, and none were hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS S-OIV infection can cause severe illness, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death in previously healthy persons who are young to middle-aged. None of the secondary infections among health care workers were severe.","Perez-Padilla, Rogelio; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Ponce de Leon, Samuel; Hernandez, Mauricio; Quiñones-Falconi, Francisco; Bautista, Edgar; Ramirez-Venegas, Alejandra; Rojas-Serrano, Jorge; Ormsby, Christopher E; Corrales, Ariel; Higuera, Anjarath; Mondragon, Edgar; Cordova-Villalobos, Jose Angel",The New England journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa0904252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19564631/,338
160771,Vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccination in Hong Kong.,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVE In Belgium, people with an incurable psychiatric disorder can file a request for euthanasia claiming unbearable psychic suffering. For the request to be accepted, it has to meet stringent legal criteria. One of the requirements is that the patient possesses decision-making capacity. The patient's decision-making capacity is assessed by physicians.The objective of our study is to provide insight in the assessment of decision-making capacity in the context of euthanasia for patients with psychic suffering caused by a psychiatric disorder. METHOD Twenty-two semistructured interviews with psychiatrists and neurologists were analysed with NVivo, a qualitative analysis software to code and organise transcribed data. RESULTS Different views and approaches regarding decision-making capacity in the context of euthanasia emerged from the data.Most of the physicians have some knowledge of the cognitive ability approach on decision-making capacity. According to this approach, four abilities constitute decision-making capacity: communication, understanding, appreciation and reasoning. We observed differences in the way these abilities are valued in relation to competence. Some physicians take additional elements into consideration when assessing decision-making capacity.Physicians acquired their knowledge on the subject in many different ways. Most of the physicians reported that decision-making capacity was not part of their training. CONCLUSION We conclude that physicians assess decision-making capacity in different ways and that personal values and beliefs influence their approach. As such, a common approach in assessing the decision-making capacity of a patient among the interviewed physicians is lacking. Less arbitrariness could be obtained by consistently implementing the cognitive ability approach.","Schweitser, Frank; Stuy, Johan; Distelmans, Wim; Rigo, Adelheid",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-105690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747525/,338

COVID-19 is understood to further worsen the psychosocial problems of patients with diabetes. Aims: We carried out this cross-sectional telephonic survey of COVID-19-related worries in patients with diabetes mellitus to understand the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19-related worries. Settings and Design: This was a telephonic survey of patients seeking care from noncommunicable disease clinic of a tertiary care medical center. Subjects and Methods: We used a structured questionnaire to assess sociodemographic, clinical, psychological variables and COVID-19-related worries. Statistical Analysis Used: We used SPSS 20.0 for descriptive statistics keeping significance levels at 0.05. Between-group comparisons of continuous variables were made with independent t-test and two-way ANOVA;correlations were carried out with Pearson correlation test. Results: Two hundred and nine patients completed the telephonic survey conducted from September to November 2020. The prevalence of diabetes-related worries in our sample was 80%. Younger age (P &lt; 0.001), unemployment (P = 0.029), and the presence of mental disorder (P &lt; 0.001) were associated with higher diabetes-related worries. Poor glycemic control (0.008) and symptoms of COVID-19 (0.03) were associated with diabetes-related worries. Diabetes-related worries correlated with diabetes distress (ρ =0.441, P &lt; 0.001), social isolation (ρ =0.401, P &lt; 0.001), and perception of social support (ρ =-0.158, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: A large proportion of our patients with diabetes are at high risk to experience COVID-19-related worries especially, younger people, unemployed and those with mental illness. Furthermore, the presence of diabetes distress and the perception of social isolation increase COVID-19 worries.","Patra, S.; Acharya, S. P.; Taywade, M.; Bandyopadhyay, D.; Patro, B.

This study was conducted to assess burnout among oncologists and other healthcare professionals at a large academic center. Methods: An electronic 10- minute questionnaire was sent to actively employed physicians, APRNs and PAs at the University of Miami. Survey items evaluated various personal and professional characteristics including COVID related stress. Burnout was examined with Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which evaluated severity across two domains: emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. The logistic regression model was used to estimate association between study variables and high burnout levels. Odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained. Continuous variables were tested using two-sample t-test by high burnout status. Results:The survey was sent to 739 HCWs, out of which 182 (24.6%) completed the entire survey;63.7% were physicians, 8.6% fellows, and 27.4% APRN or PA. The pandemic led to rescheduling of professional activities (22.2%), increased workload (59.5%), job insecurity (28.6%), and decreased leadership opportunities (32.2%). 62.3% of respondents reported decreased exercise;44.8% reported new sleep disorder;56.1% reported increased home responsibilities;childcare arrangements were affected in 60.6%;61.4% struggled to maintain work-life balance. 70 of 182 respondents were broadly from the fields of Oncology and Palliative Care. 9 out of these 70 respondents reported high depersonalization, 27 reported high emotional exhaustion, and 33 reported overall high burnout symptoms on either emotional exhaustion or depersonalization scales. Amongst physicians holding positions from PGY4 through licensed attendings with less than 5 years' experience, 62.5% (95%CI=35.4-84.8) showed high burnout rate (10 of 16), which was not statistically different from older physicians (11 of 27=40.7% (95%CI=22.4-61.2)). No difference in burnout was seen for other study variables including gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has incited not only an unmatched level of practice changes, but also extraordinary psycho-social uncertainty, leading to a considerable impact on HCWs' wellbeing. Long working hours, lack of sleep, fear of losing job, transition to tele-medicine, risk of getting infection and putting their family at risk, lack of childcare, pressure of home schoolingall seem to have caused an increased physical and psychological pressure among HCWs and warrants an examination of potential coping mechanisms. This study sets the stage for more elaborate research to illustrate and guide the development of wellness programs imperative to the well-being of HCWs.","Dawar, R.; Rodriguez, E.; Gawri, K.; Kwon, D.; Penedo, F.

This study aimed to investigate the full extent of the issues (internal and external) caused by the public policies. Regarding the external factors, we examined the state, the local authorities, the financial institutions, the social stakeholders and the citizens. Regarding the internal factors, we focused on turnover, liquidity, working conditions, internal changes related to patient care and the implementation of protective measures. A qualitative research was conducted among twelve rural healthcare business owners in the form of semi-structured interviews. The research was conducted in the fall of 2020 during the second phase of COVID-19. The research showed that these enterprises were severely impacted by the government’s public policies. Local authorities were not involved due to lack of competence. The business owners were unwilling to support their enterprises via bank lending. During the first phase of COVID-19, citizens postponed nonessential medical examinations, causing a reduction in these enterprises’ turnover. As a result, in the following periods, these enterprises faced liquidity problems. However, they developed social objectives and implemented protective measures for their employees and patients. The present study contributes to the mapping of the factors affecting the internal and external environments of rural healthcare enterprises along with the public policies developed in times of prolonged crisis. These kinds of data are crucial to the business world and government officials voting on social policies.

In this study, we propose a spatio-temporal, heterogeneous population model and in silico simulation to evaluate pandemic IPs in four types of buildings - home, office, school, and mall. We show that indeed each building type has a unique pandemic spread and therefore a different optimal IP. Moreover, we show that temporal-based IPs (such as mask wearing) have a similar influence on the pandemic spread in all four building types while spatial-based IPs (such as social distance) highly differ.","Lazebnik, T.; Alexi, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.15.21260564v1?rss=1,338

Firstly, those epidemic attributes that are significantly associated with crowd outflow intensity from the spread center are identified using the geographic detector. Then, considering all pairs of spatial units, a spatial weight matrix is adaptively constructed by measuring the similarity of crowd outflow intensities from the spread center. Finally, each spatial unit is characterized using the local variation gradient of epidemic attribute values, based on which both global and local Moran's I are modified to statistically discriminate the distribution patterns and detect local anomalous regions in flow space. Through performing comparative experiments on the spatio-temporal sequence of COVID-19, it illustrates that the proposed method can effectively detect the spatial anomalies caused by a variety of multiple potential factors. These findings can support the targeted epidemic prevention and control in different stages. © 2021, Surveying and Mapping Press.

Samples with varying levels of porosity were created by laser welding bare or anodized aluminum material in multiple layers. For comparison, two Al 1100 top layer materials, one anodized and one bare, were welded in multiple layer configurations onto a 1.6 mm Al substrate. The samples were characterized by electrical measurements, tensile tests, and X-ray computed tomography imaging. Thermography was performed on the entire sample set, where the heat source distribution was used to analyze raw thermal data corresponding to the weld region-of-interest. A maximum peak histogram value of the thermography data was determined and was found to correlate well with the X-ray CT, electrical resistance, and tensile data. Thermography was observed to be more affected by pores close to the surface as confirmed by the porosity cross sections from the CT data. It was seen however, that in areas of many small pores, the overall thermography values indicated lower heat flow than other areas even if the individual pores could not be resolved. Overall it is shown that thermography correlates well with electrical resistance and tensile results, although more studies are needed to evaluate thicker stack-ups due to the limits placed by thermal diffusion.","Rinker, Teresa J.; McGovern, Megan E.; Brown, Tyson; Wang, Hongliang",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314852; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314852,338
186341,Community psycho-behavioural surveillance and related impact on outbreak control in Hong Kong and Singapore during the SARS epidemic.,2009,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have confirmed neurological involvements, such as acute cerebrovascular disease and impaired consciousness in COVID-19. In the present study, our aim is to investigate the current evidence regarding central nervous system (CNS) complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted in electronic databases including Medline (using PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, in addition to the manual search in Google and Google scholar search engines, for articles published from 2019 until April 21st, 2020. Inclusion criteria was articles that were reviewed and reported the incidence of neurological outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 638 records, from which 7 articles were included. Overall, the incidence of CNS complications was calculated to be 6.27% (95% CI: 3.32 to 9.98). The incidence of the most common CNS complications, encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disease, were 9.14% (95%CI: 2.20 to 19.81) and 2.59% (95% CI: 1.31 to 4.25), respectively. CONCLUSION: CNS complications do exist in COVID-19 patients, encephalopathy being the most concerning one. The heterogeneity in the existing literature causes an uncertainty in reporting the definite prevalence rate for each complication. Thus, further studies are needed for scientists to reach a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of these complications in COVID-19 patients. However, healthcare providers should consider the possibility of CNS involvements in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","MadaniNeishaboori, Arian; Moshrefiaraghi, Donya; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Toloui, Amirmohammad; Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Hosseini, Mostafa",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587989/,338

188189,Public health interventions to control the spread of a directly transmitted human pathogen within and between Hong Kong and Guangzhou.,2012,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged human disease associated with pneumonia. Inapparent infection with SARS coronavirus (CoV) is not well characterized. To develop a safe, simple, and reliable screening method for SARS diagnosis and epidemiological study, two recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid proteins (N' protein and (N)Delta(121) protein) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and used as antigens for indirect, immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Serum samples collected from healthy volunteers and SARS patients in Vietnam were used to evaluate the newly developed methods. The N' protein-based ELISA showed a highly nonspecific reaction. The (N)Delta(121) protein-based ELISA, with a nonspecific reaction drastically reduced compared to that of the nearly-whole-length N' protein-based ELISA, resulted in higher rates of positive reactions, higher titers, and earlier detection than the SARS-CoV-infected cell lysate-based ELISA. These results indicate that our newly developed SARS-CoV (N)Delta(121) protein-based ELISA is not only safe but also a more specific and more sensitive method to diagnose SARS-CoV infection and hence a useful tool for large-scale epidemiological studies. To identify inapparent SARS-CoV infections, serum samples collected from health care workers (HCWs) in Vietnam were screened by the (N)Delta(121) protein-based ELISA, and positive samples were confirmed by a virus neutralization test. Four out of 149 HCWs were identified to have inapparent SARS-CoV infection in Vietnam, indicating that subclinical SARS-CoV infection in Vietnam is rare but does exist.","Yu, Fuxun; Le, Mai Quynh; Inoue, Shingo; Thai, Hong Thi Cam; Hasebe, Futoshi; Del Carmen Parquet, Maria; Morita, Kouichi",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16002634/,338

METHODS Information on local data was collected from the members of the SEBoD International Advisory Board on known epidemiological studies. Additionally, online searches were conducted using Medline and PsycInfo for the period 1994-2004. RESULTS Across the Asia Pacific region, rates of current or 1-month major depression ranged from 1.3% to 5.5%, rates of major depression in the previous year ranged from 1.7% to 6.7%, and lifetime rates ranged from 1.1% to 19.9%, with a median of 3.7%. Rates of suicide in the Asia Pacific region are now similar to those in Europe and the Americas. The exceptions include China and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiological studies in Asian populations are rare and use various diagnostic criteria. However, studies indicate that rates of depression in Asia Pacific, whilst lower, are comparable to other western countries. As such, depression as a health issue in Asia Pacific demands greater recognition. It is important that Asian countries should have the human and financial resources to conduct large scale epidemiological surveys not only in the area of depression, but also in the broader field of mental disorders.","Chiu, Edmond",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15715830/,338

A commercially available armored RNA (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) was evaluated as positive control for the ORF 1b assay. The analytical sensitivity, reproducibility, amplification efficiency, and dynamic range of the assays were similar. Both were specific for SARS-CoV as determined by testing against human CoV 229E and OC43, specimens from patients without SARS, and by BLAST searches of GenBank for primer and probe sequence homology.

In contrast, infection of Brown Norway (BN) inbred rats does not lead to clinical disease. Previous findings indicated that in both rat strains brain-infiltrating leukocytes consisted mainly of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Here, we phenotypically as well as functionally characterised this T cell subset after isolation from the central nervous system (CNS). Using JHMV-infected target cells, MHC class I restricted, cytotoxic T lymphocytes were demonstrated to be present in the leukocyte fraction from the CNS of both, susceptible LEW and disease-resistant BN rats. However, compared to infected, but healthy BN rats, diseased LEW rats generated an enhanced cytotoxic immune response which became most prominent at the maximum of neurological disease. Recently published observations from our laboratory demonstrated a strong virus-specific antibody response in the CNS of BN rats. In LEW rats, however, the response was delayed and of low magnitude. This suggests, that consequences of cytotoxic T lymphocyte action in JHMV-infected CNS tissue largely depend on the efficacy of an accompanying virus-specific humoral immune response.","Hein, A; Schwender, S; Imrich, H; Sopper, S; Czub, M; Dörries, R",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9222376/,338
201226,"Increased Intracranial Pressure in the Setting of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, Associated With COVID-19",2021,"Knowing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of tuberculosis (TB) patients is essential to optimal patient management. TB is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic condition. Patients with both TB and HIV infection are five times more likely to die during anti-TB treatment than patients who are not HIV infected (CDC, unpublished data, 2003). HIV infection is the greatest known risk factor for progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. In the United States, after TB exposure and infection, HIV-infected persons who do not receive appropriate treatment progress to TB disease over 5 years at a rate 10 times greater than that for persons not infected with HIV. In 1989, CDC recommended that all TB patients be offered HIV testing and, in 2006, called for routine HIV screening of all TB patients after the patient is notified that testing will be performed, unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). In addition to enabling optimal patient management, knowing the HIV status (i.e., positive or negative) of TB patients helps public health agencies to identify HIV-infected contacts of TB patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce the progression to TB disease, TB relapse, and death. To assess reported HIV status of TB patients and selected characteristics of TB patients with HIV infection, CDC analyzed data from the U.S. National TB Surveillance System for the period 1993-2005. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 1) reporting of HIV status among TB patients increased from 35% in 1993 to 68% in 2003, 2) HIV status of 31% of TB patients was unknown in 2005, 3) 9% of TB patients were HIV positive in 2005, and 4) groups of TB patients at greater risk for HIV infection included injection-drug users (IDUs), noninjection-drug users (NIDUs), homeless persons, non-Hispanic blacks, correctional-facility inmates, and alcohol abusers. Increased promotion of routine HIV testing and rapid HIV tests might increase acceptability of testing, which would allow health-care providers to know the HIV status of a greater percentage of TB patients and enable them to provide optimal care.",,MMWR.

206773,A Case Report of Neonatal 2019 Coronavirus Disease in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a threat to the mental health of pregnant women. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. METHODS: From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02 ± 3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%). The average SAS, SSRS and risk perception scores of the participants were 42.45 ± 6.98, 44.60 ± 7.00 and 21.60 ± 5.74, respectively. The total effect of maternal social support on anxiety was -2.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.40 ~ -1.44, p < .001), the direct effect was -1.44 (95% CI: -2.74 ~ -0.35, p < .05) and the indirect effect was -1.19 (95% CI: -2.49 ~ -0.51, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The third trimester pregnant women had a high level of social support, a medium level of risk perception to COVID-19 and were susceptible to anxiety. Risk perception played a mediating role between social support and anxiety.","Yue, Chongyu; Liu, Cuiping; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Meng; Wu, Hongjing; Li, Chunrong; Yang, Xiuling",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,338

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 3218 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to a major healthcare system (three hospitals) in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports. Four neuroradiologists evaluated all neuroimaging studies for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19. RESULTS: 14.1% of admitted COVID-19 patients had neuroimaging and this accounted for only 5.5% of the total imaging studies. Acute stroke was the most common finding on neuro-imaging, seen in 92.5% of patients with positive neuro-imaging studies, and present in 1.1% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with acute large ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke had much higher mortality risk adjusted for age, BMI and hypertension compared to those COVID-19 patients without neuroimaging. (Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detection of an acute stroke is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome. Our study also highlights the fact there is limited use of neuroimaging in these patients due to multiple logistical constraints.","Jain, Rajan; Young, Matthew; Dogra, Siddhant; Kennedy, Helena; Nguyen, Vinh; Jones, Simon; Bilaloglu, Seda; Hochman, Katherine; Raz, Eytan; Galetta, Steven; Horwtiz, Leora",J Neurol Sci,,338

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To describe the innovative teaching practices, tools, and resources for remote learning developed by a school of pharmacy with a decentralized experiential program to empower and support preceptors in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. SUMMARY: As the pandemic has continued, there have been significant shifts in pharmacy workflow, staffing, and patient care delivery. Pharmacy students are slowly being reintegrated into these learning environments. Although preceptors are willing and eager to teach, many lack the resources, tools, and support to create remote learning experiences at their facilities. The University of the Pacific Thomas J. Long School of Pharmacy has a decentralized experiential education model in which faculty regional coordinators with clinical practices and diverse expertise are disseminated throughout California. This model allowed us to collaborate and understand preceptor needs from a local level. We created a preceptor COVID-19 guidance document, introduced innovative virtual playbooks to pivot up to 100% remote rotations, and promoted the layered learning model to integrate pharmacy residents into the remote teaching space. Communication and flexibility are key to ensure student and preceptor safety while maintaining high-quality advanced pharmacy practice experiences and preserving patient-student relationships in telehealth. CONCLUSION: Overall, we successfully created innovative solutions and leveraged our decentralized experiential model to meet the teaching and learning demands during an unanticipated crisis. We continue to adapt and plan to assess the effectiveness of the tools by administering surveys of preceptors and pharmacy students.","Law, Elaine; Scott, Marie C; Moon, Yong S K; Lee, Audrey J; Bandy, Veronica T; Haydon, Andrew; Shek, Allen; Kang-Birken, S Lena",Am. j. health system pharm,,338

214893,The COVID-19 outbreak: The issue of face masks,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe asthma management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge and will continue to be, at least in the next few months, as herd immunity is still a mirage. A lot has to be learned about how COVID-19 affects underlying diseases, and severe asthma is no exception. METHODS: Narrative review of papers available until February 2021 in PubMed and Google Scholar, relating severe asthma and COVID-19. Four main research topics were reviewed: SARS-CoV-2 infection: immunology and respiratory pathology; interrelationship of severe asthma endotypes and COVID-19 disease mechanisms; severe asthma epidemiology and COVID-19; and biologics for severe asthma in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 disease mechanisms start with upper respiratory cell infection, and afterwards several immunological facets are activated, contributing to disease severity, namely cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Although infrequent in the COVID-19 course some patients develop a cytokine storm that causes organ damage and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure. Regarding severe asthma endotypes, type2-high might have a protective role both in infection risk and disease course. There is conflicting data regarding the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 among severe asthma patients, with some studies reporting increased risk of infection and disease course, whereas others the other way round. Biologics for severe asthma do not seem to increase the risk of infection and severe COVID-19, although further evidence is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, in the era of COVID-19, major respiratory societies recommend continuing the biologic treatment, preferably in a self-home administration program.","Gaspar-Marques, João; van Zeller, Mafalda; Carreiro-Martins, Pedro; Chaves Loureiro, Cláudia","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,338

For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60-80% of the world's population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19.","Excler, Jean-Louis; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Kim, Jerome H",Curr Opin Immunol,,338

221492,Will the Colombian intensive care units collapse due to the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"During recent crisis, wage subsidies played a major role in sheltering firms and households from economic shocks. During COVID-19, most workers were affected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage subsidies to protected workers' earnings and employment (OECD, 2021). New wage subsidies marked a departure from the structure of traditional income support payments and required reform. This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the structure and incentives of the Irish COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme (CWS) under five designs. We use a nowcasting approach to update 2017 microdata, producing a near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the crisis. Using microsimulation modelling, we assess the impact of different designs on income replacement, work incentives and income inequality. Our findings suggest that pro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low earners more. We find evidence for strong work disincentives under all designs, though flat rate designs perform better. Disincentives are primarily driven by generous unemployment payments and work related costs. The impact of design on income inequality depends on the generosity of payments. Earnings related pro rata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality. The difference in inequality levels falls once benefits, taxes and work related costs are considered. In our discussion, we turn to transaction costs, the rationale for reform and reintegration of CWS. We find some support for the claim that design changes were motivated by political considerations. We suggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sectorial turnover rules could offer enhanced protection to middle-and high-earners and reduce uncertainty, the need for reform, and the risk of politically motivated designs.","Linden, Jules; O'Donoghue, Cathal; Sologon, Denisa M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04198v1.pdf,338

228308,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID 19 Treated with Oral Steroid,2020,"ß-coronavirus (CoVs) alone has been responsible for three major global outbreaks in the 21st century. The current crisis has led to an urgent requirement to develop therapeutics. Even though a number of vaccines are available, alternative strategies targeting essential viral components are required as a backup against the emergence of lethal viral variants. One such target is the main protease (Mpro) that plays an indispensable role in viral replication. The availability of over 270 Mpro X-ray structures in complex with inhibitors provides unique insights into ligand-protein interactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive comparison of all nonredundant ligand-binding sites available for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV Mpro. Extensive adaptive sampling has been used to investigate structural conservation of ligand-binding sites using Markov state models (MSMs) and compare conformational dynamics employing convolutional variational auto-encoder-based deep learning. Our results indicate that not all ligand-binding sites are dynamically conserved despite high sequence and structural conservation across ß-CoV homologs. This highlights the complexity in targeting all three Mpro enzymes with a single pan inhibitor.","Cho, Eunice; Rosa, Margarida; Anjum, Ruhi; Mehmood, Saman; Soban, Mariya; Mujtaba, Moniza; Bux, Khair; Moin, Syed T; Tanweer, Mohammad; Dantu, Sarath; Pandini, Alessandro; Yin, Junqi; Ma, Heng; Ramanathan, Arvind; Islam, Barira; Mey, Antonia S J S; Bhowmik, Debsindhu; Haider, Shozeb",J. chem. inf. model,,338

DESIGN: Multicentre-based cross-sectional study was used. SETTING: Data were collected using face to face interview from patients with epilepsy who attended outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals at northwest Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with epilepsy (n=563) who came to attend outpatient treatment during the study period were included in the study using systematic random sampling technique. OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. RESULTS: The overall magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was 26.5% and 12.6%, respectively. Being woman adjusted OR ((AOR)=1.68, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.23), living alone (AOR=2.4, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.92), divorced/widowed/(AOR=2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.8), family history of suicidal attempt (AOR=2.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.79), depression (AOR=3.18, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.45), anxiety (AOR=2.92, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.09), comorbid medical illness (AOR=2.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.82) and poor social support (AOR=2.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.40) were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Depression (AOR=4.87, 95% CI 2.56 to 9.28) living alone (AOR=2.66, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.41), family history of committed suicide (AOR=2.80, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.39), taking medication for mental illness (AOR=2.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.46), hazardous alcohol use (AOR=2.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.23) were statistically associated with suicidal attempts at a p value <0.05. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was high among people with epilepsy. Being woman, living alone, having depression and anxiety, single, divorced/widowed in marital status, family history of suicidal attempt and poor social support were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Having depression, living alone, family history of suicide attempt, hazardous alcohol use and drug taking for mental illness were statistically associated with suicidal attempt. Based on the findings of this study early screening, detection and management of suicide were recommended in people with epilepsy.","Nigussie, Kabtamu; Tesfaye, Bizuneh; Lemma, Alemu; Kerebih, Habtamu",BMJ Open,,338

Self-collection of capillary blood at home can facilitate the monitoring of patients with chronic disease to support virtual clinics while mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely used biochemical analytes and to develop and pilot a user-friendly home-collection kit to support virtual outpatient clinical services. METHODS: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely requested biochemical analytes, simultaneous samples of venous and capillary blood were collected in EDTA and lithium-heparin plasma separation tubes that were of 4-6 mL and 400-600 µL draw volume, respectively. Venous samples were analysed within 4 h of collection while capillary samples were kept at ambient temperature for three days until centrifugation and analysis. Analyte results that were comparable between the matrices were then piloted in a feasibility study in three outpatient clinical services. RESULTS: HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function tests were considered comparable and piloted in the patient feasibility study. The home-collect kit demonstrated good patient usability. CONCLUSION: Home collection of capillary blood could be a clinically-useful tool to deliver virtual care to patients with chronic disease.","Ansari, Saleem; Abdel-Malek, Mariana; Kenkre, Julia; Choudhury, Sirazum M; Barnes, Sophie; Misra, Shivani; Tan, Tricia; Cegla, Jaimini",Ann Clin Biochem,,338

233834,The spatiotemporal trend of renal involvement in COVID-19: A pooled analysis of 17 134 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted various aspects of daily living and has influenced the life of every individual in a unique way. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality; thus, timely treatment is crucial to prevent poor prognosis. Therefore, an immediate emergency department (ED) visit is required; however, no domestic studies have reported the effect of COVID-19 on ED visits by patients with AMI. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the changes in the pattern of ED visits by patients with AMI by comparing visits during the COVID-19 outbreak period to those during two control periods. METHODS: This nationwide, retrospective study used registry data of the National Emergency Department Information System. The 'outbreak period' was defined as the period between February 21, 2020 and April 1, 2020, while the 'control period' was defined as the same time period in the preceding two years (2018 and 2019). The primary outcome of our study was the number of patients admitted to the ED owing to AMI during the outbreak and control periods. Secondary outcomes were time from symptom onset to ED visit, length of ED stay, and 30-day mortality following admission. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, 401,378 patients visited the ED; this number was lower than that during the control periods (2018: 577,548; 2019: 598,514). The number of patients with AMI visiting the ED was lower during the outbreak period (2,221) than during 2018 (2,437) and 2019 (2,591). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in ED visits by patients with AMI. We assume that this could likely be caused by misinterpretation of AMI symptoms as symptoms of respiratory infection, fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and restrictions in accessing emergency medical care owing to overburdened healthcare facilities. This study sheds light on the fact that healthcare and emergency medical staff members must work towards eliminating hurdles due to this pandemic for patients to receive timely emergency care, which in turn will help curb the growing burden of mortality.","Sung, Ho Kyung; Paik, Jin Hui; Lee, Yu Jin; Kang, Soo",J Korean Med Sci,,338

With the spread of the virus, the global epidemic situation has become extremely serious, especially in the United States, Spain and Italy. Due to a series of control measures, the epidemic situation in Wuhan has been alleviated to a certain extent, and this region has entered into a post-epidemic period. The treatment of some acute and worsened cardiovascular diseases has become more complex because of epidemic prevention measures. Patients and Methods: We examined cardiovascular patients in the emergency department, as well as outpatient clinics and inpatient units in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, from March 20th to April 17th, 2020, as the study subjects, and we performed standard medical activities according to the principles of border treatment and border protection. Additionally, we aimed to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic on the therapy that was administered to cardiology patients. Results: Due to this standard and feasible strategy, the cardiology department admitted a total of 97 patients, with 36 patients being discharged. No patients have been observed to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiology department. In addition, we have no outpatient, caregivers or medical staff infected. Conclusion: Our study aimed to provide prevention and treatment strategies for the rapid and effective medical recovery of patients in non-COVID-19 designated hospitals in high-risk areas after remission, as well as in low- and medium-risk areas.","Fan, Qian; Chen, Xin; Lin, Yan; Wang, Zhiquan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,338

Owing to its crucial role in the invasion of the host cell, spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the major targets in these studies. The S1 subunit of the S protein (S1 protein) accommodates the receptor-binding domain, which enables the initial binding of the virus to the host cell. Being a heavily glycosylated protein, numerous studies have investigated its glycan composition. However, none of the studies have explored the isomeric glycan distribution of this protein. Furthermore, this isomeric glycan distribution has never been compared to that in S1 proteins of other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which were responsible for past epidemics. This study explores the uncharted territory of the isomeric glycan distribution in the coronaviruses' S1 protein using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We believe that our data would facilitate future investigations to study the role of isomeric glycans in coronavirus viral pathogenesis.","Cho, Byeong Gwan; Gautam, Sakshi; Peng, Wenjing; Huang, Yifan; Goli, Mona; Mechref, Yehia",J. proteome res,,338

To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory ""cytokine-storm"", a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1ß, and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.","Mills, Richard J; Humphrey, Sean J; Fortuna, Patrick R J; Lor, Mary; Foster, Simon R; Quaife-Ryan, Gregory A; Johnston, Rebecca L; Dumenil, Troy; Bishop, Cameron; Rudraraju, Rajeev; Rawle, Daniel J; Le, Thuy; Zhao, Wei; Lee, Leo; Mackenzie-Kludas, Charley; Mehdiabadi, Neda R; Halliday, Christopher; Gilham, Dean; Fu, Li; Nicholls, Stephen J; Johansson, Jan; Sweeney, Michael; Wong, Norman C W; Kulikowski, Ewelina; Sokolowski, Kamil A; Tse, Brian W C; Devilée, Lynn; Voges, Holly K; Reynolds, Liam T; Krumeich, Sophie; Mathieson, Ellen; Abu-Bonsrah, Dad; Karavendzas, Kathy; Griffen, Brendan; Titmarsh, Drew; Elliott, David A; McMahon, James; Suhrbier, Andreas; Subbarao, Kanta; Porrello, Enzo R; Smyth, Mark J; Engwerda, Christian R; MacDonald, Kelli P A; Bald, Tobias; James, David E; Hudson, James E",Cell,,338

We know that the elderly and people with chronic diseases contract the infection more easily and they develop clinically more serious and often lethal forms. To date, the reasons for this have been generically attributed to old age and underlying diseases. Most Covid-19 deaths occurred in long-term care facilities because the residents are elderly people with chronic illness living in close contact. Therefore, facilities have become epidemic outbreaks. Forensic knowledge is very limited because an autopsy is rarely performed. Post-mortem investigations can help increase knowledge about Covid-19 and identify any undiagnosed pathologies in life. Therefore, forensic investigations play a role in protecting a frail population.

We have used a sample of 119 galaxies with directly-measured $M_{\rm BH}$ and host spheroid parameters obtained from multi-component decomposition of, primarily, $3.6\,\mu$m Spitzer images. Here, we investigate the correlations between $M_{\rm BH}$ and the projected luminosity density $\mu$, the projected stellar mass density $\Sigma$, and the deprojected (internal) stellar mass density $\rho$, for various spheroid radii.

The future carbon footprint of Bitcoin strongly depends on the decarbonization pathway of the electricity sector. If the electricity sector achieves carbon neutrality by 2050, Bitcoin's carbon footprint has peaked already. However, in the business-as-usual scenario, emissions sum up to 2 gigatons until 2100, an amount comparable to 6% of global emissions in 2018.

247205,Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis,2020,"This paper studies the potential of 3 newly synthesized low molecular weight gelling agents (2 of them with azo groups) with the semicarbazide group as a H-bonding motif to gel the smectic phase of a commercial chiral smectic C material. To detect gelation two methods were used: the stabilization of the director pattern, which measures the interaction of the physical gel network with the LC-director, and the suppression of the onset of electrohydrodynamic instabilities, which measures the increase of viscosity. Special emphasis was put on the influence of the photochemical - isomerization of the gelling agents on gelation.From the stabilization of the director pattern an elastic component can be seen by the memory effect (two different switching times). Photochemical - isomerization destroys this memory effect. The increase of the threshold field for the onset of electrohydrodynamic instabilities in free-standing films measures the increase of viscosity and the supression of flow. Both methods detect the same melting temperature of the gel and the same reduction of the gelling ability upon - isomerization. This proves that the gelling abilities of the new azo-containing gelling agents can be reversibly switched on and off by photoisomerization.","Deindörfer, Pia; Eremin, Alexey; Stannarius, Ralf; Davis, Riju; Zentel, Rudolf",Soft Matter,,338

At the University of California, Davis (UCD), our Pain Division transitioned our internally validated multiple mini-interview (MMI) process to a virtual environment. METHODS: Applicants signed a confidentiality agreement prior to their interviews and were invited to watch a series of videos orienting them to the process and to the program itself. All faculty raters interviewed candidates using a total of 6 non-medical MMI scenarios with corresponding questions and scoring rubrics through the Zoom platform. Applicants were then welcomed to voluntary informal conversations with the current fellow trainees and faculty. An optional survey was sent to the applicants post-interview to assess their overall satisfaction with the virtual process. RESULTS: The survey analyzed the following using a 5 point Likert scale: Overall Satisfaction, Video Overview Program, Interview Day Details, Video Tour, Web-Based Interviews, Process was Fair, and finally a question on Informed Decision regarding receiving sufficient information to formulate their rank list. All respondents (80% response rate) reported being either satisfied or very satisfied with each of the aspects of the interview process detailed above.

However, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 can result in non-mortal complications that affect patient prognosis. To support patient risk stratification, we aimed to develop a prognostic system that predicts complications common to COVID-19. In this retrospective study, we used data collected from 3,352 COVID-19 patient encounters admitted to 18 facilities between April 1 and April 30, 2020, in Abu Dhabi (AD), UAE. The hospitals were split based on geographical proximity to assess for our proposed system's learning generalizability, AD Middle region and AD Western&Eastern regions, A and B, respectively. Using data collected during the first 24 hours of admission, the machine learning-based prognostic system predicts the risk of developing any of seven complications during the hospital stay. The complications include secondary bacterial infection, AKI, ARDS, and elevated biomarkers linked to increased patient severity, including d-dimer, interleukin-6, aminotransferases, and troponin. During training, the system applies an exclusion criteria, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection for each complication-specific model. The system achieves good accuracy across all complications and both regions. In test set A (587 patient encounters), the system achieves 0.91 AUROC for AKI and>0.80 AUROC for most of the other complications. In test set B (225 patient encounters), the respective system achieves 0.90 AUROC for AKI, elevated troponin, and elevated interleukin-6, and>0.80 AUROC for most of the other complications. The best performing models, as selected by our system, were mainly gradient boosting models and logistic regression. Our results show that a data-driven approach using machine learning can predict the risk of such complications with high accuracy.","Ghosheh, Ghadeer O.; Alamad, Bana; Yang, Kai-Wen; Syed, Faisil; Hayat, Nasir; Iqbal, Imran; Kindi, Fatima Al; Junaibi, Sara Al; Safi, Maha Al; Ali, Raghib; Zaher, Walid; Harbi, Mariam Al; Shamout, Farah E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01138v1.pdf,338

263801,Shifting Coronavirus Disease 2019 Testing Policy and Research to Include the Full Translation Pipeline,2021,"SUMMARY: Hospital and health system leaders alike are increasing their efforts to implement an ambulatory care strategy. The move is understandable: Innovative and well-funded competitors are entering their markets, payers are demanding lower-cost options, and patients are seeking affordability and convenience.Healthcare organizations must consider several imperatives when identifying a long-term ambulatory strategy that is both successful and sustainable. The rise of value-based care and emerging market and competitive trends are among the important considerations that call for a strategy that is affordable, responds to consumer expectations, and ensures that care is coordinated and optimal.Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health (LG Health) strategically transformed its ambulatory services over three decades. Early on, the system focused on providing services in and around its urban flagship hospital. Increased competition, new technologies, market growth, and other influences eventually led the system to expand its depth and breadth while aggregating many of its ambulatory services in a single suburban location designed to optimize efficiency, prioritize clinical coordination, and enhance patient and physician satisfaction.The system built on that foundation by creating a network of ambulatory locations featuring four service delivery models. Each features distinct facility sizes, physician types, patient groups, and services. In addition, LG Health continues to build the technological and operational capabilities to deliver telehealth services that have become more established in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The investments made, experiences studied, and lessons learned by LG Health since 1990 and during the uncertain course of the current pandemic continue to guide its ambulatory strategy.","Bergen, Jan L; Wynne, Susan",Front Health Serv Manage,,338
264707,A Case Series of Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019: What Have We Learned?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated catastrophic job loss, unprecedented unemployment rates, and severe economic hardship in renter households. As a result, housing precarity and the risk of eviction increased and worsened during the pandemic, especially among people of color and low-income populations. This paper considers the implications of this eviction crisis for health and health inequity, and the need for eviction prevention policies during the pandemic. Eviction and housing displacement are particularly threatening to individual and public health during a pandemic. Eviction is likely to increase COVID-19 infection rates because it results in overcrowded living environments, doubling up, transiency, limited access to healthcare, and a decreased ability to comply with pandemic mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine, and hygiene practices). Indeed, recent studies suggest that eviction may increase the spread of COVID-19 and that the absence or lifting of eviction moratoria may be associated with an increased rate of COVID-19 infection and death. Eviction is also a driver of health inequity as historic trends, and recent data demonstrate that people of color are more likely to face eviction and associated comorbidities. Black people have had less confidence in their ability to pay rent and are dying at 2.1 times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites. Indigenous Americans and Hispanic/Latinx people face an infection rate almost 3 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Disproportionate rates of both COVID-19 and eviction in communities of color compound negative health effects make eviction prevention a critical intervention to address racial health inequity. In light of the undisputed connection between eviction and health outcomes, eviction prevention, through moratoria and other supportive measures, is a key component of pandemic control strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread and death.","Benfer, Emily A; Vlahov, David; Long, Marissa Y; Walker-Wells, Evan; Pottenger, J L; Gonsalves, Gregg; Keene, Danya E",J Urban Health,,338

Thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100-150], or (150-) groups after taking the unit (×109 /L) away from the report of nadir platelet count. Nadir platelet counts and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Among all patients, 238 (16.1%) patients were deceased and 306 (20.7%) had thrombocytopenia. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia, and had lower nadir platelet counts. The in-hospital mortality was 92.1%, 61.2%, 17.5%, and 4.7% for (0, 50], (50, 100], (100-150], and (150-) groups, respectively. With (150-) as the reference, nadir platelet counts of (100-150], (50, 100], and (0, 50] groups had a relative risk of 3.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36-4.96), 9.99 (95% CI 7.16-13.94), and 13.68 (95% CI 9.89-18.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with COVID-19, and it is associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The lower the platelet count, the higher the mortality becomes.","Yang, Xiaobo; Yang, Qingyu; Wang, Yaxin; Wu, Yongran; Xu, Jiqian; Yu, Yuan; Shang, You",J Thromb Haemost,,338

The preparedness rankings of this index have had little correlation with the actual experiences of COVID-19 in various countries. In explaining this disrepancy, the paper argues that better indicators and more data would not have fixed the problem. Rather, the prevailing paradigm of global health security that informs instruments such as the GHS Index needs to be interrogated. This dominant paradigm narrowly conceptualises global health security in terms of the availability of a technical infrastructure to detect emerging infectious diseases and prevent their contagion, but profoundly undertheorises the broader social and political determinants of public health. The neglect of social and political features is amplified in instruments such as the GHS Index that privilege universalised templates presumed to apply across countries but that prove to be inadequate in assessing how individual societies draw on their unique histories to craft public health responses.","Mahajan, Manjari",International Journal of Law in Context,,338

272794,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to a regional health system in the southeast,2020,"It is important for dental care professionals to reliably assess carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and ventilation rates in their offices in the era of frequent infectious disease pandemics. This study was to evaluate CO2 levels in dental operatories and determine the accuracy of using CO2 levels to assess ventilation rate in dental clinics. Mechanical ventilation rate in air change per hour (ACHVENT) was measured with an air velocity sensor and airflow balancing hood. CO2 levels were measured in these rooms to analyze factors that contributed to CO2 accumulation. Ventilation rates were estimated using natural steady-state CO2 levels during dental treatments and experimental CO2 concentration decays by dry ice or mixing baking soda and vinegar. We compared the differences and assessed the correlations between ACHVENT and ventilation rates estimated by the steady-state CO2 model with low (0.3 L/min, ACHSS30) or high (0.46 L/min, ACHSS46) CO2 generation rates, by CO2 decay constants using dry ice (ACHDI) or baking soda (ACHBV), and by time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2 generated by dry ice (ACHDI63%) or baking soda (ACHBV63%). We found that ACHVENT varied from 3.9 to 35.0 in dental operatories. CO2 accumulation occurred in rooms with low ventilation (ACHVENT &#8804;6) and overcrowding but not in those with higher ventilation. ACHSS30 and ACHSS46 correlated well with ACHVENT (r = 0.83, P = 0.003), but ACHSS30 was more accurate for rooms with low ACHVENT. Ventilation rates could be reliably estimated using CO2 released from dry ice or baking soda. ACHVENT was highly correlated with ACHDI (r = 0.99), ACHBV (r = 0.98), ACHDI63% (r = 0.98), and ACHBV63% (r = 0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between ACHVENT and ACHDI63% or ACHBV63%. We conclude that ventilation rates could be conveniently and accurately assessed by observing the changes in CO2 levels after a simple mixing of household baking soda and vinegar in dental settings.","Huang, Q; Marzouk, T; Cirligeanu, R; Malmstrom, H; Eliav, E; Ren, Y-F",J Dent Res,,338

It is a promising solution for telemonitoring systems that demand intensive data collection, for detection, classification, and prediction of future events, from different locations while maintaining a strict privacy constraint. Due to privacy concerns and critical communication bottlenecks, it can become impractical to send the FL updated models to a centralized server. Thus, this paper studies the potential of hierarchical FL in IoT heterogeneous systems and propose an optimized solution for user assignment and resource allocation on multiple edge nodes. In particular, this work focuses on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based schemes while considering the practical constraints of non-uniformly distributed data across different users. We evaluate the proposed system using two real-world datasets, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art FL solutions. In particular, our numerical results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and its ability to provide 4-6% increase in the classification accuracy, with respect to hierarchical FL schemes that consider distance-based user assignment. Furthermore, the proposed approach could significantly accelerate FL training and reduce communication overhead by providing 75-85% reduction in the communication rounds between edge nodes and the centralized server, for the same model accuracy.","Abdellatif, Alaa Awad; Mhaisen, Naram; Mohamed, Amr; Erbad, Aiman; Guizani, Mohsen; Dawy, Zaher; Nasreddine, Wassim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06548v1.pdf,338

The oral cavity is referred to as a target of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to review oral symptoms specific to COVID-19 patients from the point of view of symptom prevalence and pathogenesis and to speculate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying them. Scientific articles were retrieved by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from 3 February 2020 to 31 December 2020, and they were reviewed by title, abstract, and text for relevance. The literature search indicated that COVID-19 patients frequently present with gustatory dysfunction, xerostomia, and oral mucosal lesions, while their prevalence is likely to vary by country, age, gender, and disease severity. Gustatory dysfunction and xerostomia appear at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection and last relatively long. One of possible pathogenic mechanisms of both symptoms is attributed to the expression of viral cellular entry-relevant receptors in taste cells and salivary glands. Dental professionals who can first become aware of oral symptoms associated with COVID-19 will play a more active role in and make a greater contribution to diagnosis and prevention of COVID-19.","Tsuchiya, Hironori",,,338

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the relationship between initial chest X-rays and initial laboratory tests in symptomatic adults with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 seen at our center between February 29 and March 23, 2020. Among other radiologic findings, we analyzed ground-glass opacities, consolidations, linear opacities, and pleural effusion. We also used a scale of radiologic severity to assess the distribution and extent of these findings. Among initial laboratory findings, we analyzed leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Of 761 symptomatic patients, 639 (84%) required hospitalization and 122 were discharged to their homes. The need for admission increased with increasing scores on the scale of radiologic severity. The extent of initial lung involvement was significantly associated with the laboratory parameters analyzed (p<0.05 for platelets, p<0.01 for lymphocytes, and p<0.001 for the remaining parameters), as well as with the time from the onset of symptoms (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: It can be useful to use a scale of radiologic severity to classify chest X-ray findings in diagnosing patients with COVID-19, because the greater the radiologic severity, the greater the need for hospitalization and the greater the alteration in laboratory parameters.","Nava-Muñoz, Á; Gómez-Peña, S; Fuentes-Ferrer, M E; Cabeza, B; Victoria, A; Bustos, A",Radiologia,,338
278214,Viral Ribonucleic Acid Shedding and Transmission Potential of Asymptomatic and Paucisymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"Maternal stress has debilitating implications for both mother and child, including increased risk for anxiety. The current COVID-19 pandemic escalates these phenomena, thus, urging the need to further explore and validate feasible therapeutic options. Unlike the protracted nature of clinical studies, animal models could offer swift evidence. Prominent candidates for treatment are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the mother, that putatively accommodate maternal functioning, and, thereby, also protect the child. However, SSRIs might have deleterious effects. It is important to assess whether SSRIs and other pharmacotherapies can moderate the transference of anxiety by soothing maternal anxiety and to examine the extent of offspring's exposure to the drugs via lactation. To our knowledge, the possibility that antenatal stress exacerbates lactation-driven exposure to SSRIs has not been tested yet. Thirty ICR-outbred female mice were exposed to stress during gestation and subsequently administered with either the SSRI, escitalopram, or the novel herbal candidate, shan-zha, during lactation. Upon weaning, both dams' and pups' anxiety-like behavior and serum escitalopram levels were assessed. The major findings of the current study show that both agents moderated the antenatal stress-induced transgenerational transference of anxiety by ameliorating dams' anxiety. Interestingly though, pups' exposure to escitalopram via lactation was exacerbated by antenatal stress. The latter finding provides a significant insight into the mechanism of lactation-driven exposure to xenobiotics and calls for a further consideration vis-à-vis the administration of other drugs during breastfeeding.","Burstein, Or; Simon, Noam; Simchon-Tenenbaum, Yaarit; Rehavi, Moshe; Franko, Motty; Shamir, Alon; Doron, Ravid",Transl Psychiatry,,338

However, concern for severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2 transmission during exercise testing has markedly curtailed performance of exercise testing during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: To examine the feasibility to conducting exercise testing with an in-line filter, 2 healthy volunteer subjects each completed 2 incremental exercise tests, one with discrete stages of increasing resistance and one with a continuous ramp. Each subject performed 1 test with an electrostatic filter in-line with the system measuring gas exchange and air flow, and 1 test without the filter in place. Oxygen uptake and minute ventilation were highly consistent when evaluated with and without use of an electrostatic filter with a >99.9% viral efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Deployment of a commercially available in-line electrostatic viral filter during cardiopulmonary exercise testing is feasible and provides consistent data compared with testing without a filter.","Bhat, Rohan R; Schoenike, Mark W; Kowal, Alyssa; White, Casey; Rouvina, Jennifer; Hardin, Charles C; Malhotra, Rajeev; Lewis, Gregory D",J. card. fail,,338

While the world at large is waiting that the released vaccines immunize most citizens, public health experts suggest that, in the meantime, it is only through behavior change that the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled. Importantly, the required behaviors are aimed not only at safeguarding one's own health. Instead, individuals are asked to adapt their behaviors to protect the community at large. This raises the question of which social concerns and moral principles make people willing to do so. We considered in 23 countries (N = 6948) individuals' willingness to engage in prescribed and discretionary behaviors, as well as country-level and individual-level factors that might drive such behavioral intentions. Results from multilevel multiple regressions, with country as the nesting variable, showed that publicized number of infections were not significantly related to individual intentions to comply with the prescribed measures and intentions to engage in discretionary prosocial behaviors. Instead, psychological differences in terms of trust in government, citizens, and in particular toward science predicted individuals' behavioral intentions across countries. The more people endorsed moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority), the more they were inclined to report trust in science, which, in turn, statistically predicted prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions. Results have implications for the type of intervention and public communication strategies that should be most effective to induce the behavioral changes that are needed to control the COVID-19 outbreak.","Pagliaro, Stefano; Sacchi, Simona; Pacilli, Maria Giuseppina; Brambilla, Marco; Lionetti, Francesca; Bettache, Karim; Bianchi, Mauro; Biella, Marco; Bonnot, Virginie; Boza, Mihaela; Butera, Fabrizio; Ceylan-Batur, Suzan; Chong, Kristy; Chopova, Tatiana; Crimston, Charlie R; Álvarez, Belén; Cuadrado, Isabel; Ellemers, Naomi; Formanowicz, Magdalena; Graupmann, Verena; Gkinopoulos, Theofilos; Kyung Jeong, Evelyn Hye; Jasinskaja-Lahti, Inga; Jetten, Jolanda; Muhib Bin, Kabir; Mao, Yanhui; McCoy, Christine; Mehnaz, Farah; Minescu, Anca; Sirlopú, David; Simic, Andrej; Travaglino, Giovanni; Uskul, Ayse K; Zanetti, Cinzia; Zinn, Anna; Zubieta, Elena",PLoS One,,338

New self-care practices are presented. RECENT FINDINGS: Globally, thousands of health care practitioners and staff have been infected; many have died. Research studies reveal that this pandemic has threatened the health of healthcare staff, their families, and communities in many unique ways, such as fear of infecting family (lack of safety at home), moral injury, witnessing the suffering of the ""innocent,"" coping with a problem too big to solve (the enormity problem), and racial trauma. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global population in ways not seen in a century. The unique self-care challenges of COVID-19 while enhancing the symptoms of burnout, i.e., physical, and mental exhaustion, despair, helplessness, and suicidal thinking, need to be addressed directly.

284957,Early Monoclonal Antibody Administration Can Reduce Both Hospitalizations and Mortality in High-Risk Outpatients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Multi-problem families face problems in several domains that are often found to be chronic and intergenerational. Effective mental health care for youth from these families is currently lacking, urging research on new methods. The InConnection approach is an integrated care program to improve resilience in multi-problem families by connecting the professional expertise from multiple disciplines with the informal social network of the youth. Specifically, youth are asked to nominate a youth initiated mentor (YIM) from among the supportive adults in their network. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a mixed-methods study to examine the effectiveness and working mechanisms of the InConnection approach. METHOD/DESIGN: The effectiveness of the InConnection approach is studied in a quasi-experimental questionnaire study using propensity score matching, with N = 300 families with youth aged 10-23 years receiving treatment in either the intervention group (InConnection approach) or the control group (care as usual). The main outcome variables include youth resilience (primary), youth mental health, parental functioning, and the number, duration and types of out-of-home placements. Mediators, moderators, and predictors of effectiveness are examined. Assessments take place at the start of the care program and after three, nine and 15 months. Additionally, semi-structured interviews are conducted with families who have and have not nominated a YIM to understand why some families successfully nominate a YIM, whereas others do not. DISCUSSION: Effective care for youth in multi-problem families is urgently needed. Given its flexibility and accessibility to suit all youth aged 10-23 years from multi-problem families, and its low costs compared to out-of-home placements, the InConnection approach seems an appealing approach to support these families. The current study will provide information on the effectiveness of the InConnection approach. Strengths of this study include its robust design, the ecological validity, and the inclusion of possible mediators, predictors, and moderators of treatment effects.

286289,Response to 'COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults with Kawasaki disease-like cutaneous manifestations',2021,"Elemental sulfur is intensively used to control weeds and rubber leaf diseases. However, the mechanisms contributing to elemental sulfur dissipation and decay (hereafter decay) in rubber agroforestry remains unclear. This study relates hydrological processes such as runoff and soil loss to the changes in soil total sulfur (Stot) and sulfate (S-SO4) in typical hillslope rubber agroforestry intercropped with cocoa in Xishuangbanna. The elemental sulfur decay kinetics were studied at two slopes (top and bottom) and three agrosystems (weed, no-weed and mixed). The results show that soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity was uniformly distributed in the experimental rubber agroforestry settings. Higher soil loss and runoff occurred in the bottom slope than the top slope, and in no-weed agrosystem than the herbaceous agrosystems (weed and mixed). The soil loss was mainly driven by runoff. Moreover, Stot and S-SO4 in runoff water were higher in weed agrosystem than no-weed agrosystems. Soil Stot best fit a two-compartments kinetics model, with lower kinetic rates in elemental sulfur applied treatments than in the no-added elemental sulfur treatments, particularly for the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot dissipation time 50% (DT50) was 10-14 times higher in top slope than bottom slope; but 4 and 20 times higher in mixed and no-weed agrosystems, respectively, compared to the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot and S-SO4 contents negatively correlated with soil microbial respiration (CO2 efflux), indicating an adverse influence of elemental sulfur on soil microbial activity. In short, elemental sulfur decay and its S-SO4 transformation depended on soil moisture, runoff, soil erosion and soil CO2, which are in turn affected by slope and agrosystem. This study not only clarifies the mechanisms of elemental sulfur dissipation and decay for its use as an environmental friendly agrochemical; but it also provides information to understand the contribution of runoff and soil loss on these mechanisms in rubber agroforestry.","Zakari, Sissou; Liu, Wenjie; Wu, Junen; Singh, Ashutosh Kumar; Jiang, Xiaojin; Yang, Bin; Chen, Chunfeng; Zhu, Xiai",J Environ Manage,,338
288950,Coronavirus Disease 2019: Is Everything Lawful to Create an Effective Vaccine?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced health jurisdictions worldwide to significantly restructure and reorganize their medical activities. In response to the rapidly evolving body of evidence, a solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of and adherence to locally drafted and validated guidance to aide medical staff with COVID-19-related clinical decisions. OBJECTIVE: We present a usage analysis of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform as part of an institutional knowledge dissemination strategy of COVID-19-related guidance to all health care workers (HCWs) in a large academic hospital. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of experts drafted local guidance related to COVID-19. In total, 60 documents and 17 external links were made available through the platform. Documents were disseminated using a recently deployed mHealth platform for HCWs. Targeted dissemination of COVID-19-related content began on March 22, 2020. Using a third-party statistics tool, data concerning user activity and content use was anonymously collected. A quantitative analysis of user activity was performed over a 4-month period, separated into 3 periods: 2 months before (Period A), 2 weeks after (Period B), and 6 weeks following (Period C) targeted dissemination. Regional epidemiological data (daily new COVID-19 cases and total COVID-19-related hospitalizations) was extracted from an official registry. RESULTS: During the study period, the platform was downloaded by 1233 new users. Consequently, the total number of users increased from 1766 users before Period A to a total of 2999 users at the end of Period C. We observed 27,046 document views, of which 12,728 (47.1%) were COVID-19-related. The highest increase in activity occurred in Period B, rapidly following targeted dissemination, with 7740 COVID-19-related content views, representing 71.2% of total content views within the abovementioned period and 550 daily views of COVID-19-related documents. Total documents consulted per day increased from 117 (IQR 74-160) to 657 (IQR 481-1051), P<.001. This increase in activity followed the epidemiological curbing of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases, which peaked during Period B. Total active devices doubled from 684 to 1400, daily user activity increased fourfold, and the number of active devices rose from 53 (IQR 40-70) to 210 (IQR 167-297), P<.001. In addition, the number of sessions per day rose from 166 (IQR 110-246) to 704 (IQR 517-1028), P<.001. A persistent but reduced increase in total documents consulted per day (172 [IQR 131-251] versus 117 [IQR 74-160], P<.001) and active devices (71 [IQR 64-89] versus 53 [IQR 40-70]) was observed in Period C compared to Period A, while only 29.8% of the content accessed was COVID-19-related. After targeted dissemination, an immediate increase in activity was observed after push notifications were sent to users. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate time-sensitive medical knowledge seemed to be an effective solution to increase the reach of validated content to a targeted audience.","Windisch, Olivier; Zamberg, Ido; Zanella, Marie-Céline; Gayet-Ageron, Angèle; Blondon, Katherine; Schiffer, Eduardo; Agoritsas, Thomas",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,338

These derivatives were evaluated for their PARP-1 inhibitory activity and cellular inhibitory against BRCA-1 deficient cells (MDA-MB-436) and wild cells (MCF-7) using PARP kit assay and MTT method. The results indicated that compared with other heterocyclic compounds, furan ring-substituted derivatives 14n-14q showed better PARP-1 inhibitory activity. Among this derivatives, compound 14p displayed the strongest inhibitory effects on PARP-1 enzyme (IC50 = 0.023 µM), which was close to that of Olaparib. 14p (IC50 = 43.56 ± 0.69 µM) and 14q (IC50 = 36.69 ± 0.83 µM) displayed good antiproliferation activity on MDA-MB-436 cells and inactivity on MCF-7 cells, indicating that 14p and 14q have high selectivity and targeting. The molecular docking method was used to explore the binding mode of compound 14p and PARP-1, and implied that the formation of hydrogen bond was essential for PARP-1 inhibition activities. This study also showed that in the hydrophobic pocket (AD binding sites), the introduction of strong electronegative groups (furan ring, e.g.) or halogen atoms in the side chain of benzimidazole might improve its inhibitory activity and this strategy could be applied in further research.","Chen, Miaojia; Huang, Honglin; Wu, Kaiyue; Liu, Yunfan; Jiang, Lizhi; Li, Yang; Tang, Guotao; Peng, Junmei; Cao, Xuan",Drug dev. res,,338

Diabetes, Obesity and COVID-19 Disease: An Observational Study of Outcomes Among Hospitalized Patients in Boston, Massachusetts",2020,"BACKGROUND: Influenza epidemics were initially considered to be a suitable model for the COVID-19 epidemic, but there is a lack of data concerning patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), who were supposed to be at risk of severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalised for COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018-2019 influenza outbreak). We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89â530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45â819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: Patients with prior respiratory diseases were globally less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than for influenza but were at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and had a higher mortality rate compared to influenza patients and patients without a history of respiratory illness.Our data suggest that these patients should have priority access to SARS-CoV2 vaccination.","Beltramo, Guillaume; Cottenet, Jonathan; Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Georges, Marjolaine; Piroth, Lionel; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Bonniaud, Philippe; Quantin, Catherine",Eur. respir. j,,338

This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits (i.e., from Qiagen) and a simple heat and detergent method that extracts viral RNA directly off the particle, allowing a sample processing time of 10 min. We furthermore tested our method in transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, showing that our method not only correctly identified all positive samples but also substantially improved detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold value across all viral titers tested was 3.1.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system, using transneuronal and hematogenous mechanisms. Although not every COVID-19 patient will test positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid exam, the appearance of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals the importance of understanding the neurologic manifestations and capacity for neural invasion associated with the pathogen. These aspects are relevant for correct diagnosis and treatment, and for the potential development of vaccines.

For data analysis we used Warp PLS 7.0 (a variance-based structural equation modelling tool). We found that alliance management capability under the mediating effect of artificial intelligence-powered supply chain analytics capability enhances the operational and financial performance of the organization. Moreover, we also observed that the alliance management capability has a significant effect on artificial intelligence-powered supply chain analytics capability under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. The results of our study provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamic capabilities and the relational view of organization. Finally, we noted the limitations of our study and provide numerous research directions that may help answer some of the questions that arise from our study.","Dubey, Rameshwar Bryde David J.; Blome, Constantin Roubaud David Giannakis Mihalis",Industrial Marketing Management,,338

311968,COVID-19 and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: how vulnerable are the kidneys?,2021,"Lung ultrasound (US) imaging has the potential to be an effective point-of-care test for detection of COVID-19, due to its ease of operation with minimal personal protection equipment along with easy disinfection. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for detection of COVID-19 are heavy models that may not be easy to deploy in commonly utilized mobile platforms in point-of-care testing. In this work, we develop a lightweight mobile friendly efficient deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 using lung US images. Three different classes including COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy were included in this task. The developed network, named as Mini-COVIDNet, was bench-marked with other lightweight neural network models along with state-of-the-art heavy model. It was shown that the proposed network can achieve the highest accuracy of 83.2% and requires a training time of only 24 min. The proposed Mini-COVIDNet has 4.39 times less number of parameters in the network compared to its next best performing network and requires a memory of only 51.29 MB, making the point-of-care detection of COVID-19 using lung US imaging plausible on a mobile platform. Deployment of these lightweight networks on embedded platforms shows that the proposed Mini-COVIDNet is highly versatile and provides optimal performance in terms of being accurate as well as having latency in the same order as other lightweight networks.

A Case Report,2021,"To estimate the size of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the early stage in Italy, this paper introduces the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate (WR) to evaluate an epidemic curve. On the basis of an exponential decay model (EDM), we provide estimations of the WR in four-time intervals from February 27 to April 07, 2020. By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17th of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130,033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.","Bartolomeo, Nicola; Trerotoli, Paolo; Serio, Gabriella",,,338

We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 16,103 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 15,807 patients at Stanford facilities between March 2 and April 11, 2020. We analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between March 2nd and April 11th 2020. RESULTS: We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems. CONCLUSION: Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.","Kashyap, Sehj; Gombar, Saurabh; Yadlowsky, Steve; Callahan, Alison; Fries, Jason; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Shah, Nigam H",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,338

Thus, this work aimed to study postpartum women's mental health in Argentina during mandatory social isolation. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to July 2020, which included five validated questionnaires to assess postpartum depression (Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), memory complaints (Memory Complaint Scale), metacognition (Brief Metamemory and Metaconcentration Scale), and breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form). Sociodemographic variables, social isolation characteristics, and breastfeeding practices were also collected. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis included zero-order correlations, multiple logistic regressions, and a set of structural equation models (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects. Goodness-of-fit indices were calculated for SEM. SETTING: Postpartum women were recruited from public hospitals, private health clinics, and online community recruitment in the Cordoba province (Argentina). PARTICIPANTS: 305 postpartum women from Argentina. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: 37% of women reported postpartum depression, 46% insomnia, 42% memory impairment, 60% low metaconcentration, 50% low metamemory, and 23% low breastfeeding efficacy. Also, significant associations were found demonstrating that social isolation promoted postpartum depression and insomnia were reciprocally related, which compromised female cognition and efficacy. This situation was aggravated in women during late postpartum, with previous children, and by low social support (e.g., family, health professionals), with non-exclusive breastfeeding being increased. KEY CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study addressing postpartum women's mental status during social isolation in Argentina, which was a promoting factor for postpartum depression and insomnia that were reciprocally related. This situation was also aggravated by reproductive factors, such as late postpartum, multiparity, breastfeeding frequency, and non-exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, breastfeeding self-efficacy depended on mental health status, and euthymia therefore favoured the practice of exclusive breastfeeding.","Miranda, Agustín Ramiro; Scotta, Ana Veronica; Cortez, Mariela Valentina; Soria, Elio Andrés",Midwifery,,338

Determining such immunity may enhance knowledge about susceptibility of HCWs to COVID-19, frequency of vaccine administration, and degree of workplace risk, and may also support enactment of better workplace policies and procedures. The present study reports on 6-months follow-up serosurveillance to determine the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Sub-sample (n=35) of the original serosurveillance in HCWs (n = 3,458) with baseline, 8-week, and 6-month blood sampling were analyzed. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Of 35 subjects, 13 were seropositive at baseline and maintained positivity at 8-week follow-up, with 3 losing positivity at 6-month follow-up. Among 22 subjects who were seronegative at baseline and seropositive at 8-week follow-up, all but one maintained positivity at 6-month follow-up. There was no significant effect of all factors (e.g., age, gender, job duties) examined at the .05 level on seropositivity at 6-month follow-up.

The longest duration of seropositivity observed in this cohort was 7.9 months (236 days). With reported COVID-19-related symptoms up to 4.7 months prior to baseline blood sampling, possibly longer antibody presence is suggested. Similarly, seropositivity at 6-month follow-up further suggests greater antibody longevity than observed in this study.","Brant-Zawadzki, Michael; Fridman, Deborah; Robinson, Philip A.; German, Randy; Shapiro, Arell; Breit, Marcus; Wilton, Stacy; Burke, Elmira; Bock, Jason; Hara, Junko",,,338

Both the abuse potential in mothers with ELM and in mothers with a history of mental disorders might be associated with a disturbed mother-child interaction. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined differences in emotional availability between mothers with a history of ELM and previous or current mental disorders (non-resilient), mothers with ELM without mental disorders (resilient), and control mothers without ELM and without mental disorders. METHODS: Thirty-three non-resilient mothers, 18 resilient mothers, and 37 control mothers and their 5- to 12-year-old children participated in a standardized mother-child interaction task. Videotaped interactions were rated by three independent, trained raters based on the Emotional Availability Scales (EA Scales) and compared between the groups. RESULTS: The non-resilient mothers and their children showed reduced maternal sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, non-hostility, responsiveness, and involvement compared to the resilient mothers and their children and the control mothers and their children (p = 0.006, Î·p2 = 0.12). No differences on any of the EA Scales were found between resilient mothers and control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits in mother-child interaction in non-resilient mothers might contribute to mechanisms that could explain the cycle of abuse. Interestingly, resilient mothers, who did not develop a mental disorder despite having experienced ELM, did not show these deficits. Thus, prevention programs promoting resilience might be a key to break the cycle of abuse.","Mielke, Emilia Louisa; Neukel, Corinne; Fuchs, Anna; Hillmann, Karen; Zietlow, Anna-Lena; Bertsch, Katja; Reck, Corinna; Möhler, Eva; Herpertz, Sabine C",Psychopathology,,338
328514,Imaging Findings in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19,2020,"It is an urgent priority for advanced materials researchers to help find solutions to eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is majorly through touching the contaminated surfaces and then the vulnerable mouth and eyes besides the direct contact with the infected person. This lesson inspired us to propose a strategy from the view of materials scientists on designing effective antiviral surfaces to prevent the transmission of infectious coronaviruses by disrupting their survival on various surfaces. In this perspective, based on current progress in antiviral and antibacterial coatings, we put forward some general principles for designing effective antiviral surfaces by applying natural viral inhibitors, physical/chemical modifications, and bioinspired patterns, with the mechanisms of direct disinfection, indirect disinfection, and receptor inactivation. This work maps possible solutions to inactivate the receptors of the coronavirus spikes and resist the transmission of the COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and contribute to the prevention of future outbreaks and control of epidemics.","Sun, Ziqi; Ostrikov, Kostya",Sustain.

However, in the more industrialized countries, physical activity rates are declining, and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic may amplify this scenario. Thus, this study aimed to report the Italian population's physical activity profile living in the North-western regions during the national lockdown. Methods: Physical activity was assessed using the official Italian short form of IPAQ, intended for Social Networking Services (SNS). Participation was voluntary, and people could fill the questionnaire simply by clicking on a specific link. Results: The final sample size was 612 Italians, male and female, equally distributed (49.1% male and 50.9% female). Data showed a percentage of 15.4% of inactive subjects (MET < 700), 61.8% of moderate-active (MET 700-2500), and 22.9% of active people (MET > 2500). Women were more inactive than men (p < 0.01; 57.4% vs 42.6%). Furthermore, participants were classified into four classes of age: 18-29; 30-44; 45-59; and 60-79. Class 18-29 was prevalent (p < 0.01, 68.3%) and showed higher levels of physical activity (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Italians living in North-western regions maintained a moderate amount of physical activity during the quarantine. This behavior should be encouraged, particularly among women that usually appear to be less active than men.","Abate Daga, Federico; Agostino, Samuel; Peretti, Serenella; Beratto, Luca",Sport Sci Health,,338

339634,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nosocomial Clostridioides difficile infection,2020,"PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the COVID-19 infection rate and determine the factors that affect hospitalization and prognosis in patients receiving systemic chemotherapy (CT), immunotherapy (IT) and molecular-targeted therapies at our hospital within three months after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients who received systemic treatment at chemotherapy unit with diagnosis of cancer between 11 March 2020 and 11 June 2020 were included. The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, the systemic treatments that they received (CT, IT, targeted therapies), and the stage of disease were determined. For the parameters that affect the hospitalization of COVID-19 infected patients were also determined. RESULTS: Among 1149 patients with cancer, 84 of them were infected with COVID-19, and the median age of infected patients was 61.0 (IQR: 21-84) and 60.7% of them were male. As a subtype of cancers lung cancer was more frequent in the patients who infected with COVID compared with non-infected ones and the difference was statistically significant when the underlying malignities were compared (32.1% vs 19.0%, p = 0.031). The hospitalization rate and receiving COVID-19 treatment were more frequent in metastatic patients who were receiving palliative therapy, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.03). In our study, infection rate was similar among patients treated with CT, IT and CT plus targeted therapy; however, fewer COVID-19 infections were seen at patients who received only targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients and tends to be more severe in metastatic cancer patients receiving anticancer treatment, and the continuation of palliative cancer treatments in these patients may cause increased cancer and infection-related morbidity and mortality.","Ayhan, Murat; Laçin, Sahin; Özyükseler, Deniz T; Sürmeli, Heves; Dogan, Akif; Turan, Merve; Odabas, Hatice; Turan, Nedim; Yildirim, Mahmut Emre",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,338

Fake news have been spreading about the ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) pandemic. Since January 2020, the culprits and antidotes to disinformation have been digital and social media.Aims: Our study aimed to develop and test the psychometric properties of the SMDS-12 measurement scale which assesses the consumption, confidence, and sharing of information related to COVID-19 by social media users.Methods:A total of 874 subjects recruited over two exploratory (Mean age = 28.39, SD = 9.32) and confirmatory (Mean age = 32.84, SD = 12.72)periods, completed thesocial media disinformation scale (SMDS-12),the Internet addiction test (IAT), the COVID-19 fear scale, and the perceived stress questionnaire.The 12-item scale (SMDS-12 ) was initially tested by exploratory factor analysis and subsequently by confirmatory factor analysis..Results: The test supported the three-dimensional structure, in addition, no items were removed from the measurement scale, with three factors explaining up to 73.72% of the total variance, and with items having a lambda factor loading ranging from 0.73 to 0.85. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the robustness of the measure by referring to a wide range of goodness-of-fit indices that met the recommended standards. The construct validity of the scale has been proved by its convergent and discriminant validity.The reliability of the instrument examined by means of three internal consistency indices and the corrected item-total correlation demonstrated that the three dimensions of the instrument are reliable: Cronbach's &#945; indices have values of 0.89, 0.88 and 0.88 for the Consumption, Confidence, and Sharing subscales, respectively.The corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.70 to 0.78.The correlation between the instrument's dimensions with the internet addiction scale and mental health factors showed positive associations. Conclusion:The scale is eligible for measuring the credibility of disinformation and can be adapted to measure the credibility of social media disinformation in other contexts.","Guelmami, Noomen; Ben Khalifa, Maher; Chalghaf, Nasr; Kong, Jude Dzevela; Amayra, Tannoubi; Wu, Jianhong; Azaiez, Fairouz; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",,,338

341552,Balancing Scientific Rigor With Urgency in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with unaffected individuals, patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have higher risk of hypertension, and diabetes combined with hypertension can lead to server cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a simple nomogram model to identify the determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM and to quickly calculate the probability of hypertension in individuals with T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 643,439 subjects participating in the national physical examination has been recruited in this cross-sectional study. After excluding unqualified subjects, 30,507 adults with T2DM were included in the final analysis. 21,355 and 9,152 subjects were randomly assigned to the model developing group and validation group, respectively, with a ratio of 7:3. The potential risk factors used in this study to assess hypertension in patients with T2DM included questionnaire investigation and physical measurement variables. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models to optimize feature selection, and the multivariable logistic regression analysis was for predicting model. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve. RESULTS: The results showed that the major determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM were age, gender, drinking, exercise, smoking, obesity and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The area under ROC curve of developing group and validation group are both 0.814, indicating that the prediction model owns high disease recognition ability. The p values of the two calibration curves are 0.625 and 0.445, suggesting that the nomogram gives good calibration. CONCLUSION: The individualized nomogram model can facilitate improved screening and early identification of patients with hypertension in T2DM. This procedure will be useful in developing regions with high epidemiological risk and poor socioeconomic status just like Urumqi, in Northern China.","Xue, Mingyue; Liu, Li; Wang, Shuxia; Su, Yinxia; Lv, Kun; Zhang, Mingchen; Yao, Hua",PLoS One,,338

349357,Coronavirus Disease 2019: Is Everything Lawful to Create an Effective Vaccine?,2020,"CONTEXT: During the COVID-19 pandemic, community-based research studies experienced prolonged shutdowns unless able to pivot to remote study procedures. OBJECTIVES: To describe the revision of two National Institutes of Health funded community-based palliative-focused clinical trials serving underserved populations to accommodate remote subject enrollment and examine its impact. METHODS: Transitioning to remote processes required multiple protocol and procedural changes including: altering informed consent processes; reducing the number of surveys administered; adding internet access as an inclusion criterion. To understand technological challenges, a screening tool was developed for one study to identify potentially eligible subjects' technology abilities and accessibility. RESULTS: Subjects' limited access to the internet and internet-enabled devices and discomfort with technology led to changes in recruitment patterns. Lack of familiarity with technology increased the amount of time it took research team members and subjects to connect remotely. Patients with significant cognitive and/or sensory deficits were at higher risk of experiencing fatigue during remote study visits leading to streamlining of data collection. A researcher-developed technology screening tool found that potential subjects were not comfortable with videoconferencing through Zoom expressing a preference for phone visits. Reduced travel time made scheduling remote study visits more efficient. CONCLUSION: Future community- and home-based palliative care trials must consider the best way to utilize remote recruitment, enrollment, and data collection processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Researchers should consider technology accessibility and train staff to ensure the greatest possible opportunity to recruit underserved populations who have traditionally been underrepresented in research studies.","Brody, Abraham A; Convery, Kimberly A; Kline, Danielle M; Fink, Regina M; Fischer, Stacy M",J. pain symptom manage,,338

While originally considered to be a rather homogeneous cell type, recent attention to neutrophils has uncovered their fascinating transcriptional and functional diversity as well as their developmental trajectories. These new findings are important to better understand the many facets of neutrophil involvement not only in COVID-19 but also many other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, both communicable and non-communicable. Here, we highlight the observed immune deviation of neutrophils in COVID-19 and summarize several promising therapeutic attempts to precisely target neutrophils and their reactivity in patients with COVID-19.","Reusch, Nico; De Domenico, Elena; Bonaguro, Lorenzo; Schulte-Schrepping, Jonas; Baßler, Kevin; Schultze, Joachim L; Aschenbrenner, Anna C",Front Immunol,,338

Multicellular eukaryotes have therefore evolved a range of extrinsic and cell-autonomous mechanisms for restraining proliferation of aneuploid cells, including activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, accumulating evidence indicates that a subset of aneuploid cells can escape p53-mediated growth restriction and continue proliferating in vitro. Here we show that such aneuploid cell lines display a robust modal karyotype and low frequency of chromosomal aberrations despite ongoing chromosome instability. Indeed, while these aneuploid cells are able to survive for extended periods in vitro, their chromosomally unstable progeny remain subject to p53-induced senescence and growth restriction, leading to subsequent elimination from the aneuploid pool. This mechanism helps maintain low levels of heterogeneity in aneuploid populations and may prevent detrimental evolutionary processes such as cancer progression and development of drug resistance.","Giam, Maybelline; Wong, Cheng Kit; Low, Jun Siong; Sinelli, Matteo; Dreesen, Oliver; Rancati, Giulia",Cell Cycle,,338

353154,Sinus bradycardia in a toddler with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Characteristics of COVID-19 patients have mainly been reported within confirmed COVID-19 cohorts. By analyzing patients with respiratory infections in the emergency department during the first pandemic wave, we aim to assess differences in the characteristics of COVID-19 vs. Non-COVID-19 patients. This is particularly important regarding the second COVID-19 wave and the approaching influenza season. METHODS: We prospectively included 219 patients with suspected COVID-19 who received radiological imaging and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as RT-PCR results were used for subgroup analysis. Imaging data were reassessed using the following scoring system: 0 - not typical, 1 - possible, 2 - highly suspicious for COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 72 (32,9%) patients. In three of them (4,2%) the initial RT-PCR was negative while initial CT scan revealed pneumonic findings. 111 (50,7%) patients, 61 of them (55,0%) COVID-19 positive, had evidence of pneumonia. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed higher body temperature (37,7 ± 0,1 vs. 37,1 ± 0,1 °C; p = 0.0001) and LDH values (386,3 ± 27,1 vs. 310,4 ± 17,5 U/l; p = 0.012) as well as lower leukocytes (7,6 ± 0,5 vs. 10,1 ± 0,6G/l; p = 0.0003) than patients with other pneumonia. Among abnormal CT findings in COVID-19 patients, 57 (93,4%) were evaluated as highly suspicious or possible for COVID-19. In patients with negative RT-PCR and pneumonia, another third was evaluated as highly suspicious or possible for COVID-19 (14 out of 50; 28,0%). The sensitivity in the detection of patients requiring isolation was higher with initial chest CT than with initial RT-PCR (90,4% vs. 79,5%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients show typical clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters which enable a sensitive detection of patients who demand isolation measures due to COVID-19.","Fink, Nicola; Rueckel, Johannes; Kaestle, Sophia; Schwarze, Vincent; Gresser, Eva; Hoppe, Boj; Rudolph, Jan; Goller, Sophia; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Ricke, Jens; Sabel, Bastian O",BMC Infect Dis,,338

Epidemiologic studies are warranted to improve the disease understanding, evaluate the care procedure and prepare for futures waves. The aim of the study was to describe epidemiologic characteristics associated with hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This real-world, observational, multicenter and retrospective study screened all consecutive patients admitted to 8 Spanish private hospitals. Inclusion criteria: hospitalized adults (age&#8805;18 years old) with clinically and radiologically findings compatible with COVID-19 disease from March 1st to April 5th, 2020. Exclusion criteria: patients presenting negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 7 days from hospital admission, transfer to a hospital not belonging to the HM consortium, lack of data and discharge against medical advice in emergency departments. RESULTS: One thousand and three hundred thirty-one COVID-19 patients (medium age 66.9 years old; males n= 841, medium length of hospital stayed 8 days, non-survivors n=233) were analyzed. One hundred and fifteen were admitted to intensive care unit (medium length of stay 16 days, invasive mechanical ventilation n= 95, septic shock n= 37 and renal replacement therapy n= 17). Age, male gender, leukocytes, platelets, oxygen saturation, chronic therapy with steroids and treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin were independent factors associated with mortality. The proportion of patients that survive and received tocilizumab and steroids were lesser and higher respectively than those that die, but their association was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Overall crude mortality rate was 17.5%, rising up to 36.5% in the subgroup of patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit. Seven factors impact in hospital mortality.

The threat of this surge is likely to persist until herd immunity is acquired either by natural infection or through vaccination. However, given the time frame needed for herd immunity to occur and the low probability that a vaccine will be available on a global scale by the coming fall and winter seasons, contingency preparedness plans should be established and put in place for the coming days or months. These plans should help mitigate new peaks of the pandemic while relaxing the social isolation rules, patient, public health, and hospital levels.In this article, we go about recommendations that practicing physicians and public health agencies should provide to individuals, especially those at risk of infection, to take and implement pre-emptive measures in anticipation of the potential next peak of the pandemic.","Moghnieh, Rima; Abdallah, Dania; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,338

Active Monitoring of a Healthcare Worker Cohort During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Webinars have recently replaced in-person medical conferences, including paediatric cardiology conferences, given the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference. Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7). RESULTS: We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually. CONCLUSIONS: While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia.","Duane, Brett; Lyne, Alexandra; Faulkner, Theresa; Windram, Jonathan D; Redington, Andrew N; Saget, Sophie; Tretter, Justin T; McMahon, Colin J",Cardiol Young,,338

We present a 2.9-Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complex between the ACE2 receptor and N501Y spike protein ectodomains that shows Y501 inserted into a cavity at the binding interface near Y41 of ACE2. This additional interaction provides a structural explanation for the increased ACE2 affinity of the N501Y mutant, and likely contributes to its increased infectivity. However, this mutation does not result in large structural changes, enabling important neutralization epitopes to be retained in the spike receptor binding domain. We confirmed this through biophysical assays and by determining cryo-EM structures of spike protein ectodomains bound to 2 representative potent neutralizing antibody fragments.","Zhu, Xing; Mannar, Dhiraj; Srivastava, Shanti S; Berezuk, Alison M; Demers, Jean-Philippe; Saville, James W; Leopold, Karoline; Li, Wei; Dimitrov, Dimiter S; Tuttle, Katharine S; Zhou, Steven; Chittori, Sagar; Subramaniam, Sriram",PLoS Biol,,338

METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial involving releases of wMel-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes for the control of dengue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We randomly assigned 12 geographic clusters to receive deployments of wMel-infected A. aegypti (intervention clusters) and 12 clusters to receive no deployments (control clusters). All clusters practiced local mosquito-control measures as usual. A test-negative design was used to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Patients with acute undifferentiated fever who presented to local primary care clinics and were 3 to 45 years of age were recruited. Laboratory testing was used to identify participants who had virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) and those who were test-negative controls. The primary end point was symptomatic VCD of any severity caused by any dengue virus serotype. RESULTS: After successful introgression of wMel into the intervention clusters, 8144 participants were enrolled; 3721 lived in intervention clusters, and 4423 lived in control clusters. In the intention-to-treat analysis, VCD occurred in 67 of 2905 participants (2.3%) in the intervention clusters and in 318 of 3401 (9.4%) in the control clusters (aggregate odds ratio for VCD, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.35; P = 0.004). The protective efficacy of the intervention was 77.1% (95% CI, 65.3 to 84.9) and was similar against the four dengue virus serotypes. The incidence of hospitalization for VCD was lower among participants who lived in intervention clusters (13 of 2905 participants [0.4%]) than among those who lived in control clusters (102 of 3401 [3.0%]) (protective efficacy, 86.2%; 95% CI, 66.2 to 94.3). CONCLUSIONS: Introgression of wMel into A. aegypti populations was effective in reducing the incidence of symptomatic dengue and resulted in fewer hospitalizations for dengue among the participants.

Methods: Our study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19, with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol, and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoint, the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, was similar between groups (all p > 0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest computed tomography (CT) at days 7 or 14 (all p > 0.05). At day 7, 8 (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group, and 2 (11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical (p = 0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group.

Since COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system and to a lesser degree the cardiovascular system, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of COVID-19-caused detraining on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of recently recovered volleyball athletes. Sixteen experienced volleyball athletes (age 24 +/- 4.5 years) who were recently diagnosed and recovered from a COVID-19 infection volunteered to participate in this study and were tested for CRF and spirometry. Given that participants had only mild symptoms of infection, the primary focus of this study was on the effects of detraining on CRF. On average, the time to exhaustion was 9.4 +/- 1.4 min. VE, VCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, RER and oxygen pulse increased, heart rate exceeded 90% of predicted values, and peak VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values were typical for this level of athlete (44.1 +/- 3.4 mL/kg). Pulmonary function reflected in FVC, FEV1/FVC and MVV values were well above 80% of predicted values for each of the participants while electrocardiography revealed no ischemia, arrythmias or conduction and repolarization abnormalities were found in the tested subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that participants experienced typical consequences of detraining. Due to a lack of CRF data prior to COVID-19 infection, we were unable to estimate the magnitude detraining had on CRF. Complete CRF assessment after COVID-19 infection in athletes can be useful for screening of residual myocardial and/or respiratory system damage for safe return-to-play decisions.","Milovancev, A.; Avakumovic, J.; Lakicevic, N.; Stajer, V.; Korovljev, D.; Todorovic, N.; Bianco, A.; Maksimovic, N.; Ostojic, S.; Drid, P.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,338

To avoid stigma, a firm with high-quality legacy assets either withdraws from subsequent financing after receiving a bailout or refuses a bailout altogether to send a favorable signal. The former leads to a short-lived stimulation with subsequent market freeze even worse than if there were no bailout. The latter revives the funding market, albeit with delay, to the level achievable without any stigma. Strikingly, a bailout offer is most effective when many firms reject it (to build a favorable reputation) rather than accept it.","Che, Yeon-Koo; Choe, Chongwoo; Rhee, Keeyoung",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05640v1.pdf,338

Patients and Methods: We reviewed clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data for all patients that underwent surgery within the neurosurgery department from March 26th to April 22nd 2020. We collected demographic information, comorbidities, pre-operative COVID-19 test result, whether COVID-19 respiratory or other symptoms were developed during hospitalization, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and result of post-operative COVID-19 test. Results: Using a combination of both preoperative outpatient COVID-19 drive-through and inpatient testing to obtain surgical clearance with selected telemedicine evaluations, 103 non-elective neurosurgical procedures were performed on 102 patients. No patients tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 testing obtained 48h prior to surgery. None of the patients developed any COVID-19 symptoms during their hospitalization or were re-admitted to our ED postoperatively for COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: We describe a multi-faceted preoperative triage protocol for safely performing non-elective neurosurgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could help other neurosurgical departments and hospitals minimize coronavirus exposure for patients and healthcare workers. We believe this triage strategy could be implemented at other centers to gradually restart a process towards elective surgeries in a safe way.","De Biase, Gaetano; Freeman, William; Elder, Benjamin; Nottmeier, Eric; Smith, Nathan; Jerreld, Daniel; O039,; Connor, Devon; Abel, Martin; Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo; Abode-Iyamah, Kingsley",,,338

We obtained patient data during this period and a corresponding control period prior to the pandemic. The data was focussed on the volume of operating theatre cases, outpatient consultations, procedural clinic appointments and the estimated avoided outpatient travel. RESULTS: Total urology admissions decreased by 27% during the 21-day NHRFA level 2 period. However, acute surgical procedures increased by 30% whereas elective surgical procedures decreased by 32%. Outpatient consultations overall decreased by 32% during NHRFA level 2 despite virtual phone consultations increasing by 274%. Procedural clinic appointments decreased by 85%. The virtual platform also saved each patient an estimated 22.7km of average travel. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate the effects of restrictions in response to a crisis and set a precedent for future management in such scenarios.

RESULTS: 148 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Scohy, Anaïs; Anantharajah, Ahalieyah; Bodéus, Monique; Kabamba-Mukadi, Benoît; Verroken, Alexia; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector",J Clin Virol,,338

This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; pp = 0.024),.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, the mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas the eosinophil count and platelet distribution width levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among influenza patients. In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the platelet count and platelet indices are easily accessible, inexpensive, and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter.","Ozcelik, Neslihan; Ozyurt, Songul; Yilmaz Kara, Bilge; Gumus, Aziz; Sahin, Unal",J. med. virol,,338

Researchers have been working urgently and collaboratively to develop vaccines against the causative agent of COVID-19. The use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform offers new opportunities for the development of effective vaccines. The first use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for individuals outside the clinical trials raised concerns over their safety and future efficacy. In social media, particularly in developing countries, widely shared false claims allege that the current mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines potentially integrate into the host genome and thus may genetically modify humans. These vaccines are also assumed to lack efficacy due to the emergence of new strains. Such misinformation cause people to hesitate about receiving vaccination against COVID-19. This commentary aimed to outline the structure, mechanism of action and the major motive for the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with a focus on scientifically addressing challenges associated with conspiracy theories and dispelling misinformation around vaccination.","Hajissa, Khalid; Mussa, Ali",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,338

372993,Hiv patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a tertiary care center in mexico city,2020,"The prevalence of people infected with COVID-19 in Aarhus on 7 August can be calculated using the dark figure of seroprevalence studies and a conservative estimate of the 12-day contagiousness. This conservative estimate is based on the fact that the transmission of the disease may already begin in the Pressentomatic period, 23 days before symptoms, and even in asymptomatic patients, and is at maximum during symptomatic disease, but is unlikely after 710 days of symptoms. These numbers correspond to a prevalence ratio of 2.8%. A recent study has estimated that most individuals are infectious for about five weeks only, which is the number of infected individuals can be 4,080, producing a prevalence ratio of 1, 2%. Therefore, the risk of satisfying an individual who can transmit Sars Cov2 is in the range of one in 3686 people. These numbers and risks can be more relevant to consider when choosing to visit a disco, a football celebration or even a supermarket. This can be extended to the micro leadership, as well as macroLevel. The previous considerations are based on the presumption that the cases of accidents represent the background population and not a border subgroup. The current outbreak in the municipality of Aarhus, in Denmark, is considered limited to the access points that surround the Omnibus operations of the municipalities in an introductory course for economic students, a group of minorities and Somali participants at a football festival. However, a case was also reported in an elderly asylum and can reflect a more casual and widespread infection in the municipality. An improvement in the estimate of the prevalence calculated by the space autocortion control of the cases could be carried out. The prevalence is such a measure;And despite the uncertainties in the esteem, it can generate relevance for adherence to the recommendations of the health authorities.","Lorentzen, H.

373504,Clinical value of immune-inflammatory parameters to assess the severity of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"A predator-prey model is used to investigate the interactions between phages and bacteria by considering the lytic and lysogenic life cycles of phages and the prophage induction. We provide answers to the following conflictual research questions: (1) what are conditions under which the presence of phages can purify a bacterial infected environment? (2) Can the presence of phages triggers virulent bacterial outbreaks? We derive the basic offspring number $mathcal N_0$ that serves as a threshold and the bifurcation parameter to study the dynamics and bifurcation of the system. The model exhibits three equilibria: an unstable environment-free equilibrium, a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) phage-free equilibrium (PFE) whenever $mathcal N_0<1$, and a locally asymptotically stable environment-persistent equilibrium (EPE) when $mathcal N_0>1$. The Lyapunov-LaSalle techniques are used to prove the GAS of the PFE and estimate the EPE basin of attraction. Through the center manifold approximation, topological types of the PFE are precised. Existence of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations are established. Precisely, when $mathcal N_0>1$, the EPE loses its stability and periodic solutions arise. Furthermore, increasing $mathcal N_0$ can purify an environment where bacteriophages are introduced. Purposely, we prove that for large values of $mathcal N_0$, the overall bacterial population asymptotically approaches zero, while the phage population sustains. Ecologically, our results show that for small values of $mathcal N_0$, the existence of periodic solutions could explain the occurrence of repetitive bacteria-borne disease outbreaks, while large value of $mathcal N_0$ clears bacteria from the environment. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results.","Ndongmo Teytsa, H M; Tsanou, B; Bowong, S; Lubuma, J M-S",Math. med. biol,,338

Hepatocyte-driven liver regeneration that involves the proliferation of preexisting hepatocytes is a primary regeneration mode. On the other hand, liver progenitor cell (LPC)-driven liver regeneration that involves dedifferentiation of biliary epithelial cells or hepatocytes into LPCs, LPC proliferation, and subsequent differentiation of LPCs into hepatocytes is a secondary mode. This secondary mode plays a significant role in liver regeneration when the primary mode does not effectively work, as observed in severe liver injury settings. Thus, promoting LPC-driven liver regeneration may be clinically beneficial to patients with severe liver diseases. In this review, we describe the current understanding of LPC-driven liver regeneration by exploring current knowledge on the activation, origin, and roles of LPCs during regeneration. We also describe animal models used to study LPC-driven liver regeneration, given their potential to further deepen our understanding of the regeneration process. This understanding will eventually contribute to developing strategies to promote LPC-driven liver regeneration in patients with severe liver diseases.","So, Juhoon; Kim, Angie; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Shin, Donghun",Exp. mol. med,,338

CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding epitope can only be accessed by CR3022 when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the ""up"" conformation and slightly rotated.

Objective: To assess outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged via the expected practice approach to home or quarantine housing with supplemental home oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 621 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from 2 large urban public hospitals caring primarily for patients receiving Medicaid from March 20 to August 19, 2020. Patients were included in the analysis cohort if they received emergency or inpatient care for COVID-19 and were discharged with home oxygen. Interventions: Patients receiving at least 3 L per minute of oxygen, stable without other indication for inpatient care, were discharged from either emergency or inpatient encounters with home oxygen equipment, educational resources, and nursing telephone follow-up within 12 to 18 hours of discharge. Nurses provided continued telephone follow up as indicated, always with physician back-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality and all-cause 30-day return admission. Results: A total of 621 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (404 male [65.1%] and 217 female [34.9%]) were discharged with home oxygen. Median age of these patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 45-61 years), with 149 (24.0%) discharged from the emergency department and 472 (76%) discharged from inpatient encounters. The all-cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.5%) and the 30-day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-10.7%) with a median follow-up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15-55 days). No deaths occurred in the ambulatory setting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged on home oxygen had low rates of mortality and return admission within 30 days of discharge. Ambulatory management of COVID-19 with home oxygen has an acceptable safety profile, and the expected practice approach may help optimize outcomes, by ensuring right care in the right place at the right time and preserving access to acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Josh; Canamar, Catherine P; Voyageur, Christian; Tangpraphaphorn, Soodtida; Lemus, Anabel; Coffey, Charles; Wald-Dickler, Noah; Holtom, Paul; Shoenberger, Jan; Bowdish, Michael; Yee, Hal F; Spellberg, Brad",JAMA Netw Open,,338

Keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic, in this study, an attempt has been made to understand the selectivity and the current voltage relation of the COVID-19 E protein pentameric ion channel. Two ionic species, namely Na^{+} and Cl^{-}, have been considered here. E protein is one of the smallest structural protein which is embedded in the outer membrane of the virus. Once the virus is inside the host cell, this protein is expressed abundantly and is responsible for activities such as replication and budding of the virus. In the literature, we can find a few experimental studies focusing on understanding the activity of the channel formed by E proteins of different viruses. Here, we attempt the same study for the COVID-19 E protein ion channel through mathematical modeling. The channel geometry is calculated from the protein data bank file which was provided by NARLabs, Taiwan, using the hole program. Further, it was used to obtain the charge distribution using the pdbtopqr online program. The immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) has been implemented to numerically solve the system of equations in the channel generated by the protein data bank file.

In this paper we outline and evaluate the Co-Creation processes underpinning a handwashing intervention for young children (A Germ's Journey) developed and delivered in India, Sierra Leone and the UK, and consider the implications surrounding Imperialist/Colonial discourse and the White Saviour Complex. The paper focuses both on the ways Co-Creation was conceptualised by our collaborators in all three countries and the catalysts and challenges encountered. Qualitative data have been drawn from in-depth interviews with five key stakeholders, focus group data from 37 teachers in Sierra Leone and responses to open-ended questionnaires completed by teachers in India (N = 66) and UK (N = 63). Data were analysed using thematic analysis and three themes, each with three constituent subthemes are presented. In the theme 'Representations of and Unique Approaches to Co-Creation' we explore the ways in which Co-Creation was constructed in relation to teamwork, innovative practice and more continuous models of evaluation. In 'Advantages of Co-Creation' we consider issues around shared ownership, improved outcomes and more meaningful insights alongside the mitigation of risks and short-circuiting of problems. In 'Challenges of Co-Creation' we discuss issues around timing and organisation, attracting and working with appropriate partners and understanding the importance of local context with inherent social, economic and structural barriers, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. We consider how theoretical elements of Co-Creation can inform effective international public health interventions; crucial during a global pandemic in which handwashing is the most effective method to control the transmission of COVID-19. Finally we reflect on some of the methodological challenges of our own work and in managing the potentially conflicting goals of the ethical and participatory values of Co-Creation with pragmatic considerations about ensuring an effective final 'product'.","Crosby, Sapphire; Younie, Sarah; Williamson, Iain; Laird, Katie",PLoS One,,338

Proponents argue that the low cost and near perfect safety profile of vitamin C support its early adoption. Yet, adverse events might be underreported and underappreciated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 73-year-old non-diabetic white man with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock that was suspected to be due to peritonitis. The patient was enrolled in LOVIT (Lessening Organ Dysfunction with VITamin C; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03680274), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. He developed factitious hyperglycemia, as measured with a point-of-care glucometer, that persisted for 6 days after discontinuation of the study drug, confirmed to be vitamin C after unblinding. He also had short-lived iatrogenic coma because of hypoglycemia secondary to insulin administration. These events triggered a protocol amendment. CONCLUSIONS: Although factitious hyperglycemia has been reported before using certain glucometers in patients treated with high-dose vitamin C, the persistence of this phenomenon for 6 days after the discontinuation of the therapy is a distinguishing feature. This case highlights the importance of monitoring glucose with a core laboratory assay for up to a week in specific populations, such as patients on peritoneal dialysis.","Lachance, Olivier; Goyer, François; Adhikari, Neill K J; Masse, Marie-Hélène; Bilodeau, Jean-François; Lamontagne, François; Leclair, Marc-André",J Med Case Rep,,338

While the majority of these measures are proving effective, they have a high social and economic cost, and response strategies are being adjusted. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that communities should have a voice, be informed and engaged, and participate in this transition phase. We propose ten considerations to support this principle: (1) implement a phased approach to a 'new normal'; (2) balance individual rights with the social good; (3) prioritise people at highest risk of negative consequences; (4) provide special support for healthcare workers and care staff; (5) build, strengthen and maintain trust; (6) enlist existing social norms and foster healthy new norms; (7) increase resilience and self-efficacy; (8) use clear and positive language; (9) anticipate and manage misinformation; and (10) engage with media outlets. The transition phase should also be informed by real-time data according to which governmental responses should be updated.","Habersaat, Katrine Bach; Betsch, Cornelia; Danchin, Margie; Sunstein, Cass R; Böhm, Robert; Falk, Armin; Brewer, Noel T; Omer, Saad B; Scherzer, Martha; Sah, Sunita; Fischer, Edward F; Scheel, Andrea E; Fancourt, Daisy; Kitayama, Shinobu; Dubé, Eve; Leask, Julie; Dutta, Mohan; MacDonald, Noni E; Temkina, Anna; Lieberoth, Andreas; Jackson, Mark; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Seale, Holly; Fietje, Nils; Schmid, Philipp; Gelfand, Michele; Korn, Lars; Eitze, Sarah; Felgendreff, Lisa; Sprengholz, Philipp; Salvi, Cristiana; Butler, Robb",Nat Hum Behav,,338

In the United States, such calls went largely unanswered. In response to COVID-19, public health and occupational safety concerns have rapidly transformed some drug policies, along with their enforcement. Almost contemporaneously, nationwide protests against violence and racism by militarized police have highlighted the enduring legacy of the Drug War in fueling carceral systems. Disruption from these historical events provides a once-in-a-century opportunity to reconsider the legal architecture of drug policy and policing-both in the U.S. and elsewhere. Rather than returning to a fundamentally broken and inequitable status quo, we urge envisioning a new drug policy in service to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.","Del Pozo, Brandon; Beletsky, Leo",Int J Drug Policy,,338
397943,COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and postpartum,2021,"BACKGROUND: Advanced age is a well-known risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19. However, few studies have specifically focused on very old inpatients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of very old inpatients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality at admission. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective, observational study in patients &#8805;80 years hospitalized with COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19) Registry (March 1-May 29, 2020). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A uni- and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of mortality at admission. RESULTS: 2,772 consecutive patients (49.4% men, median age 86.3 years) were analyzed. Rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and Barthel Index <60 were 30.8%, 25.6%, 30.5%, and 21.0%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was 46.9% (n:1,301) and increased with age (80-84 years:41.6%; 85-90 years:47.3%; 90-94 years:52.7%; &#8805;95 years:54.2%). After analysis, male sex and moderate-to-severe dependence were independently associated with in-hospital mortality; comorbidities were not predictive. At admission, independent risk factors for death were: SatO2 <90%; temperature &#8805;37.8ºC; qSOFA score &#8805;2; and unilateral-bilateral infiltrates on chest X-rays. Some analytical findings were independent risk factors for death, including eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73m 2; lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;500 U/L; CRP &#8805;80 mg/L; neutrophils &#8805;7.5x10 3/µL; lymphocytes <0.8x10 3/µL; and monocytes <0.5 x 10 3/µL. CONCLUSIONS: This first large, multicenter cohort of very old inpatients with COVID-19 shows that age, male sex, and poor pre-admission functional status-not comorbidities-are independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Severe COVID-19 at admission is related to poor prognosis.","Ramos-Rincon, Jose-Manuel; Buonaiuto, Verónica; Ricci, Michele; Martín-Carmona, Jesica; Paredes-Ruíz, Diana; Calderón-Moreno, María; Rubio-Rivas, Manel; Beato-Pérez, José-Luis; Arnalich-Fernández, Francisco; Monge-Monge, Daniel; Vargas-Núñez, Juan-Antonio; Acebes-Repiso, Gonzalo; Mendez-Bailon, Manuel; Perales-Fraile, Isabel; García-García, Gema-María; Guisado-Vasco, Pablo; Abdelhady-Kishta, Alaaeldeen; Pascual-Pérez, Maria-de-Los-Reyes; Rodríguez-Fernández-Viagas, Cristina; Montaño-Martínez, Adrián; López-Ruiz, Antonio; Gonzalez-Juarez, Maria-Jesus; Pérez-García, Cristina; Casas-Rojo, José-Manuel; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo","J. gerontol.

400203,Covid-19: Cases of inflammatory syndrome in children surge after urgent alert,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of people aged 50+ years presenting to primary care with features that could potentially indicate cancer, and to explore how reporting differed by patient characteristics and in face-to-face vs remote consultations. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","Scott, Lauren J; Murphy, Mairead; Price, Sarah; Lewis, Rhys; Denholm, Rachel; Horwood, Jeremy; Palmer, Tom; Salisbury, Chris",BMJ Open,,338
402091,Editorial: COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),2021,"BACKGROUND: Plasma-derived immunoglobulins (IgG) are essential medicines that are in worldwide shortage, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Optimised manufacturing processes can increase supply. We evaluated various new process steps for IgG fractionation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A crude, worst-case, IgG intermediate obtained by caprylic acid fractionation of cryoprecipitate-poor plasma was used as starting experimental material. It was processed inline by Fractogel® (Merck) TMAE anion-exchanger to deplete IgA and IgM, Eshmuno® P (Merck) anti-A and anti-B affinity chromatography to remove anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins, 0.3% TnBP-1% Triton X-100 (S/D) treatment, C18 chromatography for removal of S/D agents, and single-pass tangential flow filtration (SPTFF) concentration to 20%. Quality, safety, and recovery were evaluated at small and pilot scales to assess purity, removal of IgA, IgM isoagglutinins, S/D agents, thrombogenic factors, and lack of toxicity in a cell model. RESULTS: The starting IgG intermediate contained approximately 90% IgG, IgA, and IgM and 10% albumin. Fractogel® TMAE, equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate-pH 6.0 and loaded with up to 225 mg of IgG/mL, could remove IgA and IgM, with over 94% IgG recovery with preserved sub-class distribution in the flow-through. Sequential Eshmuno®-P anti-A and anti-B columns efficiently removed isoagglutinins. The C18 packing, used at up to 17 mL of S/D-IgG solution per mL, removed TnBP and Triton X-100 to less than 1 and 2 ppm, respectively. The 20% purified IgG was devoid of activated factor XI and thrombin generation activity. DISCUSSION: This purification sequence yields a >99% pure, 20% (v/v) IgG product, depleted of IgA, isoagglutinins, and thrombogenic markers, and should be implementable on various IgG intermediates to help improve the supply of immunoglobulins.","Cheng, Josephine H; Wu, Yu-Wen; Wang, Chen-Yun; Wu, Sharon S; Hong, Cheum L; Chan, Karen W; Liao, Leo X; Cao, Xisheng; Wang, Bin; Burnouf, Thierry","Blood transfus.

The POC diagnostic devices offer easy operation, fast analytical outcome, and affordable cost, which promote their advanced research and versatile adoptability. Keeping advantages in view, considerable efforts are being made to design and develop smart sensing components such as miniaturized transduction, interdigitated electrodes-based sensing chips, selective detection at low level, portable packaging, and sustainable durability to promote POC diagnostics according to the needs of patient care. Such effective diagnostics systems are in demand, which creates the challenge to make them more efficient in every aspect to generate a desired bio-informatic needed for better health access and management. Keeping advantages and scope in view, this mini review focuses on practical scenarios associated with miniaturized analytical diagnostic devices at POC application for targeted disease diagnostics smartly and efficiently. Moreover, advancements in technologies, such as smartphone-based operation, paper-based sensing assays, and lab-on-a-chip (LOC) which made POC more sensitive, informative, and suitable for major infectious disease diagnosis, are the main focus here. Besides, POC diagnostics based on automated patient sample integration with a sensing platform is continuously improving therapeutics interventions against specific infectious disease. This review also discussed challenges associated with state-of-the-art technology along with future research opportunities to design and develop next generation POC diagnostic systems needed to manage infectious diseases in a personalized manner.","Kumar, Sandeep; Nehra, Monika; Khurana, Sakina; Dilbaghi, Neeraj; Kumar, Vanish; Kaushik, Ajeet; Kim, Ki-Hyun",Int J Nanomedicine,,338

412867,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in an Adolescent that Developed Coronary Aneurysms: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,2020,"Tuberculosis dates back to ancient times but it is not a problem of the past. Each year, millions of people die from tuberculosis. After inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis reaches the lungs where it can manipulate the immune system and survive within host macrophages, establishing a persistent infection. The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) is a self-ligand receptor that can internalize gram-negative bacteria and regulate macrophages' phagosomal functions. In tuberculosis, SLAMF1 promotes Th1-protective responses. In this work, we studied the role of SLAMF1 on macrophages' functions during M. tuberculosis infection. Our results showed that both M. tuberculosis and IFN-Î³ stimulation induce SLAMF1 expression in macrophages from healthy donor and Tohoku Hospital Pediatrcs-1 cells. Costimulation through SLAMF1 with an agonistic antibody resulted in an enhanced internalization of M. tuberculosis by macrophages. Interestingly, we found that SLAMF1 interacts with M. tuberculosis and colocalizes with the bacteria and with early and late endosomes/lysosomes markers (EEA1 and LAMP2), suggesting that SLAMF1 recognize M. tuberculosis and participate in the endolysosomal maturation process. Notably, increased levels of SLAMF1 were detected in CD14 cells from pleural effusions of tuberculosis patients, indicating that SLAMF1 might have an active function at the site of infection. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SLAMF1 improves the uptake of M. tuberculosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages.","Barbero, Angela María; Trotta, Aldana; Genoula, Melanie; Pino, Rodrigo Emanuel Hernández Del; Estermann, Martín Andrés; Celano, Josefina; Fuentes, Federico; García, Verónica Edith; Balboa, Luciana; Barrionuevo, Paula; Pasquinelli, Virginia",J. leukoc. biol,,338

Real world data have demonstrated the vaccines to be highly effective against COVID-19, severe disease and death. Here, we estimate vaccine effectiveness over time since the second dose of Comirnaty, Vaxzevria and Spikevax in England. MethodsWe used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, hospitalisation and mortality by age, comorbidity status and over time after the second dose to investigate waning separately for Alpha and Delta variants. ResultsVaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease peaked in the early weeks after the second dose and then fell to 47.3 (95% CI 45 to 49.6) and 69.7 (95% CI 68.7 to 70.5) by 20+ weeks against the Delta variant for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty, respectively.

Vaccine effectiveness fell less against hospitalisations to 77.0 (70.3 to 82.3) and 92.7 (90.3 to 94.6) beyond 20 weeks post-vaccination and 78.7 (95% CI 52.7 to 90.4) and 90.4 (95% CI 85.1 to 93.8) against death for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty, respectively. Greater waning was observed among 65+ year-olds in a clinically extremely vulnerable group and 40-64-year olds with underlying medical conditions compared to healthy adults. ConclusionsWe observed limited waning in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death more than 20 weeks post-vaccination with Vaxzevria or Comirnaty. Waning was greater in older adults and those in a clinical risk group, suggesting that these individuals should be prioritised for booster doses.","Andrews, Nick; Tessier, Elise; Stowe, Julia; Gower, Charlotte; Kirsebom, Freja; Simmons, Ruth; Gallagher, Eileen; Chand, Meera; Brown, Kevin; Ladhani, Shamez; Ramsay, Mary; Bernal, Jamie Lopez",,,338

Most sample collection was performed in emergency departments (EDs). Traditional sample collection requires substantial personal protective equipment (PPE), healthcare professionals, sanitation workers, and isolation space. To solve this problem, we established a multifunctional sample collection station (MSCS) for COVID-19 testing in front of our ED. The station is composed of a thick and clear acrylic board (2 cm), which completely separates the patient and medical personnel. Three pairs of gloves (length, 45 cm) are attached and fixed on the outside wall of the MSCS. The gloves are used to conduct sampling of throat/nasal swabs, sputum, and blood from patients. The gap between the board and the building is only 0.2 cm (sealed with silicone sealant). ED personnel communicate with patients using a small two-way broadcast system. Medical waste is put in specific trashcans installed in the table outside the MSCS. With full physical protection, the personnel conducting the sampling procedure need to wear only their N95 mask and gloves. After we activated the station, our PPE, sampling time, and sanitization resources were considerably conserved during the 4-week observation period. The MSCS obviously saved time and PPE. It elevated the efficiency and capacity of the ED for handling potential community infections of COVID-19.","Lin, Po-Ting; Ni, Ting-Yuan; Chen, Tren-Yi; Su, Chih-Pei; Sun, Hsiao-Fen; Chen, Mu-Kuan; Chou, Chu-Chung; Wang, Po-Yu; Lin, Yan-Ren",Environ Health Prev Med,,338

Thirty male albino rats weighing ""190-200 g"" were divided randomly into three groups (10 each): control, MA-induced OA, and MA-induced OA + dpdo. In MA-induced OA rat, the tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, reactive oxygen species, as well as all the mitochondrial markers such as mitochondria membrane potential, swelling mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and serum oxidative/antioxidant status (malondialdehyde level and activities of myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase) are elevated. Also, the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), levels of ATP, the level of glutathione (GSH), and thiol were markedly diminished in the MA-induced OA group compared to the normal control rats. These findings showed that mitochondrial function is associated with OA pathophysiological alterations and high gene expressions of (IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b) and suggests a promising use of dpdo as potential ameliorative agents in the animal model of OA and could act as anti-inflammatory agent in case of severe infection with COVID-19. It is clearly appeared in improving the bone cortex and bone marrow in the treated group with the novel compound in histological and transmission electron microscopic sections which is a very important issue today in fighting severe infections that have significant effects on the blood indices and declining of blood corpuscles like COVID-19, in addition to declining the genotoxicity and inflammation induced by MA in male rats. The novel synthesized compound was highly effective in improving all the above mentioned parameters.","Refat, M S; Hamza, R Z; Adam, Ama; Saad, H A; Gobouri, A A; Al-Salmi, F A; Altalhi, T; El-Megharbel, S M",Hum Exp Toxicol,,338

425261,COVID-19-related Potential Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Childhood in a Neonate Presenting as Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 3.6 million people worldwide and it is responsible for more than 250,000 deaths. A major problem faced in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the inefficiency and scarcity of medical tests. The use of computed tomography (CT) has shown promise for the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. CT exam analysis is complex and requires specialist effort, which can lead to diagnostic errors. The use of CAD systems can minimize the problems generated by the analysis of CTs by specialists. This paper presents a methodology for diagnosing COVID-19 using convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction in CT exams and its classification using XGBoost. The methodology consists of using a CNN to extract features from 708 CTs, 312 with COVID-19, and 396 Non-COVID-19. After the extracted data, we used XGBoost for classification. The results show an accuracy of 95.07, recall of 95.09, precision of 94.99, F-score of 95, AUC of 95, and a kappa index of 90. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology can be used as a diagnostic aid system by specialists.","Carvalho, E. D.; de Carvalho, A. O.; de Araujo, F. H. D.; Rabelo, R. D.

This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively. In this study, age between 25-34 years (AOR = 0.20), age between 35-44 years (AOR = 0.13), family size of >6 (AOR = 3.77), work experience of 21-30 years (AOR = 0.01), and good handwashing habit (AOR = 0.44) were the protective factors against COVID-19. On the other hand, perception of non-exposure to COVD 19 (AOR = 9.56), and poor habit of decontamination of high touch areas (AOR = 2.52) were the risk factors associated with confirmed COVID 19 cases among health care workers. CONCLUSION: Poor adherence to personal protective equipment use and aseptic practices during and after health care interactions with patients were identified. Strategies should be implemented to institute effective and sustainable infection control measures that protect the health care workers from COVID-19 infection.","Atnafie, Seyfe Asrade; Anteneh, Demssie Ayalew; Yimenu, Dawit Kumilachew; Kifle, Zemene Demelash",PLoS One,,338

A total of 17 COVID-19 patients underwent retinal imaging 6 months after hospital discharge with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The parafoveal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) were significantly thinner in COVID-19 patients at 6 months compared to 0 months (p = &lt;0.001 in both cases). In the optic nerve analysis, a significantly thinner RNFL was observed (p = 0.006) but persisted significantly thickened, compared to controls (p = 0.02). The vascular density (VD) at 6 months persisted significantly decreased when compared to the control group, and no significant differences were found with the 0 months evaluation;in addition, when analyzed separately, women showed a worsening in the VD. Moreover, a significantly greater foveal area zone (FAZ) (p = 0.003) was observed in COVID-19 patients at 6 months, compared to 0 months. The cotton wool spots (CWSs) observed at baseline were no longer present at 6 months, except for one patient that developed new ones.

433519,Defining Association between COVID-19 and the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children through the Pandemic,2020,"Pandemics are enormous threats to the world that impact all aspects of our lives, especially the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged since December 2019 and has affected the global economy in many ways. As the world becomes more interconnected, the economic impacts of the pandemic become more serious. In addition to increased health expenditures and reduced labor force, the pandemic has hit the supply and demand chain massively and caused trouble for manufacturers who have to fire some of their employees or delay their economic activities to prevent more loss. With the closure of manufacturers and companies and reduced travel rates, usage of oil after the beginning of the pandemic has decreased significantly that was unprecedented in the last 30 years. The mining industry is a critical sector in several developing countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic has hit this industry too. Also, world stock markets declined as investors started to become concerned about the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism industry and airlines have also experienced an enormous loss too. The GDP has reduced, and this pandemic will cost the world more than 2 trillion at the end of 2020.","Kolahchi, Zahra; De Domenico, Manlio; Uddin, Lucina Q; Cauda, Valentina; Grossmann, Igor; Lacasa, Lucas; Grancini, Giulia; Mahmoudi, Morteza; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,338

We aimed to determine the parameters that can predict the mortality of moderate to severely ill patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19. METHODS: Moderate to severely ill, Covid-19 patients older than 18 years were included. Mild Covid-19 patients and the ones with negative polymerase chain reaction test results were excluded from the study. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality rate and we aimed to determine the factors affecting mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: 168 patient results were analyzed. Median age of the patients was 59.5 (48.3 to 76) and 90 (53.6%) were male. According to multivariate regression analysis results, the presence of any comorbid disease (p = 0.027, HR = 26.11 (95%CI: 1.45 to 471.31)), elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (p < 0.001, HR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.11 to 1.38)) and presence of dyspnea (p = 0.026, HR = 4.26 ((95%CI: 1.19 to 15.28)) were found to significantly increase the mortality, while high pulse O 2 saturation level (p < 0.001, HR = 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82 to 0.99) was found to decrease. When receiver operating characteristic curve was created for laboratory tests, it was determined that white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, CRP levels and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio predicted mortality while Lymphocyte levels did not. CONCLUSION: Dyspnea, the presence of any comorbid disease, elevated CRP levels, and low pulse O 2 saturation levels predict mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients.","Aksel, Gökhan; Islam, Mehmet Muzaffer; Algin, Abdullah; Eroglu, Serkan Emre; Yasar, Gökselin Beleli; Ademoglu, Enis; Dölek, Ümit Can",Am. j. emerg. med,,338

The aim of this report is to describe the activity of Bergamo Teratology Information Service (TIS) in supporting the public and health-care personnel in case of drug prescriptions in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 pregnant and lactating patients during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Methods All Bergamo TIS requests concerning COVID-19 pregnant and lactating women have been retrospectively evaluated from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Type of medications, drug's safety profile and compatibility with pregnancy and lactation are reported. Results Our service received information calls concerning 48 (9 pregnant, 35 lactating) patients. Among pregnant and lactating women, the requests of information were related to 16 and 60 drugs prescriptions respectively. More than half concerned drugs prescriptions during the first and second trimester (13/16) and during the first six months of lactation (37/60). Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were the most involved. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at dosages used for COVID-19 may be considered compatible and reasonably safe either in pregnancy and lactation. Antivirals may be considered acceptable in pregnancy. During lactation lopinavir and ritonavir probably exhibit some supportive data from literature that darunavir and cobicistat do not.

438218,Implications of social distancing in Brazil in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The advent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused an increase in patients requiring enteral feeding access while undergoing proning for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We investigated the safety and feasibility of fluoroscopy guided NJ feeding tube placement in the prone position. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients that underwent fluoroscopic placement of NJ feeding tubes at a single institution between March and December 2020. Primary endpoints were success rate and number of attempts. Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were used to compare prone and supine groups. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included in the study, 53 patients received NJ feeding tubes while prone and 157 while supine. All but one patient in the prone group had ARDS secondary to COVID-19, while 47 (30.3%) had COVID-19 in the supine group. Mean age was 58 years (SD±15.3) and 134 (63.8%) were male. The rate of successful placement was 94.3% in the prone group and 100% in supine group. Mean number of attempts was 1.1 (SD ±0.4) in the prone and 1.0 (SD ±0.1) in the supine groups (p=0.14). Prone patients had a longer median fluoroscopy time (69 seconds, IQR: 92, vs 48 seconds, IQR: 43, p<0.001) and received higher radiation dose during the procedure (47 mGy, IQR: 50 vs 25 mGy, IQR: 33, p=0.004). No procedural complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy guided NJ feeding tube placement in prone patients is feasible and safe. Patient positioning should not delay obtaining post-pyloric feeding access. This article is protected by copyright.

SUMMARY: A group of pharmacy leaders in the Kansas City region identified potential benefits to healthcare personnel and patients if hazardous drug handling procedures were standardized. A task force was created, a preimplementation survey was distributed, and meetings were held monthly to discuss sections of USP <800> identified as the most challenging to implement. The task force focused on an assessment of risk tool, hot topics, cleanroom design, and a detailed analysis of controversial medications. After the first year of meetings, a postimplementation survey was distributed, and the results were analyzed. The task force created significant value for the participants and achieved the goal of facilitating efficient USP <800> implementation resulting in greater compliance and consistency across the multiple health systems represented. Over 5,100 beds and 200 clinic sites were affected by this task force's efforts. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of respondents reported that the task force was ""extremely helpful,"" and the majority (64%) of respondents adopted most or all (81%-100%) of the task force's assessment of risk choices. Prioritization of tasks, information sharing, and decision-making were areas where the individual leaders were most supported. CONCLUSION: Creating a structure to eliminate barriers and facilitate collaboration among regional pharmacy leaders provided a framework for successful implementation of USP <800> requirements. This interdependent leadership model produced innovative and standardized solutions and should be considered when addressing complicated initiatives that impact the profession.","Duty, Ashley; Robinson, Joanna; Bahmandar, Della; Hanson, Nathan; Lucas, Amber J",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,338
443948,Favipiravir-induced fever in coronavirus disease 2019: A report of two cases,2020,"Background: Adequate information and knowledge about COVID-19 has been shown to induce the confidence and positive performance among healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, assessing the relationship between confidence in knowledge and associated factors among HCWs is vital in the fight against COVID-19. This paper investigates factors associated with HCWs' confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19 in South Africa in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods: Data utilized in this paper were from an online survey conducted among HCWs using a structured questionnaire on a data free online platform. The study population were all the medical fraternity in South Africa including medical and nurse practitioners as well as other healthcare professionals. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to examine the factors associated with confidence in HCWs' overall knowledge about COVID-19. Results: Overall, just below half (47.4%) of respondents indicated that they had confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19. Increased odds of having confidence in the knowledge about COVID-19 were significantly associated with being male [aOR = 1.31 95% CI (1.03-1.65), p < 0.05], having a doctorate degree [aOR = 2.01 (1.23-3.28), p < 0.05], being satisfied with the information about COVID-19 guidelines [aOR = 6.01 (4.89-7.39), p < 0.001], having received training in 6-8 areas [aOR = 2.54 (1.89-3.43), p < 0.001] and having received training in 9-11 areas [aOR = 5.33 (3.81-7.47), p < 0.001], and having already treated COVID-19 patients [aOR = 1.43 (1.08-1.90), p < 0.001]. Those who were highly concerned with the levels of training of HCWs [aOR = 0.47 (0.24-0.92), p < 0.05] had decreased odds of having confidence in their overall knowledge about COVID-19. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the importance of capacitating HCWs with knowledge and adequate relevant training as part of infection prevention control measures during pandemics. Future training and information sharing should be sensitive to knowledge gaps by age, gender, qualifications, professional categories, and experience.","Manyaapelo, Thabang; Mokhele, Tholang; Sifunda, Sibusiso; Ndlovu, Philisiwe; Dukhi, Natisha; Sewpaul, Ronel; Naidoo, Inbarani; Jooste, Sean; Tlou, Boikhutso; Moshabela, Mosa; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Zuma, Khangelani; Reddy, Priscilla",Front Public Health,,338

446549,Drug desensitization in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic era: Local success to widespread potential,2021,"BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a serious health threat in the Amazonas Region of Peru and approximately 95% of the cases, mainly Plasmodium vivax, are found in native communities of The Rio Santiago District, Condorcanqui Province. In 2019, more than one thousand malaria cases were reported, with an unusual number of Plasmodium falciparum autochthonous cases. The present study aims to report this P. falciparum outbreak while describing the epidemiology of malaria and the risk factors associated in the native communities of Amazonas, Peru. METHODS: The DIRESA-Amazonas in collaboration with the Condorcanqui Health Network and the Institute of Tropical Diseases of the UNTRM carried out a malaria Active Case Detection (ACD III) between January 31st and February 10th of 2020. A total of 2718 (47.4%) individuals from 21 native communities grouped in eight sanitary districts, were screened for malaria infections. Each participant was screened for malaria using microscopy. Follow-up surveys were conducted for all malaria positive individuals to collect socio-demographic data. Spatial clustering of infection risk was calculated using a generalized linear model (GLM). Analysis of risk considered factors such as gender, age, type of infection, symptomatology, and parasitaemia. RESULTS: The study suggests that the P. falciparum index case was imported from Loreto and later spread to other communities of Rio Santiago during 2019. The ACD III reported 220 (8.1%) malaria cases, 46 P. falciparum, 168 P. vivax and 6 mixed infections. SaTScan analysis detected a cluster of high infection risk in Middle Rio Santiago and a particular high P. falciparum infection risk cluster in Upper Rio Santiago. Interestingly, the evaluation of different risk factors showed significant associations between low parasitaemia and P. falciparum asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a P. falciparum outbreak in native communities of Condorcanqui, Amazonas. Timely identification and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are critical to achieve malaria control and possible elimination in this area. However, the current malaria situation in Condorcanqui is uncertain, given that malaria ACD activities have been postponed due to COVID-19.","Montenegro, Carla C; Bustamante-Chauca, T Pershing; Pajuelo Reyes, Cecilia; Bernal, Miguel; Gonzales, Lizandro; Tapia-Limonchi, Rafael; Tejedo, Juan R; Chenet, Stella M",Malar J,,338
446550,Drug desensitization in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic era: Local success to widespread potential,2021,"Early life adversity impacts on a range of emotional, cognitive, and psychological processes. A recent theoretical model suggests that at least some of these effects are due to accelerated maturation of specific physiological systems and/or neural circuits. For example, maternal separation (MS), a model of early life adversity in rodents, accelerates maturation of memory systems, and here we examined its impact on maturation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) and parvalbumin (PV)-containing inhibitory interneurons. PNNs are specialized extracellular matrix structures suggested to be involved in stabilizing long-term memories and in the closure of a sensitive period in memory development. PV-containing inhibitory interneurons are the type of cell that PNNs preferentially surround, and are also thought to be involved in memory. In Experiment 1, with male rats, there was an increase in PNNs in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex with age from infancy to juvenility. Contrary to prediction, MS had no impact on either PNN or PV expression. The same pattern was observed in female rats in Experiment 2. Taken together, these data show that the early maturation of memory in MS infants is not due to an accelerated maturation of PNNs or PV-containing cells in either the amygdala or prefrontal cortex.","Richardson, Rick; Bowers, Jeremy; Callaghan, Bridget L; Baker, Kathryn D",Dev Cogn Neurosci,,338

The Data Integration Center (DIC) of the University Hospital Magdeburg and the Institute of Biometry and Medical Informatics (IBMI) has developed a concept based on existing structures that can be quickly implemented and used by the Medical Faculty at Otto von Guericke University. This manuscript focuses on the IT support for lecturers, which allows them to concentrate on teaching their lessons, although the authors are aware that this is only a small part of the entire subject. Additionally, there is a great awareness that ERT can never replace well-structured in-person classes. Concept: The key feature of the concept uses the well-working management system for all physical rooms of the university by designing a virtual video conference room for every physical room. This allows high interactivity for lectures and seminars while applying proven teaching methods. Additionally, a collaboration software system to document all lessons learned and a technical support team have been available for the teaching staff. Courses with a hands-on approach require more personal interaction than lectures. Therefore, the issues of practical trainings have not been solved with this concept, but been tackled by using questionnaires and minimizing contacts during attestations. Applied IT tools: The concept's requirements were met by Zoom Meetings, Confluence, HIS/LSF and Moodle. Discussion and Conclusion: The concept helped the lecturers to provide high-quality teaching for students at universities. Additionally, it allows for a dynamic response to new needs and problems. The concept will be reviewed as part of a higher Universal Design for Learning concept and may support lecturers in the following semesters in hybrid meetings with real and virtual attendees.","Bruns, Christian; Herrmann, Tim; Böckmann-Barthel, Martin; Rothkötter, Hermann-Josef; Bernarding, Johannes; Plaumann, Markus",GMS J Med Educ,,338

A two-stage design is adopted: the first stage adopts an exploratory strategy to identify consumption-related themes using netnography, while the second stage explores these themes further to gain a deeper insight through 13 semi-structured interviews. Three themes emerge relating to different aspects of consumption practices. These themes are found to link to the self-control research area and include consumers' self-control changing their shopping behaviour, having less self-control over unhealthy snack consumption and having less self-control concerning alcohol. These lead to changes in other consumption practices, including store format and type of shopping. Different initiatives are discussed to help retailers retain their new lockdown customers to help manufacturers provide healthier options and to help weight management businesses and the National Health Service reduce unhealthy consumption habits.","Gordon-Wilson, Sianne",International journal of consumer studies,,338

457077,Remestemcel-L Therapy for COVID-19-Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused over 95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2 million deaths worldwide. According to current literature data, older adults have higher risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19. It is also known that older adults often do not present typical symptoms of diseases. The aim of the study was to assess if the prevalence of typical COVID-19-related symptoms varies by age group. METHODS: Medical charts of a random sample of COVID-19 patients dying in-hospital were retrieved through an integrated national surveillance system and reviewed by a group of researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health. Detailed information on COVID-19-related symptoms were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: 3241 confirmed cases of COVID-19-related deaths were identified from 4391 reviewed medical charts. The mean number of COVID-19-related symptoms progressively declined with age, from 2.1 in patients aged < 60 years to 1.7 in those aged 90 years or older (p < 0.001). Moreover, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly declined with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults have atypical presentation of symptoms and may be paucisymptomatic. This may lead to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay which aggravates the prognosis of COVID-19. Special attention should be posed when assessing individuals aged 65 years and older with suspected COVID-19.","Unim, Brigid; Palmieri, Luigi; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",Aging Clin Exp Res,,338

A meta-analysis was carried out to identify studies on COVID-19 from 25 December 2019 to 30 April 2020. A total of 48 studies with 5829 pediatric patients were included. Children of all ages were at risk for COVID-19. The main illness classification ranged as: 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-26%; I2 = 91.4%) asymptomatic, 33% (95% CI: 23%-43%; I2 = 95.6%) mild and 51% (95% CI: 42%-61%; I2 = 93.4%) moderate. The typical clinical manifestations were fever 51% (95% CI: 45%-57%; I2 = 78.9%) and cough 41% (95% CI: 35%-47%, I2 = 81.0%). The common laboratory findings were normal white blood cell 69% (95% CI: 64%-75%; I2 = 58.5%), lymphopenia 16% (95% CI: 11%-21%; I2 = 76.9%) and elevated creatine-kinase MB 37% (95% CI: 25%-48%; I2 = 59.0%). The frequent imaging features were normal images 41% (95% CI: 30%-52%; I2 = 93.4%) and ground-glass opacity 36% (95% CI: 25%-47%; I2 = 92.9%). Among children under 1 year old, critical cases account for 14% (95% CI: 13%-34%; I2 = 37.3%) that should be of concern. In addition, vomiting occurred in 33% (95% CI: 18%-67%; I2 = 0.0%) cases that may also need attention. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 may experience milder illness with atypical clinical manifestations and rare lymphopenia. High incidence of critical illness and vomiting symptoms reward attention in children under 1 year old.","Cui, Xiaojian; Zhao, Zhihu; Zhang, Tongqiang; Guo, Wei; Guo, Wenwei; Zheng, Jiafeng; Zhang, Jiayi; Dong, Cuicui; Na, Ren; Zheng, Lisheng; Li, Wenliang; Liu, Zihui; Ma, Jia; Wang, Jinhu; He, Sijia; Xu, Yongsheng; Si, Ping; Shen, Yongming; Cai, Chunquan",J Med Virol,,338

This study describes the psychological distress that this group has suffered, analyzing the effect that the sense of coherence related with the history of contact with infected people has generated in their mental health. Cross-sectional descriptive study using online questionnaires. Data were collected on a sample of 499 subjects, representing 42.0% and 38.8% of the associations of specialists in Occupational Medicine and Nursing, respectively. A univariate data analysis, independence test, and the CHAID multivariate method were carried out. The percentage of workers with high psychological distress was higher among women than among men; this was also higher in public sector workers than in the private sector. No differences have been observed regarding psychological distress and educational level, coexistence, having children, working away from home, having a pet, or between being a physician or nurse. The most efficient measure to prevent psychological distress was acting regarding the comprehensibility dimension of the sense of coherence. Sex, contact with any infected person, age, living as a couple, working in public or private centers, the availability of diagnostic tests, and the correlation with the manageability dimension were modulating factors. Sense of coherence is an effective measure to prevent psychological distress due to contact with people affected by COVID-19 in Occupational Health professionals.","Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Ortega-Moreno, Mónica; Soriano, Guillermo; Fagundo-Rivera, Javier; Allande-Cussó, Regina; Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos",Sci Prog,,338

Although treatment strategies for CM are continually being developed, the mortality rate is still high. Therefore, we need to explore more therapeutic strategies that are aimed at hindering its pathogenic mechanism. In the field of CM, several studies have observed rapid iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation within the brain, all of which are hallmarks of ferroptosis, which is a type of programmed cell death that is characterized by iron dependence and lipid peroxidation. In recent years, many studies have confirmed the involvement of ferroptosis in many diseases, including infectious diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, ferroptosis is considered as immunogenic and pro-inflammatory as the ferroptotic cells release damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) and alarmin, both of which regulate immunity and pro-inflammatory activity. Hence, we hypothesize that there might be a relationship between this unique cell death modality and CM. Herein, we review the evidence of ferroptosis in CM and consider the hypothesis that ferroptotic cell death may be involved in the cell death of CM.","Xu, Xianbin; Lin, Danfeng; Tu, Sheng; Gao, Shiqi; Shao, Anwen; Sheng, Jifang",Front Immunol,,338
460258,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Antimicrobial Resistance: Parallel and Interacting Health Emergencies,2021,"One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust-or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people's trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in 'scientific fact' by societies. As well as providing information on the 'correct science' behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics-that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases-Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)-in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society-based on race, gender or wealth-to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.","Han, Qijun; Curtis, Daniel R",Med. humanit,,338

Bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) measurements enable designing and regulating medical masks to prevent bioaerosol dissemination; however, despite the simplicity of these measurements, several scientific questions remain unanswered regarding BFE tests. Here, we investigated (1) the impact of substituting 100-mm Petri dishes with 90-mm disposable Petri dishes, (2) the impact of colony-counting methods on the bioaerosol aerodynamic size, and (3) the impact of colony-counting methods on the total viable particle counts. We demonstrated that disposable 90-mm Petri dishes can be used to replace the 100-mm dishes. We also showed that an automatic high-resolution colony counter can be used to directly count viable particles on collection substrates and to measure the bioaerosol size parameters. Our results enable possible modernization of the outdated testing methods recommended in the US and European standards for BFE measurements. Specifically, use of a modernized colony counter should be clearly regulated and permitted to avoid the counting of positive holes. The median aerodynamic diameter appears to be the most relevant parameter for characterizing bioaerosol size.","Pourchez, Jérémie; Peyron, Aurélien; Montigaud, Yoann; Laurent, Coralie; Audoux, Estelle; Leclerc, Lara; Verhoeven, Paul O",Sci Rep,,338
468048,Likelihood of survival of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"Background and objectives: Critically and non-critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Covid-19) may present with higher-than-expected glycemia, even in the absence of diabetes. With this study we aimed to assess glucose, glycemic gap (GlyG) and insulin secretion/sensitivity measures in patients with Covid-19. Materials and Methods: We studied, upon admission, 157 patients with Covid-19 (84: in wards and 73: in intensive care units; ICU); 135 had no history of diabetes. We measured blood glucose upon admission as well as glycated hemoglobin (A1c), plasma insulin and C-peptide. We calculated the GlyG and the Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) estimates of steady state beta cell function (HOMA2%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S). Statistical assessment was done with analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Compared to patients in the wards without diabetes, patients with diabetes in the wards, as well as patients in the ICU (without or with diabetes) had higher admission glycemia. The GlyG was significantly higher in patients without diabetes in the ICU compared to patients without diabetes in the wards, while HOMA2%B based on glucose and insulin was significantly higher in the ICU patients compared to patients in the wards. Of all the parameters, HOMA2%S based on C-peptide/glucose was higher in survivors (n = 133). Conclusions: In our series of patients with Covid-19, a substantial number of patients with and without diabetes had admission hyperglycemia and those who were critically ill may have had compromised insulin secretion and lowered sensitivity to insulin. These findings lend credence to reports of association between Covid-19 and hyperglycemia/secondary diabetes.","Ilias, Ioannis; Diamantopoulos, Aristidis; Pratikaki, Maria; Botoula, Efthymia; Jahaj, Edison; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Zacharis, Alexandros; Vassiliou, Alice G; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",Medicina (Kaunas),,338

The World Health Organization's (WHO's) End TB Strategy set ambitious targets for 2020, including a 20% reduction in TB incidence and a 35% reduction in the number of TB deaths compared with 2015, as well as zero TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs (defined as costs exceeding 20% of annual household income) (2). In addition, during the 2018 United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB (UNHLM-TB), all member states committed to setting 2018-2022 targets that included provision of TB treatment to 40 million persons and TB preventive treatment (TPT) to 30 million persons, including 6 million persons living with HIV infection and 24 million household contacts of patients with confirmed TB (4 million aged <5 years and 20 million aged &#8805;5 years) (3,4). Annual data reported to WHO by 215 countries and territories, supplemented by surveys assessing TB prevalence and patient costs in some countries, were used to estimate TB incidence, the number of persons accessing TB curative and preventive treatment, and the percentage of TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs (1). Globally, TB illness developed in an estimated 10 million persons in 2019, representing a decline in incidence of 2.3% from 2018 and 9% since 2015. An estimated 1.4 million TB-related deaths occurred, a decline of 7% from 2018 and 14% since 2015. Although progress has been made, the world is not on track to achieve the 2020 End TB Strategy incidence and mortality targets (1).

It interacts with RNA polymerase II and participates in the process of gene expression. Mediator complex subunit 19 or regulation by oxygen 3, or lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1 is located at the head of the mediator complex; it is a multi-protein co-activator that induces the transcription of RNA polymerase II by DNA transcription factors. It is a tumor-related gene that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis and is closely related to the occurrence and development of the cancers of the lung, bladder, skin, etc. Here, we used the structure of mediator complex subunit 19 to review its role in tumor progression, fat metabolism, drug therapy, as well as the novel coronavirus, which has attracted much attention at present, suggesting that mediator complex subunit 19 has broad application in the occurrence and development of clinical diseases. As a tumor-related gene, the role and mechanism of mediator complex subunit 19 in the regulation of tumor growth could be of great significance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of mediator complex subunit 19 -related tumors.","Zhang, Yuting; Qin, Peifang; Tian, Linlin; Yan, Jianguo; Zhou, Yali",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,338

These applications while potentially useful, present significant adoption, societal, technical and privacy challenges. We propose ACDC-Tracing, a simpler, anonymous, voucher-based contact tracing solution that relies on peoples' knowledge of their own close contacts. People who test positive are given an anonymous voucher which they can share with a limited number of people whom they think they might be infected. The recipients can use this voucher to book a COVID-19 test and can receive their test results without ever revealing their identity. People receiving positive result are given vouchers to further backtrack the path of infection. This is a fully anonymous solution which does not require any sharing of location data, Bluetooth, or having an app installed on people's mobile device. Moreover, ACDC-Tracing can be tested for effectiveness at a small scale without requiring adoption by the entire population, which would enable acquiring fast evidence about its efficacy and scalability.

478205,Repurposing antimicrobial stewardship tools in the electronic medical record for the management of COVID-19 patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is a public health strategy that aims to reduce the burden of viral illness, especially important for populations known or likely to be at increased risk for inequitable outcomes due to the disease itself or disparities in care accessed and received. The role of weight status in COVID-19 susceptibility and disease burden remains unclear. Despite this, higher weight is frequently described as a definitive risk factor for both susceptibility and disease severity. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine trials should recruit a study group representative of the full weight spectrum, and undertake appropriate subgroup analysis by weight status to evaluate response and titrate dose regimes where indicated to ensure equitable outcomes for higher weight people. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to review inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trial protocols registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, the WHO official vaccine trial register, and 'The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker'. To determine the number of trials including higher weight (body mass index >30 kg/m2) individuals and the number of trials conducting efficacy subgroup analyses by weight status. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal of trial protocols will be completed independently by a minimum of two reviewers. Clinical trials will be assessed for risk of bias using the Risk of Bias-2 tool. We will conduct a descriptive analysis of extracted data. The following subsets are proposed: participation of higher weight people in COVID-19 vaccine trials by trial phase, country and vaccine platform. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this review. The results of this rapid review will be presented at appropriate conferences and published in a suitable peer reviewed journal.

479947,Secondary infections in COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab in a Community Hospital,2020,"We propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.","Zhao, Zhengqiao; Sokhansanj, Bahrad A; Malhotra, Charvi; Zheng, Kitty; Rosen, Gail L",PLoS Comput Biol,,338
479948,Secondary infections in COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab in a Community Hospital,2020,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating an unprecedented healthcare crisis. Understanding the determinants of mortality is crucial to optimise intensive care unit (ICU) resource use and to identify targets for improving survival. METHODS: In a multicentre retrospective study, we included 379 COVID-19 patients admitted to four ICUs between 20 February and 24 April 2020 and categorised according to time from disease onset to ICU admission. A Cox proportional-hazards model identified factors associated with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years (53-68) and 292 (77%) were men. The main comorbidities included obesity and overweight (67%), hypertension (49.6%) and diabetes (30.1%). Median time from disease onset (i.e., viral symptoms) to ICU admission was 8 (6-11) days (missing for three); 161 (42.5%) patients were admitted within a week of disease onset, 173 (45.6%) between 8 and 14 days, and 42 (11.1%) > 14 days after disease onset; day 28 mortality was 26.4% (22-31) and decreased as time from disease onset to ICU admission increased, from 37 to 21% and 12%, respectively. Patients admitted within the first week had higher SOFA scores, more often had thrombocytopenia or acute kidney injury, had more limited radiographic involvement, and had significantly higher blood IL-6 levels. Age, COPD, immunocompromised status, time from disease onset, troponin concentration, and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The excess mortality in patients admitted within a week of disease onset reflected greater non-respiratory severity. Therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 might impact different clinical endpoints according to time since disease onset.","Azoulay, Elie; Fartoukh, Muriel; Darmon, Michael; Géri, Guillaume; Voiriot, Guillaume; Dupont, Thibault; Zafrani, Lara; Girodias, Lola; Labbé, Vincent; Dres, Martin; Beurton, Alexandra; Vieillard-Baron, Antoine; Demoule, Alexandre",Intensive Care Med,,338

482536,Risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness in healthcare workers: Too many unknowns,2020,"Emerging research suggests that there may be important links between social networking site (SNS) use and alcohol consumption specific to COVID-19. In addition, substantial research indicates that descriptive normative perceptions are a strong predictor of drinking behavior more generally. However, less is known about SNS-specific norms and how they might be associated with health-related behavior. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether descriptive normative perceptions for alcohol posting related to COVID-19 on SNSs are associated with both personal SNS posting behavior and drinking to cope with COVID-19-related stress, among a sample of 587 adults (48.4 percent women; mean age = 48.7 years) across the United States. All study procedures were approved by the local IRB. Results indicate that perceiving same-age peers to be posting on SNSs about their alcohol use to cope with pandemic-related stress/boredom is associated with both an increased likelihood of making such postings oneself and increased drinking to cope with the pandemic. Results have important implications for prevention and intervention efforts aimed to curb risky drinking during the pandemic and suggest that SNS behavior and norms should be incorporated into these strategies.","Litt, Dana M; Rodriguez, Lindsey M; Stewart, Sherry H",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

483159,Short and thick corpus callosum - the thin border between a minor anatomical variant to very poor outcome,2020,"The global emergence of novel coronavirus disease and its rapid global expansion over a short span of time require effective countermeasures to combat it. Development of a specific vaccine can induce an optimal antibody response, thus providing immunity against it. Our study proposes a detailed and comprehensive immunoinformatic approach that can be applied to the currently available coronavirus protein data in the online server for vaccine candidate development. We have identified the receptor binding domain (RBD) of structural spike protein (S1) as a potential target for immunity against COVID- 19 infection. Epitope prediction illustrated cytotoxic T-cell epitopes, helper T-cell epitopes, and B-cell epitopes associated with the target protein. These were joined through specific linkers along with adjuvant beta-defensin located at the N-terminal to create a multi epitope subunit vaccine (MESV). The specificity in the binding of the devised vaccine candidate to the TLR-3 immune cell receptor was evaluated via molecular docking interaction studies. Good docking score combined with robust interactions in the binding cavity certified the stringency of the engineered vaccine. Molecular dynamics simulation data showed minimal variation of the root-mean square deviations (RMSDs) and root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) which confirmed the interaction stability. These results obtained from various in-silico experiments indicate the potency of this vaccine candidate as a probable therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Vaccination strategies targeting conserved epitope-based immune response would be beneficial in providing cross protection across beta-coronaviruses, and such vaccines would be resistant to the ever-evolving viruses.

Using bibliometric methods in a non-expert perspective, in a review of 34 published articles on the COVID-19 and drug-repurposing, we investigated obvious and less obvious points of consensus on drug candidates. To establish these two types of consensus, we first implemented document clustering. Within a set of five clustered papers, we established an obvious consensus, relying solely on the occurrence of entities by using term frequency and inverse document frequency and a comparison of mentioned drugs, finding that remdesivir and chloroquine were discussed with a certain degree of agreement. For the less obvious consensus, we created a drug entity co-occurrence network to establish low-high centrality combinations to probe the crucial drugs found in article clustering that are not plainly apparent through the mere counting of the occurrence of drug entities occurrences. Lopinavir emerged as having possibly potent effects in spite of underuse, while the mainstream of studies focus more on drugs such as chloroquine that enjoy explicit consent.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and the occurrence and progression of VBD. METHODS: Sixty (60) cases without VBD and ischemia stroke were considered as Group A, 100 cases with VBD were further divided into Group B (VBD without ischemic stroke, n = 54) and Group C (VBD with first ever acute posterior circulation ischemic stroke, n = 46). Demographic data (such as gender and age) and past medical history (such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history) were collected. The levels of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hypersensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), homocysteine (HCY), uric acid (UA), fibrinogen (Fib), and Lp-PLA2, etc. were measured. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the related factors of VBD and ischemic stroke secondary to VBD. RESULTS: Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that only age and the level of serum Lp-PLA2 were significantly higher in group B than those in group A (P < 0.012, P < 0.001, respectively), however, only the level of serum Lp-PLA2 was significantly higher in group C than those in group B (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The serum marker Lp-PLA2 is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of VBD and the progression of VBD to posterior circulation ischemic stroke. Whether intervening on atherosclerosis could prevent the occurrence and development of VBD needs to be further studied.","Liu, Yuan; Zhu, Jinhua; Deng, Xuhui; Yang, Zhi; Chen, Chunchun; Huang, Shuxuan; Chen, Lue; Ma, Ying; Lin, Weifeng; Zhu, Feiqi",Neurol. sci,,338

498049,[Clinical Characteristics and Coping Strategies of Neoplasms with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection],2020,"BACKGROUND: Accurate prognostication is essential in caring for palliative patients. Various prognostication tools have been validated in many settings in the past few years. Biomarkers of inflammation (albumin and C-reactive protein) are combined to calculate the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which has been found to be a simple prognostic tool in this population. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study was to evaluate mGPS as a prognostication tool for cancer patients admitted to an acute hospital in regional Australia. METHODS: Adult cancer patients admitted to an acute Australian regional hospital during 2017 who had albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) tested were included. The mGPS was calculated based on their admission values and discharge values. Based on their score (0-2), groups were compared using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for prognostication. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and median survival time from admission and discharge were constructed. RESULTS: A total of 170 patient records were reviewed of which 95 had admission and discharge mGPS scores available for analysis. Of those, 86 had died at the time of data analysis. The median survival for admission mGPS 0, 1, 2 was 168,156 and 74 days. For discharge mGPS 0, 1, 2 medians were 168,119 and 70 days. On multi variate analysis admission mGPS 2 showed Hazard ratio of 2.29 (95% CI 1.16-4.56, p -0.02) and discharge mGPS 2 of 2.07 (95% CI 0.95-4.50, p value 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, mGPS was able to differentiate cancer patients into various prognostic groups. Further studies in regional acute hospitals could validate this prospectively with a multi-center larger sample size.","Lojanapiwat, Nuttaradee; Islam, Md Rafiqul; Ridout, Martin; Subramaniam, Sivakumar",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,338

499482,The Course of Mild and Moderate COVID-19 Infections-The Unexpected Long-Lasting Challenge,2020,"In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide. Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+â¼3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+â¼3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","Cheng, Yichun; Luo, Ran; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Zhixiang; Dong, Lei; Li, Junhua; Yao, Ying; Ge, Shuwang; Xu, Gang",Kidney Int,,338

To minimize exposure and because of limited personal protective equipment resources, most gastroenterology practices were curtailed/modified during the surge, with slow reopening to a normal/semi-normal schedule. Gastroenterology healthcare workers have been impacted greatly by COVID-19, resulting in job and wage insecurity. The aim of our study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on gastroenterology healthcare workers across the United States. A web-based survey, consisting of 40 questions, was disseminated among gastroenterology practices across the United States via en masse e-mails and direct contact by authors. In total, 223 gastroenterology healthcare workers completed the survey; 56.1% were from academic settings. COVID-19 impacted the work schedule of 85.2% of participants, with reduced weekly work hours (38.1%), duty reassignment (22.4%), and furlough (13.9%). Uncertainty about job and/or future wages/benefits after reopening was noted in 41%, which was significantly associated with the presence of physical (p = .021) and mental/emotional symptoms (p = .045). Worsening of pre-existing physical and/or mental/emotional conditions was observed in 53%. Inadequate personal protective equipment availability, lack of temporary housing and/or childcare facilities, as well as job insecurity appear to be the important factors leading to worsening physical/mental/emotional conditions among gastroenterology healthcare workers.","Keihanian, Tara; Sharma, Prateek; Sandhu, Dalbir S; Sussman, Daniel A; Tabibian, James H; Girotra, Mohit",Gastroenterol. nurs,,338

501574,518. Factors Associated with Severe COVID-19 among Patients Hospitalized in Rhode Island,2020,"Background: It is hypothesized that different levels of hormones especially serum testosterone level could explain the sex differences between men and women on the susceptibility and case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, traditional observational studies that support this hypothesis could not effectively establish the causal effects. Objective: Utilizing recently published genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) on serum Testosterone level and on COVID-19 related phenotypes, we sought to assess the causality through Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses. We further applied a suite of statistical genomics methods to further explore the biological mechanisms. Results: We found that testosterone level is significantly associated with Covid-19 critical illness. All six MR methods yielded significant associations. There is no significant association between Testosterone and COVID-19 respiratory failure or COVID-19 susceptibility. Conclusion: Based on the GWAS currently available, we provide support for a causal role of Testosterone on COVID-19 critical illness. Nevertheless, we recognize that the COVID-19 susceptibility GWAS effort is still ongoing and there is no such strong locus as CCR5 for HIV discovered for COVID-19.","Xiong, Juan; Ma, Ziyong; Miao, Ruicheng; Huang, Jie; Kong, Xue-Jun; Qu, Yifei; Yang, Xu",,,338
505532,Extracardiac imaging findings in COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,2021,"COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease responsible for over 800K deaths worldwide as of August 2020. The need for rapid testing is a high priority and alternative testing strategies including X-ray image classification are a promising area of research. However, at present, public datasets for COVID19 x-ray images have low data volumes, making it challenging to develop accurate image classifiers. Several recent papers have made use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to increase the training data volumes. But realistic synthetic COVID19 X-rays remain challenging to generate. We present a novel Mean Teacher + Transfer GAN (MTT-GAN) that generates COVID19 chest X-ray images of high quality. In order to create a more accurate GAN, we employ transfer learning from the Kaggle Pneumonia X-Ray dataset, a highly relevant data source orders of magnitude larger than public COVID19 datasets. Furthermore, we employ the Mean Teacher algorithm as a constraint to improve stability of training. Our qualitative analysis shows that the MTT-GAN generates X-ray images that are greatly superior to a baseline GAN and visually comparable to real X-rays. Although board-certified radiologists can distinguish MTT-GAN fakes from real COVID19 X-rays. Quantitative analysis shows that MTT-GAN greatly improves the accuracy of both a binary COVID19 classifier as well as a multi-class Pneumonia classifier as compared to a baseline GAN. Our classification accuracy is favourable as compared to recently reported results in the literature for similar binary and multi-class COVID19 screening tasks.","Menon, Sumeet; Galita, Joshua; Chapman, David; Gangopadhyay, Aryya; Mangalagiri, Jayalakshmi; Nguyen, Phuong; Yesha, Yaacov; Yesha, Yelena; Saboury, Babak; Maryland, Michael Morris University of; County, Baltimore; Center, National Institutes of Health Clinical; Health, Networking",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12478v1.pdf,338

Being associated with cough, fever, and respiratory distress, this disease caused more than 15 % mortality worldwide. Due to its vital role in virus replication, Mpro/3CLpro has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design. The current study focused on the inhibitory activity of Calotropin, a component from milk of Calotropis gigantean, against Mpro protein from SARS-CoV-2. Till date there is no work is undertaken on in-silico analysis of this compound against Mpro of COVID-19 protein. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using Patchdock tool. Protein Interactions tool was used for protein interactions. The calculated parameters such as docking score indicated effective binding of Calotropin to Mpro protein. Interactions results indicated that, Mpro/ Calotropin complexes forms hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, Calotropin may represent potential herbal treatment to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor.

506667,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A systematic review,2020,"Researches suggest that child abuse is related to a previous history of violence within the family setting and the evolution of the learning process. The current study was aimed to investigate the exposure of child abuse in the case of distance learning and its relationship to some variables of the social-cognitive processing among parents who potentially assaulted their children. The survey research method was applied. The questionnaire consisted of three blocks of questions: socio-demographic block, parents’ impressions of distance learning at school, violence, and parents’ aggression towards children. The sample included 308 primary school children’s parents from the Zakarpatska region (Ukraine). Results show that parents’ reaction to learning difficulties is not always constructive because most stressful situations provoke verbal aggression and physical violence towards the child. Distance learning and related difficulties have become a major factor in violent and aggressive behavior towards children during quarantine. Most parents who allowed maltreatment toward their children before pandemic COVID-19 also demonstrated it during distance learning. Our study found a link between parents’ use of physical violence and verbal aggression with the following variables: duration of lockdown, the function of the teacher in distance learning, parents’ assessment of the process and learning outcome, qualitative changes in the relationship between parents and children during quarantine. The study of violent situations against children during distance learning will provide an opportunity to develop effective preventive and corrective measures. The process of informing about situations of violence against children can have a psychoprophylactic effect. © 2021.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95% CI 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: P = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95% CI 2.86-3.40) for patients 20-39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95% CI 1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95% CI 1.12-1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI 0.98-1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.73-1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older.

Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR = 7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P = 0.027), eosinopenia (OR = 5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P = 0.049), and worse one-month outcome (OR = 8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.","Sun, Da-Wei; Zhang, Dong; Tian, Run-Hui; Li, Yang; Wang, Yu-Shi; Cao, Jie; Tang, Ying; Zhang, Nan; Zan, Tao; Gao, Lan; Huang, Yan-Zhu; Cui, Chang-Lei; Wang, Dong-Xuan; Zheng, Yang; Lv, Guo-Yue",Clin Chim Acta,,338

514753,Post COVID 19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an older adult,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision making are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared with: (1) nonpregnant controls and (2) natural coronavirus disease 2019 infection in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 nonpregnant women) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at 2 academic medical centers. Titers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike and receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin M were quantified in participant sera (n=131) and breastmilk (n=31) at baseline, at the second vaccine dose, at 2 to 6 weeks after the second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (n=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared with those of pregnant women 4 to 12 weeks from the natural infection (n=37) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Postvaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed-effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences among groups. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared with nonpregnant women (pregnant, median, 5.59; interquartile range, 4.68-5.89; lactating, median, 5.74; interquartile range, 5.06-6.22; nonpregnant, median, 5.62; interquartile range, 4.77-5.98, P=.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy (P<.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord than maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (maternal sera, median, 104.7; interquartile range, 61.2-188.2; cord sera, median, 52.3; interquartile range, 11.7-69.6; P=.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific immunoglobulin G, but not immunoglobulin A, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in nonpregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were statistically significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.","Gray, Kathryn J; Bordt, Evan A; Atyeo, Caroline; Deriso, Elizabeth; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Young, Nicola; Baez, Aranxta Medina; Shook, Lydia L; Cvrk, Dana; James, Kaitlyn; De Guzman, Rose; Brigida, Sara; Diouf, Khady; Goldfarb, Ilona; Bebell, Lisa M; Yonker, Lael M; Fasano, Alessio; Rabi, S Alireza; Elovitz, Michal A; Alter, Galit; Edlow, Andrea G",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,338

590927,Epstein-Barr Virus Coinfection in COVID-19,2021-08-25,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) spread throughout the world and become pandemic. To stop and control the rapid infection of COVID-19 lockdown is the best option. Sudden lockdown implies change in entire lifestyle of the population. Social isolation affects individual's lives by greater reduction in their physical activity, which might increase chance of infection by reducing the immunity. To what extent, the physical activity is reduced during this lockdown period among physiotherapy professionals and students who propagate physical activity is not known. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity level and energy utilization among physiotherapy professionals and students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and forty three volunteered physiotherapy professionals and students participated in web based open E-survey. The survey was carried out by sending the Google Forms link for International Physical activity questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) through social networking sites using Google forms, to gather amount of PA before and during COVID-19 lockdown period and analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Among identified 261 potential survey participants, 143 responded reaching response rate of 54.8%. Total physical activity before and during COVID–19 lockdown period were 7809.7 (3849.7–11769.8) MET-min/week and 4135.7 (867.2–7404.1) MET-min/week; p < 0.0001. While energy expenditure before and during COVID–19 lockdown period were 8189.8 (4242.1–12137.6) kcal/wk and 4221.7 (1004.6–7438.8) kcal/wk; p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in self-report PA levels were observed among physiotherapy professionals and students were observed during COVID–19 lockdown period.","Srivastav, Adarsh Kumar; Sharma, Neha; Samuel, Asir John",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838062/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420301731?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420301731,338

Alpha-carbonic anhydrases (α-CAs) have been identified as suitable sequestration agents. This study reports the sequence and structural analysis of 15 α-CAs from bacteria, originating from hydrothermal vent systems. Structural analysis of the multimers enabled the identification of hotspot and interface residues. Molecular dynamics simulations of the homo-multimers were performed at 300 K, 363 K, 393 K and 423 K to unearth potentially thermostable α-CAs. Average betweenness centrality (BC) calculations confirmed the relevance of some hotspot and interface residues. The key residues responsible for dimer thermostability were identified by comparing fluctuating interfaces with stable ones, and were part of conserved motifs. Crucial long-lived hydrogen bond networks were observed around residues with high BC values. Dynamic cross correlation fortified the relevance of oligomerization of these proteins, thus the importance of simulating them in their multimeric forms. A consensus of the simulation analyses used in this study suggested high thermostability for the α-CA from Nitratiruptor tergarcus. Overall, our novel findings enhance the potential of biotechnology applications through the discovery of alternative thermostable CO(2) sequestration agents and their potential protein design.","Manyumwa, Colleen Varaidzo; Emameh, Reza Zolfaghari; Tastan Bishop, Özlem",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138066/,338

These two questions – chosen among others – were those of the unity of the medical ethics and of the specific nature of the pharmacist's ethics. The answers to these questions were deeply changed in meaning and value after the events we experienced. When reality intrudes, it does not only change practices but it equally changes theory. The questions formerly asked continue to be asked, but a certain number of solutions have been discredited among those that we thought should be taken into account: a certain bureaucracy, in one case, to resolve illusory questions of ethical efficiency; a vague metaphysics of morals in the other, to believe that the distinction between a drug and a commodity can be fulfilled cheaply. A reading of Kierkegaard appeared to us like a salutary issue in the first case; whereas ethical and political research about pharmaceutical matters seemed to be absolutely urgent to our eyes, in the second case.","Cléro, J.-P.",Ethics Med Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352552520301262; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552520301262,338

At the same time, there is an overall lack of U.S. state-specific surveillance data tracking social determinants of health (SDOH) and associations with population well-being, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic in populations. Statewide data can offer important insights into how SDOH shape the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the population since implementation of many policies and programs varied widely early on in the pandemic. In May of 2020, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program launched a statewide online/phone survey of early and ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on health and well-being across diverse communities and families. The goal of this study is to provide descriptive data including perceived COVID-19 risks, access to and results of COVID-19 antigen testing, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic on health and mental health in populations. Key findings include higher rates of testing and perceived past infection from COVID-19 among non-white respondents. Higher economic shifts and job changes in female vs male respondents. Families with children reported overall higher levels of stress, and stress from the pandemic. There were urban and rural differences in changes to access to care. Rural regions, which had a lower prevalence of infections early in the pandemic as compared to urban areas, also reported fewer delays or missed appointments due to COVID-19. Key findings show that SDOH are shaping impacts of health and well-being early on in the pandemic and future longitudinal follow-up will be important to shape policies and programs well into the future.","Malecki, K.

This delay may lead to a more severe clinical condition at presentation with possible complications for the patients. Material and methods Retrospective review of data collected from three institutions from Spain and Italy. Patients who presented to Emergency Department with unilateral or bilateral renal colic caused by imaging confirmed urolithiasis during the 45 days before and after each national lockdown were included. Data collected included patients’ demographics, biochemical urine and blood tests, radiological tests, signs, symptoms and the therapeutic management. Analysis was performed between two groups, Group A: patients presenting prior to the national lockdown date; and Group B: patients presenting after the national lockdown date. Results A total of 397 patients presented to Emergency Department with radiology confirmed urolithiasis and were included in the study. The number of patients presenting to Emergency Department with renal/ureteric colic was 285 (71.8%) patients in Group A and 112 (28.2%) patients in Group B (p<0.001). The number of patients reporting a delay in presentation was 135 (47.4%) in Group A and 63 (56.3%) in Group B (p=0.11). At presentation, there were no statistical differences between Group A and Group B regarding the serum creatinine level, C reactive protein, white blood cell count, fever, oliguria, flank pain and hydronephrosis. In addition, no significant differences were observed with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy. Conclusion Data from our study showed a significant reduction in presentations to Emergency Department for renal colic after the lockdown in Spain and Italy. However, we did not find any significant difference with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy.","Carrion, D.

While neutralization has been linked to protection against other pathogens, whether neutralization alone will be sufficient to drive protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the broader population remains unclear. Therefore, to fully define protective humoral immunity we dissected the early evolution of the humoral response in 193 hospitalized individuals ranging from moderate-to severe. Although robust IgM and IgA responses evolved in both survivors and non-survivors with severe disease, non-survivors showed attenuated IgG responses, accompanied by compromised Fcɣ-receptor binding and Fc-effector activity, pointing to deficient humoral development rather than disease-enhancing humoral immunity. In contrast, individuals with moderate disease exhibited delayed responses that ultimately matured. These data highlight distinct humoral trajectories associated with resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for early functional humoral immunity.","Zohar, Tomer; Loos, Carolin; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Wang, Chuangqi; Slein, Matthew D.; Burke, John; Yu, Jingyou; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake Marie; Caradonna, Tim; Schmidt, Aaron; Cai, Yongfei; Streeck, Hendrik; Ryan, Edward T.; Barouch, Dan H.; Charles, Richelle C.; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Alter, Galit",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420314598; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420314598?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207184/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.052,338

METHODS: Temporal bone computed tomography images of 36 patients diagnosed with cochlear hypoplasia between 2010 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with those of 40 controls without sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS: Basal turn length and mid-modiolar height were significantly lower in the cochlear hypoplasia patients with subtypes I, II and III than in the control group (p < 0.001). Mid-scalar length was significantly shorter in subtype I-III patients as compared with the control group (p < 0.001). In addition, cochlear canal length (measured along the lateral wall) was significantly shorter in subtype I-IV patients than in the control group (subtypes I-III, p < 0.001; subtype IV, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Cochlear hypoplasia should be considered if basal turn length is less than 7.5 mm and mid-modiolar height is less than 3.42 mm. The cochlear implant should be selected according to cochlear hypoplasia subgroup. It is critically important to differentiate subtype II from incomplete partition type I and subtype III from a normal cochlea, to ensure the most appropriate implant electrode selection so as to optimise cochlear implantation outcomes.","Pamuk, G; Pamuk, A E; Akgöz, A; Bajin, M D; Özgen, B; Sennaroglu, L",J Laryngol Otol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843508/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022215121000979,338

We performed a cohort study examining the association between obesity and risk of serious infections in biologic-treated patients with IBD. METHODS: Using an administrative claims database, in a cohort of biologic-treated patients with IBD between 2014 and 2018 with follow-up 1 year before and after treatment initiation, we compared the risk of serious infections (infections requiring hospitalization) between obese vs nonobese patients (based on validated administrative claims) using Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: We included 5,987 biologic-treated patients with IBD (4,881 on tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists and 1,106 on vedolizumab), of whom 524 (8.8%) were classified as obese. Of the 7,115 person-year follow-up, 520 patients developed serious infection. Risk of serious infection was comparable in obese vs nonobese patients (8.8% vs 8.5%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.54). After adjusting for age, comorbidities, disease characteristics, health care utilization, use of corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and opiates, obesity was not associated with an increased risk of serious infection (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% confidence interval, 0.55–1.01]). Similar results were seen on stratified analysis by disease phenotype (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and index biologic therapy (tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists and vedolizumab).

Through targeted recombination and reverse genetic manipulation, studies of infection with MHV-JHM variants have identified phenotypic differences and examined the effects of these differences on viral pathogenesis and anti-viral host immune responses. Studies employing recombinant viruses with a modified spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV-JHM have identified the S gene as a major determinant of neurovirulence. However, the association of S gene variation and neurovirulence with host ability to generate anti-viral CD8 T cell responses is not completely clear. Partially protective anti-viral immune responses may result in persistent infection and chronic demyelinating disease characterized by myelin removal from axons of the CNS and associated with dense macrophage/microglial infiltration. Demyelinating disease during MHV-JHM infection is immune-mediated, as mice that lack T lymphocytes fail to develop disease despite succumbing to encephalitis with high levels of infectious virus in the CNS. However, the presence of T lymphocytes or anti-viral antibody can induce disease in infected immunodeficient mice. The mechanisms by which these immune effectors induce demyelination share an ability to activate and recruit macrophages and microglia, thus increasing the putative role of these cells in myelin destruction.","Templeton, Steven P.; Perlman, Stanley",Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917063/,338

Here, we analyse the emergence and outbreak trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh using these new data streams, and identify mass population movements as a key early event driving the ongoing epidemic. Methods We sequenced complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (March-July 2020) and combined this dataset with 324 genomes from Bangladesh. For phylogenetic context, we also used 68,000 GISAID genomes collected globally. We paired this genomic data with population mobility information from Facebook and three mobile phone operators. Findings The majority (85%) of the Bangladeshi sequenced isolates fall into either pangolin lineage B.1.36 (8%), B.1.1 (19%) or B.1.1.25 (58%). Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted SARS-COV-2 first appeared in mid-February, through international introductions. The first case was reported on March 8th. This pattern of repeated international introduction changed at the end of March when three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity across Bangladesh is reflected in the mobility data which shows the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka and the rest of the country during the following months. Interpretation In Bangladesh, population mobility out of Dhaka as well as frequent travel from urban hotspots to rural areas resulted in rapid country-wide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. The strains in Bangladesh reflect the local expansion of global lineages introduced early from international travellers to and from major international travel hubs. Importantly, the Bangladeshi context is consistent with epidemiologic and phylogenetic findings globally. Bangladesh is one of the few countries in the world with a rich history of conducting mass vaccination campaigns under complex circumstances. Combining genomics and these new data streams should allow population movements to be modelled and anticipated rendering Bangladesh extremely well prepared to immunize citizens rapidly. Based on our genomics data and the country's successful immunization history, vaccines becoming available globally will be suitable for implementation in Bangladesh while ongoing genomic surveillance is conducted to monitor for new variants of the virus.","Cowley, L.

610512,Isolated Right Ventricular Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy Causing Pulmonary Embolism,2021-06-13,"Abstract The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), JHM strain, induces a biphasic retinal disease in adult BALB/c mice. In the early phase, Day 1 to Day 7, a retinal vasculitis is noted which is associated with the presence of viral proteins and infectious virus. In the late phase, Day 10 to Day 140, a retinal degeneration is associated with the absence of viral proteins, infectious virus, and inflammatory cells. The purpose of this study was to determine if viral RNA persists within the retina during the retinal degenerative phase of the disease. BALB/c mice were inoculated by the intravitreal route with 104.0TCID50/5 μl of virus. The presence of viral RNA was detected byin situhybridization with a viral cDNA probe and viral proteins were identified by immunocytochemical staining. During the acute phase of the infection, viral RNA was found in the retina, RPE, ciliary body epithelium, and the iris epithelium. During the late phase of the infection, viral RNA was almost exclusively found within the retina and RPE and not in the anterior segment of the eye. Within the retina, viral RNA was detected in the ganglion cell layer, the inner retina, the outer retina, and the RPE cell. Immunocytochemical staining identified viral protein within the retina only from Day 1 to Day 8. This ocular disease was also associated with a persistent systemic infection. Both viral RNA and viral proteins were identified within the liver during the first 8 days. However, only viral RNA was detected in the liver from Day 8 to Day 60. These studies demonstrate that MHV established an acute infection (Day 1–8) where infectious virus and viral proteins were identified. This was followed by a persistent infection within the retina and liver where only viral RNA were detected byin situhybridization.","Komurasaki, Yusuke; Nagineni, Chandrasekharam N.; Wang, Yun; Hooks, John J.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296904420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806529/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296904420,338
611575,Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Remain Essential to Reducing Coronavirus Disease 2019 Burden Even in a Well-Vaccinated Society: A Modeling Study,2021-08-09,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of animals and birds. Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors.

Advantages and disadvantages,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: We determined the clinical presentation, risk factors, and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and identified if these are different based on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We included all observational studies on pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 reporting clinical presentation, risk factors, and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We included all studies published between Dec/2019-Feb/2021 in Medline, Embase, the WHO COVID-19 databases, and clinicaltrials.gov. The methodological quality of cohort and case-series was assessed using NHLBI criteria. RESULTS: 31 016 pregnant women from 62 studies were included. Women were an average of 30.9 years of age, most (77.7%) were in the third trimester, and 16.4% developed severe COVID-19. Nearly half were asymptomatic, while the most commonly reported symptoms were cough, fever, fatigue, and anosmia/ageusia. About 7% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 8% required mechanical ventilation, and 2% of the women died. Almost 80% of women delivered; 48.4% had cesarean births. Among newborns, 23.4% were preterm (<37 weeks), 16.6% were low birth weight, and 23.7% were admitted to neonatal ICU. A total of 21 stillbirths (1.6%) and 24 neonatal deaths (1.6%) were recorded, while 50 babies (3.5%) were COVID-19 positive. Studies comparing pregnant women with severe and non-severe COVID-19 showed that women with severe COVID-19 were 3.7 years older and the risk of severe COVID-19 was 1.5 times higher among women >35 years. The risk of severe COVID-19 was significantly higher among women who were obese, had smoked, diabetic, and had pre-eclampsia. The risk of preterm birth was almost 2.4 folds among women with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests a heightened risk of COVID-19 severity and adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes among women with certain demographic and health profiles. These findings can inform the formation of current guidelines; however, these should be constantly updated as the global COVID-19 scenario unfolds.

613913,Letter to the Editor: Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with respiratory viruses.,2020-11-27,"Cancer immunotherapy has made remarkable clinical advances in recent years. Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) based on ex vivo expanded peripheral CTLs, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), gene-engineered TCR- and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have all shown durable clinical efficacies in multiple types of cancers. However, these immunotherapeutic approaches only benefit a small fraction of cancer patients as various immune resistance mechanisms and limitations make their effective use a challenge in the majority of cancer patients. For example, adaptive resistance to therapeutic PD-1 blockade is associated with an upregulation of some additional immune checkpoint receptors. The efficacy of transferred tumor-specific T cells under the current clinical ACT protocol is often limited by their inefficient engraftment, poor persistence, and weak capability to attack tumor cells. Recent studies demonstrate that the complement receptor C3aR and C5aR function as a new class of immune checkpoint receptors. Complement signaling through C3aR and C5aR expressed on effector T lymphocytes prevent the production of the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Removing C3aR/C5aR-mediated transcriptional suppression of IL-10 expression results in endogenous IL-10 production by antitumor effector T cells, which drives T cell expansion and enhances T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Importantly, preclinical, and clinical data suggest that a signaling axis consisting of complement/C3aR/C5aR/IL-10 critically regulates T cell mediated antitumor immunity and manipulation of the pathway ex vivo and in vivo is an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, a combination of treatment strategies targeting the complement/C3aR/C5aR/IL-10 pathway with other treatment modalities may improve cancer therapeutic efficacy.","Wang, Yu; Zhang, Hui; He, You-Wen",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379815/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01574,338

617271,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in South Africa,2020-08-21,"To achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, it is crucial to know the drivers of vaccination intention and, thereby, vaccination. As the determinants of vaccination differ across vaccines, target groups and contexts, we investigate COVID-19 vaccination intention using data from university students from three countries, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal. We investigate the psychological drivers of vaccination intention using the 5C model as mediator. This model includes five antecedents of vaccination: Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Calculation and Collective Responsibility. First, we show that the majority of students have a positive propensity toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19, though only 41% of students are completely acceptant. Second, using the 5C model, we show that ‘Confidence’ (β = 0.33, SE = 03, p < .001) and ‘Collective Responsibility’ (β = 0.35, SE = 04, p < .001) are most strongly related to students’ COVID-19 vaccination intention. Using mediation analyses, we show that the perceived risk and effectiveness of the vaccine as well as trust in the government and health authorities indirectly relate to vaccination intention through ‘Confidence’. The perceived risk of COVID-19 for one’s social circle and altruism, the need to belong and psychopathy traits indirectly relate to vaccination intention through ‘Collective Responsibility’. Hence, targeting the psychological characteristics associated with ‘Confidence’ and ‘Collective Responsibility’ can improve the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns among students.","Wismans, Annelot; Thurik, Roy; Baptista, Rui; Dejardin, Marcus; Janssen, Frank; Franken, Ingmar",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379648/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255382,338

618354,Presenting characteristics and outcomes of migrants in a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Does the origin matter?,2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a global health issue. There are a number of evidence-based practices for suicide screening, assessment, and intervention that are not routinely deployed in usual care settings. The goal of this study is to develop and test implementation strategies to facilitate evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention in two settings where individuals at risk for suicide are especially likely to present: primary care and specialty mental health care. We will leverage methods from behavioral economics, which involves understanding the many factors that influence human decision making, to inform strategy development. METHODS: We will identify key mechanisms that limit implementation of evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health through contextual inquiry involving behavioral health and primary care clinicians. Second, we will use contextual inquiry results to systematically design a menu of behavioral economics-informed implementation strategies that cut across settings, in collaboration with an advisory board composed of key stakeholders (i.e., behavioral economists, clinicians, implementation scientists, and suicide prevention experts). Finally, we will conduct rapid-cycle trials to test and refine the menu of implementation strategies. Primary outcomes include clinician-reported feasibility and acceptability of the implementation strategies. DISCUSSION: Findings will elucidate ways to address common and unique barriers to evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health care.

The global economy has begun to show major disruptions and is heading toward a severe recession with an unprecedented economic crisis. As the global economy is highly integrated and interdependent through the global supply chains, it has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although all countries have faced difficulties due to Covid-19, South Asian countries in particular have had to deal with a more challenging situation due to their large population, weak health facilities, high poverty rates, low socio-economic conditions, poor social protection systems, limited access to water and sanitation, and inadequate living space, necessary to maintain physical distancing and take other required measures to contain this pandemic. To contain the spread of the virus, South Asian countries have imposed stringent lockdowns, which have consequently affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the region, where a third of world’s poor live. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the existing and prospective impacts, risks and challenges of Covid-19 on key social and economic sectors including migration, tourism, informal sector, agriculture and rural livelihoods. The analysis revealed that COVID-19 is likely to affect economic growth, increase fiscal deficit and monetary burden, increase the risks of macroeconomic instability, decrease migration and remittance, reduce income from travel and tourism, and result in dwindling micro-small and medium industries and informal businesses. This is likely to deepen poverty and increase unemployment and the risks of hunger and food insecurity. If not addressed properly, this may reinforce existing inequalities, break social harmony, and increase tension and turbulence. The economic and social costs of the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore likely to be significant and long-lasting in South Asia.","Rasul, Golam; Nepal, Apsara Karki; Hussain, Abid; Maharjan, Amina; Joshi, Surendra; Lama, Anu; Gurung, Prakriti; Ahmad, Farid; Mishra, Arabinda; Sharma, Eklabya",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869579/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.629693,338

Among this, cell-based therapy is focused on moderate to severe phases of COVID-19, and there have been promising outcomes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their pro/anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory behavior, Natural Killer (NK) cells thanks to their capacity of lysing virus-infected cells and regulate the resulting immune response, Dendritic cells thanks to immunotherapy and cell-based vaccine engineering, SARS-CoV2-specific T cells due to stimulate and promote the immune system and MSC-derived exosomes because of cell-free therapy and beneficial manufacturing aspects, hold great promises for cell-based therapy applications for treating COVID-19 and similar viral infections. Moreover, recently, an innovative approach to COVID-19 based on engineered human MSC has been introduced, which is continuously evacuated and degraded by the body’s immune system during the antigen recognition process. However, the economic situation of governments and nations, and the cost of therapeutics influence the clinical approaches to manage and exit from this pandemic. This summary describes cell-based clinical trials and the cost-utility aspects of cell therapy. In this regard, limited clinical studies have been reported; while, several clinical trials have been approved for starting phases 2 and 3 of their trials for treating COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regarding the cost of cell therapy, many believe that the high cost of cell-based therapy will decrease substantially. Hence, there are hopes that cellular therapy can be approved soon for the treatment of viral diseases such as COVID-19.

Zoonotic foodborne transmission from pigs and feral animals such as wild boar is of increasing importance in the rapidly industrializing countries of the Asia Pacific region.

624229,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): The good, the bad and the ugly!",2021-02-04,"Summary Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an optional prescription status that has resulted in frequent use, in particular for the symptomatic treatment of fever and non-rheumatic pain. In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate. In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.","Micallef, Joëlle; Soeiro, Thomas; Annie-Pierre, Jonville‐Béra",Therapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418728/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300925; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300925?v=s5,338

Social robots, including robotic pets, are promising technological interventions that can benefit the psychosocial health of older adults and people with dementia. However, issues such as high costs can lead to a lack of equal access and concerns about infection control. Although there are previous reviews on the use of robotic pets for older adults and people with dementia, none have included or had a focus on low-cost and familiarly and realistically designed pet robots. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to synthesize evidence on the delivery and impact of low-cost, familiarly and realistically designed interactive robotic pets for older adults and people with dementia. METHODS: The Arksey and O’Malley framework was used to guide this review. First, the research question was identified. Second, searches were conducted on five electronic databases and Google Scholar. Studies were selected using a two-phase screening process, where two reviewers independently screened and extracted data using a standardized data extraction form. Finally, the results were discussed, categorized, and presented narratively. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in the review. Positive impacts related to several psychosocial domains, including mood and affect, communication and social interaction, companionship, and other well-being outcomes. Issues and concerns associated with its use included misperceptions of the robotic pets as a live animal, ethical issues of attachment, negative reactions by users, and other pragmatic concerns such as hygiene and cost. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings resonate with previous studies that investigated the effectiveness of other social robots, demonstrating the promise of these low-cost robotic pets in addressing the psychosocial needs of older adults and people with dementia. The affordability of these robotic pets appeared to influence the practicalities of real-world use, such as intervention delivery and infection control, which are especially relevant in light of COVID-19.

PEEP ≥ 16 cm H(2)O for obese patients and PEEP ≥10 cm H(2)O for non-obese patients were necessary to obtain positive expiratory P(L). Change of PEEP did not alter significantly ΔP(L) or elastances in obese patients. However, in non-obese patients lung EL and ΔP(L) increased significantly with PEEP increase. Chest wall EL was not affected by PEEP variations in both groups.","Mezidi, Mehdi; Daviet, Florence; Chabert, Paul; Hraiech, Sami; Bitker, Laurent; Forel, Jean-Marie; Yonis, Hodane; Gragueb, Ines; Dhelft, Francois; Papazian, Laurent; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Guervilly, Christophe",Ann Intensive Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00745-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001320/,338
631883,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS‐C) Related to COVID‐19: A New York City Experience,2020-06-25,"The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the psychological well-being of many people. This study examined the relationship between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) and coping strategies adopted by undergraduate students in Ghana. A sample of 209 students were recruited to complete online surveys on fear of COVID-19, psychological distress and coping strategies between June and July 2020. Students scored between normal to mild levels of psychological distress but above average scores on fear of coronavirus (M = 19.45, SD = 6.04). Fear of COVID-19 was positively related to psychological distress. Only maladaptive coping was found to be significantly and positively associated with fear of COVID-19. However post-hoc analysis of the components of coping strategies revealed that denial (β = .17, p = .028), venting (β = .18, p = .036) and humour (β = −.18, p = .023; an adaptive coping strategy) were associated with fear of COVID-19. Finally, both adaptive coping and maladaptive coping strategies had a mediating effect on fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress. These findings emphasize the need to design and optimize institutional interventions that will assess psychological distress and fear of COVID-19 levels during this pandemic and provide psychotherapeutic support for students as they return to school.","Oti-Boadi, Mabel; Malm, Esther; Dey, Nutifafa Eugene Yaw; Oppong, Stephen",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02267-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511860/,338

The compounds were assayed by the disc diffusion method for anti-bacterial against five pathogenic bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and E. coli). All prepared Schiff bases showed good activity compared to positive control (streptomycin), Moreover the L(3)H showed the highest activity against S. aureus, and M. luteus than the other compounds and streptomycin. In additional molecular docking studies with 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), the essential enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. The rest of compounds have shown promising results as 3CLpro inhibitors interacting with the active sites of the enzymes. Finally, DFT 's estimated electrostatic molecular potential results were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that L(3)H has the highest dipole moment and electrophilicity index. Interestingly, L(2)H of the largest energy gap ∆E = 2.49 eV, there are several hydrophilic interactions that could facilitate the binding with the receptors.

632260,Varying Presentations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporarily Associated with COVID-19,2020-11-23,"INTRODUCTION: This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. RESULTS: A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A + B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was €177.00 (N = 131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type. The administration of a vaccine containing influenza A and B types to children below 15 years of age might reduce the overall burden of the illness.","Ortiz-Lana, Naiara; Garrote, Elisa; Arístegui, Javier; Rementeria, Joseba; García-Martínez, Juan-Antonio; McCoig, Cynthia; García-Corbeira, Pilar; Devadiga, Raghavendra; Tafalla, Mónica",An Pediatr (Barc),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28363360/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403316303381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403316303381; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2016.10.016,338

638372,In-Hospital 30-Day Survival Among Young Adults with COVID-19: A Cohort Study,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of different prophylactic anticoagulation regimens among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. We pooled evidence from available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to provide insights on this topic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched for RCTs comparing treatment with an escalated-dose (intermediate-dose or therapeutic-dose) vs. a standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation regimen in critically and non-critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization and without a formal indication for anticoagulation. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause death, and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Seven RCTs were identified, including 5154 patients followed on an average of 33 days. Compared to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, escalated-dose prophylactic anticoagulation was not associated with a reduction of all-cause death [17.8% vs. 18.6%; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–1.18] but was associated with an increase in major bleeding (2.4% vs. 1.4%; RR 1.73, 95%CI 1.15–2.60). Compared to prophylactic anticoagulation used at a standard dose, an escalated dose was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism (2.5% vs. 4.7%; RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.41–0.74) without a significant effect on myocardial infarction (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.47–1.36), stroke (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.43–2.09), or systemic arterial embolism (RR 1.20, 95%CI 0.29–4.95). There were no significant interactions in the subgroup analysis for critically and non-critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide comprehensive and high-quality evidence for the use of standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation over an escalated-dose regimen as routine standard of care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who do not have an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation, irrespective of disease severity.

639331,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C):: An Emerging Immune Mediated Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19,2020-07-01,"Given the volume of research and discussion on the health, medical, economic, financial, political, and travel advisory aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, it is essential to enquire if an outbreak of the epidemic might have been anticipated, given the well-documented history of SARS and MERS, among other infectious diseases. If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244–0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186–0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects. The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used.","Chang, Chia-Lin; McAleer, Michael",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370069/,338

Consequently, pulmonary embolism is a recognized complication of COVID-19. Currently, the need for Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) relies on the Wells score and serum D-dimer levels. However, since COVID-19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population. We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID-19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis. Patients’ age and gender, CTPA results, and associated D-dimer levels were entered in a database. The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and an area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) measured. RESULTS: Of 459 patients with COVID-19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 (19%) had evidence of pulmonary embolism. Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above four points, and serum D-dimer levels five times above age-adjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism. However, only 33% of patients with PE had a Wells score of four points or higher. The AUC/ROC showed non-discriminating values (0.54) CONCLUSION: While a Wells score of four or more points predicted pulmonary embolism in our cohort, the outcome can be present even with lower scores.","Kirsch, Brittany; Aziz, Moez; Kumar, Sungita; Burke, Michael; Webster, Tyler; Immadi, Amrutha; Sam, Maurine; Lal, Aditya; Estrada-Y-Martin, Rosa M; Cherian, Sujith; Aisenberg, Gabriel Marcelo",Am J Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.10.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316254/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320311086?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934320311086,338
644437,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to COVID-19: a systematic review,2021-02-18,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges to current diagnostic and therapeutic patient care pathways including whether new in vitro diagnostic tests can accurately identify and rule out current SARS-CoV-2 infection. The gold standard diagnostic test to identify a current SARS-CoV-2 infection is a central laboratory-based molecular assay using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with very high accuracy of detection but which typically requires 1-2 days turn-around for results. Therefore, rapid RTPCR assays and systems have been developed which can be deployed locally (near-patient or point of care (POC), provide faster results and not impact on already stressed central laboratory capacity. Rapid test results can be returned within the same clinical encounter, facilitating timely decisions that optimise the patient care pathway and support more rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, isolation and contract tracing activities. Direct-to-PCR is an evolution of RT-PCR in which the patient sample is added directly to an amplification reaction without being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction, purification, or quantification to reduce the time and monetary resources required to process samples. Rapid, direct-to-PCR systems further increase the speed of testing by combining rapid PCR instruments with direct-to-PCR assays, to generate results in less than two hours. This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In total, 10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text reports and/or supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 datasets with 4593 patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis. The overall agreement between the rapid direct RT-PCR and gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR was 97.1% with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohens kappa statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results indicate that direct-to-PCR assays can perform equivalently to the standard centralised laboratory PCR systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of rapid direct-to-PCR assays and systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital, care home and medical research population in England from November 2020 to April 2021. Search methods: Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on the 30th of April 2020. Please see the PRISMA flow diagram below (figure 2). Selection criteria: Studies of subjects with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection were included. Commercially available and research use rapid direct-to-PCR assays (without RNA extraction and purification reporting results within two hours) were included in the study. Data collection, extraction and analysis: Studies were screened independently, in duplicate with any disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability were undertaken independently in duplicate. Where studies were not publicly available, sites that undertook in-service evaluations of rapid direct-to-PCR system were contacted and asked to supply anonymised datasets. Both reviewers independently performed data extraction and verification and calculated 2x2 contingency tables of the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives. They resolved any disagreements by discussion and by review with the third reviewer. Main results: Twenty study cohorts were included (described in 14 study reports, including 4 unpublished reports), reporting results for 4593 samples (1391 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe and North America, and evaluated nine direct-to-PCR assays. Conclusions: This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

646226,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in an Adult,2021-04-08,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize maternal immune response after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and quantify the efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 infection at any point in pregnancy and collected paired maternal and cord blood samples at the time of delivery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays were performed to measure maternal plasma and cord blood concentrations and neutralizing potency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Differences in concentrations according to symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infection and time from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result to delivery were analyzed using nonparametric tests of significance. The ratio of cord to maternal anti–receptor-binding domain IgG titers was analyzed to assess transplacental transfer efficiency. RESULTS: Thirty-two paired samples were analyzed. Detectable anti–receptor-binding domain IgG was detected in 100% (n=32) of maternal and 91% (n=29) of cord blood samples. Functional neutralizing antibody was present in 94% (n=30) of the maternal and 25% (n=8) of cord blood samples. Symptomatic infection was associated with a significant difference in median (interquartile range) maternal anti–receptor-binding domain IgG titers compared with asymptomatic infection (log 3.2 [3.5–2.4] vs log 2.7 [2.9–1.4], P=.03). Median (interquartile range) maternal anti–receptor-binding domain IgG titers were not significantly higher in patients who delivered more than 14 days after a positive PCR test result compared with those who delivered within 14 days (log 3.3 [3.5–2.4] vs log 2.67 [2.8–1.6], P=.05). Median (range) cord/maternal antibody ratio was 0.81 (0.67–0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate robust maternal neutralizing and anti–receptor-binding domain IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet a lower-than-expected efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer and a significant reduction in neutralization between maternal blood and cord blood. Maternal infection does confer some degree of neonatal antibody protection, but the robustness and durability of protection require further study.","Joseph, Naima T.; Dude, Carolynn M.; Verkerke, Hans P.; Irby, Les’Shon S.; Dunlop, Anne L.; Patel, Ravi M.; Easley, Kirk A.; Smith, Alicia K.; Stowell, Sean R.; Jamieson, Denise J.; Velu, Vijayakumar; Badell, Martina L.",Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910220/,338

While telehealth has been widely utilized since and has played a vital role in burn care overall, adaptation of platform has been minimal amongst burn therapists. As more hospital systems integrate telehealth as a service delivery mode, there is a need for guidelines on how to capture data collection and recommended documentation language which indicates progress and justifies therapy. METHODS: The following virtual visit documentation and objective data collection guidance form was created in an effort to capture ability, disabilities, limitations and barriers of the burn survivor participating in the burn rehabilitative virtual visits. The guidance form is intended to demonstrate examples of data collection can be captured in the virtual environment along with pointers to enhance the experience and recommended documentation language. It is not all inclusive, nor are all the tests listed necessarily required for a successful virtual interaction. (Attachment A) RESULTS: Despite the inability to perform formal standardized objective measurements, a burn therapist is still able to measure and document gains and losses. Posture, gait, range of motion, skin integrity, strength, motor control, body mechanics, coordination, adl’s, functional mobility, transfers are a few of the many categories which a burn therapist can focus their documentation. CONCLUSIONS: When appropriately administered and thoroughly documented telehealth can not only provide quality care to burn survivors but also demonstrate gains to optimal outcome goals and return to baseline levels of independence with ADLs, IADL’s, mobility, transfers, range of motion, strength and sensation.","Siwy, Katherine G",J Burn Care Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/irab032.296,338

A cross-sectional study was performed on 102 exhaled breath samples, 42 with COVID-19, 30 with the post-COVID syndrome and 30 control subjects. Breath-print analysis was performed by the Cyranose 320 electronic nose with 32 sensors. Group data were evaluated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the test's diagnostic power was evaluated through a Receiver Operaring Characteristic curve(ROC curve). The results of the chemometric analysis indicate in the PCA a 97.6% (PC(1) = 95.9%, PC(2) = 1.0%, PC(3) = 0.7%) of explanation of the variability between the groups by means of 3 PCs, the CDA presents a 100% of correct classification of the study groups, SVM a 99.4% of correct classification, finally the PLS-DA indicates an observable separation between the groups and the 12 sensors that were related. The sensitivity, specificity of post-COVID vs. controls value reached 97.6% (87.4%–99.9%) and 100% (88.4%–100%) respectively, according to the ROC curve. As a perspective, we consider that this technology, due to its simplicity, low cost and portability, can support strategies for the identification and follow-up of post-COVID patients. The proposed classification model provides the basis for evaluating post-COVID patients; therefore, further studies are required to enable the implementation of this technology to support clinical management and mitigation of effects.","Zamora-Mendoza, Blanca Nohemí; Díaz de León-Martínez, Lorena; Rodríguez-Aguilar, Maribel; Mizaikoff, Boris; Flores-Ramírez, Rogelio",Talanta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122832; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914021007530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635222/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914021007530?v=s5,338
647799,Sinus bradycardia in a toddler with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19,2021-05-11,"School-aged youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic will likely have long-standing effects on the well-being of youth, and access to mental health care is even more critical during this time. For the past 5 years, TRAILS (Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students) has been working throughout the state to increase utilization of evidence-based mental health practices among K-12 school mental health professionals (SMHPs). By leveraging SMHPs who are widely accessible to students, TRAILS seeks to improve youth access to effective mental health care and reduce current mental health inequities. In March 2020, TRAILS responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a group manual designed to be delivered virtually by SMHPs to help students develop effective coping skills to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. TRAILS focuses on promoting use of CBT and mindfulness, as these skills are ideally suited for school-based delivery, and thus the new manual, Coping with COVID-19 (CC-19), was grounded in these modalities. This article will describe the design, development, and deployment of the CC-19 program to address the mental health needs of students in the context of the pandemic. Early acceptability and penetration data will also be discussed.","Rodriguez-Quintana, Natalie; Meyer, Allison E.; Bilek, Emily; Flumenbaum, Rochelle; Miner, Kristen; Scoville, Lynne; Warner, Kelly; Koschmann, Elizabeth",Cogn Behav Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1077722921000468; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077722921000468?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850413/,338

While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the ""German Corona Consensus Dataset"" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data. Methods: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. Results: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined. Conclusion: GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.","Sass, J.; Bartschke, A.; Lehne, M.; Essenwanger, A.; Rinaldi, E.; Rudolph, S.; Heitmann, K.

650497,A comparison of the epidemiology of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks occurring in the first and second pandemic waves in care homes in Northern Ireland,2021-06-11,"Introduction Dès le début de l’arrivée du virus en France, la transmission d’information entre médecins s’est transformée avec la mise en place spontanée de nouveaux réseaux de communication entre médecins face à l’épidémie. L’objectif de ce travail est d’étudier la réalité de l’intelligence collective médicale au cours de la pandémie de Covid-19 en analysant l’émergence et la diffusion de quatre informations médicales nouvelles durant la quarantaine. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons étudié les différents messages d’information circulant entre médecins puis leur reprise dans la presse écrite nationale durant l’épidémie de COVID-19 en France pendant la période de confinement pour quatre informations médicales : anosmie/agueusie, l’atteinte dermatologique, le lien entre tabagisme et COVID19 et enfin l’intérêt du traitement par hydroxychloroquine. Le corpus était constitué des messages d’alertes COVID du 14 mars 2020 au 11 mai 2020, reçus par SMS, messages WhatsApp, mails, publications des sociétés savantes et enfin, les publications scientifiques. Les articles de presse écrite ont été recherchés par le moteur de recherche Europresse et les articles scientifiques par PubMed. Résultats (a) Lésions dermatologiques liée au COVID : onze alertes ont circulé entre médecins dès le 2 avril 2020 (3 mails, 5 messages WhatsApp et 3 articles scientifiques le premier publié le 15/04/20). Un seul article évoque cette alerte dans la presse généraliste française publié le 8 avril 2020 dans le Point. (b)Symptômes d’anosmie agueusie : 21 alertes entre médecins ont circulé dès le 20 mars 2020 (4 mails, 1 SMS, 1 message WhatsApp, 11 articles scientifiques dont le 1er publié le 26/03/20) et 28 articles dans la presse nationale généraliste dès le 20 mars 2020. (c) Lien entre tabac et COVID : 7 alertes ont circulées entre médecins (7 articles scientifiques dès le 02/04/20 dont 1 article d’une équipe française mis en ligne sur une plateforme en accès libre le 21 avril 2020) suivis par 25 articles dans la presse écrite nationale dès le 13 avril 2020. (d) Traitement par chloroquine : nombreuses alertes entre médecins ont été publiées (4 mails, 918 articles scientifiques), 3278 articles y sont consacrés dans la presse écrite nationale dont le premier publié le 18 février 2020 dans le Monde. À titre comparatif une recherche dans la presse nationale généraliste avec les mots clés « Anticorps monoclonaux », « Tocilizumab », « azithromycine », « Remdesivir » donnent respectivement, 61, 123, 281 et 493 résultats. Conclusion Au vu de cette analyse, les réseaux sociaux ont relayé avec efficacité les messages d’alerte pendant l’épidémie, à un moment où les médecins n’avaient pas forcément du temps de lire la littérature scientifique quotidienne. Néanmoins, si la diffusion a été large par ces canaux, le gain de temps a été faible puisque les messages ont presque tous été relayés de manière simultanée dans la presse généraliste et scientifique à quelques jours d’intervalle.","Pascal, C.; Lesens, O.; Arquembourg, J.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20306065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20306065; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.06.442,338
651511,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: first report from the Eastern Mediterranean,2021-02-12,"INTRODUCTION: Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) can cause persisting life-changing dysfunction. There is scarce literature regarding the long-term assessment of CES symptoms, and rarer still is the impact of these symptoms on mental wellbeing investigated. This study assessed the long-term patient reported mental wellbeing outcomes of post-operative CES patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for CES between August 2013 and November 2014 were identified using an ethically approved database. They then completed validated questionnaires over the telephone assessing their mental and physical functioning (Short-Form 12 Questionnaire), generating the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Bladder, bowel and sexual function were also assessed using validated questionnaires. MCS scores were compared to both the Scottish mean and previously published cut-offs indicating patients at risk of depression. Correlations of MCS with bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction were examined and multifactorial regression to predict MCS from these variables analysed. Independent t-tests assessed the mean difference in MCS between patients presenting with incomplete CES (CES-I) and CES with retention (CES-R) and between those with radiologically confirmed and impending CES. RESULTS: Forty-six participants with a mean follow-up time of 43 months completed the study. The mean (±SD) MCS was 49 (±11.8) with 22% demonstrating poor mental health related quality of life in comparison to the Scottish mean. Overall, 37% had scores consistent with being at risk for depression with in the last 30 days, and 45% within the last 12 months. MCS was significantly correlated with Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) score (-0.608), NBDS score (-0.556), ASEX score (-0.349) and PCS score (0.413) with worse bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction associated with worse MCS score. Multifactorial regression analysis demonstrated both urinary (USP score p = 0.031) and bowel function (NBDS score p = 0.009) to be significant predictive variables of mental health related quality of life. There were no significant mean differences in MCS between those presenting with CES-I and CES-R or those with radiologically complete and impending CES. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a high frequency of being at risk for depression in patients with CES and identifies outcome measures (physical, sexual and more so bladder and bowel dysfunction) associated with poorer mental wellbeing. Our large cohort and long follow-up highlight that CES patients should be considered at risk of depression, and the need to consider mental health outcomes following CES surgery.","Hazelwood, James E.; Hoeritzauer, Ingrid; Carson, Alan; Stone, Jon; Demetriades, Andreas K.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358259/,338

Although it is well-known that particular MHC allelic polymorphisms and haplotypes are genetically relate to immune-mediated diseases detailed information of the cat MHC (Feline Leukocyte Antigen; FLA) genetic and haplotypic structure and diversity is limited in comparison to humans and many other species. In this study, to better understand the degree and types of allele and allelic haplotype diversity of FLA-class I (FLA-I) and FLA-DRB loci in domestic cats, we identified six expressible FLA-I loci in peripheral white blood cells by in silico estimation of the coding exons and NGS-based amplicon sequencing using five unrelated cats. We then used a newly developed NGS-based genotyping method to genotype and annotate 32 FLA-I and 16 FLA-DRB sequences in two families of 20 domestic cats. A total of 14 FLA-I and seven FLA-DRB were identified as novel polymorphic sequences. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the sequences into six FLA-I (FLA-E/H/K, FLA-A, FLA-J, FLA-L, FLA-O and a tentatively named FLA-E/H/K_Rec) and four FLA-DRB (FLA-DRB1, FLA-DRB3, FLA-DRB4, and FLA-DRB5) lineages. Pedigree analysis of two cat families revealed eight distinct FLA structural haplotypes (Class I – DRB) with five to eight FLA-I and two to three FLA-DRB transcribed loci per haplotype. It is evident that the eight FLA haplotypes were generated by gene duplications and deletions, and rearrangements by genetic recombination with the accumulation and/or inheritance of novel polymorphisms. These findings are useful for further genetic diversity analysis and disease association studies among cat breeds and in veterinary medicine.","Okano, Masaharu; Miyamae, Jiro; Suzuki, Shingo; Nishiya, Kohei; Katakura, Fumihiko; Kulski, Jerzy K.; Moritomo, Tadaaki; Shiina, Takashi",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760428/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00750,338

According to its essential role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been implicated in several pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopathies. More recently, autophagy has been described as a mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. In this context, autophagy has been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. This is strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy regulation. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert IFN-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit. This review provides an overview of the autophagic process and its involvement in the infection by different viral pathogens and of the connections existing between autophagy and proteins involved in IFN signalling pathways.","Espert, Lucile; Codogno, Patrice; Biard-Piechaczyk, Martine",J Mol Med (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17340132/,338

We aimed to determine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, and the incidence of VA-LRTI. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation > 48 h were eligible if they had: SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection at ICU admission. VA-LRTI, including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. All VA-LRTI were prospectively identified, and chest-X rays were analyzed by at least two physicians. Cumulative incidence of first episodes of VA-LRTI was estimated using the Kalbfleisch and Prentice method, and compared using Fine-and Gray models. RESULTS: 1576 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2, 482 in influenza, and 526 in no viral infection groups). VA-LRTI incidence was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients (287, 50.5%), as compared to influenza patients (146, 30.3%, adjusted sub hazard ratio (sHR) 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.04)) or patients with no viral infection (133, 25.3%, adjusted sHR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.39)). Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for a large proportion (82% to 89.7%) of VA-LRTI, mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VA-LRTI is significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection after statistical adjustment, but residual confounding may still play a role in the effect estimates.

Patients with chronic underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension have shown worst outcomes. The understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of COVID-19 patients at high risk. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the association of diabetes and hypertension with severity of disease. Methods A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed and Cochrane until March 31, 2020. Seven studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 2018 CIVID-19 patients. Results Diabetes was lower in the survivors (OR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.35-0.90; p=0.017; I2 : 0.0%) and non-severe (OR: 1.66; 95%CI: 1.20-2.30; p=0.002; I2 : 0.0%) patients. No association of diabetes was found with ICU care. Hypertension was positively associated with death (OR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.34-0.73; p=0.000; I2 : 0.0%), ICU care (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.22-0.81; p=0.009; I2 : 0.0%) and severity (OR: 2.69; 95%CI: 1.27-5.73; p=0.01; I2 : 52.4%).

Underlying causes include pulmonary and non-pulmonary aetiologies. ARDS is acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure associated with non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, reduced pulmonary compliance, and can lead to lung fibrosis. In addition to treating the underlying cause, often the mainstay of the management of ARDS is invasive mechanical ventilation. This can perpetuate lung injury—ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). Despite recent advances in our understanding of this, ARDS-associated morbidity and mortality remains high.

Whether it had any impact on coronary angiography (CA) volume or on mechanical support device use for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and post-STEMI mechanical complications in Canada is unknown. Methods We administered a Canada-wide survey to all Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Directors seeking the volume of CA for STEMI performed during 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (pandemic period) and from two control periods (01/03/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/03/2018-31/05/2018). The number of left ventricular support devices used, as well as the number of ventricular septal defects or papillary muscle rupture cases diagnosed, were also recorded. We also assessed if the number of COVID-19 cases recorded in each province was associated with STEMI CA volume. Results Forty-one out of 42 Canadian catheterization laboratories (98%) provided data. There was a modest but statistically significant 16% reduction (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR 0.84; 95%CI 0.80-0.87) in CA for STEMI during the first wave of the pandemic compared to control periods. IRR was not associated with provincial COVID-19 caseload. We observed a 26% reduction (IRR 0.74; 95%CI 0.61-0.89) in the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in STEMI. Use of Impella® and mechanical complications from STEMI were exceedingly rare. Conclusion We observed a modest 16% decrease in CA for STEMI during the pandemic first wave in Canada, lower than reported in other countries. Provincial COVID-19 caseload did not influence this reduction.","Rinfret, Stéphane; Jahan, Israth; McKenzie, Kevin; Dendukuri, Nandini; Bainey, Kevin R; Mansour, Samer; Natarajan, Madhu; Ybarra, Luiz F; Chong, Aun-Yeong; Bérubé, Simon; Breton, Robert; Curtis, Michael J; Rodés-Cabau, Josep; Amlani, Shy; Bagherli, Alireza; Ball, Warren; Barolet, Alan; Beydoun, Hussein K; Brass, Neil; Chan, Albert W; Colizza, Franco; Constance, Christian; Fam, Neil P; Gobeil, François; Haghighat, Tinouch; Hodge, Steven; Joyal, Dominique; Kim, Hahn Hoe; Lutchmedial, Sohrab; MacDougall, Andrea; Malik, Paul; Miner, Steve; Minhas, Kunal; Orvold, Jason; Palisaitis, Donald; Parfrey, Brendan; Potvin, Jean-Michel; Puley, Geoffrey; Radhakrishnan, Sam; Spaziano, Marco; Tanguay, Jean-François; Vijayaraghaban, Ram; Webb, John G; Zimmermann, Rodney H; Wood, David A; Brophy, James M",CJC Open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589790X2100127X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589790X2100127X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2021.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997751/,338

Although previous research has greatly enriched our understanding of the conceptualization, predicting factors, processes, and consequences of resilience from a variety of disciplines and levels, future research is needed to gain a deeper and comprehensive understanding of resilience, including developing an integrative and interdisciplinary framework for cultivating resilience, developing an understanding of resilience from a life span perspective, and developing scalable and cost-effective interventions for enhancing resilience and improving pandemic preparedness. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 73 is January 2022.

667632,Exuberant Plasmocytosis in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Specimen of the First Patient Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe,2020-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Despite improved diagnostics, pulmonary pathogens in immunocompromised children frequently evade detection, leading to significant mortality. Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children. METHODS: We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 children’s hospitals from 2014–2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, parallel RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort. RESULTS: We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome that contained bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median, 0.61; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33–0.72 vs median, 0.96; IQR, 0.94–0.96; P < .001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. Ongoing investigation is needed to determine the pathogenic significance of outlier microbes in the lungs of immunocompromised children with pulmonary disease.","Zinter, Matt S; Dvorak, Christopher C; Mayday, Madeline Y; Iwanaga, Kensho; Ly, Ngoc P; McGarry, Meghan E; Church, Gwynne D; Faricy, Lauren E; Rowan, Courtney M; Hume, Janet R; Steiner, Marie E; Crawford, Emily D; Langelier, Charles; Kalantar, Katrina; Chow, Eric D; Miller, Steve; Shimano, Kristen; Melton, Alexis; Yanik, Gregory A; Sapru, Anil; DeRisi, Joseph L",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/1805/21914/1/ciy802.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239621/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy802,338

In this meta-analysis we investigate this association and determine SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals’ odds of having a specific blood group compared to controls. We performed a systematic search on MEDLINE and LitCovid databases for studies published through July 15, 2020. Seven studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, including a total of 13 subgroups of populations (7503 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 2962160 controls). We analysed the odds of having each blood group among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared with controls. Random-effects models were used to obtain the overall pooled odds ratio (OR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed in order to explore the source of heterogeneity and results consistency. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are more likely to have blood group A (pooled OR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.09–1.40) and less likely to have blood group O (pooled OR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.67–0.88). Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms at the basis of this association, which may affect the kinetics of the pandemic according to the blood group distribution within the population.","Golinelli, Davide; Boetto, Erik; Maietti, Elisa; Fantini, Maria Pia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946531/,338

The FDA Emergency Use Authorization restricts use of CCP to high‐titer units only. The purpose of this study was to determine if donor ABO blood group was associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody response, and subsequent qualification as high‐titer CCP. METHODS: All CCP donations collected from April 21, 2020 to September 1, 2020 were included. The Abbott ARCHITECT semi‐quantitative chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to assess IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS‐CoV‐2. Units with a S/C value ≥4.5 were considered high titer. RESULTS: A total of 232 CCP donations were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the distribution of sex, age, and interval from symptom resolution to donation by ABO blood group. The mean SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibody S/C value was significantly lower in blood group O donations (3.6), compared to blood group A (5.0) donations (p < .001). There was no difference in antibody response between the other blood group pairings. Blood group O donations resulted in a lower percentage of high‐titer units (35%), compared to blood group A (60%), B (58%), and AB (65%) donations. CONCLUSION: Blood group O donations were found to have significantly lower levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG nucleocapsid antibodies compared to blood group A donations and were less likely to produce CCP units that qualified as high titer. These findings may aid donor recruitment to promote availability of high‐titer CCP to meet patient needs.","Hayes, Chelsea; Rubenstein, Wesley; Gibb, David; Klapper, Ellen; Tanaka, Julie; Pepkowitz, Samuel",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036595/,338

We used regression models to determine if this decline was best explained by underreporting, seasonal trends, or reduced exposure due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented for SARS-CoV-2 using data from 9 states from July 2012–July 2020. The decline in norovirus outbreaks was significant for all 9 states and underreporting or seasonality are unlikely to be the primary explanations for these findings. These patterns were similar across a variety of settings. NPIs appear to have reduced incidence of norovirus, a non-respiratory pathogen.","Kraay, Alicia N M; Han, Peichun; Kambhampati, Anita K; Wikswo, Mary E; Mirza, Sara A; Lopman, Benjamin A",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606027/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab093,338
680374,Rapid implementation of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and reuse processes for N95 respirators at a health system during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy. METHODS: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories. RESULTS: General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.

682102,The Important Factors Associated with Treatment Response in Laser Treatment of Facial Scars: A Single-Institution Based Retrospective Study,2019-01-02,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 and has spread across the globe. SARS‐CoV‐2 is a highly infectious virus with no vaccine or antiviral therapy available to control the pandemic; therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and the host immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2. SARS‐CoV‐2 is a new member of the betacoronavirus genus like other closely related viruses including SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). Both SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV have caused serious outbreaks and epidemics in the past eighteen years. Here, we report that one of the interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs), cholesterol 25‐hydroxylase (CH25H), is induced by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in vitro and in COVID‐19‐infected patients. CH25H converts cholesterol to 25‐hydrocholesterol (25HC) and 25HC shows broad anti‐coronavirus activity by blocking membrane fusion. Furthermore, 25HC inhibits USA‐WA1/2020 SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. Mechanistically, 25HC inhibits viral membrane fusion by activating the ER‐localized acyl‐CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) which leads to the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus–cell fusion. Since 25HC is a natural product with no known toxicity at effective concentrations, it provides a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID‐19 and emerging viral diseases in the future.","Wang, Shaobo; Li, Wanyu; Hui, Hui; Tiwari, Shashi Kant; Zhang, Qiong; Croker, Ben A; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Carlin, Aaron F; Rana, Tariq M",EMBO J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944968/; https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020106057,338

Aims To determine the impact of COVID-19 in paediatric and congenital cardiology clinical research and to analyse decision-making and adaptation processes, from a panel of on-going academic and industry-sponsored research at the time of the pandemic. Methods This observational study was carried out in April 2020, from a CHD clinical research network involving five tertiary care paediatric and congenital cardiology centres. Investigators and clinical research assistants from each participating research centre filled in an online survey questionnaire, and each principal investigator underwent a one-hour web-based videoconference interview. Results From a total of 34 study questionnaires and 288 enrolled patients at the time of the pandemic, 18 studies were declared as totally suspended. Upon investigator's decision, after discussion on ethical issues and with facilitating support from health authorities, 16 studies were resumed. The rate of study suspension in interventional research (53%) was similar to non-interventional research (56%). Logistical problems were predominantly reported in both continued and suspended trials. Research protocols were adapted, largely thanks to telemedicine, which in some cases even improved the course of the study.

However, many patients will experience recurrence or progression during or following BCG. This scenario has been one of the most challenging in urologic oncology for several decades since BCG implementation. Finally, significant progress has occurred lately. The aim of this review was to summarize for the practising urologist the current treatment options available in 2020 or expected to be ready for routine use in the near future for patients with high-risk NMIBC who experience BCG failure. METHODS: Narrative review using data through the end of 2020. RESULTS: First, the definition of BCG unresponsive disease which is critical in counseling and managing patients has finally reached a consensus. Second, some promising options other than radical cystectomy are finally available and many other should be in a near future. The options can be categorized as chemotherapy, device-assisted therapy, check-point inhibitors, new intravesical and systemic agents and sequential combinations of these newer modalities with conventional therapy.

688553,Lung ultrasound predicts histological lung injury in a neonatal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020-08-10,"OBJECTIVE: Cineole has mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the exacerbation rate in patients suffering from COPD, as well as ameliorates symptoms in patients suffering from asthma and rhinosinusitis. Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. METHODS: As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p = 0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that Cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.

Here we report and characterize the in vitro anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of several semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone. METHODS: Anti-HCV activity was analysed in: (i) three different subgenomic HCV replicon systems using a luciferase or quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) assay; and (ii) an infectious HCV cell culture system by means of qRT–PCR and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS: Several teicoplanin aglycone derivatives elicited selective anti-HCV activity in replicons as well as infectious cell culture systems, with LCTA-949 being the most potent derivative. LCTA-949 proved, in contrast to several directly acting antivirals for HCV, efficient in clearing cells of their replicons. When LCTA-949 was combined with HCV protease or polymerase inhibitors an overall additive effect was observed. Likewise, LCTA-949 was equipotent against wild-type replicons as well as against replicons resistant to polymerase and protease inhibitors. Following up to 4 months of selective pressure, no drug-resistant replicons were selected. When combined with the HCV NS3 protease inhibitor VX-950, LCTA-949 prevented the development of VX-950-resistant variants. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone constitute a novel class of HCV replication inhibitors that are not cross-resistant with various HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors and in particular are potent in clearing hepatoma cells of their replicons. This class of molecules also provides a good tool to obtain novel insights into the replication cycle of HCV and into cellular factors/processes that are crucial for viral replication.","Obeid, Susan; Printsevskaya, Svetlana S.; Olsufyeva, Eugenia N.; Dallmeier, Kai; Durantel, David; Zoulim, Fabien; Preobrazhenskaya, Maria N.; Neyts, Johan; Paeshuyse, Jan",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkr104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436155/,338
