When aspiration is suspected, antibiotics to cover anaerobes are frequently used, but in the absence of clear risk factors, current guidelines have questioned their role. It is unknown how frequently these guidelines are followed. METHODS: We conducted a single‐centre observational study on practice patterns of anaerobic antibiotic use in consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia (Asp), community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare‐associated pneumonia (HCAP). RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were studied (Asp: 20, HCAP: 107, CAP: 65). Overall, 59 patients received anaerobic antibiotics (Asp: 90%, HCAP: 28%, CAP 17%) but a significant proportion of these patients did not meet criteria to receive them. Inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use was 12/20 for Asp, 27/107 for HCAP and 9/65 for CAP. Mortality probability model III at zero hours (MPM0) score and a diagnosis of Asp were predictors of receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics. Receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics was associated with a longer ICU length of stay (LOS; 7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 7–21) vs 4 days (IQR:2–9), P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: For patients in the ICU admitted with pneumonia, there is a high occurrence of inappropriately prescribed anaerobic antibiotics, the use of which was associated with a longer ICU LOS.","Kioka, Mutsumi J.; DiGiovine, Bruno; Rezik, Mohamed; Jennings, Jeffrey H.",Respirology,589,16

Bolstered by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black and white colobus), Macaca nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus leucophaeus (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.","Vanderpool, Dan; Minh, Bui Quang; Lanfear, Robert; Hughes, Daniel; Murali, Shwetha; Harris, R.

The disease was deemed trivial in children, until the reporting, few days ago, of an emerging pediatric multi-inflammatory syndrome mimicking Kawasaki disease (KD). MAIN BODY: This report reveals that coronaviridae were implicated in induction of several post-infectious vasculitides, namely, KD, AHEI, and HSP. This occurs in genetically susceptible individuals to vascular inflammation. Shared genetic susceptibilities between KD and CoV include genes encoding for CD 40, HLAB-15:03, and ACE. This leads to augmented inflammation with hypersecretion of cytokines especially IL-6. CONCLUSION: The revealed relationships between KD and CoV can help to predict the risk of KD in COVID-19 patients through screening levels of upregulated cytokines. It might also signify that classic treatment of KD with IVIG might need to be replaced with anti-cytokine therapy in COVID-19 patients.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; AbdelAzeam, Aisha Said; Ayad, Aya; Kamel, Aya Yasser; Khalil, Ayah; Kotb, Basma; Waheed, Dina; Menshawey, Esraa; Sefein, Fady; Taha, Farah; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; Osman, Ibrahim; Iskander, John; El Wakil, Lama; Rashad, Lara; Arsanyous, Mariem Badr; El Shershaby, Meryam; Mansour, Mina; Ashraf, Mirette; Hafez, Nada; Abuzeid, Nadeen Mohamed; AbdElSalam, Noheir Mahmoud-Nashaat; Hafez, Nouran Gamal; Youssef, Nourhan; Hozaien, Rafeef; Saeed, Rana; Kamel, Dina; AbdelHameed, Manal Ahmed; Ali, Salma",Egypt Pediatric Association Gaz,589,16

Main funding source(s): Study sponsored by DiA Imaging Analysis BACKGROUND: The assessment of the right ventricular (RV) function is an essential part of every transthoracic echocardiographic examination. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of many diseases and conditions. In covid-19 patients, there is evidence showing that enlarged RV and abnormal Free Wall Strain (FWS) correlate with high mortality. Assessment of the RV in the Point of Care settings can assist the differential diagnosis and provide important clinical information in early stages, close to the onset of symptoms, however, it is done qualitatively by visual estimation and thus subjective and requires high level of expertise. The presented study aims to validate the use of a novel artificial intelligence tool (LVivo RV by DiA imaging analysis) that uses deep learning and image processing algorithms to automatically evaluate RV size and function from apical 4 chamber (4CH) focused or modified ultrasound clips. METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 patients who underwent routine echocardiographic examination was conducted in three medical centers in US and Israel. The apical 4CH focused or modified clips were interpreted by experts to evaluate RV size and function. The End Diastolic Area (EDA) measured manually by two sonographers and the FWS measured by semi-automated Velocity Vector Imaging software (VVI by Siemens) were compared to the same parameters obtained automatically by the LVivo RV, using linear regression and Bland Altman analysis. RESULTS: 100 cases were included, 39% females and 61% males. Mean age was 64.7 [19-92]. Mean BMI was 28.1 [6.8-17.6]. 74% had pulmonary hypertension and 19% had lung disease. 36% were considered abnormal by their fractional area change values and 64% were considered normal. Three cases were non-interpretable by the physicians thus excluded from the analysis. The LVivo RV was able to process 99% of the cases. Excellent correlation was obtained for EDA between the sonographers"" average of manual measurements and the automated EDA by LVivo RV with r = 0.92 (p < 0.0001, 95%CI 0.88-0.94). The bias and limits of agreement for EDA were 0.87 ± 5.76cm^2. For FWS, 4 cases were manually excluded due to insufficient image quality. The Bland Altman analysis for FWS showed small bias and limits of agreement of 0.7 ± 12.2%. A very good correlation of r= 0.78, (95% CI 0.69-0.85) was found, indicating good compatibility between the methods. The specificity and sensitivity for FWS were 80% and 77% respectively, using an optimal cutoff value of -16%, and the overall agreement was 79%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of LVivo RV demonstrated a very good agreement with manual and semi-automated quantitative methods for RV assessment. LVivo RV provides fast, accurate, objective and reproducible results and has the potential to be used at the Point of Care settings as a powerful tool for RV size and function evaluation.","Carasso, S; Rosenmann, D; Butnaro, A; Alper-Suissa, L; Igata, S; De-Maria, AN",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,589,3

At the time of development of this study, no specific medication/vaccine for this disease was approved. Therefore, preventive measures were the main key to control this pandemic. Health literacy (HL) is the ability to obtain, understand and use the information to make free and informed decisions about the health of an individual and to promote community empowerment. Thus, the HL of COVID-19 is important for community empowerment and the adoption of preventive measures. This article aims to understand possible predictors of HL of COVID-19, functional domain. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed, applying the Questionnaire of COVID-19 (previously designed and submitted to a preliminary pilot testing) through an online platform from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An Index of Health Knowledge of COVID-19 Questionnaire (IHK-COV19) was constructed. Associations between independent variables (“Gender,” “Age,” “Education,” and “Risk Factor” for COVID-19 codified by ICPC-2) and HL were assessed using multivariate analyses (mixed effects models). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Our sample includes 864 subjects (median age, 44.33 years), mostly women (n = 619; 71.76%), undergraduate (n = 392; 45.37%) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (n = 266; 30.79%). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated “Age” as a negative predictor of IHK-COV19 and “Education” and “Risk Factor” as positive predictors of IHK-COV19. Conclusions: Health knowledge regarding COVID-19 is associated with the level of education. Future interventions should consider including HL mechanisms in interventions designed to improve communication.","Gomes da Silva, Joana; Silva, Carla Sofia; Alexandre, Bárbara; Morgado, Pedro",Front Public Health,589,1

We have previously reported that hepatitis B viral RNAs are m6A modified, displaying a dual functional role in the viral life cycle. Here, we show that cellular m6A machinery regulates host innate immunity against hepatitis B and C viral (HBV/HCV) infections by inducing m6A modification of viral transcripts. The depletion of the m6A writer enzymes (METTL3 and METTL14) leads to an increase in viral RNA recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), thereby stimulating type-I interferon production. This is reversed in cells, in which m6A METTL3 and METTL14 are overexpressed. The m6A modification of viral RNAs renders RIG-I signaling less effective, and while single nucleotide mutation of m6A consensus motif of viral RNAs, enhances RIG-I sensing activity. Importantly, m6A reader proteins (YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) inhibit RIG-I transduced signaling activated by viral RNAs by occupying m6A modified RNAs and inhibiting RIG-I recognition. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion via m6A modification of viral RNAs.","Kim, Geon-Woo; Imam, Hasan; Khan, Mohsin; Siddiqui, Aleem",The Journal of biological chemistry,589,31

Population-based prevalence surveys demonstrate that the majority of individuals with culture-positive tuberculosis and corresponding radiographic abnormalities lack recognizable symptoms. Subclinical tuberculosis is often conceptualized as an early stage that generally progresses to recognizable active tuberculosis disease within months. However, many individuals with subclinical tuberculosis likely never develop recognizable symptoms, and consequently are never identified as having tuberculosis. A growing body of evidence indicates that, in high-burden settings, people with tuberculosis spend more time in a subclinical state than they spend with recognizable symptoms, and that people with subclinical tuberculosis may be infectious. As such, the subclinical period may represent a long window of potential Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. To appropriately prioritize interventions, there is a need to quantify the amount of transmission that occurs during the subclinical period, including the contribution of those who never develop clinically symptomatic disease. If individuals with subclinical tuberculosis are responsible for a large fraction of M. tuberculosis transmission, then ambitious reductions in tuberculosis incidence cannot be achieved without greater focus on early detection and treatment of subclinical tuberculosis. Novel diagnostic assays, population-based studies, and bioinformatic techniques could be used to better estimate the contribution of individuals with subclinical tuberculosis to overall transmission. This knowledge can help us understand whether finding and treating people with subclinical tuberculosis is essential or extraneous as part of a comprehensive strategy to end the epidemic.","Kendall, Emily A; Shrestha, Sourya; Dowdy, David W",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,589,5

After partial resection was performed with electrocautery, two different methods of surface sealing were used: a coagulation method (C method) with Soft Coagulation alone, and a coagulation-suturing method (CS method) with Soft Coagulation combined with continuous suturing. The clinical outcomes of the two methods were retrospectively compared in this study. The C method was used in 19 lesions of 18 cases, and the CS method was used in 20 lesions of 19 cases. Primary lung cancer was the most frequent diagnosis (22 lesions of 21 cases). There were no differences between the two groups in the size and depth of the lesions. Operative time was longer with the CS method than with the C method. Postoperative air leakage was a complication in 4 cases with the C method, and one of them required re-do surgery, whereas only one case with the CS method had temporary air leakage. Postoperative computed tomography showed cavitation in 3 C method cases and 5 CS method cases, all without related symptoms. There were no local recurrences at resected sites. In conclusion, the C method was technically easy to perform, but air leakage may be prolonged after surgery. The CS method may have the advantage of causing less air leakage than the C method, but mastering the technique is important to shorten operative time.","Toyazaki, Toshiya; Tomioka, Yasuaki; Chiba, Naohisa; Ueda, Yuichiro; Sakaguchi, Yasuto; Gotoh, Masashi; Ishikawa, Shinya; Nakagawa, Tatsuo",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,589,5

The 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) of four patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS was followed for 6 months after admission to the hospital. These four patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital and received mechanical ventilation. Rehabilitation therapy (positioning, postural drainage, and passive range of motion exercises) was started after ICU admission. Mobilization therapy, including muscle power training, sitting on the edge of the bed, and endurance training, was performed after the end of sedation. The Medical Research Council sum scores and Barthel Indexes for the patients improved after ICU discharge and completely recovered 6 months after admission to the hospital.

AIM To provide insight into existing initiatives to support the practice of continuous sedation until death and assess their feasibility and effectiveness. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis, registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020149630). DATA SOURCES Records were searched through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to April 16 2020. Peer-reviewed studies reporting original data on initiatives to support the practice of continuous sedation were included for review. RESULTS Twenty-one studies met the criteria and were included. Initiatives were focused on assessment tools of consciousness and discomfort (9), the use of guidelines and protocols (8), and expert consultation (3). All initiatives were reported as useful, acceptable, and feasible. Studies on the use of monitoring devices showed that a small proportion of patients were found to be awake, despite the patient being unresponsive according to the observer-based sedation scales. However, the wide range of values of these monitoring devices for comfortable and adequately sedated patients seems to hamper its overall implementation in daily clinical practice. Physicians reported changes in practice conform to guideline recommendations but the shift was modest at best. Expert consultation was regarded as supportive when sufficient expertise is lacking and helpful in avoiding possibly unnecessary sedations. CONCLUSIONS The reviewed initiatives may contribute to improvement of continuous sedation until death, though their evidence base is rather limited. More insight is needed into their feasibility, preconditions for effective implementation and impact in actual practice.","Robijn, Lenzo; Deliens, Luc; Scherrens, Anne-Lore; Pauwels, Nele S; Pype, Peter; Rietjens, Judith; Chambaere, Kenneth",Palliative medicine,589,27

Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5-80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57-38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66-31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.","Saredakis, Dimitrios; Szpak, Ancret; Birckhead, Brandon; Keage, Hannah A D; Rizzo, Albert; Loetscher, Tobias",Frontiers in human neuroscience,589,1

The study was stopped early as data revealed a 22% relative reduction in mortality rate when using 6 ml/kg tidal volume. The current generation of critical care ventilators allows the tidal volume to be set during volume-targeted, assist/control (volume A/C); however, some ventilators include options that may prevent the tidal volume from being controlled. The purpose of this bench study was to evaluate the delivered tidal volume, when these options are active, in a spontaneously breathing lung model using an electronic breathing simulator. METHODS Four ventilators were evaluated: CareFusion AVEA (AVEA), Dräger Evita® XL (Evita XL), Covidien Puritan Bennett® 840(TM) (PB 840), and Maquet SERVO-i (SERVO-i). Each ventilator was connected to the Hans Rudolph Electronic Breathing Simulator at an amplitude of 0 cm H2O and then 10 cm H2O. All four ventilators were set to deliver volume A/C, tidal volume 400 ml, respiratory rate 20 bpm, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, peak flowrate 60 L/min. The displayed tidal volume was recorded for each ventilator at the above settings with additional options OFF and then ON. RESULTS The AVEA has two options in volume A/C: demand breaths and V-sync. When activated, these options allow the patient to exceed the set tidal volume. When using the Evita XL, the option AutoFlow can be turned ON or OFF, and when this option is ON, the tidal volume may vary. The PB 840 does not have any additional options that affect volume delivery, and it maintains the set tidal volume regardless of patient effort. The SERVO-i's demand valve allows additional flow if the patient's inspiratory flowrate exceeds the set flowrate, increasing the delivered tidal volume; this option can be turned OFF with the latest software upgrade. CONCLUSIONS Modern ventilators have an increasing number of optional settings. These settings may increase the delivered tidal volume and disrupt a low tidal-volume strategy. Recognizing how each setting within a mode affects the type of breath delivered is critical when caring for ventilator-dependent patients.","Wing, Thomas J; Haan, Lutana; Ashworth, Lonny J; Anderson, Jeff",Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease,589,1

To date, there is no effective medication for CICP, and existing medication is not useful, making surgery the only effective treatment. Laparoscopic surgery is useful for reducing surgical trauma and postoperative adhesion. Herein, we report a patient with recurrent laxative-uncontrolled bowel obstruction, who underwent successful treatment with laparoscopic total colectomy based on preoperative detailed evaluation of bowel function. CASE PRESENTATION A 77-year-old female patient without any past abdominal or psychological medical history was referred to our hospital because of chronic constipation and abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography, barium enema, cine magnetic resonance imaging, and defecography indicated an enlarged colon from the cecum to the transverse colon (proximal to the splenic flexure) without apparent mechanical obstruction, and a collapsed colon from the descending colon to the rectum, with reduced peristalsis. Bowel movements of the rectum and anorectal function were normal. Based on these findings, we diagnosed CICP and performed laparoscopic total colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis in this case. Postoperative recovery was good, without the need for postoperative laxatives. Pathologically, no degeneration of the muscle layers or Auerbach's plexus was found in the resected specimen. CONCLUSION Surgery is the only effective treatment for patients with CICP. Careful imaging before surgery is important for detecting the extent of excision required. This will reduce the need for additional surgery due to symptom relapse in the remnant colon. However, continued observation of the patient is required.","Yoshimura, Kosuke; Ohge, Hiroki; Shimada, Norimitsu; Uegami, Shinnosuke; Watadani, Yusuke; Nakashima, Ikki; Hirano, Toshinori; Kitagawa, Hiroki; Kaiki, Yuki; Takahashi, Shinya",Surgical case reports,589,31

This study also investigated the potential mechanism of action of ISL. METHOD Methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to test ISL toxicity. An ELISA and an RT-qPCR assay detected the inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2, and ICAM-1). A Western blot investigated the expression levels of inflammation-related signals [nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)], and fibrogenesis, including fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)]. Protein expressions of α-SMA were measured by immunofluorescence. RESULTS Pre-treatment with ISL (10 or 20 μM) dose-dependently decreased the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and COX-2 induced by ANG II (1 μg/ml) in both MPMs and HTFs. ANG II remarkably increased the amount of P65 in the nuclei and decreased the amount of P65 in the cytoplasm. Additionally, ANG II reduced PPARγ expression levels in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, these effects which were induced by ISL were remarkably neutralized by ISL pre-treatment. Finally, ANG II markedly elevated the expression of fibronectin and α-SMA. CONCLUSION ISL could alleviate ANG II-induced fibrogenesis by inhibiting the NF-κB/PPARγ inflammatory pathway. In addition, ISL may be a potential agent for the treatment of conjunctival fibrosis. Most importantly, the NF-κB/PPARγ signaling pathway could be an effective therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of conjunctival fibrosis after glaucoma surgery.","Ye, Huifang; Xi, Yang; Chen, Xiong; Shen, Lijun; Le, Rongrong",Experimental eye research,589,1

This study sought to identify interprofessional barriers and facilitators for use of MOUD (specifically naltrexone and buprenorphine) among current and future primary care providers in a southeastern academic center in South Carolina. METHOD Faculty, residents, and students within family medicine, internal medicine, and a physician assistant program participated in focus group interviews, and completed a brief survey. Survey data were analyzed quantitatively, and focus group transcripts were analyzed using a deductive qualitative content analysis, based upon the theory of planned behavior. RESULTS Seven groups (N = 46) completed focus group interviews and surveys. Survey results indicated that general attitudes towards MOUD were positive and did not differ significantly among groups. Subjective norms around prescribing and controllability (i.e., beliefs about whether prescribing was up to them) differed between specialties and between level of training groups. Focus group themes highlighted attitudes about MOUD (e.g., ""opens the flood gates"" to patients with addiction) and perceived facilitators and barriers of using MOUD in primary care settings. Participants felt that although MOUD in primary care would improve access and reduce stigma for patients, prescribing requires improved provider education and an integrated system of care. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study provide an argument for tailoring education to specifically address the barriers primary care prescribers perceive. Results promote the utilization of active, hands-on learning approaches, to ultimately promote uptake of MOUD prescribing in the primary care setting in South Carolina.","Oros, Sarah M; Christon, Lillian M; Barth, Kelly S; Berini, Carole R; Padgett, Bennie L; Diaz, Vanessa A",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,589,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) and API to predict IA occlusion using pre- and post-intervention DSAs. METHODS We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step. RESULTS The study included 190 IAs. The mean and median duration between treatment and follow-up was 9.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. For the un-normalized, normalized, and relative subgroups, the DNN average prediction accuracies for IA occlusion were 62.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 64.4%), 70.8% (95% CI 68.2% to 73.4%), and 77.9% (95% CI 76.2% to 79.6%).

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of induced sputum as an additional indicator for the current clinical discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients to prevent virus recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-one COVID-19 patients who met the national clinical discharge criteria were discharged from the hospital and tested daily for the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in their pharyngeal swabs and every other day for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in their induced sputum. Once the patient's induced sputum was negative after two consecutive tests, testing was discontinued. RESULTS Among 21 discharged patients from COVID-19, the first pharyngeal swab and induced sputum tests for viral nucleic acid were positive in 3 (14.3%) and 8 (38.1%) patients respectively. Induced sputum was significantly more positive than pharyngeal swab (p < 0.05). In our cohort, all pharyngeal swabs became negative at day 7, and all induced sputa turned negative at day 11 after discharge. Interestingly, patients with negative pharyngeal swabs experienced viral relapse, whereas patients with negative induced sputum did not revert to positivity. CONCLUSIONS The detection rate of positive viral nucleic acid in induced sputum was high. Patients with negative induced sputum nucleic acid tests did not have a relapse of SARS-COV-2, indicating that viral nucleic acid testing of induced sputum should be used as an additional criterion for patients with national clinical discharge criteria COVID-19.","Zheng, S-L; Sun, W-L; Sun, L-N; Zeng, X-H; Wang, Q-X",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,589,29

DESIGN This study used a cross-sectional exploratory, qualitative interview design. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten first-time mothers who had given birth since COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULT Experiences of new, first-time mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic were organized around two themes. First, new mothers felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility for their baby which was heightened by the pandemic. The challenge of meeting this responsibility was heightened in the context of societal expectations to do the 'right' thing and uncertainty and distrust around official guidance about COVID-19. Secondly, the expected transition into motherhood was altered by the pandemic. Disruption to the birthing experience, an inability to connect with close friends and family, and limited healthcare support was perceived to be detrimental. However, altered social expectations and the increased presence of the partner were perceived as positives. CONCLUSION Many of the common challenges experienced by new, first-time mothers have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.

A LGK was performed on all dogs under dexmedetomidine and butorphanol sedation. Fourteen eyes were randomly assigned to receive a corneal contact lens. The dogs were evaluated typically at 7, 10, and 14 days or until the ulceration was healed. Client surveys were completed by the owners to subjectively assess comfort level and contact lens retention. Statistical analyses were performed utilizing generalized linear models and survival analysis with the Wilcoxon-Gehan test to evaluate group differences. RESULTS All ulcers healed after the LGK procedure. Dogs with bandage contact lenses had a statistically significant (P = 0.035) decrease in median healing time (7 days (95% CI [7,9]) compared to those without contact lenses (10 days (95% CI [7,12])). There was no difference in subjective comfort score between treatment groups. Early contact loss occurred in 28.6% (95% CI [8.4%, 58.1%]) of dogs. All of the Acrivet(™) ruler corneal measurements agreed to within 1 mm (95% CI [87.2%, 100%]) of the Jameson caliper measurements of horizontal corneal diameter. CONCLUSIONS The use of corneal bandage contact lenses significantly decreased median healing time although there was no effect on subjective comfort score. The Acrivet(™) ruler measurements were accurate in determining corneal diameter and therefore contact lens size.","Wooff, Penelope J; Norman, Joanna C",Veterinary ophthalmology,589,6

STUDY DESIGN It is a retrospective study conducted in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital (PUSH) in Shenzhen, China. A total of 96 patients who were treated with LM because of big and moderate size of myomas in PUSH from January 2013 and December 2015 were enrolled in this study. Among them 35 were managed with IRCP -integrated LM as the study group, while the other 61 were treated with normal LM as the control group. The core steps of IRCP include minimized uterine incision, rotary cuttings in the fibroid inside the pseudocapsule, and preserving the fibers and vessels of the fibroid pseudocapsule. The operation data and outcome variables of each patient in the two groups were collected and compared to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of this new improved surgery procedure. RESULTS The ages, body mass indexes, main indication for myomectomy, and the diameters, numbers and types of the fibroids of patients in the two groups were similar. There is no significant difference in enucleation time and days of postoperative in-hospital staying between the two groups. In comparison with normal LM, application of IRCP significantly reduced the length of uterine incisions (P=0.000), the overall time of operations (P=0.001), and the time for uterine cavity suturing (P=0.000), and application of IRCP was also associated with less operation bleeding (P=0.003) and postoperative hemoglobin dropping (P=0.001). Five cases (8.2%) in the control group were referred to laparotomy, while no case was done so in the study group. No patient in the study group needed blood transfusion but six patients (9.8%) in the control group did. Follow-up to all the patients showed no uterine malignant tumor. CONCLUSIONS Our study provided strong supportive evidences showing that Intracapsular Rotary-cut Procedures is safe and practicable. The less uterine incision length, less surgery time, and less bleeding than the normal LM procedures all suggests that IRCP should be adopted in LM for facilitation to the operation procedures, minimization of operative invasiveness, and protection to patients' infertility.","Zhong, Shi-Lin; Zeng, Li-Ping; Li, Huan; Wu, Rui-Fang","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",589,1

One of the important findings in this area is that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene is a negative regulator of wild-type p53. In tumors, expressing wild-type p53, inhibition of MDM2 expression will stabilize p53 and allow it to perform its proapoptotic function, while simultaneously preventing MDM2 from exerting its p53-independent oncogenic effects. The intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by MDM2, as it is a key player in autoregulatory feedback loop under nonstressed conditions. The p53-MDM2 relationship is vital not only for essential functions of the cell, but it also appears to be an integrated part of the complex cellular network which supports the importance of this affair and is a hallmark for its coexistence. Subjects and Methods This study was designed to identify immunohistochemically the expression of p53 and MDM2 gene using monoclonal antibody in 60 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, of which 20 cases were of solid multicystic ameloblastoma (SMA), 20 cases were of odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and 20 cases were of unicystic ameloblastoma (UA). Results Immunoexpression of p53 and MDM2 was highest in OKC followed by SMA and was minimum in UA. Further results showed positive correlation between both the molecules. Conclusion The studied showed that the relationship has a significant role in cancer etiology and progression and therefore is an important topic for future research which should help in the development of new therapeutic agent against cancer.","Singh, Abhishek; Jain, Anshi; Shetty, Devi Charan; Rathore, Ajit Singh; Juneja, Saurabh",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,589,11

Coronavirus disease-19 quarantine is more detrimental than traditional off-season on physical conditioning of professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-Beyond the severe health crisis, the coronavirus disease 2019 has also affected the high-performance sports scenario. In soccer, practitioners are concerned about the effects of long-term detraining on players' conditioning, and caution is required when activities return. This study assessed body composition, jump and sprint performance, hamstring eccentric strength, and intermittent cardiorespiratory fitness of 23 male professional soccer players who returned to training activities after 63 days of quarantine. The results were compared with their physical condition assessed before a pre-season phase as soon as they returned to training after a regular 24-day off-season period. In comparison with after off-season assessments, the quarantine induced significant increases in body mass, body fat mass, 10- and 20-m sprint times as well as decreases in countermovement jump height (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in hamstring eccentric strength, squat jump height, and cardiorespiratory fitness (p > 0.05). In summary, we showed that 63 days of quarantine impaired several physical performance measures compared with regular off-season in soccer players. Given the present results, special attention should be given to body composition-related and speed power-related capabilities after long-term detraining in professional soccer.","Grazioli, Rafael; Loturco, Irineu; Baroni, Bruno M; Oliveira, Gabriel S; Saciura, Vasyl; Vanoni, Everton; Dias, Rafael; Veeck, Filipe; Pinto, Ronei S; Cadore, Eduardo L",Journal of strength and conditioning research,589,17

This pilot project investigated how such a format is accepted and evaluated by the participants. Methodology: A forum-based online format with group and individual tasks was chosen, which was didactically designed according to the problem-oriented design by Reinmann and Mandl. Results: The seminar was attended by 14 people, 13 of whom took part in the evaluation. The overall evaluation was, with one exception, a grade of 2 (and better). The three items ""practical relevance"", ""subjective learning success"" and the question of recommendation also received very high approval ratings. The weekly workload reported by the participants was very heterogeneous (mean=2.4 hours; SD=1.1). For some participants, the use of the learning platform was not intuitive and group collaboration was somewhat faltering. Conclusion: The experiences made show that courses on medical didactics can be implemented online and are gladly accepted by the participants. Based on the experience gained, online seminars or blended learning formats will certainly continue to be part of the FAM course program in the future.","Kollewe, Thomas; Ochsendorf, Falk",GMS journal for medical education,589,1

The purpose of this study was to compare perceived pain in castrated piglets treated 1 h before castration with either of these drugs alone, or when mixed with ID, by observing the time it takes for piglets to navigate a chute. Piglets were divided into seven treatment groups (n = 25 piglets per treatment group) including castration with analgesia (meloxicam or ketoprofen), castration with analgesic plus ID, castration without analgesic or ID, sham handled and given ID, and sham handled alone. Piglets were placed in a short chute and their time to navigate the chute was recorded at four timepoints following castration. Piglets given meloxicam or ketoprofen, with or without ID did not differ from each other in their chute navigation times. Additionally, these piglets did not differ from treatment groups that were not castrated. Piglets castrated without analgesia had significantly longer navigation times. These results indicate that meloxicam or ketoprofen, whether mixed with ID prior to injection or not, provide similar analgesic efficacy.","Reynolds, Kristen; Johnson, Ron; Brown, Jennifer; Friendship, Robert; O'Sullivan, Terri L",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,589,1

It avoids flow arrest and the risk of vessel rupture associated with balloon-assisted coiling. However, there is a risk of stent thrombosis with the corollary risk of stroke during and after the procedure. Antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate this risk but raise a secondary concern of hemorrhagic complications, particularly with ruptured aneurysm where further interventions such as ventriculostomy occur not infrequently. Stent removal after coil embolization would eliminate the risk of post-procedure stent thromboembolic complications and alleviate the need for continuing antiplatelet therapy. METHODS A prospectively maintained endovascular database was searched to identify patients who underwent stent-assisted coil embolization followed by stent retrieval and removal. The clinical and technical aspects of the cases were obtained in addition to the procedural outcomes. RESULTS Three cases were identified where the use of the fully resheathable Solitaire AB Neurovascular Remodeling Device permitted the coiling of broad-based aneurysms with subsequent retrieval and removal of the stent. All patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and received aspirin prior to the procedure. Two patients did not require antiplatelet therapy after the procedure. No coil herniation or thromboembolic events were encountered. CONCLUSIONS Stent retrieval and removal can be done safely in selected cases at the end of stent-assisted coil embolization using the Solitaire AB device. This technique avoids the need for continuing antiplatelet therapy, which can be particularly important in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Hockley, Aaron; Wong, John H; Goyal, Mayank",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,589,12

METHODS From January 2011 to January 2013, 52 a total of consecutive patients with LACC were candidates for extraperitoneal PA lymphadenectomy via an original single-port approach that we developed. All patients underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography that indicated no PA uptake. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients underwent single-port staging surgery. Two patients had peritoneal carcinomatosis and were not submitted to PA lymphadenectomy. Median age and body mass index were, respectively 47 (range 27-68) years and 23 (range 16-37) kg/m(2). In one case, lymphadenectomy was unfeasible because of renal vessel anomalies (a bifurcated left renal vein crossed the aorta at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery), and two nodes were removed. Conventional instruments were used in all cases. The median operative time was 180 (range 110-270) min. The median and mean number of nodes removed were, respectively, 18 (range 2-47) and 19.4. Six (12 %) patients had metastatic PA disease. No conversion to laparotomy or conventional multiport laparoscopy was required. The median postoperative hospital stay and the interval between staging surgery and the beginning of chemoradiation were, respectively, 2 (range 1-26) days and 16.5 (range 1-60) days. The learning curve was evaluated at seven procedures with a decreased median operative time at 160 (range 110-240) min.

RECENT FINDINGS H1N1 2009 was first recognized as a pathogen in March of 2009, when there was a spike in the number of cases of influenza-like illness leading to severe and at times fatal pneumonia. The etiologic agent was then identified as a novel H1N1 influenza A virus, which subsequent spread rapidly throughout the globe. Most countries reported cases of severe viral pneumonitis requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Severe disease was noted to occur more commonly in younger patients than those typically affected by seasonal influenza and obesity and pregnancy were associated with severe disease. The majority of patients requiring ICU admission met criteria for ARDS and case fatality ratio was estimated at less than 0.5%. Chest radiographs and pathology resembled ARDS and most patients were treated with low tidal volume ventilation, high positive end expiratory pressure and at times, rescue therapies. Available evidence suggests that early antiviral treatment improves outcomes from H1N1 2009. SUMMARY H1N1 2009 has emerged as an important cause of ARDS in 2009-2010.

The optimal antibiotic treatment duration for cIAIs is uncertain, especially in cases where source control is not achieved. We hypothesised that in patients with cIAIs, regardless of source control intervention, there would be a lower relapse rate with long-course antibiotics (28 days) compared with short course (≤ 10 days). We piloted a trial comparing ≤ 10-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI. METHODS A randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted. Eligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed ≤ 6 days prior to screening. Randomisation was to long-course (28 days) or short-course (≤10 days) antibiotic therapy. Choice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team. Participants were followed up for 90 days. Primary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures. RESULTS In total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised. Patients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%). One patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation. In the short-course arm, 4/17 (23.5%) were treated for a cIAI relapse vs 0/13 (0.0%) relapses in the long-course arm. Protocol violations included deviations from protocol-assigned antibiotic duration and interruptions to antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS This feasibility study identified opportunities to increase recruitment in a full trial. This study demonstrates completion of a randomised controlled trial to further evaluate if the optimum antibiotic duration for cIAIs is feasible.

Previous reports are contradictory regarding an association with severe disease. METHODS Three hundred forty-six specimens from children with acute respiratory illness identified at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were evaluated by direct immunofluorescent assay and/or viral culture by Clinical Microbiology Laboratory and later by molecular study for the presence of influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and human bocavirus. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS Multiple viruses were detected in 46 (21.7%) of 212 virus-positive specimens with the most frequent virus-virus combinations being HRV-respiratory syncytial virus (n = 12), HRV-human bocavirus (n = 6) and HRV-parainfluenza virus 3 (n = 4). Risk factors for coinfection included male gender (OR [odds ratio]: 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-3.46), 6 months to 1 year age (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 0.75-6.19) and history of immunosuppression (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 0.99-4.23). Children with viral coinfections were less likely than children with single virus infections to be admitted to an intensive care unit (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.08-1.27); however, this may be explained by undetected viral-bacterial coinfections.

Therefore, we used cross-sectional regression analysis to examine the association between the presence of health care worker unions and COVID-19 mortality rates in 355 nursing homes in New York State. Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29 percentage point mortality reduction, which represents a 30% relative decrease in the COVID-19 mortality rate compared to facilities without health care worker unions.

METHODS Patients with a positive baseline culture were included. Six-month culture conversion was defined as two consecutive negative cultures collected >15 days apart. We derived predicted probabilities of culture conversion and relative risk using marginal standardisation methods. RESULTS Culture conversion was observed in 83.8% (526/628) of patients receiving an all-oral regimen and 85.5% (425/497) of those receiving an injectable-containing regimen. The adjusted relative risk comparing injectable-containing regimens to all-oral regimens was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.88-1.04). We found very weak evidence of effect modification by HIV status: among patients living with HIV, there was a small increase in the frequency of conversion among those receiving an injectable-containing regimen, relative to an all-oral regimen, which was not apparent in HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS Among individuals receiving bedaquiline and/or delamanid as part of a multidrug regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis, there was no significant difference between those who received an injectable and those who did not regarding culture conversion within 6 months. The potential contribution of injectable agents in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis among those who were HIV positive requires further study.","Khan, Palwasha Y; Franke, Molly F; Hewison, Catherine; Seung, Kwonjune J; Huerga, Helena; Atwood, Sidney; Ahmed, Saman; Khan, Munira; Sultana, Tanha; Manzur-Ul-Alam, Mohammad; Vo, Luan N Q; Lecca, Leonid; Yae, Kalkidan; Kozhabekov, Serik; Tamirat, Meseret; Gelin, Alain; Vilbrun, Stalz C; Kikvidze, Marina; Faqirzai, Jamil; Kadyrov, Abdullaat; Skrahina, Alena; Mesic, Anita; Avagyan, Nana; Bastard, Mathieu; Rich, Michael L; Khan, Uzma; Mitnick, Carole D",The European respiratory journal,589,8

In the present study, chemopreventive effects of oat and barley (beta®barley) kernels were investigated. In order to address the impact of thermal processing on these effects, kernels were roasted (150-180 °C, approx. 20 min), digested and fermented using an In Vitro human digestion model. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia were determined in fermentation supernatants (FS). Growth inhibition, apoptosis, DNA integrity and gene expression of catalase were analyzed in LT97 colon adenoma cells. Concentrations of SCFA, particularly butyrate, were higher in oat/barley FS (2.2-fold, on average), while ammonia levels were significantly lower (0.7-fold, on average) than in the fermentation control. Treatment of LT97 cells with FS of oat/barley kernels led to a significant time- and dose-dependent growth reduction, a significant increase in caspase-3 activity and enhanced levels of catalase mRNA, without exhibiting genotoxic effects. In general, the results indicate a chemopreventive potential of In Vitro fermented oat and waxy winter barley mediated mainly by growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects, which are preserved after thermal processing.","Schlörmann, Wiebke; Atanasov, Julia; Lorkowski, Stefan; Dawczynski, Christine; Glei, Michael",Nutrition and cancer,589,24

However, there is no widely accepted priority setting evaluation framework. We reviewed literature with the aim of developing and proposing a framework for the evaluation of macro and meso level healthcare priority setting practices. METHODS We systematically searched Econlit, PubMed, CINAHL, and EBSCOhost databases and supplemented this with searches in Google Scholar, relevant websites and reference lists of relevant papers. A total of 31 papers on evaluation of priority setting were identified. These were supplemented by broader theoretical literature related to evaluation of priority setting. A conceptual review of selected papers was undertaken. RESULTS Based on a synthesis of the selected literature, we propose an evaluative framework that requires that priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels of the health system meet the following conditions: (1) Priority setting decisions should incorporate both efficiency and equity considerations as well as the following outcomes; (a) Stakeholder satisfaction, (b) Stakeholder understanding, (c) Shifted priorities (reallocation of resources), and (d) Implementation of decisions. (2) Priority setting processes should also meet the procedural conditions of (a) Stakeholder engagement, (b) Stakeholder empowerment, (c) Transparency, (d) Use of evidence, (e) Revisions, (f) Enforcement, and (g) Being grounded on community values. CONCLUSION Available frameworks for the evaluation of priority setting are mostly grounded on procedural requirements, while few have included outcome requirements. There is, however, increasing recognition of the need to incorporate both consequential and procedural considerations in priority setting practices. In this review, we adapt an integrative approach to develop and propose a framework for the evaluation of priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels that draws from these complementary schools of thought.","Barasa, Edwine W; Molyneux, Sassy; English, Mike; Cleary, Susan",International journal of health policy and management,589,1

Maximum likelihood (ML) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) dominate the estimation of SEMs with continuous or categorical endogenous variables, respectively. When a model is correctly specified, ML and DWLS function well. But, in the face of incorrect structures or nonconvergence, their performance can seriously deteriorate. Model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimates and tests individual equations, is more robust to misspecifications, and is noniterative, thus avoiding nonconvergence. This article is an overview and tutorial on MIIV-2SLS. It reviews the six major steps in using MIIV-2SLS: (a) model specification; (b) model identification; (c) latent to observed (L2O) variable transformation; (d) finding MIIVs; (e) using 2SLS; and (f) tests of overidentified equations. Each step is illustrated using a running empirical example from Reisenzein's (1986) randomized experiment on helping behavior. We also explain and illustrate the analytic conditions under which an equation estimated with MIIV-2SLS is robust to structural misspecifications. We include additional sections on MIIV approaches using a covariance matrix and mean vector as data input, conducting multilevel SEM, analyzing categorical endogenous variables, causal inference, and extensions and applications.

Recently, a 30-nucleotide (nt) cis-replication stem-loop VI (SLVI) has been mapped at nt 101 to 130 within a 288-nt 5'-terminal segment of the 738-nt nsp1 cistron in a BCoV defective interfering (DI) RNA. Since a similar nsp1 coding region appears in all characterized groups 1 and 2 coronavirus DI RNAs and must be translated in cis for BCoV DI RNA replication, we hypothesized that nsp1 might regulate ORF 1 expression by binding this intra-nsp1 cistronic element. Here, we (i) establish by mutation analysis that the 72-nt intracistronic SLV immediately upstream of SLVI is also a DI RNA cis-replication signal, (ii) show by gel shift and UV-cross-linking analyses that cellular proteins of approximately 60 and 100 kDa, but not viral proteins, bind SLV and SLVI, (SLV-VI) and (iii) demonstrate by gel shift analysis that nsp1 purified from Escherichia coli does not bind SLV-VI but does bind three 5' untranslated region (UTR)- and one 3' UTR-located cis-replication SLs. Notably, nsp1 specifically binds SLIII and its flanking sequences in the 5' UTR with approximately 2.5 muM affinity. Additionally, under conditions enabling expression of nsp1 from DI RNA-encoded subgenomic mRNA, DI RNA levels were greatly reduced, but there was only a slight transient reduction in viral RNA levels. These results together indicate that nsp1 is an RNA-binding protein that may function to regulate viral genome translation or replication but not by binding SLV-VI within its own coding region.","Gustin, Kortney M; Guan, Bo-Jhih; Dziduszko, Agnieszka; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,589,1

This study aimed to assess the characteristics of kidney injury and its association with disease progression and death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This is a retrospective study. Two representative cohorts were included. Cohort 1 involved severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from Wuhan, China. Cohort 2 was all patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen city (Guangdong province, China). Any kidney injury was defined as the presence of any of the following: hematuria, proteinuria, in-hospital AKI, or prehospital AKI. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. The primary outcome was death at the end of follow-up. The secondary outcome was progression to critical illness during the study period. RESULTS A total of 555 patients were enrolled; 42% of the cases (229 of 549) were detected with any kidney injury, 33% of the cases (174 of 520) were detected with proteinuria, 22% of the cases (112 of 520) were detected with hematuria, and 6% of the cases (29 of 520) were detected with AKI. Of the 29 patients with AKI, 21 cases were recognized as in-hospital AKI, and eight were recognized as prehospital AKI. Altogether, 27 (5%) patients died at the end of follow-up. The death rate was 11% (20 of 174) in patients with proteinuria, 16% (18 of 112) in patients with hematuria, and 41% (12 of 29) in the AKI settings. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria (hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 15.94), hematuria (hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 13.81), and in-hospital AKI (hazard ratio, 6.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.42 to 19.31) were associated with death. Among the 520 patients with noncritical illness at admission, proteinuria (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 5.56) and hematuria (hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 5.08) were found to be associated with progression to critical illness during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Kidney injury is common in coronavirus disease 2019, and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes.

AIMS We aimed to determine the accuracy of three popular scores (original intracerebral hemorrhage, modified intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale) on 30-day mortality and 90-day death or major disability, and whether the magnitude of benefit varies according to prognosis graded by the three predictive scores. METHODS Data from the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial which included 2839 intracerebral hemorrhage patients (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure (150-220 mmHg), randomized to intensive (target systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg) or guideline-based (<180 mmHg) blood pressure management. Discrimination of scales for predicting death and poor outcome (modified Rankin scale 3-6) was evaluated in area under receiver operator characteristic curves. RESULTS Among 2556 (90%) participants with available data, the modified intracerebral hemorrhage had the highest discrimination (receiver operator characteristic 0·75) for 90-day poor outcome compared with the original intracerebral hemorrhage (receiver operator characteristic 0·68) and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale (receiver operator characteristic 0·69). All scores had good positive predictive value (approximately 80-90%) for poor outcome but poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for death. The scores do not clearly discriminate a patient group most likely to benefit from blood pressure lowering. CONCLUSIONS Intracerebral hemorrhage prognostic scores are not useful in defining patients at high probability of early death, but they are reliable for predicting poor outcome, defined by death or major disability. Potential benefits of early intensive blood pressure lowering are broadly applicable across grades of severity defined by such scores.","Heeley, Emma; Anderson, Craig S; Woodward, Mark; Arima, Hisatomi; Robinson, Thompson; Stapf, Christian; Parsons, Mark; Lavados, Pablo M; Huang, Yining; Wang, Yanxia; Crozier, Sophie; Parry-Jones, Adrian; Wang, Jiguang; Chalmers, John",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,589,26

An increasingly holistic understanding of healthcare has resulted in contextual factors such as perceived quality of care, as well as patients' acceptance, preferences and subjective expectations of health services, all gaining in importance. How patients with CHF experience the use of healthcare services has not been studied within the scope of a systematic review in a German healthcare context. The aim of this scoping review is therefore to review systematically the experiences of patients affected by CHF with healthcare services in Germany in the literature and to map the research foci. Further objectives are to identify gaps in evidence, develop further research questions and to inform decision makers concerned with improving healthcare of patients living with CHF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will be based on a broad search strategy involving systematic and comprehensive electronic database searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL and Cochrane's Database of Systematic Reviews, grey literature searches, as well as hand searches through reference lists and non-indexed key journals. The methodological procedure will be based on an established six-stage framework for conducting scoping reviews that includes two independent reviewers. Data will be systematically extracted, qualitatively and quantitatively analysed and summarised both narratively and visually. To ensure the research questions and extracted information are meaningful, a patient representative will be involved. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval will not be required to conduct this review. Results will be disseminated through a clearly illustrated report that will be part of a wider research project. Furthermore, it is intended that the review's findings should be made available to relevant stakeholders through conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals (knowledge transfer).

Antigen presentation of myelin-derived proteins has been shown to trigger astrocyte response, suggesting that astrocytes can directly sense demyelination. However, the direct response of astrocytes to lipid-debris generated during demyelination has not been investigated. The lipid composition of the myelin sheath is distinct, presenting significant amounts of cerebrosides, sulfocerebrosides (SCB), and ceramides. Studies have shown that microglia are activated in the presence of myelin-derived lipids, pointing to the possibility of lipid-induced astrocyte activation. In this study, a human astrocyte cell line was exposed to liposomes enriched in each myelin lipid component. Although liposome uptake was observed for all compositions, astrocytes had augmented uptake for liposomes containing sulfocerebroside (SCB). This enhanced uptake did not modify their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules or secretion of chemokines. This was in contrast to changes observed in astrocyte cells stimulated with IFNγ. Contrary to human monocytes, astrocytes did not internalize beads in the size-range of liposomes, indicating that liposome uptake is lipid specific. Epifluorescence microscopy corroborated that liposome uptake takes place through endocytosis. Soluble SCB were found to partially block uptake of liposomes containing this same lipid. Endocytosis was not decreased when cells were treated with cytochalasin D, but it was decreased by cold temperature incubation. The specific uptake of SCB in the absence of a proinflammatory response indicates that astrocytes may participate in the trafficking and regulation of sulfocerebroside metabolism and homeostasis in the CNS.","Suesca, Elizabeth; Alejo, Jose Luis; Bolaños, Natalia I; Ocampo, Jackson; Leidy, Chad; González, John M",Cytometry.

CLE lesions can have signs of skin damage including dyspigmentation, scarring, atrophy and/or alopecia. Disease damage secondary to CLE can be cosmetically disfiguring and causes patients significant distress. While many current treatments for CLE focus primarily on reducing inflammation, there are few options for managing disease damage. Providers currently lack strong guidance on managing CLE damage due to the paucity of literature on this topic. Because of this knowledge gap, we aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about the pathogenesis and management of signs of disease damage in CLE. METHODS In this narrative review, Pubmed, Ovid Medline, and Google scholar were searched for relevant articles assessing pathogenesis and treatment of disease damage. RESULTS Therapeutic options for CLE damage, including hyperpigmentation (laser and camouflage), hypopigmentation (melanocyte grafting and camouflage), scarring (laser, dermabrasion and camouflage), atrophy (filler, fat transplantation and flap procedures) and scarring alopecia (hair transplantation and camouflage) were identified. We found that investigations of therapeutics for CLE disease damage primarily consist of case reports and small case series. Reported adverse events due to treatment for CLE disease damage range from temporary erythema and discomfort to disease reactivation and pigmentary defects. CONCLUSIONS There are various treatments for disease damage for each sign of disease damage. However, more robust investigations are needed to assess disease pathogenesis and improve treatments of disease damage due to CLE.","Joseph, Adrienne K; Abbas, Laila F; Chong, Benjamin F",Dermatologic therapy,589,16

HCMV infection profoundly influences the host immune system and, perhaps more than any other human pathogen, has been shown to create a lasting imprint on human T and NK cell compartments. HCMV-seropositivity has been associated with both beneficial effects, such as increased vaccine responsiveness or heterologous protection against infections, and deleterious effects, such as pathological neurodevelopmental sequelae from congenital infection in utero and cumulative damage from chronic lifelong latency into old age. The significance of many of these associations is unclear, as studies into the causal mechanisms linking HCMV and these disease outcomes are lacking; however, HCMV-mediated changes to the immune system may play a key role.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients (n = 69) who underwent liposuction for treatment of lipoedema between 2004 and 2019, and gathered data on patient age, body mass index, the number of liposuction sessions, and the amount of fat removed per side. The study also prospectively evaluated the QoL in 20 lipoedema patients before and after liposuction using the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphatic diseases questionnaire. The mean age was 50.6 ± 12.8 years, and the average number of liposuction sessions performed was 2.9 ± 1.9, with a mean volume of 1868 ± 885.5 mL of fat removed per side. Before treatment with liposuction, disease-specific QoL in patients with lipoedema was low on every single subscale as well as on the global score and showed a significant improvement in all aspects after liposuction. There was a significant correlation between a higher number of liposuction treatment sessions and general health status in lipoedema patients (P = .007). Liposuction greatly improves the QoL in lipoedema patients. A higher number of liposuction treatment sessions seem to have a positive effect on general health status in these patients.","Schlosshauer, Torsten; Heiss, Christian; von Hollen, Ann-Kathrin; Spennato, Stefano; Rieger, Ulrich M",International wound journal,589,16

A large percentage of chronically mentally ill individuals have low HL. They are also at increased risk for hospital readmission and poor self-management skills. This study examined the HL of adult patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, investigated the relationship between HL and psychiatric hospital readmission, and identified differences in readmission rates between HL groups. A prospective, exploratory, descriptive research design was used to examine readmission rates among 30 adult patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder: 16 men (mean age = 37 years, SD ± 12.16) and 14 women (mean age = 41.36 years, SD ± 12.51). The study used an HL questionnaire at or near discharge, and 2- and 4-weeks postdischarge readmissions were tracked. HL strongly correlated with 2-week and total readmissions. The findings support the feasibility of assessing HL further in this patient population, validate the procedure for subsequent studies, and provide preliminary data on the relationship between HL and readmission. The findings may also be useful for patient education, discharge planning, and policy making.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between June 1999 and April 2009, a total of 341 patients with 535 nodules were treated as difficult cases. Artificial pleural effusion assisted ablation was performed on 64 patients with 82 nodules. Artificial ascites-assisted ablation was performed on 11 patients with 13 nodules. Cooling by endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube-assisted ablation was performed on 6 patients with 8 nodules. When the tumors were not well visualized with conventional B-mode ultrasonography (US), contrast-enhanced US-assisted ablation with Levovist or Sonazoid or virtual CT sonography-assisted ablation was performed. Contrast-enhanced US-assisted ablation was performed on 139 patients with 224 nodules and virtual CT sonography-assisted ablation was performed on 121 patients with 209 nodules. RESULTS In total, complete ablation was achieved in 514 of 535 (96%) nodules in difficult cases. For RFA with artificial pleural effusion, artificial ascites and ENBD, complete response was confirmed in all cases. For contrast-enhanced US- and CT sonography-assisted ablation, complete response was 95%. Early complications were recognized in 24 cases (4.5%). All cases recovered with no invasive treatment. Local tumor recurrence was investigated in 377 nodules of 245 patients, and 69 (18%) nodules were positive. Tumor recurrences in each assisted technique were 14.7% in artificial pleural effusion cases, 7% in artificial ascites, 12.5% in ENBD tube cases, 31% in virtual CT sonography, and 8.5% in contrast-enhanced US. CONCLUSION Although local tumor progression needs to be carefully monitored, assisted techniques of RFA for difficult cases are well tolerated and expand the indications of RFA.","Inoue, Tatsuo; Minami, Yasunori; Chung, Hobyung; Hayaishi, Sousuke; Ueda, Taisuke; Tatsumi, Chie; Takita, Masahiro; Kitai, Satoshi; Hatanaka, Kinuyo; Ishikawa, Emi; Yada, Norihisa; Hagiwara, Satoru; Ueshima, Kazuomi; Kudo, Masatoshi",Oncology,589,16

Currently, electroejaculation (EE) is routinely utilized for semen collection in BFFs, a technique that requires custom equipment and experienced operators, and does not consistently yield viable samples in this species. In this case study, we evaluated the feasibility of urethral catheterization (UC) for semen collection, a method predominately tested in domestic and non-domestic felids, on four occasions (three BFF males). After general anesthesia with a combination of ketamine, midazolam and α2-agonist dexmedetomidine (thought to promote semen release into the urethra), a lightly lubricated, flexible feeding tube was passed into the urethral opening and advanced ~7-8 cm into the urethra. A syringe attached to the feeding tube was used to apply mild negative pressure to collect sperm. Semen samples were successfully collected on all four attempts. Sperm characteristics ranged as follows: 10.5-26.0 × 106 sperm/ml concentration, 50-90% motility and 36-61% normal sperm morphology. This is the first report of the use of UC as a potential alternative to EE in the BFF, a more field-friendly technique that is less invasive and more consistent for obtaining samples free of urine contamination.","Mackie, Paula; Chan, Biankha; Franke, Maria; Mastromonaco, Gabriela F",Conservation physiology,589,16

Patient portals and electronic personal health records (ePHRs) are technologies that could better serve populations with the highest health care needs, such as older adults. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the existing research landscape related to patient portal and ePHR use and experience among older adults and to understand the benefits and barriers to older adults' use and adoption of patient portals and ePHRs. METHODS We searched six pertinent bibliographic databases for papers, published from 2006 to 2016 and written in English, that focused on adults 60 years or older and their use of or experience with patient portals or ePHRs. We adapted preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to review papers based on exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then applied thematic analysis to identify key themes around use, experience, and adoption. RESULTS We retrieved 199 papers after an initial screening and removal of duplicate papers. Then we applied an inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a final set of 17 papers that focused on 15 separate projects. The majority of papers described studies involving qualitative research, including interviews and focus groups. They looked at the experience and use of ePHRs and patient portals. Overall, we found 2 main barriers to use: (1) privacy and security and (2) access to and ability to use technology and the Internet. We found 2 facilitators: (1) technical assistance and (2) family and provider advice. We also reported on older adults' experience, including satisfaction with the system and improvement of the quality of their health care. Several studies captured features that older adults wanted from these systems such as further assistance managing health-related tasks and contextual health advice and tips. CONCLUSIONS More research is needed to better understand the patient portal experience among older adults from initial use to adoption. There are also opportunities to explore the role of design in addressing barriers and supporting facilitators to patient portal and ePHR use. Finally, the future use of these systems by older adults should be anticipated and considered in the design process.","Sakaguchi-Tang, Dawn K; Bosold, Alyssa L; Choi, Yong K; Turner, Anne M",JMIR medical informatics,589,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group included 520 students. Survey forms prepared previously in line with the study objective were completed by the students under supervision. The severity of dysmenorrhea was rated with Visual Analogue Scale. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to evaluate the sleep quality. The χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for the analyses. Statistical significance level was accepted at p < 0.05. RESULTS Mean age of the students was 20.23 ± 1.59 years (range 17-25). Frequency of dysmenorrhea was determined to be 69.0% (n = 359). Frequency of dysmenorrhea was higher in smokers, those with menstrual irregularity, those who use drugs for menstrual regulation and those having a family history (p < 0.05 for each). The most frequent symptoms in those having dysmenorrhea history were weakness (59.6%), fatigue (58.5%) and breast tenderness (45.4%), respectively.

It has been shown to offer benefits such as decreased blood loss and ""softening of the tumor"" during subsequent resection. However, the actual benefits remain unclear, and the potential harm of an additional procedure along with the cost of embolization have limited its use to a small proportion of the meningiomas treated. In this article the authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with preoperative embolization of meningiomas over the previous 6 years (March 2007-March 2013). In addition, they performed a MEDLINE search using a combination of the terms ""meningioma,"" ""preoperative,"" and ""embolization"" to analyze the indications, embolizing agents, timing, and complications reported during preoperative embolization of meningiomas. In this retrospective review, 18 cases (female/male ratio 12:6) were identified in which endovascular embolization was used prior to resection of an intracranial meningioma. Craniotomy for tumor resection was performed within 4 days after endovascular embolization in all cases, with an average time to surgery of 1.9 days. The average duration of surgery was 4 hours and 18 minutes, and the average blood loss was 574 ml, with a range of 300-1000 ml. Complications following endovascular therapy were identified in 3 (16.7%) of 18 cases, including one each of transient hemiparesis, permanent hemiparesis, and tumor swelling. The literature review returned 15 articles consisting of a study population greater than 25 patients. No randomized controlled study was found. The use of small polyvinyl alcohol particles (45-150 μm) is more effective in preoperative devascularization than larger particles (150-250 μm), but is criticized due to the higher risk of complications such as cranial nerve palsies and postprocedural hemorrhage. Time to surgery after embolization is inconsistently reported across the articles, and conclusions on the appropriate timing of surgery could not be drawn. The overall complication rate reported after treatment with preoperative meningioma embolization ranges from as high as 21% in some of the older literature to approximately 6% in recent literature describing treatment with newer embolization techniques. The evidence in the literature supporting the use of preoperative meningioma embolization is mainly from case series, and represents Level III evidence. Due to the lack of randomized controlled clinical trials, it is difficult to draw any significant conclusions on the overall usefulness of preoperative embolization during the management of meningiomas to consider it a standard practice.","Singla, Amit; Deshaies, Eric M; Melnyk, Vlad; Toshkezi, Gentian; Swarnkar, Amar; Choi, Hoon; Chin, Lawrence S",Neurosurgical focus,589,1

Computer science education was both well-positioned for this change and faced unique challenges, e.g. that students often need significant (in-person) support with programming. In this study we examine how aspects of students' remote learning experience in spring 2020 compared to the same aspects in previous in-person, pre-COVID offerings of 6 lower- to mid-division computer science courses at UC San Diego (UCSD), a large US research university. We were in a unique position to make this comparison because we had been collecting data on several aspects of students' course experiences throughout the 2019-2020 academic year. We found, surprisingly, that most elements of students' experiences that we examined were unchanged, or even improved, in spring 2020. Students in spring reported similar or lower stress levels and found their courses similarly or less challenging relative to previous quarters. However, some aspects did degrade. Students had less connection with their peers (particularly in introductory classes), more interference from family obligations, and higher drop/fail rates in some classes. Surprisingly, these results hold across all assessed demographics. Our results indicate that the actions UCSD and its CS instructors took to mitigate the stresses of remote learning in spring 2020 were largely successful and provide implications for improving education beyond the pandemic. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Lewis, M.; Deng, Z.; Krause-Levy, S.; Salguero, A.; Griswold, W.

Studies on COVID-19 recovered patients are scarce. Thus, there is a need to add granularity to our existing knowledge about the course and long-term effects of the infection. Aim: To describe the clinical details and risk factors of post-COVID sequelae in the North Indian population. Method: This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary healthcare centre in Northern India between October 2020 to February 2021. Patients aged >18 years with a confirmed COVID-19 disease were recruited after at least two weeks of diagnosis and interviewed for any post-COVID-19 symptoms. Results: Of 1234 patients recruited, who were followed up for a median duration of 91 days (IQR: 45-181 days), 495 (40.11%) patients had symptoms. In 223 (18.1%) patients, the symptoms resolved within four weeks, 150 (12.1%) patients had symptoms till twelve weeks, and 122 (9.9%) patients had symptoms beyond twelve weeks of diagnosis of COVID-19.

The major determinants of developing post-COVID-19 symptoms in the patients were hypothyroidism and the severity of the disease. Conclusion: Most often, patients complain of myalgias, fatigue, dyspnoea, cough and disturbed sleep. Patients who are hypothyroid or have recovered from moderate to severe COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing post-COVID sequelae.

World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 was a “public health emergency”. The number of patients with COVID-19 and deaths from this disease are increasing every day, so the issue of diagnosis and treatment of this serious pathology remains relevant. Goal. To identify the key lung lesion patterns in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during digital radiological examination. To identify its capabilities in assessing the prevalence and dynamics of radiological manifestations of lung damage. Material and methods. The analysis of data of radiological examination of 1, 075 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in moderate and severe conditions, who were treated in MNPE KRC “Regional Clinical Specialized Dispensary for Radiation Protection” in the period from June to November 2020 has been carried out. All the patients were given digital radiography at the time of treatment. To assess the dynamics the control examination depending on the clinical manifestations was held. The images were evaluated by two independent radiologists. Pathological changes manifested in the form of matte, consolidation of parenchyma and reticular pattern. Results. The majority of the total number of the surveyed patients falls on the age group between 50 and 75 years old - 789 patients (73.4%). The most common pattern of lung lesion on the primary radiograph is a GGO symptom (82.7%), and in control examination there was an increase in the frequency of consolidation (53.4%), and then - fibrous changes of varying severity (62.5%). Bilateral lesion was detected in 74.8% of cases. Middle-lower and lower lobes of the lungs were more often affected. Conclusions. OCC CT should be used to detect pathological changes in COVID-19 in the early stages, and digital radiography can identify characteristic signs of lung lesion in inpatients with moderate to severe Coronavirus disease and is sufficient to assess the dynamics of the pathological process. Digital radiography method should be included in the examination protocol of patients in moderate and severe conditions in the hospital due to the impossibility or difficulty of their transportation. If repeated examination in such patients is necessary much higher dose load on CT compared to digital radiography should be taken into account. © Spuziak R. M., Ulko R. V., Maksimishyn O.

Peripheral blood films have shown changes in white blood cell (WBC) morphology and counts, as well as platelet abnormalities. Atypical and reactive lymphocytes may also be observed in the blood film, which suggests mild leukoerythroblastosis. Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the hematological and morphological changes in the peripheral blood smear of patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study was conducted on 175 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Blood samples were collected from the patients and examined for the estimation of blood parameters, differential cell count, and presence of atypical lymphocytes. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.73 years, and males constituted 52.6% of the patients. The majority had normal hemoglobin levels. WBC count was normal in 60.6% of the patients, while 74.3% had normal platelet count, and thrombocytope-nia was detected in 23.4%. In addition, differential WBC count indicated that 56.6% of the patients had normal neutrophils, while lymphopenia was detected in 28 and 77.7% had a low eosinophil count. The peripheral blood smears showed atypical lymphocytes with deeply basophilic cytoplasm in 21.14% of the patients. Conclusions: Blood film examination may show multiple abnormal findings in patients with COVID-19 infection.

An understanding of evidence synthesis is important for people to make truly informed healthcare decisions. There is an increasing focus on the use of knowledge translation resources within healthcare; however, the development of these resources has often been poorly described or studied. Objectives: This study employs a user-centred approach to develop a video animation resource to explain the purpose, use and importance of evidence synthesis to the general public regarding healthcare decision-making. Methods: We employed a user-centred approach to developing a spoken animated video that could explain evidence synthesis to a public audience, conducting several cycles of idea generation, prototyping, user-testing, analysis and refinement. Six researchers with expertise in evidence synthesis and knowledge translation resource development gave input on the key messages of the video animation and informed the first draft of the storyboard and script. Seven members of the public provided feedback on this draft through Think-aloud interviews, which we used to develop a video animation prototype. Seven additional members of the public participated in Think-aloud interviews while watching the video prototype. In addition to interviews, participants completed a questionnaire that collected data on perceived usefulness, desirability, clarity and credibility. One experienced patient and public involvement (PPI) advocate also provided feedback on the script and prototype. At the end of each feedback cycle, we assimilated all data and made necessary changes, resulting in a final, rendered version of the animation video. Results: Researchers identified the initial key messages for the SAV as 1) the importance of evidence synthesis, 2) what an evidence synthesis is and 3) how evidence synthesis can impact healthcare decision-making. Using guidance and feedback from members of the public, we produced a three-and-a-half-minute video animation that members of the public rated 9/10 for usefulness, 8/10 for desirability, 8/10 for clarity and 9/10 for credibility. The video was uploaded on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZR0xQmZVQg) and has been viewed over 5500 times to date. Conclusions: Employing a user-centred approach, we developed a video animation knowledge translation resource to explain evidence synthesis to the general public that was assessed as useful, desirable and clear by its intended target audience. This study describes the structured and systematic development of this knowledge translation resource and how key stakeholders and end-users informed the final output.","Deliv, C.; Putnam, E.; Devane, D.; Healy, P.; Hall, A.; Rosenbaum, S.; Toomey, E.",,589,27

Upon binding to target cells, the antibody’s constant (Fc) domain recruits complement component C1 to initiate a proteolytic cascade that generates lytic pores and stimulates phagocytosis. The C1 complex (C1qr2s2) consists of the large recognition protein C1q and a heterotetramer of proteases C1r and C1s (C1r2s2). While interactions between C1 and IgG-Fc’s are believed to be mediated by the globular heads of C1q, we here find that C1r2s2 proteases affect the capacity of C1q to form an avid complex with surface-bound IgG molecules (on various DNP-coated surfaces and pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus). The extent to which C1r2s2 contribute to C1q-IgG stability strongly differs between human IgG subclasses. Using antibody engineering of monoclonal IgG we reveal that hexamer-enhancing mutations improve C1q-IgG stability, both in absence and presence of C1r2s2. In addition, hexamer-enhanced IgGs targeting S. aureus mediate improved complement-dependent phagocytosis by human neutrophils. Altogether, these molecular insights into complement binding to surface-bound IgGs could be important for optimal design of antibody therapies.","Zwarthoff, Seline A.; Widmer, Kevin; Kuipers, Annemarie; Strasser, Jürgen; Ruyken, Maartje; Aerts, Piet C.; de Haas, Carla J.C.; Ugurlar, Deniz; Vidarsson, Gestur; Van Strijp, Jos A.

Employees of LTCF, who are facing a critical epidemiological situation endangering the vulnerable residents, are exposed to pandemic’s psychological consequences daily.ObjectivesThe main aim of this study was to assess psychological consequences (somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression) among LTCF employees exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis. Moreover, we investigated if factors such as: personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, safety guidelines or access to psychiatric and psychological support at the workplace, correlated with the level of psychological distress experienced by personnel.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among personnel of LTCF in Poland. The survey consisted of the sociodemographic section, the authors’ questionnaire with questions related to COVID-19 exposure, working conditions, access to PPE and mental health services, GHQ Questionnaire-28.Resultsshow that access to PPE (P= .018), to workplace safety guidelines (P= .031), psychological support at workplace (P<0.01), fixed shift schedule (P= .05) and feeling that the right number of staff are employed in the workplace (P= .009), were related to the lower severity of psychopathological symptoms evaluated with the GHQ-28.ConclusionsThe study indicates an evidence that LTCF personnel are susceptible to the development of anxiety, depression, insomnia and social dysfunction during the pandemic crisis. However, these can be modified by: access to PPE, safety guidelines and psychological support.

Canonically, MYC up-regulation in luminal prostate cancer cells functions to oppose the terminally differentiating effects of AR. However, the effects of MYC up-regulation are pleiotropic and inconsistent with a poorly proliferative phenotype. Here we show that increased MYC expression and activity are associated with the down-regulation of MEIS1, a HOX-family transcription factor. Using RNA-seq to profile a series of human prostate cancer specimens laser capture microdissected on the basis of MYC immunohistochemistry, MYC activity and MEIS1 expression were inversely correlated. Knockdown of MYC expression in prostate cancer cells increased expression of MEIS1 and increased occupancy of MYC at the MEIS1 locus. Finally, we show in laser capture microdissected human prostate cancer samples and the prostate TCGA cohort that MEIS1 expression is inversely proportional to AR activity as well as HOXB13, a known interacting protein of both AR and MEIS1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevated MYC in a subset of primary prostate cancers functions in a negative role in regulating MEIS1 expression, and that this down-regulation may contribute to MYC-driven development and progression.","Whitlock, Nichelle C.; Trostel, Shana Y.; Wilkinson, Scott; Terrigino, Nicholas T.; Hennigan, S.

Surgical gowns are worn as one of the intraoperative strategies for infection prevention. The present study investigated whether the gowns remained sterile during the surgical procedure. Furthermore, this study examined which parts of the surgical gown were more prone to contamination. Methods The sterility of the gowns was investigated during eight total joint arthroplasties all of which were performed by four surgeons. The samples were taken from the arms and frontal part of the sterile gowns pre- and postoperatively. In the anterior surface of the gown, the sampling was initiated at a strip with 50 cm height from the ground followed by the strips with 15 cm distances from caudal to cephalad. Furthermore, the frontal part of the gown was divided into three parts in relation to the operating room table. Finally, the contamination rate was evaluated in each part. A semiquantitative method was used for the analysis of bacterial culture. Results Before the operation, there were four samples tested positive for bacterial culture (1.06%). All of these samples were taken from the most proximal strip near the neckline. After the surgery, the rate of contamination in the strips on the frontal part of the gown was reported as 3.1% to 53%. Based on the operating table, the contamination rate was 35.9%, 8.9%, and 47.3% in the distal, middle, and proximal parts of the gown, respectively. The contamination rate at the elbow crease was 23%, and at 5 and 10 cm above the creases were 24% and 36%, respectively. Conclusion The high rate of gown contamination during the operation is concerning. However, part of the gown that was in contact with the operating room table remained clean most of the time. More safe strategies should be used for infection prevention in operating rooms.","Qoreishi, Mohamad; Abbasian, Mohammadreza; Safdari, Farshad",The archives of bone and joint surgery,589,7

The most striking in vivo example of ADE in humans is dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease in which ADE is thought to increase the severity of clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection by increasing virus replication. We examine the epidemiological impact of ADE on the prevalence and persistence of viral serotypes. Using a dynamical system model of n cocirculating dengue serotypes, we find that ADE may provide a competitive advantage to those serotypes that undergo enhancement compared with those that do not, and that this advantage increases with increasing numbers of cocirculating serotypes. Paradoxically, there are limits to the selective advantage provided by increasing levels of ADE, because greater levels of enhancement induce large amplitude oscillations in incidence of all dengue virus infections, threatening the persistence of both the enhanced and nonenhanced serotypes. Although the models presented here are specifically designed for dengue, our results are applicable to any epidemiological system in which partial immunity increases pathogen replication rates. Our results suggest that enhancement is most advantageous in settings where multiple serotypes circulate and where a large host population is available to support pathogen persistence during the deep troughs of ADE-induced large amplitude oscillations of virus replication.","Cummings, Derek A T; Schwartz, Ira B; Billings, Lora; Shaw, Leah B; Burke, Donald S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,589,28

The clinical course, laboratory data, SARS-CoV antibody titers, and results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were studied. Significantly higher left ventricular index of myocardial performance (IMP) (0.42+/-0.13 versus 0.33+/-0.09, P<0.001), longer isovolumic relaxation time (102.9+/-15.7 versus 81.6+/-14.7 ms, P<0.001), lower flow propagation velocity (69.6+/-15.7 versus 83.8+/-19.7 cm/s, P=0.011), and Doppler-derived cardiac output (4.69+/-1.01 versus 5.49+/-1.04 L/min, P<0.001) were observed during acute infection when compared with those at 30 days. No significant valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension was found. At baseline, a lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (65.3+/-12.8% versus 71.4+/-5.7%, P=0.03) and a higher mean IMP (0.51+/-0.11 versus 0.40+/-0.12, P=0.017) were found in patients who required mechanical ventilation. A decrease in LVEF correlated moderately with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (r=-0.605, P<0.001), whereas a higher IMP correlated weakly with an increase in creatine kinase level (r=0.38, P=0.016).

We also aimed to assess the use of parent collection to obtain an adequate respiratory specimen from acutely unwell children in the community. PATIENTS AND METHODS The community epidemiology and burden of human metapneumovirus and other respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and picornaviruses) were examined in a cohort of 234 preschool-aged children from Melbourne, Australia, over a 12-month period by using polymerase chain reaction testing. Parents collected a daily symptom diary for the duration of the study and were taught to collect a combined nose-throat swab and complete an impact diary when the study child had an acute respiratory illness. RESULTS The average incidence of acute respiratory illness was 0.48 per child-month for the duration of the study, with a winter peak. Of 543 illnesses with > or = 1 specimen returned, 33 were positive for human metapneumovirus (6.1%) and 18 for human coronavirus NL63 (3.3%). Of all of the viruses for which we tested, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus NL63 were most strongly linked to child care attendance, occurring in 82% and 78% of infected children, respectively. Picornaviruses were the most commonly identified virus group (269 [49.5%]). Influenza virus and adenovirus illnesses had the greatest impact, with fever in more than three quarters and requiring, on average, > 1 local doctor visit per illness. CONCLUSIONS Recently identified human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus NL63 are important pathogens in community-based illness in children, particularly in those who attend child care. Picornaviruses were detected in half of the nose-throat swabs collected during acute respiratory illness in children but resulted in milder illnesses; influenza and adenovirus caused the highest-impact illnesses.

At least three coronavirus strains within group 2 expressed a structural protein with sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity, distinguishing them from other members of group 2, which encode an enzyme specific for 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid. The esterases of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains S and JHM and puffinosis virus (PV) specifically hydrolysed 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac2) as well as the synthetic substrates p-nitrophenyl acetate, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate and fluorescein diacetate.

Methods: The authors queried Google Trends for over 100 oculofacial plastic surgery terms. The main outcome measure was the top 50 oculofacial plastic surgery-related search terms from 2004 to 2020. Secondary outcomes were trends, including seasonality, and search volume changes during the COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020) compared to 2018-2019. Terms were analyzed individually and in thematic categories; controlled against generic search terms to account for general internet traffic. Results: Between 2004 and 2020, searches for oculofacial plastic surgery altogether increased, surpassing the rate of internet traffic growth. One thematic category - eyelid malpositions - decreased month-over-month. The top five terms were ""face lift,"" ""Bell's palsy,"" ""puffy eyes,"" ""dark circles under eyes,"" and ""chalazion."" Eyelid neoplasms searches peaked in summer (R2 = 0.880) whereas cosmetic (R2 = 0.862), symptoms (R 2 = 0.907), and surgeries (R 2 = 0.140) peaked in winter. Overall, oculofacial-related searches decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown, although thyroid eye disease interest increased compared to 2018 or 2019 (+68.6%; adj. p = .005). Oculofacial plastic surgery interest in 2020 was inversely correlated to ""COVID-19"" searches (r = -0.76, p < .001). Conclusions: Oculofacial plastic surgery searches increased since 2004 at a pace greater than that ascribed to internet traffic growth. The most searched terms were ""face lift,"" ""Bell's palsy,"" ""puffy eyes,"" ""dark circles under eyes,"" and ""chalazion.""

The current healthcare ecosystem, which is centered on the treatment of established foot disease, often fails to adequately control key reversible risk factors to prevent diabetic foot ulcers leading to unacceptable high foot disease amputation rate, 40% recurrence of ulcers rate in the first year, and high hospital admissions. Thus, the latest diabetic foot ulcer guidelines emphasize that a paradigm shift in research priority from siloed hospital treatments to innovative integrated community prevention is now critical to address the high diabetic foot ulcer burden. The widespread uptake and acceptance of wearable and digital health technologies provide a means to timely monitor major risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer, empower patients in self-care, and effectively deliver the remote monitoring and multi-disciplinary prevention needed for those at-risk people and address the health care access disadvantage that people living in remote areas. This narrative review paper summarizes some of the latest innovations in three specific areas, including technologies supporting triaging high-risk patients, technologies supporting care in place, and technologies empowering self-care. While many of these technologies are still in infancy, we anticipate that in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic and current unmet needs to decentralize care for people with foot disease, we will see a new wave of innovations in the area of digital health, smart wearables, telehealth technologies, and ""hospital-at-home"" care delivery model. These technologies will be quickly adopted at scale to improve remote management of diabetic foot ulcers, smartly triaging those who need to be seen in outpatient or inpatient clinics, and supporting acute or subacute care at home.","Najafi, Bijan; Mishra, Ramkinker",Medicina (Kaunas),589,15

However, prominent regions of hypoxia are a common feature of infected and inflamed tissues and many chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases are associated with mucosal and systemic hypoxia. The airway epithelium represents a key interface with the external environment and is the first line of defense against potentially harmful agents including respiratory pathogens. The protective arsenal of the airway epithelium is provided in the form of physical barriers, and the production of an array of antimicrobial host defense molecules, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in response to activation by receptors. Dysregulation of the airway epithelial innate immune response is associated with a compromised immunity and chronic inflammation of the lung. An increasing body of evidence indicates a distinct role for hypoxia in the dysfunction of the airway epithelium and in the responses of both innate immunity and of respiratory pathogens. Here we review the current evidence around the role of tissue hypoxia in modulating the host-pathogen interaction at the airway epithelium. Furthermore, we highlight the work needed to delineate the role of tissue hypoxia in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in addition to novel respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the epithelial-pathogen interactions in the setting of hypoxia will enable better understanding of persistent infections and complex disease processes in chronic inflammatory lung diseases and may aid the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies.","Page, Lee K; Staples, Karl J; Spalluto, C Mirella; Watson, Alastair; Wilkinson, Tom M A",Front Immunol,589,16

Quantitative real-time PCR and CRISPR-based methods rapidly detect DNA/RNA in 1 h but suffer from inter-site variability. Absolute quantification of DNA/RNA by methods such as digital PCR reduce this variability but are currently too slow for wider application. Here, we report a RApid DIgital Crispr Approach (RADICA) for absolute quantification of nucleic acids in 40-60 min. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a proof-of-concept target, RADICA allows for absolute quantification with a linear dynamic range of 0.6-2027 copies/µL (R2 value > 0.99), high accuracy and low variability, no cross-reactivity to similar targets, and high tolerance to human background DNA. RADICA's versatility is validated against other targets such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from human B cells and patients' serum. RADICA can accurately detect and absolutely quantify EBV DNA with similar dynamic range of 0.5-2100 copies/µL (R2 value > 0.98) in 1 h without thermal cycling, providing a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based detection. RADICA therefore enables rapid and sensitive absolute quantification of nucleic acids which can be widely applied across clinical, research, and biomanufacturing areas.","Wu, Xiaolin; Tay, Joshua K; Goh, Chuan Keng; Chan, Cheryl; Lee, Yie Hou; Springs, Stacy L; Wang, De Yun; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lu, Timothy K; Yu, Hanry",Biomaterials,589,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case series of all sequential patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with TCZ at an Academic Spanish hospital (March 12 - May 2, 2020). Clinical outcomes: death, length of hospital stay. An early clinical response to TCZ (48-72 h after the administration) was assessed by variations in respiratory function markers, Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS), inflammatory parameters, and patients' and physicians' opinion. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: From a cohort of 236 patients, 77 patients treated with TCZ were included (median age 62 years (IQR 53.0-72.0), 64.9% were males), 42.9% had Charlson index &#8805;3; hypertension (41.6%), obesity (34.7%), and diabetes (20.8%). Median follow-up was 83.0 days (78.0-86.5), no patient was readmitted. ICU admission was required for 42 (54.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation in 38 (49.4%) and 10 patients died (12.9% global, 23.8% at ICU admitted).

No coincidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection has outbreak around the world from January 2020 to the present, April 2020, as ever predicted to reoccur based on its predecessor, SARS-CoV, that have prevalence been high since January, February, March, April, until early May 2003. As opposed to other seasons, summer has low atmospheric pressure as its exemption that provenly causes virus inactivation. Conclusions: The denotative nature of SARS-CoV-2 seems to reflect its predecessor, SARS-CoV, which begins nearing the end of the year and reaches its optimum hence in spring, thereafter, finally ends in summer. Low atmospheric pressure in the summer impresses that it is the potential cause of ending the outbreak by deactivating SARS-CoV-2, apart from the hot temperature of weather. The knowledge to be gained here is further closely correlated to the fact that coronavirus is able to have genetic recombination that may bring about new genotypes and, consequently, outbreaks later occurring.","Amin, Firman Zulkifli; Sari, Mila Kurnia; Amin, Zulkifli",Internet J.

Very little data exist on the attitudes and views of health professionals on providing nutrition care to this patient cohort delivered by electronic health methods. COVID-19 has fast-tracked the adoption of digital health care provision, so it is more important than ever to understand the needs of health professionals in providing health care via these modes. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of health professionals on providing nutrition care to upper gastrointestinal cancer patients by electronic methods to allow the future scaling-up of acceptable delivery methods. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and recorded, de-identified and transcribed. Thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo Pro 12. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted on 13 health professionals from a range of disciplines across several public and private health institutions. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) the ideal model, (2) barriers to the ideal model and (3) how to implement and translate the ideal model. Health professionals viewed the provision of nutrition interventions as an essential part of an upper gastrointestinal cancer patient's treatment with synchronous, telephone-based internal health service models of nutrition care overwhelmingly seen as the most acceptable model of delivery. Mobile application-based delivery methods were deemed too challenging for the current population serviced by these clinicians. CONCLUSION: The use of novel technology for delivering nutrition care to people receiving treatment for upper gastrointestinal cancers was not widely accepted as the preferred method of delivery by health professionals.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using database that included: demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, medications and clinical outcomes of all patients hospitalized in Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between March 12, 2020 and December 1st 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 infected patients. RESULTS: In total,1002 patients with COVID-19 infection with mean age of the cohort was 54±16 years (65% (n=650) male) were included, with an overall and intensive care unit (ICU) mortalities of 26% (n=257) and 42% (n=199/473), respectively. The prevalence of ICU admission was 47% (n=473) and the need for mechanical ventilation was 41% (n=413). The overall length of stay in the ICU was 13 (9-21) days. Adjusting for other factors in the model, the multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that in-hospital mortality in admitted COVID-19 patients was associated with old age (p<0.001), heart diseases (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-3.03; p=0.018), liver diseases (aOR, 4.48; 95% CI: 1.04-19.3; p=0.044), those with higher ferritin levels (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.00; p=0.006), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR, 3.20; 95% CI: 1.65-6.18; p=0.001), sepsis (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI: 1.12-2.80; p=0.022), and those that had ICU admission (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.12-4.38; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high and was associated with advanced age, heart diseases, liver disease, high ferritin, ARDS, sepsis and ICU admission. These high-risk groups should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations.","Khamis, Faryal; Memish, Ziad; Bahrani, Maher Al; Dowaiki, Samata Al; Pandak, Nenad; Bolushi, Zakaryia Al; Salmi, Issa Al; Al-Zakwani, Ibrahim",J Infect Public Health,589,16

Though the virus is considered as a novel entity, it is not a completely new member. It is just a new version of previously emerged human SARS corona virus. The rapid evolving nature by changing host body environment and extreme environmental stability, collectively makes SARS-CoV-2 into an extremely virulent genetic variant. The evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation, through mutation, deletion and genetic recombinationevents. Different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure. By the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters. Then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect. Moreover, extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission. Thus both the host body or internal environment and the external environment performs equally as a source, responsible for shaping the genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 towards theCOVID-19 disease fitness in nature in a pandemic form.","Das, Piyanki; Choudhuri, Tathagata",VirusDisease,589,21

Two key factors have contributed to the catastrophic extent of the disease in several countries: – Most of the known COVID-19 hotspots were locally preceded by massive gatherings of up to several hundred-thousand people (sporting events, religious pilgrimages etc.). – Widespread, mostly subclinical infection of health care workers (HCW) in the hospitals of the hotspot regions inabled a crucial dramatic virus transmission to elderly population. Replication of the former factor for virus spread is actually stoped by measures preventing people from as-sembling. However, HCW represent at least 11% of the total infected population and they still suffer from suboptimal availability of protective gear. The following targeted steps are proposed: 1. Continuous periodic PCR “pooled testing” of at least all frontline and hospital based HCW (optimally all HCW) at 7-day intervals and strict immediate quarantine of all SARS-CoV-2 positive persons. 2. Early targeted clinical examination of all symptomatic COVID-19 patients together with assessment of the several biomarkers (mainly parameters of inflammation, thrombophilia, and organ damage – heart and liver) aiming at early risk stratification. Thus, this proposal represents a complementary sustainable strategy to general anti-epidemic measures it could be of help to achieve 3 crucial goals: 1. To minimize virus spread in and from health-care facilities; 2. To protect HCW; 3. To identify COVID-19 patients at high risk for adverse, frequently lethal, outcome.

In the period from November 2020 to February 2021, data were collected from 296 healthcare workers through the GAD-7 generalized anxiety questionnaire, as well as through self-assessment of their physical and mental health status, and the degree of perceiving the coronavirus as a threat. The results show that about one-third of the participating healthcare workers experienced mild generalized anxiety, and about one-fifth of them, moderate or severe symptoms of anxiety. Health professionals with the highest generalized anxiety were younger, with deteriorated physical and mental health (not only subjectively estimated by the participants but also objectively diagnosed health workers with coronavirus), less religious, having an intimate partner. More perceived threat of coronavirus was associated with increased generalized anxiety in healthcare professionals. Healthcare workers with a higher level of generalized anxiety were more likely to have difficulties doing their jobs, taking care of things at home, or getting along with other people. The anxiety experienced is of immense importance for the functioning of the individual. It is recommendable for healthcare specialists to feel that they receive social support to reduce their anxiety levels and to better balance their work and personal life, having more free time to take care of themselves and their close relationships. © 2021 The Author(s).

Hence, finding effective medications or repurposing available ones could offer great help during this serious situation. During our anti-COVID-19 investigation of microbial natural products (MNPs), we came across α-rubromycin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces collinus ATCC19743, which was able to suppress the catalytic activity (IC50 = 5.4 µM and Ki = 3.22 µM) of one of the viral key enzymes (i.e., MPro). However, it showed high cytotoxicity toward normal human fibroblasts (CC50 = 16.7 µM). To reduce the cytotoxicity of this microbial metabolite, we utilized a number of in silico tools (ensemble docking, molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation) to propose a novel scaffold having the main pharmacophoric features to inhibit MPro with better drug-like properties and reduced/minimal toxicity. Nevertheless, reaching this novel scaffold synthetically is a time-consuming process, particularly at this critical time. Instead, this scaffold was used as a template to explore similar molecules among the FDA-approved medications that share its main pharmacophoric features with the aid of pharmacophore-based virtual screening software. As a result, cromoglicic acid (aka cromolyn) was found to be the best hit, which, upon in vitro MPro testing, was 4.5 times more potent (IC50 = 1.1 µM and Ki = 0.68 µM) than α-rubromycin, with minimal cytotoxicity toward normal human fibroblasts (CC50 &gt;100 µM). This report highlights the potential of MNPs in providing unprecedented scaffolds with a wide range of therapeutic efficacy. It also revealed the importance of cheminformatics tools in speeding up the drug discovery process, which is extremely important in such a critical situation.","Alhadrami, Hani A.; Sayed, Ahmed M.; Al-Khatabi, Heba Alhakamy Nabil A.; Rateb, Mostafa E.",Pharmaceuticals,589,20

METHODS: In June 2020, 111 patients with cancer treated in the supportive care unit of a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Milan and 201 healthy controls from the general population were enrolled and assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively for fears and COVID-19-related beliefs as well as for QoL. RESULTS: Fear of COVID-19 was significantly lower among patients (41% vs 57.6%; p = 0.007), as was fear of cancer (61.5% vs 85.6%; p < 0.001) and other diseases. The perceived risk of getting COVID-19 was lower among patients (25.2% vs 52.7%; p < 0.001), as was the belief of having been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (18.1% vs 40.8%; p < 0.001). The physical component of QoL was better among the population (54.5 vs 43.8; p < 0.001); the reverse was true for patients' psychological well-being (44.6 vs 39.6; p < 0.001). The qualitative data supported such results, showing a reduced psychological effect on the patients with cancer compared to the controls. Various reasons explain this result, including the awareness of being treated for cancer and nevertheless protected against getting infected in a cancer center of public health reorganized to continue treating patients by protecting them and personnel from the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of a cancer diagnosis, together with proper hospital reorganization, may act as protective factors from fears and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ripamonti, Carla Ida; Massa, Giacomo; Insolvibile, Daniela; Guglielmo, Mauro; Miccinesi, Guido; Regalia, Camillo; Saita, Emanuela; Pagnini, Francesco",Tumori,589,15

The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis making them potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the stem-loop II motif, a highly conserved noncoding RNA element. Based on our homology model we determined that the G to U transversion in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif (S2MG35U) forms a C-U base-pair isosteric to the C-G base-pair in the early 2000's SARS-CoV (S2M). In addition, chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S2MG35U conformational profile is altered compared to S2M in the apical loop region. We explored S2MG35U as a potential drug target by docking a library of FDA approved drugs. Enzymatic probing of the best docking ligands (aminoglycosides and polymyxins) indicated that polymyxin binding alters the conformational profile and/or secondary structure of the RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif conformational differences due to nucleotide transversion and ligand binding are highly significant and provide insight for future drug discovery efforts since the conformation of noncoding RNA elements affects their function.","Aldhumani, Ali H; Hossain, Md Ismail; Fairchild, Emily A; Boesger, Hannah; Marino, Emily C; Myers, Mason; Hines, Jennifer V",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,589,26

Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. METHODS: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.","Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K; Fadel, William F; Duszynski, Thomas J; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir",PLoS One,589,26

The increasing evidence of an associated relevant prothrombotic coagulopathy has resulted in an increasing use of antithrombotic doses higher than usual in COVID-19 patients. Information on the benefit/risk ratio of this approach is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of relevant bleeding complications in association with the antithrombotic strategy and its relationship with the amount of drug. METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 were included in a retrospective analysis. Major bleedings (MB) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) were obtained from patient medical records and were adjudicated by an independent committee. RESULTS: Of the 324 patients who were recruited, 240 had been treated with prophylactic doses and 84 with higher doses of anticoagulants. The rate of the composite endpoint of MB or CRNMB was 6.9 per 100-person/months in patients who had been given prophylactic doses, and 26.4 per 100-person/months in those who had been prescribed higher doses (hazard ratio, 3.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.90-7.97). The corresponding rates for overall mortality were 12.2 and 20.1 per 100-person/months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of relevant bleeding events was high in patients treated with (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. In the latter group, overall mortality did not differ from that of patients treated with standard prophylactic doses and was even higher. Our result does not support a strategy of giving (sub)therapeutic doses of anticoagulants in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Pesavento, Raffaele; Ceccato, Davide; Pasquetto, Giampaolo; Monticelli, Jacopo; Leone, Lucia; Frigo, Annachiara; Gorgi, Davide; Postal, Anna; Marchese, Giuseppe Maria; Cipriani, Alberto; Saller, Alois; Sarais, Cristiano; Criveller, Pietro; Gemelli, Marco; Capone, Federico; Fioretto, Paola; Pagano, Claudio; Rossato, Marco; Avogaro, Angelo; Simioni, Paolo; Prandoni, Paolo; Vettor, Roberto",J. thromb. haemost,589,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from ""nonsevere"" toward ""nonsurvived"" via ""severe and survived"" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients.","Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Tan, Ge; Dong, Xiang; Wang, Bin-Chen; Lin, Jun; Yan, You-Qin; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Mübeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,589,10

Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. An additional twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2-positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by several immunoassays was performed.

In addition to reduced lung compliance and ventilation/perfusion mismatch, a blunted hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction has been hypothesized, that could explain part of the peculiar pathophysiology of the COVID-19 cardiorespiratory syndrome. However, no invasive haemodynamic characterization of COVID-19 patients has been reported so far. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients underwent right heart catheterization. Their data were compared both with those obtained from non-mechanically ventilated paired control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index, and with pooled data of 1937 patients with 'typical' acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from a systematic literature review. Cardiac index was higher in COVID-19 patients than in controls [3.8 (2.7-4.5) vs. 2.4 (2.1-2.8) L/min/m2 , P < 0.001], but slightly lower than in ARDS patients (P = 0.024). Intrapulmonary shunt and lung compliance were inversely related in COVID-19 patients (r = -0.57, P = 0.011) and did not differ from ARDS patients. Despite this, pulmonary vascular resistance of COVID-19 patients was normal, similar to that of control subjects [1.6 (1.1-2.5) vs. 1.6 (0.9-2.0) WU, P = 0.343], and lower than reported in ARDS patients (P < 0.01). Pulmonary hypertension was present in 76% of COVID-19 patients and in 19% of control subjects (P < 0.001), and it was always post-capillary. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure was higher in COVID-19 than in ARDS patients, and inversely related to lung compliance (r = -0.46, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The haemodynamic profile of COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation is characterized by combined cardiopulmonary alterations.

On 10 March, the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was admitted to Hvidovre Hospital. METHODS: Retrospective case review of individuals 18 years or older who were admitted consecutively to Hvidovre Hospital from 10 March through 23 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 175 individuals were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. The median age was 71 years, 48.6% were male and 71% had at least one co-morbidity. The most commonly presenting symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever. The majority of patients had lymphopenia, elevated liver function tests and C-reactive protein. Nearly two in three presented with multilobar infiltration by chest X-ray. Respiratory failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation developed in 27 patients (15.4%). By 20 April, 23 of 175 (13.1%) patients remained hospitalised, 43 (24.6%) had died and 109 (62.3%) had been discharged. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of COVID-19 at presentation were similar to those seen in other reports. Our population was older, slightly overrepresented by women and had a high level of co-morbidity. COVID-19 admittance was associated with frequent need of intensive care and mechanical ventilation that was associated with a very high mortality. FUNDING: none.

We build a (weighted) commute network on counties, with the weight between two counties a decreasing function of their traffic distance. We introduce a network-based disease model, in which the number of newly confirmed cases of each county depends on the numbers of hidden cases of all counties on the network. Our proposed testing allocation strategy first uses historical data to learn model parameters and then decides the testing rates for all counties by solving an optimization problem. We apply the method on the commute networks of Massachusetts, USA and Hubei, China and observe its advantages over testing allocation strategies that ignore the network structure.

Misinformation about abortion is pervasive and propagated by state-mandated scripts that contain abortion myths. We sought to investigate women's knowledge of abortion laws in their state. Our secondary objective was to describe women's ability to discern myths about abortion from facts about abortion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 18-49 in the United States. We enrolled members of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally-representative online sample. Our primary outcome was the proportion of correct answers to 12 questions about laws regulating abortion in a respondent's state. We asked five questions about common abortion myths. We used descriptive statistics to characterize performance on these measures and bivariate and multivariate modeling to identify risk factors for poor knowledge of state abortion laws. RESULTS: Of 2223 women contacted, 1057 (48%) completed the survey. The mean proportion of correct answers to 12 law questions was 18% (95% CI 17-20%). For three of five assessed myths, women endorsed myths about abortion over facts. Those who believe abortion should be illegal (aOR 2.18, CI 1.40-3.37), and those living in states with neutral or hostile state policies toward abortion (neutral aOR 1.99, CI 1.34-2.97; hostile aOR 1.6, CI 1.07-2.36) were at increased odds of poor law knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Women had low levels of knowledge about state abortion laws and commonly endorse abortion myths. Women's knowledge of their state's abortion laws was associated with personal views about abortion and their state policy environment. IMPLICATIONS: Supporters of reproductive rights can use these results to show policy makers that their constituents are unlikely to know about laws being passed that may profoundly affect them. These findings underscore the potential benefit in correcting widely-held, medically-inaccurate beliefs about abortion so opinions about laws can be based on fact.","Swartz, Jonas J; Rowe, Carly; Morse, Jessica E; Bryant, Amy G; Stuart, Gretchen S",Contraception,589,16

Presentation of cases: We reported four cases who had negative RT-PCR results, in addition to the last two consecutive negative results. Patient-1 had negative RT-PCR results twice (the 6th and 8th) from a total of 11 swabs. Patient-2 had negative RT-PCR results once (the 5th) from a total of 8 swabs. Patient-3 showed negative results of RT-PCR twice (the 4th and 6th) from a total of 11 swabs. Patient-4 had negative RT-PCR results twice (the 2nd and 10th) from a total of 14 swabs. Discussion: The fluctuating trend of our RT-PCR results in our cases might be due to insufficient viral material in the specimen, laboratory errors during sampling, restrictions on sample transportation, or mutations in the primary and probe target regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several factors might affect the occurrence of prolonged nucleic acid conversion, including older age, comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, and impaired immune function. Conclusion: Here, we confirmed the occurrence of prolonged nucleic acid conversion and the possibility of false negative RT-PCR results in COVID-19 patients.","Trisnawati, Ika; El Khair, Riat; Puspitarani, Dyah Ayu; Fauzi, Aditya Rifqi",Ann Med Surg (Lond),589,20

BACKGROUND: Nurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 unit nurses. DESIGN: Descriptive research study. METHODS: This study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID-19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative-pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non-COVID-19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID-19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID-19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among nurses working in COVID-19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up-to-date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources.","Doo, Eun-Young; Kim, Miyoung; Lee, Soyoung; Lee, Su Young; Lee, Ka Young",J Clin Nurs,589,15

The manual task of retrieving high-quality publications based on the evidence pyramid levels, however, presents a major bottleneck in researchers&#x2019;workflows. In this paper, we propose an &#x201C;evidencebased&#x201D;recommender system namely, KnowCOVID-19 that utilizes an edge computing service to integrate recommender modules for data analytics using end-user thin-clients. The edge computing service features chatbot-based web interface that handles a given COVID-19 publication dataset using two recommender system modules: (i) evidence-based filtering that observes domain specific topics across the literature and classifies the filtered information according to a clinical category, and (ii) social filtering that allows diverse experts with similar objectives to collaborate via a &#x201C;social plane&#x201D;to jointly find answers to critical clinical questions to fight the pandemic. We compare the Domain-specific Topic Model (DSTM) used in our evidence-based filtering with state-of-the-art models considering the CORD-19 dataset (a COVID-19 publication archive) and show improved generalization effectiveness as well as knowledge pattern query effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a comparison study between a manual literature review process and the KnowCOVID-19 augmented process, and evaluate the benefits of our information retrieval techniques over important queries provided by COVID-19 clinical experts.

Before and after viewing the presentations, participants used a Likert scale to rate the strength of their belief that antibiotics are effective for treating URTIs and of their desire to be prescribed an antibiotic. Patients reported whether an antibiotic had been prescribed, and pharmacy dispensing records were reviewed to determine whether an antibiotic was dispensed. RESULTS: Participants who viewed either the futility or the adverse effects presentation had greater reductions in their expectations to receive antibiotics than the control group. The mean reduction (95% CI) was 1.1 (0.8-1.3) for the futility group, 0.7 (0.4-0.9) for the adverse effects group, and 0.1 (0-0.3) for the control group (Cohen d = 0.7; P <.001). There was no significant difference among the 3 groups with regard to antibiotic prescribing (P = .84) or dispensing (P = .43). CONCLUSIONS: A brief tablet-based waiting room intervention significantly reduced participants' expectations about receiving antibiotics for URTI immediately before their family practitioner consultation. The intervention did not influence family practitioner prescribing behavior, however.","Perera, Anna Ishani; Thomas, Mark Greenslade; Petrie, Keith James; Frater, Janet; Dang, Daniel; Schache, Kiralee Ruth; Akroyd, Amelia Frances; Ritchie, Stephen Robert",Ann Fam Med,589,13

The electrochemical oxygen pump (concentrator) with a solid polymer electrolyte representing an electrolyzer with air cathode depolarization is a very promising device, which provides the portable, safe, and efficient in situ production of highly pure oxygen at a twice lower energy consumption as compared to the water electrolyzer with a solid polymer electrolyte. The effect produced by the hydrophobization of a nanostructured oxygen reduction catalyst on the oxygen pump characteristics and the endurance of a cathode catalytic layer to flooding has been considered. The modification of a carbon support with polytetrafluoroethylene particles improves the removal of excessive water from the catalytic layer and increases the limiting current characterizing the appearance of transport limitations. The operational parameters (air temperature, flow rate, and pressure) also have an essential effect on the oxygen pump performance and must be optimized to improve water transport in catalytic layers, increase the operating current densities, and reduce the energy consumption in oxygen production.","Pushkarev, A.

Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in healthy human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing Drosophila and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein LRP2 is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with hypoplastic heart defects, compared to patents the proband's iPSC-CMs exhibited reduced proliferation. Interestingly, rare, predicted-damaging LRP2 variants were enriched in a HLHS cohort; however, understanding their contribution to HLHS requires further investigation.

ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, written by family and healthcare workers during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay >72â¯h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24â¯h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychological symptom screening with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at baseline within 1â¯week of ICU discharge and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up, (nâ¯=â¯18) in the diary intervention group and (nâ¯=â¯17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Results from psychological screening tools demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in clinical practice - patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier-prolonged psychological morbidity.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments. Complementation into functional Nluc was used to assess virus-cell entry.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, human activities are largely restricted in China in early February, 2020. The influence of strict COVID-19 control policies on air quality and the potential influence of particulate matter concentration on COVID-19 infection in China are of great interest. This study analyzes the concentrations of six major air pollutants in 366 urban areas across mainland China during January 1 to April 30 in 2017–2020. Results show that strict COVID-19 control policies have significantly improved the air quality in many provinces. Compared to 2019, national mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2and CO in 2020 decrease by 14%, 15%, 12%, 16% and 12%, respectively, while the concentration of O3increases by 9%. Generally, the diurnal variation of PM2.5and PM10concentrations remains unchanged during COVID-19 and their concentrations are high in the morning and evening while low in the afternoon. Correlation analysis shows that daily COVID-19 infections are positively correlated with PM2.5concentration in many provinces, indicating a potential risk of aerosol transmission in high PM2.5environment. Thus it is suggested to stay at home in highly polluted days and go out in the afternoon to reduce the risk of infection due to aerosol transmission.","Chen, Qi-Xiang; Huang, Chun-Lin; Yuan, Yuan; Tan, He-Ping",Aerosol Air Qual.

However, little is known about these features in patients who received negative respiratory nucleic acid test results after the infections resolved. In this study, we aim to describe these features in a group of Chinese patients. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 51 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (median age: 34.0 years and 47.1% male) between January 31 and February 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected before and after two consecutive negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 tests. RESULTS: Following a negative test result, the patients' clinical symptoms continued to recover, but abnormal imaging findings were observed in all moderate cases. Specifically, 77.4% of patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited multi-lobar lung involvement and lesions were more frequently observed in the lower lobes. The most common CT imaging manifestations were ground-glass opacities (51.6%) and fibrous stripes (54.8%%).

Participants reported that, while having additional benefits in January felt like a relief from typical end-of-month deprivation, the subsequent extended gap between benefit distributions and a lack of clarity about future benefits caused cascading effects as participants later had to divert money from other expenses to buy food and faced added uncertainty about future economic stability. Additionally, the shutdown highlighted challenges related to the availability, timing, and tone of communications between participants and SNAP agencies. Participants recommended that SNAP adjust benefit and eligibility levels to better address costs of living, improve customer service, and avoid future disruptions.","Gosliner, Wendi; Chen, Wei-Ting; Johnson, Cathryn; Esparza, Elsa Michelle; Price, Natalie; Hecht, Ken; Ritchie, Lorrene",Nutrients,589,1

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum nucleotide prodrug shown to be effective against enzootic coronaviruses. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of remdesivir in plasma have recently been described. However, the distribution of its active metabolite nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to the site of pulmonary infection is unknown in humans. Our objective was to use existing in vivo mouse PK data for remdesivir and its metabolites to develop a mechanism-based model to allometrically scale and simulate the human PK of remdesivir in plasma and NTP in lung homogenate. Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations in plasma and total phosphorylated nucleoside concentrations in lung homogenate from Ces1c-/- mice administered 25 or 50 mg/kg of remdesivir subcutaneously were simultaneously fit to estimate PK parameters. The mouse PK model was allometrically scaled to predict human PK parameters to simulate the clinically recommended 200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg daily maintenance doses administered as 30-minute intravenous infusions. Simulations of unbound remdesivir concentrations in human plasma were below 2.48 µM, the 90% maximal inhibitory concentration for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in vitro. Simulations of NTP in lung were below high efficacy in vitro thresholds. We have identified a need for alternative dosing strategies to achieve more efficacious concentrations of NTP in human lung, perhaps by reformulating remdesivir for direct pulmonary delivery.","Hanafin, Patrick O; Jermain, Brian; Hickey, Anthony J; Kabanov, Alexander V; Kashuba, Angela D; Sheahan, Timothy P; Rao, Gauri G",CPT: pharmacomet. syst. pharmacol,589,26

Experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks, including the current SARS-CoV-2, has shown an augmented risk of thrombosis of both macrovasculature and microvasculature. The former involves both arterial and venous beds manifesting as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolic events. The microvascular thrombosis is an underappreciated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with profound implications on the development of multisystem organ failure. The telltale signs of perpetual on-going coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades underscore the presence of diffuse endothelial damage in the patients with COVID-19. These parameters serve as strong predictors of mortality. While summarizing the alterations of various components of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, this review points to the emerging evidence that implicates the prominent role of the extrinsic coagulation cascade in COVID-19-related coagulopathy. These mechanisms are triggered by widespread endothelial cell damage (endotheliopathy), the dominant driver of macro- and micro-vascular thrombosis in these patients. We also summarize other mediators of thrombosis, clinically relevant nuances such as the occurrence of thromboembolic events despite thromboprophylaxis (breakthrough thrombosis), current understanding of systemic anticoagulation therapy and its risk-benefit ratio. We conclude by emphasizing a need to probe COVID-19-specific mechanisms of thrombosis to develop better risk markers and safer therapeutic targets.","Kamel, Mohamed Hassan; Yin, Wenqing; Zavaro, Chris; Francis, Jean M; Chitalia, Vipul C",,589,20

As the pandemic evolves rapidly, there are data emerging to suggest that pregnant women diagnosed as having coronavirus disease 2019 can have severe morbidities (up to 9%). This is in contrast to earlier data that showed good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 include features of acute respiratory illnesses. Typical radiologic findings consists of patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph and ground glass opacities on computed tomography scan of the chest. Patients who are pregnant may present with atypical features such as the absence of fever as well as leukocytosis. Confirmation of coronavirus disease 2019 is by reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction from upper airway swabs. When the reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction test result is negative in suspect cases, chest imaging should be considered. A pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 is at the greatest risk when she is in labor, especially if she is acutely ill. We present an algorithm of care for the acutely ill parturient and guidelines for the protection of the healthcare team who is caring for the patient. Key decisions are made based on the presence of maternal and/or fetal compromise, adequacy of maternal oxygenation (SpO2 >93%) and stability of maternal blood pressure. Although vertical transmission is unlikely, there must be measures in place to prevent neonatal infections. Routine birth processes such as delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin bonding between mother and newborn need to be revised. Considerations can be made to allow the use of screened donated breast milk from mothers who are free of coronavirus disease 2019. We present management strategies derived from best available evidence to provide guidance in caring for the high-risk and acutely ill parturient. These include protection of the healthcare workers caring for the coronavirus disease 2019 gravida, establishing a diagnosis in symptomatic cases, deciding between reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction and chest imaging, and management of the unwell parturient.","Ashokka, Balakrishnan; Loh, May-Han; Tan, Cher Heng; Su, Lin Lin; Young, Barnaby Edward; Lye, David Chien; Biswas, Arijit; Illanes, Sebastian E; Choolani, Mahesh",Am J Obstet Gynecol,589,24

Compared to conventional networked applications, teleoperation poses widely different requirements, ultra-low latency (ULL) is primary. Realizing ULL communication demands significant redesign of conventional networking techniques, and the network infrastructure envisioned for achieving this is termed as Tactile Internet (TI). The design of the network infrastructure and meaningful performance metrics are crucial for seamless TI communication. However, existing performance metrics fall severely short of comprehensively characterizing TI performance. We take the first step towards bridging this gap. We take Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) as the basis of our work and identify necessary changes for characterizing TI performance. Through substantial refinements to DTW, we design Effective Time- and Value-Offset (ETVO) -- a new method for measuring the fine-grained performance of TI systems. Through an in-depth objective analysis, we demonstrate the improvements of ETVO over DTW. Through human-in-the-loop subjective experiments, we demonstrate how and why existing QoS and QoE methods fall short of estimating the TI session performance accurately. Using subjective experiments, we demonstrate the behavior of the proposed metrics, their ability to match theoretically derived performance, and finally their ability to reflect user satisfaction in a practical setting. The results are highly encouraging.","Kroep, H.J.C.; Gokhale, V.; J.Verburg,; Prasad, R. Venkatesha",,589,30

We evaluated the association between ACEI or ARB use and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among patients with hypertension. Methods and Results We identified patients with hypertension as of March 1, 2020 (index date) from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Patients who received ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics (TD), or no therapy were identified using outpatient pharmacy data covering the index date. Outcome of interest was a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 6, 2020. Patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were identified within 1 year preindex date. Among 824 650 patients with hypertension, 16 898 (2.0%) were tested for COVID-19. Of those tested, 1794 (10.6%) had a positive result. Overall, exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was not statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 infection after propensity score adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.25) for ACEIs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91-1.31 for ARBs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD). The associations between ACEI use and COVID-19 infection varied in different age groups (P-interaction=0.03). ACEI use was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 among those aged &#8805;85 years (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.77). Use of no antihypertensive medication was significantly associated with increased odds of COVID-19 infection compared with calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56). Conclusions Neither ACEI nor ARB use was associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection. Decreased odds of COVID-19 infection among adults &#8805;85 years using ACEIs warrants further investigation.","An, Jaejin; Wei, Rong; Zhou, Hui; Luong, Tiffany Q; Gould, Michael K; Mefford, Matthew T; Harrison, Teresa N; Creekmur, Beth; Lee, Ming-Sum; Sim, John J; Brettler, Jeffrey W; Martin, John P; Ong-Su, Angeline L; Reynolds, Kristi",J Am Heart Assoc,589,16

METHODS: Between March and June 2020, we enrolled >=60 years in-hospital COVID-19 patients (N=806) in GeroCovid, a multicenter observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine. RESULTS: The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%, p=0.015). At admission, 51.7%, 10.2% and 38.1% of AF cases were taking, respectively, oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents and no antithrombotic therapy. During hospitalization, 51% patients switched to low-molecular weight heparins. AF patients who survived were younger (81±8 vs. 84±7 years; p=0.002) and had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9±1.6 vs. 4.4±1.3; p=0.02) than those who died. OACs use before (63.1% vs. 32.3%; p<0.001) and during hospitalization (34.0% vs. 12.7%; p=0.002) was higher among survivors. At multivariable analysis, lower age, higher self-sufficiency, less severe initial COVID-19 presentation, and the use of Vitamin K antagonists (OR=0.16, 95%CI: 0.03-0.84) or DOACs (OR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.08-0.56) at admission, or the persistence of OAC during hospitalization (OR=0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.24), were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: AF is a prevalent and severe condition in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency and relevant clinical manifestations of disease characterized a worse prognosis. Pre-admission and in-hospital anticoagulant therapy were positively associated with survival.","Fumagalli, Stefano; Trevisan, Caterina; Del Signore, Susanna; Pelagalli, Giulia; Volpato, Stefano; Gareri, Pietro; Mossello, Enrico; Malara, Alba; Monzani, Fabio; Coin, Alessandra; Bellelli, Giuseppe; Zia, Gianluca; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele",Thromb. haemost,589,1

The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.","Woitowich, Nicole C; Jain, Shikha; Arora, Vineet M; Joffe, Hadine",Acad. med,589,23

Herein, we reported a case receiving combination therapy with CP transfusion and hydroxychloroquine for the first time. CASE PRESENTATION: Laboratory findings showed high lactic acid level (2.1 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 48.8 mg/L), and low white blood cell count (1.96 × 109/L) in a 65-year-old Chinese man, who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. CP was intravenously given twice, and hydroxychloroquine was orally administrated for a week (0.2 g, three times a day). The lactic acid and C-reactive protein levels remained high (2.1 mmol/L and 73.23 mg/L, respectively), while the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation decreased to 86% with a low oxygenation index (OI, 76 mmHg) on day 4 after CP transfusion. His temperature returned to normal and the OI ascended above 300 on day 11. Moreover, the RNA test remained positive in throat swab, and computed tomography revealed severe pulmonary lesions on day 11 after admission. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that the effectiveness of combination therapy with CP and hydroxychloroquine may be non-optimal, and specific therapy needs to be explored.","Xu, Tian-Min; Lin, Bin; Chen, Cong; Liu, Long-Gen; Xue, Yuan",Virol J,589,16

It is a complex bio-mechanical process that is highly sensitive to changes in the speaker's respiratory parameters. Since most symptomatic cases of COVID-19 present with moderate to severe impairment of respiratory functions, we hypothesize that signatures of COVID-19 may be observable by examining the vibrations of the vocal folds. Our goal is to validate this hypothesis, and to quantitatively characterize the changes observed to enable the detection of COVID-19 from voice. For this, we use a dynamical system model for the oscillation of the vocal folds, and solve it using our recently developed ADLES algorithm to yield vocal fold oscillation patterns directly from recorded speech. Experimental results on a clinically curated dataset of COVID-19 positive and negative subjects reveal characteristic patterns of vocal fold oscillations that are correlated with COVID-19. We show that these are prominent and discriminative enough that even simple classifiers such as logistic regression yields high detection accuracies using just the recordings of isolated extended vowels.","Ismail, Mahmoud Al; Deshmukh, Soham; Singh, Rita",,589,1

Heterozygotes for beta-thalassaemia (ßThal+) constitute a non-negligible proportion of blood donors in the Mediterranean and other geographical areas. The unique haematological profile of ßThal+ could affect capacity of enduring storage stress, however, the storability of ßThal+ RBCs is largely unknown. In this study, RBCs from 18 ßThal+ donors were stored in the cold and profiled for primary (haemolysis) and secondary (phosphatidylserine exposure, potassium leakage, oxidative stress) quality measures, and metabolomics, versus sex- and age-matched controls. The ßThal+ units exhibited better levels of storage haemolysis and susceptibility to lysis following osmotic, oxidative and mechanical insults. Moreover, ßThal+ RBCs had a lower percentage of surface removal signaling, reactive oxygen species and oxidative defects to membrane components at late stages of storage. Lower potassium accumulation and higher urate-dependent antioxidant capacity were noted in the ßThal+ supernatant. Full metabolomics analyses revealed alterations in purine and arginine pathways at baseline, along with activation of pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis upstream to pyruvate kinase in ßThal+ RBCs. Upon storage, substantial changes were observed in arginine, purine and vitamin B6 metabolism, as well as in the hexosamine pathway. A high degree of glutamate generation in ßThal+ RBCs was accompanied by low levels of purine oxidation products (IMP, hypoxanthine, allantoin). The ßThal mutations impact the metabolism and the susceptibility to haemolysis of stored RBCs, suggesting good post-transfusion recovery. However, haemoglobin increment and other clinical outcomes of ßThal+ RBC transfusion deserve elucidation by future studies.","Tzounakas, Vassilis L; Anastasiadi, Alkmini T; Stefanoni, Davide; Cendali, Francesca; Bertolone, Lorenzo; Gamboni, Fabia; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Rousakis, Pantelis; Vergaki, Athina; Soulakis, Vassilis; Tsitsilonis, Ourania E; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Papassideri, Issidora S; Kriebardis, A Nastasios G; D039,; Alessandro, Angelo; Antonelou, Marianna H",Haematologica,589,24

Exercise might be the most promising non-pharmaceutic intervention to address the large variety of risk factors related to the pronounced estradiol decline during peri- and early-postmenopause. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an 18-month multipurpose exercise program on risk factors and symptoms related to the menopausal transition. Fifty-four women 1-5 years postmenopause with osteopenia or osteoporosis were randomly assigned 1) to a high impact weight-bearing/high-intensity/velocity resistance training group (EG: n=27) exercising three times a week or 2) to an attendance control group (CG: n=27) that performed low-intensity exercise once a week. Both groups were supplemented with cholecalciferol and calcium. The primary study endpoint was bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (LS) and total hip, secondary outcomes were lean body mass (LBM), total and abdominal body percentage, metabolic syndrome Z-Score (MetS-Z), menopausal symptoms and muscle strength and power. Due to COVID-19, the study was stopped after 13 months.

Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19-related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19.

Since then, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to the entire world. Computed Tomography (CT) is frequently used to assess severity and complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. The purpose of this study is to compare the CT patterns and clinical characteristics in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 218 consecutive patients (136 males; 82 females; mean age 63±15 years) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-coV-2. Patients were categorized in two different groups: (a) ICU patients and (b) non-ICU inpatients. We assessed the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams and recorded the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 patients, 23 (20 males: 3 females; mean age 60 years) required ICU admission, 195 (118 males: 77 females, mean age 64 years) were admitted to a clinical ward. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were predominantly males (60% versus 83% p=0.03), had more comorbidities, a positive CRP (p=0.04) and higher LDH values (p=0.008).

This research assesses the effect of the lockdown on PA levels and identifies predictors of sufficient/insufficient PA in frail older community-dwellers. Community-dwelling participants from the +ÀGIL Barcelona frailty intervention program, suspended during the pandemic, underwent a phone-assessment during the lockdown. PA was measured before and after the lockdown using the Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool (BPAAT). We included 98 frail older adults free of COVID-19 (mean age = 82.7 years, 66.3% women, mean Short Physical Performance Battery = 8.1 points). About one third of participants (32.2%) were not meeting sufficient PA levels at the end of the lockdown. Depressive symptoms (OR = 0.12, CI95% = 0.02-0.55) and fatigue (OR = 0.11, CI95% = 0.03-0.44) decreased the odds of maintaining sufficient PA, whereas maintaining social networks (OR = 5.07, CI95% = 1.60-16.08) and reading (OR = 6.29, CI95% = 1.66-23.90) increased it. Living alone was associated with the reduction of PA levels (b = -1.30, CI95% = -2.14--0.46). In our sample, pre-lockdown mental health, frailty-related symptoms and social relationships were consistently associated with both PA levels during-lockdown and pre-post change.

The aim of this article was to describe our experience with the rollout and use of a virtual pretransplantation evaluation platform to facilitate ongoing transplant waitlisting during the early peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis of the process improvement project implemented to continue the evaluation of potential kidney transplantation candidates and ensure waitlist placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational metrics include transplantation volume per month, referral volume per month, pretransplantation patients halted before completing an evaluation per month, evaluations completed per month, and patients waitlisted per month. RESULTS: Between April and September 2020, a total of 1,258 patients completed an evaluation. Two hundred and forty-seven patients were halted during this time period before completing a full evaluation. One hundred and fifty-two patients were presented at selection and 113 were placed on the waitlist. In addition, the number of patients in the active referral phase was able to be reduced by 46%. More evaluations were completed within the virtual platform (n = 930 vs n = 880), yielding similar additions to the waitlist in 2020 (n = 282) vs 2019 (n = 308) despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Actions are being implemented to keep health care systems from being overstretched and to curb the outbreak. Any policy responses aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus and mitigating its immediate effects on health care systems require a firm basis of information about the absolute number of currently infected people, growth rates, and locations/hotspots of infections. The only way to obtain this base of information is by conducting numerous tests in a targeted way. Currently, in Ghana, there is a centralized testing approach, that takes 4-5 days for samples to be shipped and tested at central reference laboratories with results communicated to the district, regional and national stakeholders. This delay in diagnosis increases the risk of ongoing transmission in communities and vulnerable institutions. We have validated, evaluated and deployed an innovative diagnostic tool on a mobile laboratory platform to accelerate the COVID-19 testing. A preliminary result of 74 samples from COVID-19 suspected cases has a positivity rate of 12% with a turn-around time of fewer than 3 hours from sample taking to reporting of results, significantly reducing the waiting time from days to hours, enabling expedient response by the health system for contact tracing to reduce transmission and additionally improving case management.

We apply the method to assess excess mortality from March to June 2020 in Denmark and Sweden as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic; associated policy interventions; and behavioral, healthcare, social, and economic changes. We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done. More generally, later/earlier ratios may prove useful in short-term forecasting of illnesses and births as well as economic and other activity that varies seasonally or periodically.","Rizzi, Silvia; Vaupel, James W",Proc.

Climate politics can be understood as a contest between owners of assets that accelerate climate change, such as fossil fuel plants, and owners of assets vulnerable to climate change, such as coastal property. To date, obstruction by “climate-forcing” asset holders has been a large barrier to effective climate policy. But as climate change and decarbonization policies proceed, holders of both climate-forcing and “climate-vulnerable” assets stand to lose some or even all of their assets' value over time, and with them, the basis of their political power. This dynamic contest between opposing interests is likely to intensify in many sites of political contestation, from the subnational to transnational levels. As it does so, climate politics will become increasingly existential, potentially reshaping political alignments within and across countries. Such shifts may further undermine the Liberal International Order (LIO);as countries develop pro-climate policies at different speeds and magnitudes, they will have incentives to diverge from existing arrangements over trade and economic integration.","Colgan, Jeff D.; Green, Jessica F.; Hale, Thomas N.",International Organization,589,16

The pandemic continues affecting population due to nonavailability of drugs and vaccines. The pathogenesis and complications of infection mainly involve hyperimmune-inflammatory responses. Thus, therapeutic strategies rely on repurposing of drugs aimed at reducing infectivity and inflammation and modulate immunity favourably. Among, numerous therapeutic targets, the endocannabinoid system, particularly activation of cannabinoid type-2 receptors (CB2R) emerged as an important one to suppress the hyperimmune-inflammatory responses. Recently, potent antiinflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of CB2R selective ligands of endogenous, plant, and synthetic origin were showed mediating CB2R selective functional agonism. CB2R activation appears to regulate numerous signaling pathways to control immune-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. Many CB2R ligands also exhibit off-target effects mediating activation of PPARs, opioids, and TRPV, suggestive of adjuvant use with existing drugs that may maximize efficacy synergistically and minimize therapeutic doses to limit adverse/ side effects. We hypothesize that CB2R agonists, due to immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, and antiviral properties may show activity against COVID-19. Based on the organoprotective potential, relative safety, lack of psychotropic effects, and druggable properties, CB2R selective ligands might make available promising candidates for further investigation.","Nagoor Meeran, M F; Sharma, Charu; Goyal, Sameer N; Kumar, Sanjay; Ojha, Shreesh",Drug dev. res,589,1

Effective treatment options are still very rare. Therefore, the present knowledge on the pathophysiology of fatigue and the potential positive impact of treatment with vitamin C is illustrated. Additionally, the effectiveness of high-dose IV vitamin C in fatigue resulting from various diseases was assessed by a systematic literature review in order to assess the feasibility of vitamin C in post-viral, especially in long COVID, fatigue. Nine clinical studies with 720 participants were identified. Three of the four controlled trials observed a significant decrease in fatigue scores in the vitamin C group compared to the control group. Four of the five observational or before-and-after studies observed a significant reduction in pre-post levels of fatigue. Attendant symptoms of fatigue such as sleep disturbances, lack of concentration, depression, and pain were also frequently alleviated. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and circulatory disorders, which are important contributors to fatigue, are also discussed in long COVID fatigue. Thus, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, endothelial-restoring, and immunomodulatory effects of high-dose IV vitamin C might be a suitable treatment option.","Vollbracht, Claudia; Kraft, Karin",Nutrients,589,9

With SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an unexpectedly high and specific prevalence of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs). These high rates of hyposmia and hypogeusia, initially reported as up to 89% in European case series, led to the global inclusion of loss of taste and/or smell as a distinctive feature of COVID-19. However, there is emerging evidence that there are striking differences in the rates of OTDs in East Asian countries where the disease first emerged, as compared to Western countries (15.8 vs. 60.9%, p-value &lt; 0.01). This may be driven by either variations in SARS-CoV-2 subtypes presenting to different global populations or genotypic differences in hosts which alter the predisposition of these different populations to the neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that rates of OTDs were significantly higher in objective testing for OTDs as compared to subjective testing (73.6 vs. 60.8%, p-value = 0.03), which is the methodology employed by most studies. Concurrently, it has also become evident that racial minorities across geographically disparate world populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality. In this mini review, we aim to delineate and explore the varying rates of olfactory and taste disorders amongst COVID-19 patients, by focusing on their underlying geographical, testing, ethnic and socioeconomic differences. We examine the current literature for evidence of differences in the olfactory and gustatory manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss current pathophysiological hypotheses for such differences.","Kumar, A.

This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in African American patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID-19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m2 .

Many individuals who become infected have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision. Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19 severity and mortality we performed a meta-analysis of the published global literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Results: Our meta-analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictor of mortality, in terms of symptom-comorbidity combinations, it was observed that Pneumonia-Hypertension, Pneumonia-Diabetes and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-Hypertension showed the most significant effects on COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions: These results highlight patient cohorts most at risk of COVID-19 related severe morbidity and mortality which have implications for prioritization of hospital resources.","Aktar, Sakifa; Talukder, Ashis; Ahamad, Md.

Ground glass opacity, fibrous stripe, and thickening of adjacent pleura are frequently reported sequelae of COVID-19. COVID-19 causing severe bronchiectasis in a previously healthy individual with no underlying lung conditions, has not been reported in literature yet. Therefore, this case report aimed to highlight the importance of COVID-19 infection-causing unusual lung changes such as bronchiectasis. Case report: This case, a 44-year-old woman, came to the UNS hospital complaining of shortness of breath, fever, and cough. The patient had no previous history of lung disease. The results of chest Xray when he entered the ER showed bilateral pneumonia. After further examinations, the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab was confirmed and was obtained with comorbid chronic heart failure. During the treatment, the sputum culture was examined, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found. Two weeks after being declared cured of COVID-19, a chest X-ray and chest CT scan were performed, and bronchiectasis was obtained. Discussion: The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection is still being studied. Bronchiectasis is one of the scars of COVID-19 infection which can appear rapidly during COVID-19 infection. The predisposition for a sequela to COVID-19 in the form of bronchiectasis still requires further research, possibly due to the severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Comorbid and the development of bacterial pneumonia as the secondary infection was still suspected as predisposing factors for bronchiectasis in this case. Conclusion: Bronchiectasis is an atypical sequela of COVID-19, which gives a poor prognosis in post-COVID-19 patients because it reduces the patient's quality of life.","Apriningsih, H.; Prabowo, N.

For the treatment of COVID-19, selective lung-localizing strategies hold tremendous potential, as SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung via ACE2 receptors and causes severe pneumonia. Similarly, recent reports have shown the association of COVID-19 with decreased 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and increased cytokine levels. This mechanism, which involves the activation of inflammatory NF-&#954;B- and SREBP2-mediated inflammasome signaling pathways, is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. To resolve those clinical conditions observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, we report 25-HC and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) nanovesicles (25-HC@DDAB) as a COVID-19 drug candidate for the restoration of intracellular cholesterol level and suppression of cytokine storm. Our data demonstrate that 25-HC@DDAB can selectively accumulate the lung tissues and effectively downregulate NF-&#954;B and SREBP2 signaling pathways in COVID-19 patient-derived PBMCs, reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. Altogether, our findings suggest that 25-HC@DDAB is a promising candidate for the treatment of symptoms associated with severe COVID-19 patients, such as decreased cholesterol level and cytokine storm.","Kim, Hyelim; Lee, Han Sol; Ahn, June Hong; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; An, Jiseon; Mun, Yong-Hyeon; Yoo, So-Yeol; Choi, Yoon Jung; Yun, Mi-Young; Song, Gyu Yong; Joo, Jinmyoung; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, Hong Nam; Park, Hee Ho; Lee, Jae-Young; Lee, Wonhwa",Nano Today,589,4

It is unclear whether people perceive this principle as ethically more legitimate than some other principle such as ""saving more life-years"". Understanding the answer to this question is particularly relevant to the allocation of scarce medical resources during public health emergencies. Different principles typically lead to different allocations, and consequently have dramatically different implications as to who survives and who dies. We fielded an online randomized controlled survey experiment in the context of scarce ventilator allocation with a demographically representative sample of US adults (n = 700) from October 22 to October 30, 2020. Participants faced hypothetical situations where they had to allocate few available ventilators among several needy patients. The experiment was designed such that the allocation decision made by a participant can be used to infer the principle in line with their personal ethical values. We interpret this inferred principle as the one that the participant perceives to be most legitimate. The treatment group, but not the control group, was provided balanced information that described the ethical dilemmas faced by experts in developing ventilator allocation guidelines. Nearly half of the participants in the control group perceive saving more lives the most legitimate principle. Despite the balanced nature of the information, the perceived legitimacy of saving more lives was 7·6 percentage points higher in the treatment group. The magnitude of this impact was particularly strong among republican-leaning participants, a subgroup that has less trust in experts according to previous research. Our findings suggest that enhancing public awareness of ethical dilemmas faced by health experts can increase the perceived legitimacy of their proposed guidelines even among those with lower trust in experts.","Rai, Birendra; Wang, Liang Choon; Pandit, Simone; Handfield, Toby; So, Chiu Ki",Soc Sci Med,589,6

Complications of COVID-19 are closely related to an upregulation of the inflammatory response revealed by the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines (to the point of causing a cytokine storm), which is also a contributing cause of the associated coagulation disorders with venous and arterial thromboembolisms, causing multiple organ dysfunction and failure. In severe fulminant cases of COVID-19, there is an activation of coagulation and consumption of clotting factors leading to a deadly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is well established that human immune response changes with age, and also that the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines is upregulated in both healthy and diseased elderly people. In fact, normal aging is known to be associated with a subclinical, sterile, low-grade, systemic pro-inflammatory state linked to the chronic activation of the innate immune system, a phenomenon known as ""inflammaging"". Inflammaging may play a role as a condition contributing to the co-occurrence of the severe hyper-inflammatory state (cytokine storm) during COVID-19, and also in other severe infections (sepsis) in older people. Moreover, we must consider the impact of inflammation on coagulation due to the crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation. The systemic inflammatory state and coagulation disorders are closely related, a phenomenon that here we call ""coagul-aging"" (Giunta S.). In this review, we discuss the various degrees of inflammation in older adults after being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the adverse effects of aging on the inflammatory response and coagulation system. It is important to note that although there is no gender difference in susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, however, due to differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, innate immunity, and comorbidities, older men exhibit more severe disease and higher mortality than older women. There are currently no FDA-approved specific antiviral drugs that can be used against the virus. Therapies used in patients with COVID-19 consist of remdesivir, dexamethasone, low-molecular-weight heparin, in addition to monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the disease.

These alternate 'clean' hospital sites were independent hospitals running active staff and patient testing programmes for COVID-19 and which did not admit or treat patients suffering with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective survey was undertaken to include patients at least 30 days after a planned surgery or procedure conducted at a 'clean' alternate hospital site during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using structured interviews undertaken by trained assessors. A 20% sample group of patients were randomly selected to participate in this study. Qualitative data related to confidence, safety and perceptions of safety were collected. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (60%) reported that they had prior worries or concerns about undergoing an elective procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 47 patients (30%) had delayed their surgery at least once because of these concerns. A total of 150 patients (95%) felt that the precautions in place to protect their safety in the setting of an alternate 'clean' hospital site were well thought out and proportionate. Patients reported high levels of confidence in the measures undertaken. Separation of patient pathways using the independent sector and patient testing were identified by patients as having the greatest impact on their perception of safety. CONCLUSIONS: Patient confidence will be key to ensuring uptake of planned and elective procedures and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceptions of safety will be key to this confidence and efforts to demonstrably enhance safety are well received by patients. In particular, patients felt that a dedicated programme of patient testing and separation of patient pathways provided the greatest levels of confidence in the safety of their treatment.","Lee, George; Clough, Oliver T; Walker, Joseph A; Anakwe, Raymond E",Patient Saf Surg,589,7

While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing fragmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the ""German Corona Consensus Dataset"" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data, in particular for university medicine. METHODS: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. RESULTS: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, medical history, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of delirium in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and explore its association with adverse outcomes. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Tertiary university hospital dedicated to the care of severe cases of COVID-19 in São Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 707 patients, aged 50 years or older, consecutively admitted to the hospital between March and May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We completed detailed reviews of electronic medical records to collect our data. We identified delirium occurrence using the Chart-Based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART-DEL). Trained physicians with a background in geriatric medicine completed all CHART-DEL assessments. We complemented our baseline clinical information using telephone interviews with participants or their proxy. Our outcomes of interest were in-hospital death, length of stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization. We adjusted all multivariable analyses for age, sex, clinical history, vital signs, and relevant laboratory biomarkers (lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, D-dimer, and albumin). RESULTS: Overall, we identified delirium in 234 participants (33%). On admission, 86 (12%) were delirious. We observed 273 deaths (39%) in our sample, and in-hospital mortality reached 55% in patients who experienced delirium. Delirium was associated with in-hospital death, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.75 (95% confidence interval = 1.15-2.66); the association held both in middle-aged and older adults. Delirium was also associated with increased length of stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization.

We used data on cause-specific mortality to characterise the risk and trends in NCD mortality in each country and evaluate combinations of reductions in NCD causes of death that can achieve SDG target 3.4. Among NCDs, ischaemic heart disease is responsible for the highest risk of premature death in more than half of all countries for women, and more than three-quarters for men. However, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers are associated with a similar risk, and in many countries, a higher risk of premature death than ischaemic heart disease. Although premature mortality from NCDs is declining in most countries, for most the pace of change is too slow to achieve SDG target 3.4. To investigate the options available to each country for achieving SDG target 3.4, we considered different scenarios, each representing a combination of fast (annual rate achieved by the tenth best performing percentile of all countries) and average (median of all countries) declines in risk of premature death from NCDs. Pathways analysis shows that every country has options for achieving SDG target 3.4. No country could achieve the target by addressing a single disease. In at least half the countries, achieving the target requires improvements in the rate of decline in at least five causes for women and in at least seven causes for men to the same rate achieved by the tenth best performing percentile of all countries. Tobacco and alcohol control and effective health-system interventions—including hypertension and diabetes treatment; primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in high-risk individuals; low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases, diabetes complications, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and effective cancer screening and treatment—will reduce NCD causes of death necessary to achieve SDG target 3.4 in most countries.",,Lancet,589,18

Continuous formative assessment promotes personalised learning via closely monitored progress, with the identification of students’ strengths and weaknesses. This study aims to evaluate the effects of LD and FC teaching methods, supplemented with continuous formative assessment, on dental students’ learning of wire-bending skills for six types of removable orthodontic appliance components. A deeper understanding of the relative effectiveness between LD and FC teaching methods can help identify the most appropriate method to achieve student learning objectives, which is especially important given the current Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Forty third-year undergraduate dental students were randomly assigned into FC (n = 20) or LD (n = 20) cohort. Each student attended six teaching sessions, each to teach students’ competency in fabricating one type of wire component, for a total competency in fabricating six wire components over the course of six teaching sessions. Either LD or FC teaching methods were used. After each session, wire assignments had to be submitted. Wire assignments were then evaluated using a blinded wire-bending assessment protocol. As part of their formative assessment, the assessment results were distributed to students, lecturers, and technicians before the next session. After the first session (T0) and at the end of all six sessions (T1), students completed a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean wire-bending scores for FC were significantly higher than LD for two of the six assignments, namely the Adams clasp (p < 0.01) and Z-spring (p = 0.03). Scores for both LD and FC increased significantly over time, which may be attributed to formative assessment. There was no statistically significant correlation between wire-bending scores and video usage. Students were satisfied with both teaching methods, according to T0 and T1 questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Both LD and FC are equally effective in transferring practical orthodontic wire-bending skills and well-received by students. Continuous formative assessment may have enhanced students’ learning of orthodontic wire-bending skills. Further studies with control group are recommended to investigate the effect of formative assessment on teaching practical dental skills.","Sivarajan, Saritha; Soh, Eunice Xinwei; Zakaria, Nor Nadia; Kamarudin, Yasmin; Lau, May Nak; Bahar, Aufa D.; Mohd Tahir, Norhidayah; Wan Hassan, Wan Nurazreena; Wey, Mang Chek; Othman, Siti Adibah; M Razi, Roziana; Naimie, Zahra",BMC Med Educ,589,6

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from sepsis ultimately leads to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and subsequently increased vascular leakage. Current fluid resuscitation techniques only transiently improve outcomes in sepsis, and can cause edema. Nitric oxide (NO) treatment for sepsis has shown promise in the past, but implementation is difficult due to the challenges associated with delivery and the transient nature of NO. To address this, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacy of sustained delivery of exogenous NO using IV infused NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-np). The impact of NO-np on microhemodynamics and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model was evaluated. NO-np treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory response by promoting M2 macrophage repolarization, which reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and slowed vascular extravasation. Combined, this resulted in significantly improved microvascular blood flow and 72-hour survival of animals treated with NO-np. The results from this study suggest that sustained supplementation of endogenous NO ameliorates and may prevent the morbidities of acute systemic inflammatory conditions. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator in many acute inflammatory conditions, it is likely that NO enhancement strategies may be useful for the treatment of sepsis and other acute inflammatory insults that trigger severe systemic pro-inflammatory responses and often result in a cytokine storm, as seen in COVID-19.","Williams, Alexander T.; Muller, Cynthia R.; Govender, Krianthan; Navati, Mahantesh S.; Friedman, Adam J.; Friedman, Joel M.; Cabrales, Pedro",Free Radic Biol Med,589,31

This mixed-methods study by a Lebanese service provider, in partnership with an international research institute, seeks to better understand how experiences of gender-based violence (GBV) and mental health intersect in the lives of Syrian and Lebanese women, and how to better meet these needs. It employs a randomized cross-sectional survey of 969 Abaad service users and focus groups with community members and service providers. There were significant associations between GBV and ill mental health; notably, respondents reporting transactional sex had 4 times the likelihood of severe distress (aOR 4.2; 95% CI 1.2–14.8; p ≤ 0.05). Focus groups emphasized less-visible forms of violence, such as emotional violence, and the importance of environmental factors in one’s ability to cope, noting “it always came back to the economy”. Recommendations include providing a more holistic and coordinated approach between GBV, mental health, livelihood, and basic assistance sectors; and sensitive, accessible, and higher-quality mental health services informed by GBV response actors’ experience putting in place survivor-centered programming and made available to both host and refugee community members.","Barada, Rassil; Potts, Alina; Bourassa, Angela; Contreras-Urbina, Manuel; Nasr, Krystel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,589,27

Here, some new evidence was disclosed by studying the effects of nanosized TiO(2) on viral pathogens under a low irradiation condition (0.4 mW/cm(2) at UVA band) that mimics the field setting. We showed that photo-activated TiO(2) efficiently inhibits hepatitis C virus infection, and week indoor light with intensity of 0.6 mW/cm(2) at broad-spectrum wavelength and around 0.15 mW/cm(2) of UVA band also lead to partial inhibition. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals produced by photo-activated TiO(2) do not destroy virion structure and contents, but attack viral RNA genome, thus inactivating the virus. Furthermore, we showed that photo-activated TiO(2) inactivates a broad range of human viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, we showed that photo-catalyzed nanosized TiO(2) inactivates pathogenic viruses, paving a way to its field application in control of viral infectious diseases.","Tong, Yimin; Shi, Gansheng; Hu, Gaowei; Hu, Xiaoyou; Han, Lin; Xie, Xiaofeng; Xu, Yongfen; Zhang, Rong; Sun, Jing; Zhong, Jin",Chem Eng J,589,6

Clinical research related to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 is a top priority. Effective and efficient recruitment is challenging even without added constraints of a global pandemic. Recruitment registries offer a potential solution to slow or difficult recruitment. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a digital research recruitment registry to optimize awareness and participant enrollment for COVID-19-related research in Baltimore and to report preliminary results. METHODS: Planning began in March 2020, and the registry launched in July 2020. The primary recruitment mechanisms include electronic medical record data, postcards distributed at testing sites, and digital advertising campaigns. Following consent in a Research Electronic Data Capture survey, participants answer questions related to COVID-19 exposure, testing, and willingness to participate in research. Branching logic presents participants with studies they might be eligible for. RESULTS: As of March 24, 2021, 9010 participants have enrolled, and 64.2% are female, 80.6% are White, 9.4% are Black or African American, and 6% are Hispanic or Latino. Phone outreach has had the highest response rate (13.1%), followed by email (11.9%), text (11.4%), and patient portal message (9.4%). Eleven study teams have utilized the registry, and 4596 matches have been made between study teams and interested volunteers. CONCLUSION: Effective and efficient recruitment strategies are more important now than ever due to the time-limited nature of COVID-19 research. Pilot efforts have been successful in connecting interested participants with recruiting study teams.","Peeler, Anna; Miller, Hailey; Ogungbe, Oluwabunmi; Lewis Land, Cassia; Martinez, Liz; Guerrero Vazquez, Monica; Carey, Scott; Murli, Sumati; Singleton, Megan; Lacanienta, Cyd; Gleason, Kelly; Ford, Daniel; Himmelfarb, Cheryl R.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,589,20

China, India, and Indonesia are key markets and Asia is a frontrunner in tobacco control measures, such as plain packaging of cigarettes. Some countries in Asia have a long history of tobacco control activities beginning in the 1970s, and WHO's Western Pacific Region is still the only region where all countries have ratified WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. We reviewed the history, research, epidemiology, tobacco control action, obstacles, and potential responses and solutions to the tobacco epidemic in this region. Levels of development, systems of government, and population size are very different between countries, with population size ranging from 1500 to 1·3 billion, but similarities exist in aspects of the tobacco epidemic, harms caused, obstacles faced, and tobacco control actions needed.","Mackay, Judith; Ritthiphakdee, Bungon; Reddy, K Srinath",Lancet,589,29

This study examined their knowledge, preparedness, and experiences managing COVID-19 in the Australasian healthcare settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of ICP and ID physician members of the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control (ACIPC) and the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) was conducted using an online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. RESULTS: A total of 103 survey responses were included in the analysis for ICPs and 45 for ID physicians. A majority of ICPs (78.7%) and ID physicians (77.8%) indicated having ‘very good’ or ‘good’ level of knowledge of COVID-19. Almost all ICPs (94.2%) relied on state or territory’s department of health websites to source up-to-date information. While most ID physicians (84.4%) used scientific literature and journals. A majority of ICPs (96%) and ID physicians (73.3%) reported feeling ‘moderately prepared’ or ‘extremely prepared’ for managing COVID-19. Most respondents had received specific training about COVID-19 within their workplace (ICPs: 75%; ID physicians: 66.7%), particularly training/certification in PPE use, which made them feel ‘mostly or entirely confident’ in using it. Most ICPs (84.5%) and ID physicians (76.2%) reported having ‘considerably’ or ‘moderately more’ work added to their daily duties. Their biggest concerns included the uncertainties under a rapidly changing landscape, PPE availability, and community’s compliance.

In this study, four rapid methods (ACE2-RBD inhibition assay, S1-IgG detection, RBD-IgG detection, and N-IgG detection) were established and evaluated based on chemiluminescence technology. For the first time, a broadly neutralizing antibody with high affinity was used as a standard for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in human sera. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients (N = 119), vaccinated donors (N = 86), and healthy donors (N = 299) confirmed by microneutralization test (MNT) were used to evaluate the above methods. The result showed that the ACE2-RBD inhibition assay calculated with either ACE2-RBD binding inhibition percentage rate or ACE2-RBD inhibiting antibody concentration were strongly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.78, p < 0.0001) and also highly consistent with MNT (Kappa Value ≥ 0.94, p < 0.01). There was also a strong correlation between the two evaluation indices (r ≥ 0.99, p < 0.0001). Meanwhile, S1-IgG and RBD-IgG quantitative detection were also significantly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.73, p < 0.0001), and both methods were highly correlated with each other (r ≥ 0.95, p < 0.0001). However, the concentration of N-IgG antibodies showed a lower correlation with the MNT results (r < 0.49, p < 0.0001). The diagnostic assays presented here could be used for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunization effect and serological diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, and could also have guiding significance for establishing other rapid serological methods to surrogate neutralization tests for SARS-CoV-2.","Yin, Qiangling; Zhang, Yecheng; Lian, Lijun; Qu, Yuanyuan; Wu, Wei; Chen, Zhen; Pei, Rongjuan; Chen, Tingyou; Sun, Lina; Li, Chuan; Li, Aqian; Li, Jiandong; Li, Dexin; Wang, Shiwen; Guan, Wuxiang; Liang, Mifang",Viruses,589,20

Earlier disaster studies have shown the importance of including older peoples’ voices to prevent secondary stressors, yet these voices have received little attention during this pandemic. Here, we explore how Dutch older adults view this crisis and cope with measures to contribute to our understanding of coping of older adults in general and during disaster situations more specifically. METHODS: Qualitative study using semi-structured telephone interviews with 59 diverse older adults aged 54 to 95 throughout the Netherlands. RESULTS: Older adults typify this crisis as ungraspable, disrupting their daily and social lives. Despite filling their lives with activities, they experience loss or lack of purpose. They try to follow measures to decrease infection risk and gain control, and use problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. Emotion-focused strategies used were interpreting their personal vulnerability, self-enhancing comparisons, acceptance, and distraction. In the latter two strategies, the temporary nature of measures was emphasized. DISCUSSION: Older adults describe this crisis consistently with earlier findings from disaster studies. They use known coping strategies, but emphasize the duration in relation to their expectation of temporality. This underscores a dynamic, processual approach towards coping that incorporates temporal dimensions such as duration and order. Our findings stress the importance of acknowledging heterogeneity among older adults and adjusting communication about mitigation measures to decrease insecurity and increase resonance. This may make COVID-19 mitigation measures more manageable and age-responsible and allow older adults to start living again.","Verhage, Miriam; Thielman, Lucia; de Kock, Lieke; Lindenberg, J",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,589,1

The hallmark of COVID-19 continues to be the well-documented effects it has on the respiratory system. With the passage of time, the involvement of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in other systems has become more apparent, with the increased incidence of thromboembolic events, cardiac involvement as well as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms secondary to the infection. Our case report demonstrates a presentation of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Our patient was diagnosed as positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nine days prior to developing these symptoms. Her COVID-19 infection was otherwise relatively mild, for which she did not seek any medical intervention. A careful assessment ruled out cerebrovascular causes and led us to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-induced labyrinthitis. Our patient was successfully treated as an outpatient without unnecessary investigations and responded well to standard therapy for viral labyrinthitis as per National Health Service (NHS) guidelines. She eventually reported having made a full recovery within three weeks of the initial encounter. Audio-vestibular consequences of COVID-19 are less reported compared to other symptoms of neurological involvement, such as gustatory or olfactory dysfunction, which have become key indicators aiding in the diagnosis of the infection. Among these disorders, the commonly reported presentation is that of vestibular neuronitis. Our case report demonstrates that labyrinthitis is also among the neurological manifestations to be considered as a result of COVID-19, which can be safely managed in the community with the same strategies as those employed for other viral triggers. It also reveals the need for further research into the effects that COVID-19 may have on the audio-vestibular system.","Bokhary, Haider; Chaudhry, Shiza; Abidi, S. M. Rafey",Cureus,589,27

Evaluating the impacts of CICT will aid efforts to improve such programs. OBJECTIVES Estimate the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations averted by CICT and identify CICT processes that could improve overall effectiveness. DESIGN We used data on the proportion of cases interviewed, contacts notified or monitored, and days from testing to case and contact notification from 14 jurisdictions to model the impact of CICT on cumulative case counts and hospitalizations over a 60-day period. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVIDTracer Advanced tool, we estimated a range of impacts by assuming either contacts would quarantine only if monitored or would do so upon notification of potential exposure. We also varied the observed program metrics to assess their relative influence. RESULTS Performance by jurisdictions varied widely. Jurisdictions isolated between 12% and 86% of cases (including contacts that became cases) within 6 to 10 days after infection. We estimated that CICT-related reductions in transmission ranged from 0.4% to 32%. For every 100 remaining cases after other nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented, CICT averted between 4 and 97 additional cases. Reducing time to case isolation by 1 day increased averted case estimates by up to 15 percentage points. Increasing the proportion of cases interviewed or contacts notified by 20 percentage points each resulted in at most 3 or 6 percentage point improvements in averted cases. CONCLUSIONS We estimated that CICT reduced the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among all jurisdictions studied. Reducing time to isolation produced the greatest improvements in impact of CICT.","Jeon, Seonghye; Rainisch, Gabriel; Lash, R Ryan; Moonan, Patrick K; Oeltmann, John E; Greening, Bradford; Adhikari, Bishwa B; Meltzer, Martin I",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,589,1

Data for children (aged <15 years) identified with traumatic injuries during a 10-year period from the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (n = 35,064 among 10,114,909 randomly sampled cases from the claim records of the National Health Insurance) and the authors' institute (n = 39,228) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidences and characteristics of the injuries were investigated using both datasets; additionally, detailed information regarding the injury environments was investigated using the single-institutional data. The findings were similar across both datasets. The incidence of injuries increased during the study period; the head was most commonly injured, whereas the trunk or proximal extremities were rarely injured; low-energy head injuries accounted for >50% of the cases in children aged <5 years, although the incidences of lower-extremity injuries and fractures increased in older children. Single-institutional data demonstrated that the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly during the study period, and outdoor injuries and seasonal variation (with peak incidences in May and June) were more prominent in older children. Based on similarities between both datasets, the detailed results regarding pediatric traumatic injuries obtained from the single-institutional data could be generalized nationally with adequate external validity. To prevent traumatic injuries, it may be more effective to wear protective equipment covering the head and distal extremities rather than the trunk or proximal extremities; simple clothing, such as caps, could prevent many injuries in preschoolers. Among older children, safety guidelines for outdoor sports/leisure activities are needed. The increase in pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially explained by the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Stricter adherence to the preventive guidelines is needed.","Kang, Michael Seungcheol; Kim, Han-Soo",PLoS One,589,1
