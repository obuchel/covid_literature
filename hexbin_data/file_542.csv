We look at the phenomenon from a screen-ecological perspective – where dynamics of consumption, reviewing, production and regulation are interdependently and often contradictorily in play. We examine how these diverse, sometimes conflicted, perspectives can be approached as responding to new forms of internationalisation presented principally by the operations of Netflix in Australia (Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Apple TV+ are also mentioned when relevant). This article is part of a larger project (ARC Discovery DP190100978 Internet-Distributed Television: Cultural, Industrial and Policy Dynamics, chief investigators Ramon Lobato, Amanda Lotz, Stuart Cunningham) studying the cultural, industrial and policy dynamics of multinational SVOD globally and in situ locally.","Cunningham, Stuart; Scarlata, Alexa",,542,1

The copolymers were comprised of poly(tetramethylene oxide) segments with the molecular weights of 650–2,900 Da and of mono-disperse bisester-tetra-amide segments (T6A6T) based on adipic acid (A), terephthalic acid (T) and hexamethylene diamine (6). An increasing content of T6A6T gave rise to an increased modulus, yield stress and fracture stress. The modulus could be modeled by a composite model. Moreover, a strain-softening was observed well below the yield stress, due to the shearing of the T6A6T crystallites. At strains >200%, a strain-hardening of the PTMO segments took place and this even for PTMO segments that were amorphous in the isotropic state. The strain hardening increased the tensile properties. An increase in temperature had little effect on the modulus of the copolymers, but was found to lower the yield and fracture stresses. At temperatures above the melting temperature of the oriented PTMO, no strain-hardening took place. The yield stress as a function of temperature could be described by the Eyring relationship, but a modulus–yield stress relationship could not be established.","Biemond, G. J.

Risk stratification may help to identify individuals with COVID-19 risk levels and take appropriate measures. Objectives: (a) To reduce the burden of (COVID-19 among) corporate health-care ecosystem by multiple layers of screening of employees and their families through Nurse Education Health Assistants (NEHA) mobile application and using VIEW (COVID-19 Early Warning System) scores. (b) To offer teleconsultation services to individuals with the assistance of doctors and NEHA coaches (c) To assess accuracy/efficacy of VIEW system. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey using NEHA mobile application was conducted among 2424 employees and their families of a leading multinational company. The human resource staff of the company collected data using NEHA application and uploaded it through a web portal. Further investigation was carried out by NEHA coaches through telephonic consultation using VIEW data. Results: More than half of the participants received the same VIEW scores by system and doctor zone, i.e., A VIEW score (58.54%), B VIEW score (59.63%), and C VIEW score (66.67%). System zone of VIEW system was compatible to categorize participants depending upon the level of risk probability toward COVID-19. Furthermore, NEHA coach and doctor gave the same VIEW scores under A (81.74%), B (67.63%), and C (38.46%). Conclusion: VIEW system is useful to detect risk probability toward COVID-19 infection and stratify patients under different VIEW zones to prioritize medical care, identify isolation needs, identify hospitalization needs at a scale.","Joshi, S.; Sakhare, G.; Pais, A.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the organization and execution of activities in the clinical sector. Asymptomatic infections are increasingly being identified when patients seek medical advice for non-respiratory system illnesses, particularly digestive system symptoms. This has posed a significant challenge for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 reported to date, patients with typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with symptoms associated with the digestive system. Digestive illness symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are underscored by a bidirectional relationship between respiratory and digestive systems. Because the clinical diagnosis and treatment of digestive illnesses caused by COVID-19 have been challenging so far, we hypothesized that investigating the pathogenesis of digestive system diseases in patients with COVID-19 will provide potential novel targets for its prevention and treatment, and concurrently reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden. This review summarizes the relationship between the digestive and respiratory systems in patients with COVID-19 from the perspective of the ""gut-lung"" axis. We discuss extant literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related digestive symptoms, which may facilitate differential diagnosis and treatment of this condition.","Li, Juan; Li, Chunmei; Wang, Xiaojun; Wang, Yuping; Zhou, Yongning",Ann Palliat Med,542,1

Our objective was to rapidly summarize the emerging evidence of new ways of working in the care of older people during this period. We conducted an exploration of the emerging evidence within the timeframe of 1 March 2020 to 11 May 2020. To capture a broad perspective, we undertook thematic analysis of Twitter data which was extracted through a broad search for new ways of working in health and social care. For a more in-depth focus on the health and social care of older people, we undertook a systematic scoping of newspapers using the Nexis UK database. We undertook a validation workshop with members of the interprofessional working group of the Irish National Integrated Care Programme for Older People, and with researchers. A total of 317 tweets were extracted related to six new ways of working. There was evidence of using telehealth to provide ongoing care to patients; interprofessional work; team meetings using online platforms; trust and collaboration within teams; as well as teams feeling empowered to change at a local level. 34 newspaper articles were extracted related to new ways of working in the care of older people, originating in England (n = 17), Wales (n = 6), Scotland (n = 6), Ireland (n = 4) and Germany (n = 1). Four main themes were captured that focused on role expansion, innovations in communication, environmental restructuring and enablement. The results of this exploration of emerging evidence show that health and social care teams can transform very rapidly. Much of the change was based on goodwill as a response to the pandemic. Further analysis of empirical evidence of changing practices should include the perspectives of older people and should capture the resources needed to sustain innovations, as well as evaluate gaps in service provision.","Ní Shé, Éidín; O039,; Donnell, Deirdre; Shea, Marie; Stokes, Diarmuid",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),542,30

The role of platelet mitochondrial dysfunction in thrombosis, immunoregulation and age-related diseases is increasingly appreciated. Here, we studied platelet mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNApl) and mitochondrial function in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and related this to platelet function. In a cohort of 208 treated PLHIV and 56 uninfected controls, mtDNApl was quantified, as well as platelet activation, platelet agonist-induced reactivity and inflammation by circulating factors and flow cytometry. In a subgroup of participants, the metabolic activity of platelets was further studied by mitochondrial function tests and the Seahorse Flux Analyzer. PLHIV had significantly lower mtDNApl compared to controls (8.5 copies/platelet (IQR: 7.0-10.7) vs. 12.2 copies/platelet (IQR: 9.5-16.6); p < 0.001), also after correction for age, sex and BMI. Prior zidovudine-use (n = 46) was associated with a trend for lower mtDNApl. PLHIV also had reduced ex vivo platelet reactivity and mean platelet volume compared to controls. MtDNApl correlated positively with both platelet parameters and correlated negatively with inflammatory marker sCD163. Mitochondrial function tests in a subgroup of participants confirmed the presence of platelet mitochondrial respiration defects. Platelet mitochondrial function is disturbed in PLHIV, which may contribute to platelet dysfunction and subsequent complications. Interventions targeting the preservation of normal platelet mitochondrial function may ultimately prove beneficial for PLHIV.","van der Heijden, Wouter A; van de Wijer, Lisa; Jaeger, Martin; Grintjes, Karin; Netea, Mihai G; Urbanus, Rolf T; van Crevel, Reinout; van den Heuvel, Lambertus P; Brink, Maaike; Rodenburg, Richard J; de Groot, Philip G; van der Ven, Andre J; de Mast, Quirijn",Sci Rep,542,30

Geometric considerations of rigid rod packing imply that a domain of sufficiently short rods in a background membrane of long rods is more susceptible to twist than the inverse structure, a long-rod domain in a short-rod membrane. The midplane tilt at the interdomain edge forces splay, which, in turn, manifests as spontaneous edge curvature with energetics controlled by the length asymmetry of constituent rods. A thermodynamic model of such tilt-curvature coupling at interdomain edges explains a number of experimental observations, including annularly shaped long-rod domains, and a nonmonotonic dependence of edge twist on domain radius. Our work shows how coupling between orientational and compositional degrees of freedom in two-dimensional fluids gives rise to complex shapes of fluid domains, analogous to shape transitions in 3D fluid vesicles.","Miller, Joia M; Hall, Doug; Robaszewski, Joanna; Sharma, Prerna; Hagan, Michael F; Grason, Gregory M; Dogic, Zvonimir",Sci Adv,542,16

In the later stage of disease, some COVID-19 patients may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure. However, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease is cytokine storm. At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress.

Millions of people have been infected and died from this infection. Until today, the pathophysiology and treatment of this infection remain unknown, but a lot of studies are trying to solve the mystery. The trail of inflammation remains the most convincing, especially the Interleukin 6 (IL-6) which could play an important role in a reaction cascade leading to a cytokine storm. According to studies, although few in number, the Tociluzimab (TCZ), which is an anti-IL6, could prevent or even suppress this storm, leading to a less severe clinical state of the disease and a faster recovery. This could decrease the use of oxygen, avoid the risk of intubation and mortality. Patients and methods This single-center retrospective observational case review brought together 557 COVID-19 seriously ill patients (pulmonary involvement&gt; 25% + SatO2AA &lt;90%) admitted to the intensive care unit of our university hospital from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. They were divided into 2 groups a Tociluzimab group (TCZ group) and a Non Tociluzimab group (NON TCZ) to facilitate the comparison. The aim of the study was to compare the length of hospital stay, use of mechanical ventilation and mortality in the TCZ group versus the NON TCZ group. Results The average age of our patients was 62,05 years (±13.51) and 62.61 years (±16.33) respectively in the TCZ versus NON TCZ group. 76 (76%) were men while 24 were women (24%) in the TCZ group;and there was 313 (68.49%) men and 144 (31.51%) women in the NON TCZ group. Their average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (±4.52) in the TCZ group versus 27.89 kg/m2 (±4.73) in the NON TCZ group. Among them, the TCZ group included 38 (38%) diabetic patients, 38 hypertensive (38%), 12 heart disease (12%) and 2 chronic renal failure (2%), white the NON TCZ group regrouped 35 (7.65%) diabetics, 33 (7.22%) hypertensive, 12 heart disease (2.67%), and 5 chronic renal failure (1.09%) patients. The mean time to consultation of patients was almost similar in the two groups: 8.86 (±7,28) days for TCZ and 8.83 (±7,03) days for NON TCZ. The mean length of ICU hospital stay was 9 days (4,94) for the TCZ group and 8,75 days (4,73) for the other one. The saturation at admission was at 74.92% (10.45) for the TCZ group ranging from 40% to 92%, and at 73,56% for the NON TCZ group. Lung damage from COVID-19 was extensive in 12%, severe in 32%, and critical in 56% of TCZ group enrolled cases. Meanwhile it was extensive in 23.63%, severe in 41,35%, and critical in 35,01% of the NON TCZ group. The biological findings found average of white blood cells at 12256/12082 e/mm3;lymphocytes at 761/842 e/mm3;CRP at 181/199 mg/L;ferritin at 1747/528 μg/L;and fibrinogen at 6.92/6.27 g/L for the TCZ group versus NON TCZ group. Medical care was based on isolation, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, salicylic acid, dexamethasone followed with methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients. The TCZ group received at least 1 course of Tociluzimab dosed at 400 mg (2 patients received 2 doses and 1 patient received 3 doses). The indication of a Tociluzimab course in our department was based on a set of arguments: an increase in oxygen requirements, a progression of lesions on chest-computed tomography and an increase in markers of inflammation, including IL-6, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The invasive mechanical ventilation was indicated for 4 (4%) patients in the TCZ group versus 192 (42,01%) in the NON TCZ. Among the 100 patients included in our cohort in the TCZ group, 40% died in intensive care unit and 60% had a favorable evolution with a decrease of the biological markers of inflammation. However, in the NON TCZ group, 197 (43,10%) passed away. Conclusion The use of Tociluzimab in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not contribute to a significant difference in the reduction in hospital stay. However, the invasive mechanical ventilation was less needed in patients receiving Tociluzimab than the other. Moreover, there was a mortality benefit associated with the use of Tociluzimab, but only before 10 days of hospitalization.","El Rhalete, Abdelilah Rhazi Inas Bensaid Amine Diass Soufiane Kaouini Abderrahim Ounci Essaad Abdi Mohammed Maarad Mohammed Babouh Choukri Alami Zineb Abda Naima Bkiyer Houssam Housni Brahim",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,542,1

We examined these reported behaviors among rural and urban community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older. METHODS: We analyzed public use files from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which fielded a COVID survey from June to October, 2020, restricted to community-dwelling adults (n = 2,982). Eight behaviors were studied: handwashing, avoid touching face, mask wearing, limiting shopping, avoiding restaurants or bars, limiting gatherings, avoiding contact with those outside the household, and distancing. Residence was defined as urban (metropolitan county) or rural (nonmetropolitan county). Difference testing used Chi Square tests, with an alpha level of P = .05. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Rural residents constituted 18.8% (± Standard Error 3.6%) of the study population. In bivariate comparisons, rural older adults were less likely to report 5 of 8 studied behaviors: keep 6-foot distance (rural: 88.3% ±1.0%, urban 93.2% ±.08%), limit gatherings (rural 87.5% ±1.8%; urban 91.6% ±0.8%), avoid restaurants/bars (rural 85.3% ±1.9%, urban 89.6% ±0.8%), avoid touching face (rural 83.1% ±2.3%, urban 88.6%, 0.8%), and avoid contact with those outside the household (rural 80.4% ±2.4%, urban 86.2% ±1.0%). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, only maintaining a 6-foot distance remained lower among rural older adults (AOR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Within older adults, reported compliance with recommended behaviors to limit the spread of COVID-19 was high. Nonetheless, consistent rural shortfalls were noted. Findings highlight the need for rural-specific messaging strategies for future public health emergencies.","Probst, Janice C; Crouch, Elizabeth L; Eberth, Jan M",J Rural Health,542,22

Although passively delivered neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes and CD8+ T cells for optimal clinical and virological benefit. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs utilize Fc effector functions during therapy to mitigate lung infection and disease.","Winkler, Emma S; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Yu, Jinsheng; Bailey, Adam L; Chen, Rita E; Chong, Zhenlu; Zost, Seth J; Jang, Hyesun; Huang, Ying; Allen, James D; Case, James Brett; Sutton, Rachel E; Carnahan, Robert H; Darling, Tamarand L; Boon, Adrianus C M; Mack, Matthias; Head, Richard D; Ross, Ted M; Crowe, James E; Diamond, Michael S",Cell,542,5

Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials.

RESULTS: The majority (88%) of the staff members agreed that the technological skills of giving the online courses increase the educational value of the experience of the college staff. The rate of participant agreement on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and acceptance of e-learning was (77.1%, 76.5%, and 80.9% respectively). The highest barriers to e-learning were insufficient/ unstable internet connectivity (40%), inadequate computer labs (36%), lack of computers/ laptops (32%), and technical problems (32%). Younger age, teaching experience less than 10 years, and being a male are the most important indicators affecting e-learning acceptance. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the challenges and factors influencing the acceptance, and use of e-learning as a tool for teaching within higher education. Thus, it will help to develop a strategic plan for the successful implementation of e-learning and view technology as a positive step towards evolution and change.","Zalat, Marwa Mohamed; Hamed, Mona Sami; Bolbol, Sarah Abdelhalim",PLoS One,542,10

Structured and pretested short questionnaires were employed to obtain information electronically and physically across the six geopolitical zones on socio-demographic characteristics of participants;the knowledge of participants on COVID-19 disease;availability and accessibility to testing and isolation centers in the communities, attitudes and health seeking behaviors. Atotal of 1023 respondents;705 (68.9%) males and 318 (31.1%) females across the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria participated in this study with 477(46.6%) within the 26-45 years age category, and 6(0.6%) above 66 years. Atotal of 985(96.3%) had heard about COVID-19 at the time of survey while a total of 859(84.0%) of the respondents were aware of the presence of COVID-19 laboratory testing centers. Across the geopolitical zones, majority of the respondents 487(47.6%) claimed there are no routine testing for COVID-19 at their community level, while 303 (29.6%) affirmed otherwise and 216(21.1%) did not know if there were routine testing going on or not. On health seeking behaviors across the country, majority of the respondents 558(54.5%) affirmed they would visit the hospital as the first point of contact if the opportunitypresented itself, 244(23.9%) claimed they would call the NCDC toll line, 2(0.2%) said they would use prayers, while 1(0.1%) respectively claimed they would use home management strategies through visiting chemist stores and checking the internet for solutions.

Previous antibioticotherapy may be an efficient procedure to lessen the hazards of this process. The purpose of this study was to analyse the concentration of polimorphonuclears (PMN) in the lung alveolar septum of rats, after induced ischemia followed by intestinal reperfusion, with and without previous antibiotictoherapy. Forty-eight rats were used, randomly divided into 6 groups of 8 animals each (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Groups A, C and E did not receive antibiotic and groups B, D and F received 500mg/Kg of erythromycin orally. Groups A and B were the control groups. In the groups C and D intestinal ischemia was induced for 30 min; and in groups E and F reperfusion for 30 min followed the ischemia. A thoracothomy was performed and the lungs were removed and sent for histopathologic and histometric analysis. The number of PMN in the alveolar septum was observed. The control group (A) showed a mean number of 4.2 PMN per field in the septum; in the ichemia group (C) , the mean number of PMN was 13.6 and in the group where the reperfusion followed ischemia (E), the number of PMN was 17,5. The comparison between the mean number of PMN in groups A and C and A and E showed a statistically significant difference (p 0.0001). However, the difference between the groups C and E was not significant (p=0.095). The mean number of PMN per field was of 8.6 in group B; 9.9 in group D and 12.9 in group F. The comparison between the groups B and D demonstrated a p=0.007. The comparison between the groups that received antibiotics or not demonstrated that the number of PMN in group B was twice as much as in group A (p=0.0049) . Group C showed a greater concentration of PMN than did group D (p=0.019). In group E there was a greater concentration of PMN than in group F (p=0.014). It may be concluded that: (1) intestinal ischemia leads to a greater PMN concentration in the alveolar septum; (2) previous antibioticotherapy increased lung inflammatory infiltrate in the alveolus of rats with normal intestines; (3) PMN density was greater in alveolar septum of animals who underwent I/R than those who were not reperfused, and (4) previous antibioticotherapy reduced significantly the PMN concentration after I/R.","de Lourdes Pessole Biondo-Simões, Maria; Hintz Greca, Fernando; Ioshi, Sérgio; Leonardo de Souza Landmann, Felype; Luiz Mandelli, Fernando; Alexandre Arias Malaver, Gonzalo; Gomy, Israel",Acta cir. bras.,542,20

The students were assessed on the usage of adaptive (humanitarian and seeking social support) and maladaptive coping strategies (acceptance and mental disengagement). The results showed that the students used maladaptive coping strategies more than adaptive coping strategies to deal with anxiety caused by the pandemic and the effect of restriction of movement. Seeking social support and acceptance coping strategies were significantly associated with the level of anxiety. The student's gender, age, ethnicity, level and type of study, and living arrangement were associated with coping strategies.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-induced home confinement on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours and the correlations between them. Methods: Participants included 144 students (aged 18-22 years, 62.5% female, 89.5% single). Stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), d2 test, and the Simple Lifestyle Indicator Questionnaire adapted and modified (SLIQ), respectively. Total PSS score, concentration performance (CP), errors (E), and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise/activity, alcohol, and smoking) before and during confinement were calculated. Results: The data showed a significant difference between before and during confinement in total PSS, CP, E, and all lifestyle behaviours (all, p < 0.05). Significant correlations existed between total PSS score, CP, E, and lifestyle behaviours (r= -87-98, all, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Home confinement has a negative effect on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours.

COVID-19 infection was associated with significant mean QTc prolongation from baseline by both 5-day and 2-day multivariable models (5-day, patients with COVID-19: 20.81 [95% CI, 15.29 to 26.33] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: −2.01 [95% CI, −17.31 to 21.32] milliseconds; P = .93; 2-day, patients with COVID-19: 17.40 [95% CI, 12.65 to 22.16] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: 0.11 [95% CI, −12.60 to 12.81] milliseconds; P = .99). COVID-19 infection was independently associated with a modeled mean 27.32 (95% CI, 4.63-43.21) millisecond increase in QTc at 5 days compared with COVID-19–negative status (mean QTc, with COVID-19: 450.45 [95% CI, 441.6 to 459.3] milliseconds; without COVID-19: 423.13 [95% CI, 403.25 to 443.01] milliseconds; P = .01). More patients with COVID-19 not receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19 (34 of 136 [25.0%] vs 17 of 158 [10.8%], P = .002). Multivariable analysis revealed that age 80 years and older compared with those younger than 50 years (mean difference in QTc, 11.91 [SE, 4.69; 95% CI, 2.73 to 21.09]; P = .01), severe chronic kidney disease compared with no chronic kidney disease (mean difference in QTc, 12.20 [SE, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.89 to 22.51; P = .02]), elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.05 [SE, 1.19; 95% CI, 2.72 to 7.38]; P < .001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.31 [SE, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.06 to 10.57]; P = .04) were associated with QTc prolongation. Torsades de pointes occurred in 1 patient (0.1%) with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, COVID-19 infection was independently associated with significant mean QTc prolongation at days 5 and 2 of hospitalization compared with day 0. More patients with COVID-19 had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey A.; Desai, Amar D.; Chai, Zilan; Wang, Aijin; Chen, Qixuan; Wang, Amy S.; Kemal, Cameron; Baksh, Haajra; Biviano, Angelo; Dizon, Jose M.; Yarmohammadi, Hirad; Ehlert, Frederick; Saluja, Deepak; Rubin, David A.; Morrow, John P.; Avula, Uma Mahesh R.; Berman, Jeremy P.; Kushnir, Alexander; Abrams, Mark P.; Hennessey, Jessica A.; Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J.; Uriel, Nir; Kubin, Christine J.; LaSota, Elijah; Zucker, Jason; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E.; Schwartz, Allan; Garan, Hasan; Waase, Marc P.; Wan, Elaine Y.",JAMA Netw Open,542,24

Methods A total of 42 patients with COVID-19 of the ordinary type were adopted. Shénquè (神阙CV8) and Tiānshū (天枢ST25) were selected. Heat-sensitive moxibustion was operated according to the required standard, 40 min to 60 min each time, once daily. Before and after moxibustion, the improvements in clinical symptoms were evaluated, such as chest oppression, poor appetite, lassitude and negative emotions. Results (1) The number of cases and the incidence was 21 cases (50.0%), 24 cases (57.1%) and 26 cases (61.9%) for chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude before heat-sensitive moxibustion. The number of cases was reduced to be 10 cases (23.8%), 7 cases (16.7%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 1st treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion for chest oppression, poor appetite, and lassitude. It was reduced to be 11 cases (26.2%), 8 cases (19.0%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 2nd treatment of moxibustion and it was reduced to be 18 cases (42.9%), 10 cases (23.8%) and 6 cases (14.3%) after the 3rd treatment of moxibustion. The incidences of the symptoms were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (2) Before treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion, there were 24 cases of negative emotions (57.1%). It was reduced to be 16 cases (38.1%), 11 cases (26.2%) and 3 cases (7.1%) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion successively. The incidences were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (3) After the 1st treatment, the active acceptance rate of heat-sensitive moxibustion was 100% (42/42) in the patients, higher than 11.9% (5/42) before treatment. Conclusion Adjuvant treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion effectively relieves the symptoms of COVID-19 such as chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude, and alleviates the negative emotions, such as tension and anxiety. This therapy improves the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 and deserves to be promoted in clinical practice.","HUANG, Xian-bao; XIE, Ding-yi; QIU, Qi; SHEN, Yang; JIAO, Lin; LI, Qiao-lin; CHEN, Ri-xin",World Journal of Acupuncture - Moxibustion,542,16
