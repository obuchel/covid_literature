29388,Procyonids and Viverids,2014-06-25,"This chapter reviews the anatomy and physiology of the rabbit eye from a comparative perspective. The anatomy of the rabbit eye reflects its niche as a diurnal herbivore. The rabbit has both photopic and scotopic vision without the benefit of a tapetum. Orbits are laterally situated; the rabbit is one of the few animals in which the orbital axis coincides with the visual axis. The shape of the orbit is circular, compared to the cone shaped human orbit. The orbital walls are of bone, except inferiorly, where the wall is formed partially by the muscles of mastication. The superior orbital wall is formed by the frontal bone. The supraorbital process of the frontal bone contains three supraorbital foramina, which are unique feature of the rabbit orbit; the foramina are incisures formed into apertures by a cartilaginous sheet. The optic foramina share a common canal anteriorly with only a thin boney plate to divide them, which disappears posteriorly to form one canal opening into the cranium as a single foramen. Entropion in young rabbits can occur as a primary or as a secondary condition arising from infection. Viral-induced eyelid proliferations can result from infection by the rabbit myxoma and papilloma viruses. The papilloma virus is a part of the papovaviridae and is a DNA virus transmitted by arthropod vectors. The cottontail rabbit in the mid-western United States is most frequently affected, although domestic rabbits are susceptible.","Peiffer, Robert L.; Pohm-Thorsen, Laurie; Corcoran, Kelly",The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149682/,756
29428,Overview of African Wild Dog Medicine,2018-09-28,"The safe operation of a laboratory that focuses on biomedical research is difficult. No single source of information can provide all the information and guidance necessary to develop an adequate safety program/plan to protect laboratory personnel from various hazards. Most countries and provinces have regulations related to safety precautions that may need to be followed by laboratories. This chapter draws attention to general considerations concerning safety approaches in biomedical research laboratories in the United States. The operation of biomedical research laboratories requires attention to many complex issues that depend on the goals and activities of each specific laboratory. All laboratories should consider issues in physical, electrical, and fire safety. Safety can be maintained with the careful evaluation of all safety incidents and modification of the safety plan to prevent similar incidents. Regulations specify approaches necessary to protect employees from blood-borne pathogens, general laboratory chemicals, and specific chemicals such as formaldehyde. All employees need to work in order to maintain a safe working environment. This requires establishing a safety infrastructure, developing and monitoring of an effective safety plan, and imparting information about safety hazards associated with special types of laboratory work: biohazards, chemical hazards, and radiation hazards.","Grizzle, William E.; Bell, Walter C.; Fredenburgh, Jerry",Molecular Diagnostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149828/,756

Around the world HPs face similar challenges when patients express their existential and spiritual views. How HPs engage these views, and the degree of embedment into consultations, differ across cultures. Today, more than ever before, researchers in this field need to share experiences and build new knowledge upon local findings. To meet this demand, we founded the international collaboration ""Network for Research on Spirituality and Health"" ( https://NERSH.org ). One of the central projects of our network has been to build a large international data pool of health professionals' attitudes toward religiosity and spirituality. Today the data pool hosts answers from more than 6,000 health professionals from 17 separate surveys derived from 12 countries. Data were gathered by either the questionnaire ""Religion and Spirituality in Medicine, Perspectives of Physicians"" (RSMPP) or its successor 'NERSH Questionnaire'. In this article we describe the methodology behind the construction of the data pool. We also present an overview of five available scales related to HP religiosity and spirituality, including a description of scale reliability and dimensionality.","Kørup, Alex Kappel; Søndergaard, Jens; Alyousefi, Nada A; Lucchetti, Giancarlo; Baumann, Klaus; Lee, Eunmi; Karimah, Azimatul; Ramakrishnan, Parameshwaran; Frick, Eckhard; Büssing, Arndt; Schouten, Esther; Butcher, Wyatt; Hefti, René; Wermuth, Inga; Hvidt, Niels Christian",Journal of religion and health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01077-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776266/,756
60424,Abnormal liver biochemistry constitutes an independent prognostic factor of a less favorable clinical course in patients with COVID-19.,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND Accuracy of MRI in assessing mesorectal fascia and predicting circumferential resection margin decreases in low anterior rectal tumors. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of endorectal ultrasound in predicting the pathologic circumferential resection margin in low rectal anterior tumors and to compare it with MRI findings. DESIGN This was a prospective series comparing the preoperative circumferential resection margin assessed by endorectal ultrasound and MRI with pathologic examination. SETTINGS The study was conducted by a specialized colorectal multidisciplinary team at a tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS Between 2002 and 2008, 76 patients with mid to low rectal cancer were preoperatively evaluated by endorectal ultrasound and MRI and underwent total mesorectal excision without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients with posterior or postero-lateral tumors were excluded, leaving 49 patients with anterior or antero-lateral tumors for the present subanalysis. We compared preoperative circumferential resection margin status using endorectal ultrasound and MRI with pathologic examination. INTERVENTIONS We conducted a comparison between preoperative circumferential resection margin status and pathologic examination after total mesorectal excision surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accuracy in predicting pathologic circumferential resection margin status was measured. RESULTS Overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound and MRI in assessing circumferential resection margin status was 83.7% and 91.8%, with negative predictive values of 97.2% and 97.5%. When focusing on low rectal tumors, the overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound increased to 87.5%, whereas the accuracy of MRI decreased to 87.5%, with a negative predictive value of 95.6% for both diagnostic tests. LIMITATIONS The sample size is small, and interobserver variability in radiologic assessment was not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS Endorectal ultrasound can help MRI in predicting circumferential resection margin involvement in mid to low anterior rectal cancer, especially at the low third of the rectum, with a high negative predictive value.","Granero-Castro, Pablo; Muñoz, Elena; Frasson, Matteo; García-Granero, Alvaro; Esclapez, Pedro; Campos, Salvador; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Garcia-Granero, Eduardo",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807595/,756
65791,Latin American authorship in scientific production on COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"Background: Mesh augmentation for large hiatal hernia is still controversial because of high alleged risk of chronic reaction or shrinkage of mesh orifice surrounding the esophagus. The aim of this cohort study was to develop and establish an image analysis scheme, including 3D reconstruction, for MRI-visible meshes (DynaMesh®) to measure postoperative mesh shrinkage in order to observe potential complications. Methods: Between 12/2012 and 10/2016, n = 33 patients underwent surgery to correct symptomatic hiatal hernia (implantation indicated: n = 18). Intraoperative measurement of the hiatal surface area (HSA) > 5 cm2 was indication for mesh implantation. Early postoperatively, and during long-term follow-up, MRI was performed and patients filled out the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI score). Results: Follow-up rate was 76% (n = 25/33). Overall recurrence rate was 4% (1/25). No other patient showed reflux or dysphagia symptoms. Mesh related complications were not observed during follow-up period. Median GIQLI score of patients with mesh was 123 (range: 67-144), and 93 (52-141) for patients without mesh. Comparison of early and mid-term postoperative MRI for patients with mesh showed changes in mesh orifice size of 3% (corresponding to a slight increase in size of about 6 mm2) without any significant correlations with BMI, HSA, or patient age. Conclusion: We established an image analysis and 3D reconstruction scheme for MRI visible meshes in hiatal hernia repair. MRI images of normal clinical quality are sufficient for this analysis. Mesh orifice size in MRI-visible meshes does not seem to change at a clinically relevant level in the small cohort observed here. Further studies of large cohorts are necessary to establish if HSA >5 cm2 could be a suitable measure for indication of mesh implantation.","Weyhe, Dirk; Klinge, Uwe; Uslar, Verena Nicole; Tabriz, Navid; Kluge, Alexander",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2019.00017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058163/,756
70669,"Author´s answer to: ""Effect of adacolumn® in ulcerative colitis with COVID-19"".",2020-06-04,"UNLABELLED ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. IMPORTANCE Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification activity.","Li, Changqing; Debing, Yannick; Jankevicius, Gytis; Neyts, Johan; Ahel, Ivan; Coutard, Bruno; Canard, Bruno",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00705-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440879/,756

76188,[Vulnerability and Health Care. Law and Medical Protocols].,2020,"Interaction of metal or oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with biological soft matter is one of the central phenomena in basic and applied biology-oriented nanoscience. Often, this interaction includes adsorption of suspended proteins on the NP surface, resulting in the formation of the protein corona around NPs. Structurally, the corona contains a ""hard"" monolayer shell directly contacting a NP and a more distant weakly associated ""soft"" shell. Chemically, the corona is typically composed of a mixture of distinct proteins. The corresponding experimental and theoretical studies have already clarified many aspects of the corona formation. The process is, however, complex, and its understanding is still incomplete. Herein, we present a kinetic mean-field model of the formation of the ""hard"" corona with emphasis on the role of (i) protein-diffusion limitations and (ii) interplay between competitive adsorption of distinct proteins and irreversible reconfiguration of their native structure. The former factor is demonstrated to be significant only in the very beginning of the corona formation. The latter factor is predicted to be more important. It may determine the composition of the corona on the time scales comparable or longer than a few hours.","Zhdanov, Vladimir P; Cho, Nam-Joon",Mathematical biosciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2016.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720880/,756

A case report.,2018,"Numerous designs for tunneled hemodialysis catheter have been developed in an effort to improve catheter function and survival. In this prospective randomized controlled study, 97 patients were randomized into the palindrome catheter group (PC, n = 47) and step-tip catheter group (SC, n = 50). Demographic characteristics were not different between the two groups. The effective blood flow rates at different pump speeds were comparable between the two groups. The recirculation was low within acceptable range in both types of catheter, and hemodialysis adequacy was not different between the two groups. However, when arterial and venous blood lines were reversed, while the recirculation was significantly increased in SC, it was not increased at all in PC. The catheter dysfunction-free survival rate was significantly higher in PC than in SC (78.9% vs. 54.4% at 2 months, p = 0.008). The overall catheter survival rate was also higher in PC than in SC (90.6% vs. 68.8% at 2 months, p = 0.015). We conclude that both catheters are equally effective on the adequate hemodialysis and low recirculation. However, the PCs have advantages over the SCs in terms of lower catheter dysfunction rate, lower recirculation with reversed blood lines, higher short-term catheter survival rate.","Hwang, Hyeon Seok; Kang, Seok Hui; Choi, Sun Ryoung; Sun, In O; Park, Hoon Suk; Kim, Yongsoo",Seminars in dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-139x.2012.01054.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22360500/,756
83328,"Amblyomma nodosum Neumann, 1889 on collared anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla) from the Andean region of Colombia.",2020,"BACKGROUND The decision to biopsy a peripheral nerve tumor is largely based on its presumed behavior and prognosis, determined by patient history, clinical exam, and radiologic characteristics. Percutaneous image-guided biopsy is not without risk in patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs); in particular, there may be concern regarding worsening neurologic function, increasing neuropathic pain, and incorrect or absent diagnosis. METHODS Following approval by our institutional review board, we reviewed records from 1990 to 2019 at our institution's three main sites (""our institution""). Patients with pathology-proven MPNST were selected. Further inclusion criteria included image-guided percutaneous biopsy performed at our institution, pathology report available for review, and follow-up documentation to determine post-biopsy complications. RESULTS Three hundred thirty-one patients with MPNST were reviewed. In total, 73 patients undergoing image-guided percutaneous biopsies were included. Twenty-two (30.1%) had biopsy-related complications. This included ten patients with misdiagnosis (13.7%) and six patients with non-diagnostic biopsies (8.2%). Six patients had new or worsened pain that resolved with time and neuropathic pain medication (8.2%), and one patient had subjectively worsened proximal weakness (1.3%) which resolved. CONCLUSION We found nearly a third of patients undergoing biopsy had a biopsy-related complication. The single largest complication was the inability to obtain an accurate diagnosis (21.9%) with the first biopsy. This may lead to the need for repeat percutaneous or open biopsies, or a non-oncologic initial surgery with implications for disease-free and overall survival. Neurologic complications including exacerbation of pain or a deficit were rare and transient. It remains important that clinicians balance the potential risks and benefits based on individual patient characteristics when determining the necessity of an image-guided percutaneous biopsy.","Pendleton, Courtney; Howe, B Matthew; Spinner, Robert J",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04556-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901394/,756

METHODS In a randomized control trial, 71 preadolescent children (39 girls) at the age of 9-10 years were randomly assigned to a cardiovascular exercise group (CE), a motor exercise group (ME) as well as a control group (CON) in which students were attending assisted homework. The participants attended their program three times per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Steroid hormones in the saliva, working memory performance and state-trait anxiety levels were determined before and after the intervention. RESULTS Statistical analysis showed no chronic changes in hormones through the interventions. Stepwise hierarchical regression revealed the Testosterone*ME-interaction to be a significant moderator for working memory performance post-intervention (β = 0.48, p = 0.014). Within the ME, increases of Testosterone from t1 to t2 were predicting higher working memory performance post-intervention (β = 0.45, R2 = 0.16, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest 1.) that motor-exercise-induced cognitive benefits are moderated by changes in Testosterone and 2.) that a 10-week exercise training of moderate intensity and with a motor demanding vs a cardiovascular character does not affect the chronic concentration of salivary Testosterone, Estradiol and Progesterone nor anxiety levels in preadolescent children.","Akko, Davin P; Koutsandréou, Flora; Murillo-Rodríguez, Eric; Wegner, Mirko; Budde, Henning",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.113168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916181/,756

However, they are associated with pressure-related nasal injury, which causes pain and discomfort. Nasal injury may necessitate a change in interface and occasionally damage is severe enough to require surgical repair. We aim to determine the incidence and risk factors for nasal injury in preterm infants, and to provide clinicians with strategies to effectively prevent and treat it. DESIGN We conducted a systematic search of databases including MEDLINE (PubMed including the Cochrane Library), EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus. Included studies enrolled human preterm infants and were published prior to 20 February 2017. RESULTS Forty-five studies were identified, including 14 ra ndomised controlled trials, 10 observational studies, two cohort studies, eight case reports and 11 reviews. The incidence of nasal injury in preterm infants ranged from 20-100%. Infants born <30 weeks' gestation are at highest risk. Strategies shown to reduce nasal injury included: nasal barrier dressings (2 studies, n=244, risk ratio (RD) -0.12, 95%, CI - 0.20 to -0.04), nasal high flow therapy as an alternative to binasal prong CPAP (7 studies, n=1570, risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.10), and nasal masks rather than binasal prongs (5 studies, n=544, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Nasal injury is common in preterm infants born <30 weeks' gestational age receiving CPAP via binasal prongs. Larger randomised trials are required to fully evaluate strategies to reduce nasal injury.","Imbulana, Dilini I; Manley, Brett J; Dawson, Jennifer A; Davis, Peter G; Owen, Louise S",Archives of disease in childhood.

METHODS An SILS™ port using three 5-mm instrument cannulas or EndoCone™ port was used to perform an initial limited laparoscopic abdominal exploration. The stomach and descending duodenum were explored intracorporeally and the jejunum through orad descending colon was explored extracorporeally. All intestinal procedures (enterotomy, biopsy, resection, and anastomosis) were performed extracorporeally. Omentalization of affected bowel was accomplished either intracorporeally or extracorporeally. Short-term outcome was determined. RESULTS SILAIS was completed successfully in all but 1 dog and all animals had a good short-term outcome. Most (n = 5) animals were discharged the day after surgery. SILAIS was performed in a median of 120 minutes (interquartile range; 82-148 minutes) and was associated with a moderate level of difficulty. No major complications occurred but conversion to celiotomy (n = 1) and enlargement of the incision (n = 3) was required because of inability to exteriorize the affected bowel. CONCLUSIONS SILAIS using an SILS™ or EndoCone™ port in dogs and cats is feasible and appears effective in selected cases. Single portal laparoscopic-assisted intestinal surgery might be an effective method of minimizing morbidity in dogs and cats with uncomplicated intestinal disease.","Case, J Brad; Ellison, Gary",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2013.12017.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607662/,756

110772,Safety in Digestive Endoscopy during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.,2021-01-07,"Donor-reactive memory T cells generated via heterologous immunity represent a potent barrier to long-term graft survival following transplantation because of their increased precursor frequency, rapid effector function, altered trafficking patterns, and reduced reliance on costimulation signals for activation. Thus, the identification of pathways that control memory T cell survival and secondary recall potential may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we discovered that donor-specific effector/memory CD8+ T cell populations generated via exposure to acute vs. latent vs. chronic infections contain differential frequencies of CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIB. Results indicated that frequencies of FcγRIIB-expressing CD8+ donor-reactive memory T cells inversely correlated with allograft rejection. Further, adoptive T cell transfer of Fcgr2b-/- CD8+ T cells resulted in an accumulation of donor-specific CD8+ memory T cells and enhanced recall responses, indicating that FcγRIIB functions intrinsically to limit T cell CD8+ survival in vivo. Lastly, we show that deletion of FcγRIIB on donor-specific CD8+ memory T cells precipitated costimulation blockade-resistant rejection. These data therefore identify a novel cell-intrinsic inhibitory pathway that functions to limit the risk of memory T cell-mediated rejection following transplantation and suggest that therapeutic manipulation of this pathway could improve outcomes in sensitized patients.","Morris, Anna B; Pinelli, David F; Liu, Danya; Wagener, Maylene; Ford, Mandy L",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32154641/,756

116550,Impact of liver injury on the severity of COVID-19: Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.,2020-12-03,"Vascular leak is a key driver of organ injury in diseases, and strategies that reduce enhanced permeability and vascular inflammation are promising therapeutic targets. Activation of the Angiopoietin-1 (ANG1)-Tie2 tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is an important regulator of vascular quiescence. Here we describe the design and construction of a new soluble ANG1 mimetic that is a potent activator of endothelial Tie2 in vitro and in vivo. Using a chimeric fusion strategy, we replaced the extracellular matrix (ECM) binding and oligomerization domain of ANG1 with a heptameric scaffold derived from the C-terminus of serum complement protein C4-binding protein α (C4BP). We refer to this new fusion protein biologic as Hepta-ANG1, which forms a stable heptamer and induces Tie2 phosphorylation in cultured cells, and in the lung following i.v. injection of mice. Injection of Hepta-ANG1 ameliorates VEGF- and lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular leakage, in keeping with the known functions of Angpt1-Tie2 in maintaining quiescent vascular stability. The new Hepta-ANG1 fusion is easy to produce and displays remarkable stability with high multimericity that can potently activate Tie2. It could be a new candidate ANG1 mimetic therapy for treatments of inflammatory vascular leak, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. This article is protected by copyright.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations. SUMMARY Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks. Our recommendations and the guidelines we discuss here are based on C-level recommendations but help provide a framework for how to counsel our patients during this pandemic.","Calabrese, Cassandra; Lehman, Bethany",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744823/,756
117588,[Respiratory viral infections during episodes of fever in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].,2020-08-01,"Prior exercise has previously been shown to impair subsequent endurance performance in non-activated muscles. Declines in the neuromuscular function and altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained, sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function. Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance.","Greenhouse-Tucknott, A; Wrightson, J G; Raynsford, M; Harrison, N A; Dekerle, J",Psychophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578885/,756

One hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients with surgical resection of a pituitary adenoma/cystic pituitary lesion were retrospectively analyzed, blinded to clinical data and histopathological diagnosis. Different morphologic criteria were assessed: signal intensity in T2/T1w images, pattern of contrast enhancement, size, super-/infrasellar extension, and invasion of the cavernous sinus. For validation of the criteria, a second independent patient cohort (n = 102) was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy of the criteria. We identified differences between subtypes of pituitary adenomas regarding morphological MRI criteria. Especially, ACTH-producing adenomas and GH-producing adenomas showed partially specific imaging features. Application of our criteria on the second patient cohort (n = 102) did however not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Only differentiation between cystic pituitary lesions and adenomas was facilitated using these criteria, but did not reach statistical significance in this cohort (P = 0.352). MRI criteria might facilitate differentiation between pituitary adenomas and cystic pituitary lesions, but not between subtypes of pituitary adenomas. These subtypes show partially specific MR imaging features, however, due to a high variability knowledge of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings remain essential for the correct diagnosis.","Bette, Stefanie; Butenschön, Vicki M; Wiestler, Benedikt; von Werder, Alexander; Schmid, Roland M; Lehmberg, Jens; Zimmer, Claus; Meyer, Bernhard; Kirschke, Jan S; Gempt, Jens",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-018-1049-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426354/,756

We aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroxychloroquine on day 90 mortality in this specific population. Methods This retrospective, multicenter, propensity matched cohort analysis, used data of adult patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 3 university affiliated intensive care units between March 7, 2020, to April 7, 2020 in Lyon, France. Patients received either hydroxychloroquine (loading dose of 400 mg twice daily at day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 10) or standard of care without hydroxychloroquine. We compared all-cause mortality at day-90 after ICU admission between propensity score matched groups receiving hydroxychloroquine or standard of care. Results A total of 157 patients were included with a day-28 and day-90 mortality rate of 23.6% and 32.5%, respectively. The median (interquartile) age was 67 years (56-76 years), 105 (66.9%) were men, 65 (41.4%) fulfilled criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 64 (41%) received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 10 days (4-10 days). In the propensity score matched cohort (59 patients in each group), day-90 mortality was 35.6% for patients who received HCQ and 23.7% for patients who did not (P=0.23). Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed no statistically significant association between HCQ therapy and mortality (P=0.20 by log-rank test). Conclusions In this study, off-label use of HCQ in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was not associated with any significant change in medium-term prognosis, confirming results of studies in less severe patients.","Cour, Martin; Amaz, Camille; Bohé, Julien; Rimmelé, Thomas; Ovize, Michel; Argaud, Laurent",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-7811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987222/,756

MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed reduced port distal gastrectomy through the E·Z Access™ oval type device with three trocars in the umbilical incision, plus the use of additional 5 mm and 2 mm ports. All routine procedures performed in conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (CLDG) were achieved in RPDG. RESULTS We employed this technique without the use of additional trocars or conversion to laparotomy in all 25 patients. The median length of the operation was 340 (range, 220-487) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 30 (range, 5-440) ml. Neither major postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 11 days. The umbilical wound was indistinct. The patients were also highly satisfied with the cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSION Reduced port surgery using the E · Z Access™ oval type device was successfully applied for gastric cancer. This method is technically feasible, produces superior cosmetic results and thus could be an attractive surgical option for gastric cancer patients.","Shibao, Kazunori; Sato, Norihiro; Higure, Aiichiro; Yamaguchi, Koji",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2014.985684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418814/,756

The molecular mechanisms regulating the balance between NSC self-renewal and neurogenesis are not fully understood. Using mouse in utero electroporation (IUE) technique and in vitro human NSC differentiation models including cerebral organoids (hCOs), we show here that regulator of cell cycle (RGCC) modulates NSC self-renewal and neuronal differentiation by affecting cell cycle regulation and spindle orientation. RGCC deficiency hampers normal cell cycle process and dysregulates the mitotic spindle, thus driving more cells to divide asymmetrically. These modulations diminish the NSC population and cause NSC pre-differentiation that eventually leads to brain developmental malformation in hCOs. We further show that RGCC might regulate NSC spindle orientation by affecting the organization of centrosome and microtubules. Our results demonstrate that RGCC is essential to maintain the NSC pool during cortical development and suggest that RGCC defects could have etiological roles in human brain malformations.","Guo, Zhenming; Chen, Mengxia; Chao, Yiming; Cai, Chunhai; Liu, Liangjie; Zhao, Li; Li, Linbo; Bai, Qing-Ran; Xu, Yanxin; Niu, Weibo; Shi, Lei; Bi, Yan; Ren, Decheng; Yuan, Fan; Shi, Shuyue; Zeng, Qian; Han, Ke; Shi, Yi; Bian, Shan; He, Guang",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202051781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323349/,756

131072,COVID-19. Immunothrombosis and the gastrointestinal tract.,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND Airway management in entrapped casualties with restricted access to the head is challenging. If tracheal intubation is required and conventional laryngoscopy is not possible, intubation must be attempted in a face-to-face approach. Traditionally, this is performed with a standard laryngoscope held in the right hand with the blade facing upward. Recently, alternative methods have been developed to facilitate difficult intubations, and we hypothesised that such techniques are also useful for face-to-face intubations. METHODS 24 (trainee) anaesthesiologists attempted tracheal intubation in a patient simulator (SimMan, Laerdal, Norway) using three techniques in random order: (1) direct laryngoscopy (Macintosh blade #3), (2) indirect optical laryngoscopy (Airtraq, Prodol, Spain) and (3) video laryngoscopy (McGrath, Aircraft Medical, UK). The manikin was sitting with the neck immobilised and only accessible from the left anterolateral side. Success rate (percentage (95% CI)) and tube insertion time (median (IQR)) were recorded. RESULTS Success rate did not differ significantly (Airtraq and McGrath 100% (84% to 100%), direct laryngoscopy 88% (68% to 96%)). Intubation was faster with Airtraq (25 s (22-34), p<0.001) and direct laryngoscopy (34 s (22-48), p<0.05) compared with the McGrath technique (55 s (37-96)). CONCLUSIONS All three techniques have a high success rate, but the usefulness of the video laryngoscope is limited due to longer intubation duration. Inverse direct laryngoscopy showed reasonable intubation times and, given the widespread availability of Macintosh laryngoscopes, seems a useful technique. Intubation was always successful and tended to be fastest with the Airtraq device, suggesting that this technique may be a promising alternative.","Schober, Patrick; Krage, Ralf; van Groeningen, Dick; Loer, Stephan A; Schwarte, Lothar A",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2012-202064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24005641/,756
133083,"The importance of a second opinion in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus: a ""real life"" study.",2017,"Emerging data indicate that free heme promotes inflammation in many different disease settings, including in sickle cell disease (SCD). Although free heme, proinflammatory cytokines, and cardiac hypertrophy are co-existing features of SCD, no mechanistic links between these features have been demonstrated. We now report significantly higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and protein in hearts of the Townes sickle cell disease (SS) mice (2.9-fold, p ≤ 0.05) than control mice expressing normal human hemoglobin (AA). We find that experimental administration of heme 50 μmoles/kg body weight induces IL-6 expression directly in vivo and induces gene expression markers of cardiac hypertrophy in SS mice. We administered heme intravenously and found that within three hours plasma IL-6 protein significantly increased in SS mice compared to AA mice (3248 ± 275 vs. 2384 ± 255 pg/ml, p ≤ 0.05). In the heart, heme induced a 15-fold increase in IL-6 transcript in SS mice heart compared to controls. Heme simultaneously induced other markers of cardiac stress and hypertrophy, including atrial natriuretic factor (Nppa; 14-fold, p ≤ 0.05) and beta myosin heavy chain (Myh7; 8-fold, p ≤ 0.05) in SS mice. Our experiments in Nrf2-deficient mice indicate that the cardiac IL-6 response to heme does not require Nrf2, the usual mediator of transcriptional response to heme for heme detoxification by heme oxygenase-1. These data are the first to show heme-induced IL-6 expression in vivo, suggesting that hemolysis may play a role in the elevated IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy seen in patients and mice with SCD. Our results align with published evidence from rodents and humans without SCD that suggest a causal relationship between IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy.","Gbotosho, Oluwabukola T; Kapetanaki, Maria G; Ghosh, Samit; Villanueva, Flordeliza S; Ofori-Acquah, Solomon F; Kato, Gregory J",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973791/,756

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature assessing three databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO). A meta-analysis was performed with data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For non-RCT studies, a critical description of recommendations was performed. RESULTS From a total of 2,825 articles, 125 were included. Of those, three RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the interventions promoted better overall mental health outcomes as compared to control groups (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.87 [95%CI 0.33-1.41], p < 0.001, I2 = 69.2%), but did not specifically improve anxiety (SMD = 0.98 [95%CI -0.17 to 2.13], p > 0.05; I2 = 36.8%).

However, the diverse absolute values and dynamics of different devices, and overall poor repeatability of measurements are a problem. The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that INVOS 5100C, FORE-SIGHT and NONIN EQUANOX 7600 have similar properties concerning absolute values, repeatability, and sensitivity to changes in rStO2. To test repeatability the sensors were repositioned 20 times during hemodynamic steady state on the adult forearm. Afterwards six vascular occlusions by inflation of an upper arm cuff were done to achieve low oxygenation in the forearm. Absolute values were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA, repeatability was estimated by the within-subject standard deviation, Sw, and response to changing oxygenation by the down slope of rStO2 during vascular occlusion in the respective arm. 10 healthy adults, 21-29 years old, with double skinfolds on the forearm less than 10 mm participated. The median rStO2 was 70.7% (interquartile range (IQR) 7.7%), 68.4% (IQR 8.4%), and 64.6% (IQR 4.8) with INVOS, NONIN, and FORE-SIGHT, respectively, the median rate of decline was 13.2%/min (IQR 9.6), 22.8 %/min (IQR 18.0), and 10.8%/min (IQR 6.0), and the same-site repeatability was 2.9% (95% CI 2.4-3.3), 4.6% (CI 3.9-5.3), and 2.0% (CI 1.7-2.3). INVOS gave significantly higher steady state values than FORE-SIGHT, and NONIN had the steepest decline in rStO2, but the poorest repeatability. Two measures of signal-to-noise were similar among devices. This suggests that good repeatability comes at the expense of low sensitivity to changes in oxygenation.

154425,Economic evaluation of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in Spain.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Selective embolization of the left-gastric artery (LGA) reduces levels of ghrelin and achieves significant short-term weight loss. However, embolization of the LGA would prevent the performance of bariatric procedures because the high-risk leakage area (gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]) would be devascularized. AIM To assess an alternative vascular approach to the modulation of ghrelin levels and generate a blood flow manipulation, consequently increasing the vascular supply to the GEJ. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 6 pigs underwent a laparoscopic clipping of the left gastroepiploic artery. Preoperative and postoperative CT angiographies were performed. Ghrelin levels were assessed perioperatively and then once per week for 3 weeks. Reactive oxygen species (ROS; expressed as ROS/mg of dry weight [DW]), mitochondria respiratory rate, and capillary lactates were assessed before and 1 hour after clipping (T0 and T1) and after 3 weeks of survival (T2), on seromuscular biopsies. A celiac trunk angiography was performed at 3 weeks. RESULTS Mean (±standard deviation) ghrelin levels were significantly reduced 1 hour after clipping (1902 ± 307.8 pg/mL vs. 1084 ± 680.0; P = .04) and at 3 weeks (954.5 ± 473.2 pg/mL; P = .01). Mean ROS levels were statistically significantly decreased at the cardia at T2 when compared with T0 (0.018 ± 0.006 mg/DW vs. 0.02957 ± 0.0096 mg/DW; P = .01) and T1 (0.0376 ± 0.008 mg/DW; P = .007). Capillary lactates were significantly decreased after 3 weeks, and the mitochondria respiratory rate remained constant over time at the cardia and pylorus, showing significant regional differences. CONCLUSIONS Manipulation of the gastric flow targeting the gastroepiploic arcade induces ghrelin reduction. An endovascular approach is currently under evaluation.","Diana, Michele; Halvax, Peter; Pop, Raoul; Schlagowski, Isabel; Bour, Gaetan; Liu, Yu-Yin; Legner, Andras; Diemunsch, Pierre; Geny, Bernard; Dallemagne, Bernard; Beaujeux, Rémy; Demartines, Nicolas; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350614552734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294792/,756

Increased awareness among physicians is necessary as PCHA pathology (PCHAP) might be underdiagnosed. Knowledge of sports and professions at risk and risk-factors for obtaining PCHAP is essential for the development of future preventive measures. This study aims to identify sports and professions at risk as well as risk factors for PCHAP. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Twenty-seven papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and described 67 patients with PCHAP involved in seven sports and three professions. The sports (number of cases) were volleyball (41), baseball (13), swimming (1), tennis (3), American football (2), canoeing (1) and yoga (1) (2 unknown). The professions included a baseball coach, a circus trapeze artist and a mechanic. Apart from expert opinions, no studies have identified risk factors for PCHAP. An anatomic variation of the PCHA origin is suggested to be protective for PCHAP. CONCLUSIONS PCHAP is reported in seven overhead sports and three professions. No risk factors for PCHAP were identified. An anatomic variant of the PCHA origin was found to be a potential protective factor for PCHAP. Physicians should be cautious for distal embolization as a result of PCHAP in athletes and workers, both adult and adolescent, involved in repetitive powerful overhead movements.","Kraan, Rik B; Beers, Lisa; van de Pol, Daan; Daams, Joost G; Maas, Mario; Kuijer, P Paul",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.18.08579-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877677/,756

The Mexican Experience"".",2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND Chronic constipation can have one or more of many etiologies, and a diagnosis based on symptoms is not sufficient as a basis for treatment, in particular surgery. AIM To investigate the cause of chronic constipation in a patient with complete absence of spontaneous bowel movements. METHODS High-resolution colonic manometry was performed to assess motor functions of the colon, rectum, the sphincter of O'Beirne and the anal sphincters. RESULTS Normal colonic motor patterns were observed, even at baseline, but a prominent high-pressure zone at the rectosigmoid junction, the sphincter of O'Beirne, was consistently present. In response to high-amplitude propagating pressure waves (HAPWs) that were not consciously perceived, the sphincter and the anal sphincters would not relax and paradoxically contract, identified as autonomous dyssynergia. Rectal bisacodyl evoked marked HAPW activity with complete relaxation of the sphincter of O'Beirne and the anal sphincters, indicating that all neural pathways to generate the coloanal reflex were intact but had low sensitivity to physiological stimuli. A retrograde propagating cyclic motor pattern initiated at the sphincter of O'Beirne, likely contributing to failure of content to move into the rectum. CONCLUSIONS Chronic constipation without the presence of spontaneous bowel movements can be associated with normal colonic motor patterns but a highly exaggerated pressure at the rectosigmoid junction: the sphincter of O'Beirne, and failure of this sphincter and the anal sphincters to relax associated with propulsive motor patterns. The sphincter of O'Beirne can be an important part of the pathophysiology of chronic constipation.","Chen, Ji-Hong; Collins, Stephen M; Milkova, Natalija; Pervez, Maham; Nirmalathasan, Sharjana; Tan, Wei; Hanman, Alicia; Huizinga, Jan D",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06723-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462747/,756
162577,A study on family function status and its influencing factors of frontline health workers fighting Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2021,"Reversible infantile respiratory chain deficiency (RIRCD) is a rare mitochondrial myopathy leading to severe metabolic disturbances in infants, which recover spontaneously after 6-months of age. RIRCD is associated with the homoplasmic m.14674T>C mitochondrial DNA mutation; however, only ~ 1/100 carriers develop the disease. We studied 27 affected and 15 unaffected individuals from 19 families and found additional heterozygous mutations in nuclear genes interacting with mt-tRNAGlu including EARS2 and TRMU in the majority of affected individuals, but not in healthy carriers of m.14674T>C, supporting a digenic inheritance. Our transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of patient muscle suggests a stepwise mechanism where first, the integrated stress response associated with increased FGF21 and GDF15 expression enhances the metabolism modulated by serine biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism, TCA lipid oxidation and amino acid availability, while in the second step mTOR activation leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data suggest that the spontaneous recovery in infants with digenic mutations may be modulated by the above described changes. Similar mechanisms may explain the variable penetrance and tissue specificity of other mtDNA mutations and highlight the potential role of amino acids in improving mitochondrial disease.","Hathazi, Denisa; Griffin, Helen; Jennings, Matthew J; Giunta, Michele; Powell, Christopher; Pearce, Sarah F; Munro, Benjamin; Wei, Wei; Boczonadi, Veronika; Poulton, Joanna; Pyle, Angela; Calabrese, Claudia; Gomez-Duran, Aurora; Schara, Ulrike; Pitceathly, Robert Ds; Hanna, Michael G; Joost, Kairit; Cotta, Ana; Paim, Julia Filardi; Navarro, Monica Machado; Duff, Jennifer; Mattmann, Andre; Chapman, Kristine; Servidei, Serenella; Della Marina, Adela; Uusimaa, Johanna; Roos, Andreas; Mootha, Vamsi; Hirano, Michio; Tulinius, Mar; Giri, Manta; Hoffmann, Eric P; Lochmüller, Hanns; DiMauro, Salvatore; Minczuk, Michal; Chinnery, Patrick F; Müller, Juliane S; Horvath, Rita",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128823/,756
172587,The role of aerobotic assisted intensivist as solution of resources management in COVID-19 pandemic era,2021,"Background. Improved knowledge regarding the prevalence and clinical significance of the broad spectrum of autoantibodies triggered by SARS-CoV2 infection can clarify the underlying pathobiology, enhance approaches to evaluating heterogeneity of COVID-19 clinical manifestations, and potentially guide options for targeting immunosuppressive therapy as the need for more effective interventions continues to evolve. In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of autoimmune antibodies in diverse cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers and measure the extent to which factors associated with triggered autoimmunity are activated even following mild and asymptomatic infection. Methods. Antigen microarrays were used to profile reactivity of IgG autoantibodies against 91 proteins and cytokines based on autoantibody profiling studies in autoimmune diseases. Results. In this discovery screening study, we found that 90% of the IgG positive individuals demonstrated reactivity to at least one autoantibody. When compared to results of the same assays conducted on samples from pre-COVID-19 controls, our primary cohort of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity had significantly elevated IgG against twelve additional proteins including CHD3, CTLA4, HARS, IFNA4, INS, MIF, MX1, RNF41, S100A9, SRP19, TROVE2, and VEGFA. These findings confirmed that all severity levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even asymptomatic infections, trigger a robust and diverse autoimmune response; our results also highlight the utility of multiparametric autoantibody detection in this setting. Interpretation. Taken together, our findings underscore the serological diversity underlying the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection and its sequelae, including the long-Covid phenotypes.","Liu, Y.; Ebinger, J.

188372,"[Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].",2008,"Emerging infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. Many of these diseases are zoonoses, including such recent examples as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, haemolytic uraemic syndrome (a food-borne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli) and probably human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Specific factors precipitating the emergence of a disease can often be identified. These include ecological, environmental or demographic factors that place people in increased contact with the natural host for a previously unfamiliar zoonotic agent or that promote the spread of the pathogen. These factors are becoming increasingly prevalent, suggesting that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase. Strategies for dealing with the problem include focusing special attention on situations that promote disease emergence, especially those in which animals and humans come into contact, and implementing effective disease surveillance and control.","Morse, S S",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702712/,756

208344,"Spatiotemporal evolution of case fatality rates of COVID-19 in Brazil, 2020",2020,"BackgroundA growing body of literature shows profound effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, among which increased rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder (AD). However, current research efforts have largely been unilateral, focusing on psychopathology and not including well-being, and are dominated by examining average psychopathology levels or on disorder absence/presence, thereby ignoring individual differences in mental health. Knowledge on individual differences, as depicted by latent subgroups, in the full spectrum of mental health may provide valuable insights in how individuals transition between health states and factors that predict transitioning from resilient to symptomatic classes. Our aim is to (1) identify longitudinal classes (i.e., subgroups of individuals) based on indicators of PTSD, AD, and well-being in response to the pandemic and (2) examine predictors of transitioning between these subgroups. Methods and analysisWe will conduct a three-wave longitudinal online survey-study of n [≥] 2000 adults from the general Dutch population. The first measurement occasion takes place six months after the start of the pandemic, followed by two follow-up measurements with six months intervals. Latent transition analysis will be used for data-analysis. Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from four Dutch universities.

255015,Covid-19 in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients – Brazilian Experience,2020,"Importance: Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Objective: To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results: Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P < .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (8%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.","Mercuro, Nicholas J; Yen, Christina F; Shim, David J; Maher, Timothy R; McCoy, Christopher M; Zimetbaum, Peter J; Gold, Howard S",JAMA Cardiol,,756

The purpose of this study is to uncover the features of enterprises' resilience during and after an external shock such as the GFC might be helpful in predicting the shock impact on enterprises and setting proper policy measures for the upcoming COVID-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach The authors analysed the impact of the GFC on the entrepreneurial population in/of the Czech Republic using marginal effects method on a large random sample of 4,478 enterprises. In this analysis, the authors defined two groups of enterprises - ""winners"" and ""losers"" - based on the company's dissolution and performance indicators. Findings The GFC struck the enterprise population asymmetrically in terms of the enterprises' characteristics but also in terms of time. Micro and small size companies are the most vulnerable to external shocks such as the GFC. Technological level plays an important role in the recovery phase, especially in the case of manufacturing micro enterprises. Research limitations/implications Although there are differences between the GFC and the COVID-19 crisis, the GFC was the only comparable shock in modern history in its global nature, depth and unpredicted occurrence. It can be expected that the impact on enterprises can be partly similar. Practical implications Government support of micro size companies should be the priority in the upcoming COVID-19 crisis. Supporting the innovation and technology progress might accelerate the recovery phase after the crisis especially in micro companies as well. Originality/value This paper presents interesting insights into the impact of external shocks such as the GFC or COVID-19 on enterprises.

However, the use of face masks among children, especially those aged younger than 3 years, is debated, and the US Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Physicians recommend the use of face mask only among individuals aged 3 years or older. Objective: To examine whether the use of surgical facial masks among children is associated with episodes of oxygen desaturation or respiratory distress. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from May through June 2020 in a secondary-level hospital pediatric unit in Italy. Included participants were 47 healthy children divided by age (ie, group A, aged &#8804;24 months, and group B, aged >24 months to &#8804;144 months). Data were analyzed from May through June 2020. Interventions: All participants were monitored every 15 minutes for changes in respiratory parameters for the first 30 minutes while not wearing a surgical face mask and for the next 30 minutes while wearing a face mask. Children aged 24 months and older then participated in a walking test for 12 minutes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in respiratory parameters during the use of surgical masks were evaluated. Results: Among 47 children, 22 children (46.8%) were aged 24 months or younger (ie, group A), with 11 boys (50.0%) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 12.5 (10.0-17.5) months, and 25 children (53.2%) were aged older than 24 months to 144 months or younger, with 13 boys (52.0%) and median (IQR) age 100.0 (72.0-120.0) months.

This creates a new dilemma, minimize exposure to patients and health care professionals to COVID-19 while maintaining high quality in cardiovascular therapeutics. In order to achieve this, several international recommendations on treatment algorithms modifications and in safety measures in the catheterization room have been published, always aiming to solve this dilemma in the best possible way. Hereby, we present a summary of the most recent treatment algorithms in the most important cardiovascular interventions (acute coronary syndromes, structural and congenital heart diseases) as well as specific safety measures with a step-by-step preparedness before and after any interventional procedure during COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this document is to inform and to train health care professionals that works in cardiac catheterization rooms on the risks as well on the plan for containment, mitigation, and response to the global situation of COVID-19 infection in order to apply this in their own local work environments.","Eid-Lidt, Guering; Farjat Pasos, Julio Iván",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,756

423755,Covid-19 in dementia: an insidious pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the SARS-CoV­2 outbreak, personal protective equipment (PPE) was scarce worldwide, leading to the treatment of patients partially without sufficient protection for the medical personnel. In order to be prepared for a new epidemic or pandemic or a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 outbreak and to meet a renewed deficiency of PPE, considerations were made on how personnel and patients can be better protected by appropriate provisioning. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a tool to predict the necessary amount of PPE to be in stock at a transregional university hospital for a certain period of time during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The consumption of PPE needed for every patient was calculated based on the following data of the Ulm University Hospital: the total consumption of healthcare workers' PPE for April 2020 recorded by the materials management department and the number of patients suffering from COVID-19 and their treatment days. From the amount of PPE necessary for every patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in an infection ward, a PPE calculator was created in which the estimated amount of PPE can be calculated with the input variables ""patients in intensive care unit"", ""patients in infection ward"" and ""treatment days"". To validate the PPE calculator, the actual consumption of PPE for May 2020â¯at the Ulm University hospital was compared to the theoretically calculated demand by the PPE calculator. RESULTS: In April 2020 PPE consisting of 18 different items were kept in stock at Ulm University Hospital and in total 1,995,500 individual items were used. 22 intensive care patients with 257 nursing days and in the infection ward 39 patients with 357 nursing days were treated for COVID-19 disease, leading to a total of 603.2 man-days. A total of 34,550 KN95 masks, 1,558,780 gloves and 1100 goggles or protective visors were used, with a daily average of 49 NK95 masks and 2216 gloves required per ICU patient. In May 2020, 6 ICU patients and 19 patients in infection wards were treated for COVID-19 with 34 nursing days in intensive care and 201 nursing days in infection wards. The use of PPE material was 39% lower than in the previous month but in absolute terms 82% and on average 39% higher than calculated. CONCLUSION: The developed tool allows our hospital to estimate the necessary amount of PPE to be kept in stock for future pandemics. By taking local conditions into account this tool can also be helpful for other hospitals.","Pfenninger, E G; Kaisers, U X",Anaesthesist,,756

METHODS: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care at Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We compared patients who received week-2-MP (125-250 mg/d x3) with those who did not, with the end-points time to death and time to death or endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: We included 242 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers at admission. Sixty-one patients (25%) received week-2-MP. Twenty-two patients (9%) died and 31 (12.8%) suffered death or intubation. The adjusted HRs for death and death or intubation for patients in the week-2-MP group were 0.35 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.06, p = 0.064) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.84, p = 0.020), respectively. These differences were specifically seen in the subcohort of patients with a SpO2/FiO2 at day 7 lower than 353 (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12, p = 0.073 and HR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.94, p = 0.038, respectively) but not in patients with higher SpO2/FiO2. Patients receiving out-of-week-2-MP, non-pulse glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids had an increased adjusted risk for both outcomes compared with week-2-MP group: HR 5.04 (95% CI 0.91-27.86), HR 10.09 (95% CI 2.14-47.50), HR 4.14 (95% CI 0.81-21.23), respectively, for death; HR 7.38 (95% CI 1.86-29.29), HR 13.71 (95% CI 3.76-50.07), HR 3.58 (95% CI 0.89-14.32), respectively, for death or intubation. These differences were significant only in the subgroup with low SpO2/FiO2. CONCLUSIONS: Week-2-MP are effective in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with features of inflammatory activity and respiratory deterioration entering the second week of disease. The recognition of this high-risk population should prompt early use of MP at this point.","Ruiz-Irastorza, Guillermo; Pijoan, Jose-Ignacio; Bereciartua, Elena; Dunder, Susanna; Dominguez, Jokin; Garcia-Escudero, Paula; Rodrigo, Alejandro; Gomez-Carballo, Carlota; Varona, Jimena; Guio, Laura; Ibarrola, Marta; Ugarte, Amaia; Martinez-Berriotxoa, Agustin",PLoS One,,756

For many solid organ cancers, surgical intervention is imperative. We present our experience with major operations during a nationwide lockdown. METHOD: This was an observational study of 184 patients, analyzing their perioperative outcomes and categorizing morbidity according to Clavien-Dindo Classification. Strict screening required symptomatic patients to be referred to COVID centers and their operations postponed. Continuous and categorical variables were expressed as medians with range and frequencies and percentages, respectively. A two-sided &#945; < .05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: During the lockdown, we initiated a graded response over four phases: (I) 24 March to 14 April (18 procedures); (II) 15 April to 3 May (26 procedures); (III) 4 to 17 May (41 procedures); and (IV) 18 to 31 May (99 procedures). The rates of major perioperative morbidity were 10.9% and mortality 1.6%. Over the four phases, the major morbidity rates were 11.1%, 15.4%, 9.8%, and 13.1%. On multivariate analysis, an emergency procedure was the only significant factor associated with morbidity. During the study period, no hospital staff became symptomatic for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In a region with milder impact of COVID-19, treatment of cancer patients need not be deferred. Our study showed that with appropriate precautions, asymptomatic patients may undergo operations without increased morbidity to them and hospital staff.","Pai, Esha; Chopra, Saumya; Mandloi, Deepak; Upadhyay, Arvind K; Prem, Amar; Pandey, Durgatosh",J. surg. oncol,,756

However, in a substantial number of patients with a respiratory tract disease, co-infection with various viral pathogens has been confirmed. Although the association between the occurrence of co-infection and substantially higher severity of disease is still unclear, a rapid and proper diagnostics of wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens reveals an accurate picture of the disease and is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and control of infection. In the present study we reported five cases of multiple respiratory infection in hospitalized immunosuppressed patients: two double infections with influenza virus (IV) type A/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and IV type A/coronavirus (CoV) OC43, one infection with four viruses – IV type A/RSV type A and B/CoV OC43, and two cases of mixed infections caused by five viral agents – IV type A and B/RSV type A and B/ parainfluenza type 3 or CoV OC43. Each patient had an underlying chronic disease and received immunosuppressive treatment. Despite a low number of tested specimens, our study shows that the inclusions of multiplex PCR methods for diagnostics of respiratory tract infections and the extension of diagnostic strategies by clinicians to detect viruses other than influenza are very important and make a contribution to identifying the true rate of co-infections and their correlation with the clinical symptoms and severity of disease.","Stefanska, I.; Romanowska, M.; Donevski, S.; Gawryluk, D.; Brydak, L.

Even though union membership has been declining in the US, union members still comprise 10% of the working population and have higher-than-industry average non-fatal illness and injury rates. Due to limited research focused in this area, this study examined whether union membership was associated with worker perceptions of safety climate. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis study utilizing data from the Quality Work Life module from the General Social Survey centered on US workers aged 18 and above. Propensity-score matching was implemented to reduce potential selection bias between unionized and non-unionized workers. Linear regression explored the association between union membership and perceptions of safety climate, controlling for age, sex, education, industry, resource adequacy, supervisor support, co-worker support, and workload. RESULTS: For perceived safety climate (on a 0–16 scale, the higher the more positive), those in union had a lower mean of perceived safety climate (12.44) compared to those not in a union (13.20). Based on the regression results, those who were in a union reported more negative perceptions of their workplace safety climate in a 12-month period (β = −0.61, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: By demonstrating a commitment to proactive injury prevention and bolstering the business’s overall safety performance indicators, businesses who are open to collaborations with unions may see some long-term benefits (e.g. return on investment, increased job satisfaction) and enhance union workers’ perceptions of safety climate.","Le, Aurora B.; Wong, Su-Wei; Lin, Hsien-Chang; Smith, Todd D.",Saf Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520304215; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052171/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520304215,756

As demonstrated by the explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings, the need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings is critical. Here we consider how interventions that decrease the size of the susceptible populations, such as vaccination or depopulation, impact the expected number of infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a compartmental model. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in both the number of susceptible residents and the reproduction number. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on anticipated infections. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 for density-dependent COVID-19 transmission, we find that reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for implementing infection control in congregate settings. Additional applications of our modeling framework include optimizing the distribution of residents into independent residential units, and comparison of preemptive versus reactive vaccination strategies.","Blumberg, Seth; Lu, Phoebe; Hoover, Christopher M.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Kwan, Ada T.; Sears, David; Bertozzi, Stefano M.; Worden, Lee",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.05.21260043v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268514/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260043,756

An overlooked angle is the potential psychosocial impact on PCPs as they place themselves at increased risk of infection. This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS 216 PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were convenience sampled from three primary care organizations in Singapore. Participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, and a source of risk and concern to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks and the need to care for COVID-19 patients. Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high. PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors.

Thus, the objective of this paper is to review how SEP - a construct at the heart of the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) theory - shapes the health and longevity of women and girls at all stages of the lifespan. Using literature identified from PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases, we first describe the SDoH theory. We then use examples from each stage of the life course to demonstrate how SEP can differentially shape girls’ and women’s health outcomes compared with boys’ and men’s, as well as between sub-groups of girls and women when other axes of inequalities are considered, including ethnicity, race and residential setting. We also explore the key consideration of whether conventional SEP markers are appropriate for understanding the social determinants of women’s health.
