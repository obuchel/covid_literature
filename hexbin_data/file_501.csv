8651,¿Volverá el síndrome respiratorio agudo grave?,2013-04-05,"This chapter describes the current views of the pathogenesis of virus infections of the nervous system, with particular attention to certain aspects of virus-host interactions. Following invasion of the central nervous system, infection can follow a variety of patterns, as to number and distribution of neuronal and non-neuronal cells involved. There is a corresponding diversity in the pathological lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) produced by acute virus infection. Infection can be pictured as a race between virus and host defenses, where many factors, acting through different mechanisms, can influence the outcome. Outcome is always determined by multiple virus and host variables, although single variables can be independently studied under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory. The chapter demonstrates that in many virus-host combinations, the immune response plays an important role in recovery from primary infections. It mentions that an immunopathological process mediates the disease which follows certain CNS virus infections.","Nathanson, Neal; Cole, Gerald A.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131243/,501
8653,Factores de riesgo del catarro común,2013-04-05,"CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) constitute a major portion of immune responses to foreign and self antigens. CTL recognize class I major histocompatibility complex molecules complexed to peptides of 8–10 residues derived from cytosolic proteins. To understand CTL responses to these antigens to manipulate CTL responses optimally, it is necessary to identify the specific peptides recognized by CTL. The methods currently used for this purpose have significant drawbacks. We describe a plasmid transfection method that results in significant lysis of histocompatible target cells. Influenza virus-specific CTLs specifically lysed target cells that were transfected with plasmids bearing cDNAs encoding full length gene products, fragments containing the region that encodes the CTL epitope, or even a ten residue peptide. This significantly lessens the time and effort required todefine genes, and gene segments that contain CTL epitopes.","Eisenlohr, Laurence C.; Yewdell, Jonathan W.; Bennink, Jack R.",J Immunol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131252/,501

15775,"Complementarity of Photo-Biomodulation, Surgical Treatment, and Antibiotherapy for Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws (MRONJ)",2021-02-05,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is considered one of the most common arthritic diseases characterized by progressive degradation and abnormal remodeling of articular cartilage. Potential therapeutics for OA aim at restoring proper chondrocyte functioning and inhibiting apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) showed anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity in many models of various diseases, acting mainly via alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, little is known about cytoprotective effects of TUDCA on chondrocyte cells. The present study was designed to evaluate potential effects of TUDCA on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tunicamycin (TNC)-stimulated NHAC-kn chondrocytes cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results showed that TUDCA alleviated ER stress in TNC-treated chondrocytes, as demonstrated by reduced CHOP expression; however, it was not effective enough to prevent apoptosis of NHAC-kn cells in either normoxia nor hypoxia. However, co-treatment with TUDCA alleviated inflammatory response induced by IL-1β, as shown by down regulation of Il-1β, Il-6, Il-8 and Cox2, and increased the expression of antioxidant enzyme Sod2. Additionally, TUDCA enhanced Col IIα expression in IL-1β- and TNC-stimulated cells, but only in normoxic conditions. Altogether, these results suggest that although TUDCA may display chondoprotective potential in ER-stressed cells, further analyses are still necessary to fully confirm its possible recommendation as potential candidate in OA therapy.","Kusaczuk, Magdalena; Naumowicz, Monika; Krętowski, Rafał; Cukierman, Bartosz; Cechowska-Pasko, Marzanna",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915106/,501
17626,A novel swine model of the acute respiratory distress syndrome using clinically relevant injury exposures,2021-05-15,"Wild Pacific salmon, including Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, have been supplemented with hatchery propagation for over 50 years in support of increased ocean harvest, mitigation for hydroelectric development, and conservation of threatened populations. In Canada, the Wild Salmon Policy for Pacific salmon was established with the goal of maintaining and restoring healthy and diverse Pacific salmon populations, making conservation of wild salmon and their habitats the highest priority for resource management decision‐making. For policy implementation, a new approach to the assessment and management of Chinook salmon and the associated hatchery production and fisheries management are needed. Implementation of genetic stock identification (GSI) and parentage‐based tagging (PBT) for marine fisheries assessment may overcome problems associated with coded‐wire tag‐based (CWT) assessment and management of Chinook salmon fisheries, providing at a minimum information equivalent to that derived from the CWT program. GSI and PBT were used to identify Chinook salmon sampled in 2018 and 2019 marine fisheries (18,819 individuals genotyped) in British Columbia to specific conservation units (CU), populations, and broodyears. Individuals were genotyped at 391 single nucleotide polymorphisms via direct sequencing of amplicons. Very high accuracy of assignment to population and age (>99.5%) via PBT was observed for 1994 Chinook salmon of ages 2–4 years, with a 105,722–individual, 380–population baseline available for assignment. Application of a GSI‐PBT system of identification to individuals in 2019 fisheries provided high‐resolution estimates of stock composition, catch, and exploitation rate by CU or population, with fishery exploitation rates directly comparable to those provided by CWTs for 13 populations. GSI and PBT provide an alternate, cheaper, and more effective method in the assessment and management of Canadian‐origin Chinook salmon relative to CWTs, and an opportunity for a genetics‐based system to replace the current CWT system for salmon assessment.","Beacham, Terry D.; Wallace, Colin G.; Jonsen, Kim; McIntosh, Brenda; Candy, John R.; Horst, Katherine; Lynch, Cheryl; Willis, David; Luedke, Wilf; Kearey, Lee; Rondeau, Eric B.",Evol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127719/,501
19960,Causa inesperada de lesiones isquémicas en paciente inmunocompetente,2021-08-09,"Background: Ischemia-reperfusion and cardiac remodeling is associated with cardiomyocyte death, excessive fibrosis formation, and functional decline, eventually resulting in heart failure (HF). Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonists are reported to reduce apoptosis and myocardial infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion. Moreover, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been described to reduce reactive fibrosis and improve cardiac function. Here, we investigated whether combined treatment with GLP-1R agonist exenatide and MRA potassium canrenoate could minimize cardiac injury and limit HF progression in animal models of chronic HF. Methods and Results: Forty female Topigs Norsvin pigs were subjected to 150 min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Prior to reperfusion, pigs were randomly assigned to placebo or combination therapy (either low dose or high dose). Treatment was applied for two consecutive days or for 8 weeks with a continued high dose via a tunneled intravenous catheter. Using 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining we observed that combination therapy did not affect the scar size after 8 weeks. In line, left ventricular volume and function assessed by three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (baseline, 7 days and 8 weeks), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR, 8 weeks) did not differ between experimental groups. In addition, 36 C57Bl/6JRj mice underwent permanent LAD-occlusion and were treated with either placebo or combination therapy prior to reperfusion, for two consecutive days via intravenous injection, followed by continued treatment via placement of osmotic mini-pumps for 28 days. Global cardiac function, assessed by 3D echocardiography performed at baseline, 7, 14, and 28 days, did not differ between treatment groups. Also, no differences were observed in cardiac hypertrophy, assessed by heart weight/bodyweight and heart weight/tibia length ratio. Conclusion: In the current study, combined treatment with GLP-1R agonist exenatide and MR antagonist potassium canrenoate did not show beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling nor resulted in functional improvement in a small and large animal chronic HF model.","Demkes, Evelyne J.; Wenker, Steven; Silvis, Max J.

Viruses have no metabolism of their own, but rely completely on host cellular energy and substrate provision to support the biochemical processes necessary for virus replication. It is therefore obvious that RNA hydrolysis does not represent an obligate step in the viral life cycle that would have to be governed by viral proteins. Accordingly, RNases are found only rarely in the viral proteomes and serve special functions. In this chapter, several virus-specific RNases will be described and their role in the viral life cycle discussed. The text will concentrate on RNases of members of the nidoviruses, herpesviruses, pestiviruses, and several viruses with segmented negative-strand RNA genome including influenza virus. These enzymes are involved in specific steps of viral gene expression, viral genome replication, shutoff of host cellular gene expression, and interference with the host’s immune response to virus infection.","Meyers, Gregor; Rümenapf, Tillmann; Ziebuhr, John",Ribonucleases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120235/,501

However, computational analysis of such processes is hindered by the enormous size of their underlying state space. In this work, we demonstrate that lumping can be used to reduce any epidemic model to a Markov Population Model (MPM). Therefore, we propose a novel lumping scheme based on a partitioning of the nodes. By imposing different types of counting abstractions, we obtain coarse-grained Markov models with a natural MPM representation that approximate the original systems. This makes it possible to transfer the rich pool of approximation techniques developed for MPMs to the computational analysis of complex networks’ dynamics. We present numerical examples to investigate the relationship between the accuracy of the MPMs, the size of the lumped state space, and the type of counting abstraction.","Großmann, Gerrit; Bortolussi, Luca",Quantitative Evaluation of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120958/,501

25284,Progettazione e sicurezza del paziente,2010-01-17,"Inflammation is defined as the normal response of living tissue to injury or infection. It is important to emphasize two components of this definition. First, that inflammation is a normal response and, as such, is expected to occur when tissue is damaged. Infact, if injured tissue does not exhibit signs of inflammation this would be considered abnormal and wounds and infections would never heal without inflammation. Secondly, inflammation occurs in living tissue, hence there is need for an adequate blood supply to the tissues in order to exhibit an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response may be triggered by mechanical injury, chemical toxins, and invasion by microorganisms, and hypersensitivity reactions. Three major events occur during the inflammatory response: the blood supply to the affected area is increased substantially, capillary permeability is increased, and leucocytes migrate from the capillary vessels into the surrounding interstitial spaces to the site of inflammation or injury. The inflammatory response represents a complex biological and biochemical process involving cells of the immune system and a plethora of biological mediators. Cell-to-cell communication molecules such as cytokines play an extremely important role in mediating the process of inflammation. Inflammation and platelet activation are critical phenomena in the setting of acute coronary syndromes.

Emergence of a new “killer” disease in any part of the world is likely to be a threat world wide in today’s society with very rapid means of transportation of both human and animal/animal products. Recent examples include the global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 avian influenza, and the outbreaks of West Nile virus in United States. The rapid economic development in the Asian region during the last few decades was accompanied by massive urbanization and environmental changes, which are believed to be one of the triggers leading to the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. Wildlife animals play an ever-increasing role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and bats have been identified as natural reservoir host of several lethal zoonotic viruses that emerged in recent times.

It is a condition of medical, educational, and social importance. Physicians identify profound, severe, and moderate MR but rarely diagnose mild MR unless it is associated with a genetic or medical syndrome. From a medical perspective, the quest for etiology and the possibility of medical or surgical intervention to minimize deterioration are paramount. Educators, on the other hand are less concerned with causation than with academic achievement and school success. The majority of cases of mild MR is identified in school settings. Finally, the public uses the label to describe poor adaptive skills. Adults with MR who hold jobs, live independently, and participate in society are not always described as having MR.

25614,3 Pathofysiologie van de longen,2015-03-07,"The generation of fever involves the following steps: numerous substances from outside the body, exogenous pyrogens, initiate the fever cycle. Endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, with their pyrogenic component lipopolysaccaride, is the most potent exogenous pyrogen. Fever is also a common finding in children without obvious evidence of infection, for example hypersensitivity reaction, autoimmune diseases and malignancy. Exogenous pyrogens initiate fever by inducing host cells (primarily macrophages) to produce and release endogenous pyrogens such as interleukin-1, which has multiple biological functions essential for the immune response. Endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre, specifically organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), where they induce synthesis of prostaglandins, of which PGE2 is the most important. These raise the thermostatic set point to initiate the febrile response. The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre accomplishes heat production by inducing shivering and heat conservation through vasoconstriction. At an established degree, fever is regulated (even at a temperature of over 41.0 °C) and heat production approximates loss, as in health, though at a higher level of the set point. Therefore fever does not climb up relentlessly. In addition to the function as an endogenous pyrogen, IL-1 activates T-lymphocytes to produce various factors, such as INF and IL-2, which are vital for immune response. The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favour of the protective role of fever. The induction of fever results in inhibition of bacterial growth, increased bactericidal effects of neutrophils, production of acute-phase protein synthesis and other physiological changes such as anorexia and somnolence. These changes suggest that fever has an adaptive role in the host’s survival during infection.","El-Radhi, A.

Accumulating evidence shows that landscape fragmentation drives the observed worldwide decline in populations of pollinators, particularly in species of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. However, Little is known about the effects of landscape fragmentation on hoverfly (Diptera, Syrphidae) communities. Hoverflies provide varied ecosystem services: larvae contribute to waste decomposition (saprophagous species) and pest control (aphidophagous species), and adults pollinate a wide range of flowers. 2. To determine how the diversity and quantity of resources for larvae and adults affect hoverfly abundance and species richness at three spatial scales, we recorded insect visitors of five target plant species in Belgian heathlands, habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. 3. Hoverflies represented the most abundant visitors on two plant species, and the second most abundant visitors (after bumblebees) on the other target plant species. A large proportion of hoverflies observed were aphidophagous species associated with coniferous and deciduous forests. Resources for the larvae and floral resources for the adults influenced interactions among hoverflies and plants, but acted at different scales: larval habitat availability (distance to larval habitat) was relevant at the landscape scale, whereas adult resource availability (floral density) was relevant at the plot scale. 4. Hoverfly abundance and species richness decreased with distance to larval habitat but increased with floral density. Moreover, landscape structure and composition had different effects according to hoverfly ecological traits. Landscape composition influenced aphidophagous but not saprophagous hoverflies, in that their abundance and species richness decreased with distance to forests. Maintenance of the interactions between plants and their hoverfly visitors requires complementary resources at both landscape and local scales.","Moquet, Laura; Laurent, Estelle; Bacchetta, Rossana; Jacquemart, Anne‐Laure",Insect Conserv Divers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165621/,501

One of the most crucial issues in SVD is coping with the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities in projects that require the laborious manual labeling of code by software security experts. One possible solution is to employ deep domain adaptation (DA) which has recently witnessed enormous success in transferring learning from structural labeled to unlabeled data sources. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a technique that attempts to bridge the gap between source and target data in the joint space and emerges as a building block to develop deep DA approaches with state-of-the-art performance. However, deep DA approaches using the GAN principle to close the gap are subject to the mode collapsing problem that negatively impacts the predictive performance. Our aim in this paper is to propose Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) for tackling the problem of transfer learning from labeled to unlabeled software projects in SVD to resolve the mode collapsing problem faced in previous approaches.

In this work, fuzzy logic is used in a multicriteria decision making framework in two different ways. First, fuzzy sets are used to model an expert preference relation for each of the individual information sources to turn raw data into satisfaction degrees. Second, fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between sources to aggregate the individual degrees into a global score. The whole framework is implemented as an open source software called GeoFIS. The potential of the method is illustrated using an agronomic case study to design a soil chemical quality index from expert knowledge for cacao production systems. The data come from three municipalities of Tolima department in Colombia. The output inferred by the fuzzy inference system was used as a target to learn the weights of classical numerical aggregation operators. Only the Choquet Integral proved to have a similar modeling ability, but the weights would have been difficult to set from expert knowledge without learning.","Mora-Herrera, Denys Yohana; Guillaume, Serge; Snoeck, Didier; Zúñiga Escobar, Orlando",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274753/,501
37661,Na de lockdown,2020-08-07,"Since excessive sugar consumption has been related to the development of chronic metabolic diseases prevalent in the western world, the use of sweeteners has gradually increased worldwide over the last few years. Although low- and non-calorie sweeteners may represent a valuable tool to reduce calorie intake and prevent weight gain, studies investigating the safety and efficacy of these compounds in the short- and long-term period are scarce and controversial. Therefore, future studies will need to elucidate the potential beneficial and/or detrimental effects of different types of sweeteners on metabolic health (energy balance, appetite, body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors) in healthy subjects and patients with diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. In this regard, the impact of different sweeteners on central nervous system, gut hormones and gut microbiota is important, given the strong implications that changes in such systems may have for human health. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the current evidence for the neuroendocrine and metabolic effects of sweeteners, as well as their impact on gut microbiota. Finally, we briefly discuss the advantages of the use of sweeteners in the context of very-low calorie ketogenic diets.","Moriconi, Eleonora; Feraco, Alessandra; Marzolla, Vincenzo; Infante, Marco; Lombardo, Mauro; Fabbri, Andrea; Caprio, Massimiliano",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7378387/,501

This interdisciplinary article reflects on the significance of the pandemic from a largely unexplored angle, through a focus on the key concept of ecological connectivity, which broadly refers to the inter-connections between different elements of an ecosystem. Examining the pandemic through the lens of ecological connectivity, the article also theorizes it (and zoonotic diseases more generally) as a violation of this connectivity. It uses this idea as a core thread for linking COVID-19, international criminal law and transitional justice. Its key argument in this regard is that war crimes and human rights violations can themselves be viewed, in part, as violations of ecological connectivity. This theorization, in turn, provides a novel basis for thinking about the wider ecological dimensions and legacies of war crimes and gross violations of human rights, and, by extension, the potential role of international criminal law and transitional justice in helping to restore damaged connectivities through a relational approach to justice.","Clark, Janine Natalya",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798993/,501
45289,Introducción: novedades del año 2020,2021-01-03,"BACKGROUND: Anomalous origin of coronary artery from pulmonary artery (AOCAPA), as is evident from the name, is defined as abnormal origin of either coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. The consequences vary in most cases and these anomalies lead to severe coronary hypo-perfusion and ventricular dysfunction. The common variants of this cardiac malformation are an anomalous origin of a left coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). Another rare variant is left main coronary artery atresia that resembles ALCAPA in its mode of presentation. This article presents a single surgeon experience of managing this complex subset of the coronary anomaly from April 2006 to July 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 105 patients, who underwent surgery for AOCAPA from April 2006 to July 2019, have been included in the study. The patients have been analysed by follow-up echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) at our hospital by paediatric cardiologists. Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 98 (93.3%) patients underwent ALCAPA repair, of which 59 (60.2%) were males and 39 (39.7%) were females. Four out of five patients, who had an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right pulmonary artery (ALCARPA), had an intramural aortic course. Three patients (3%) had left main coronary artery atresia and four patients (4%) had ARCAPA. It may be mentioned that seven infants (7.14%) and one adult patient (1%) underwent concomitant mitral valve repair. All the patients with ALCAPA, left main coronary artery atresia and ARCAPA, and 1 of the patients with ALCARPA, underwent coronary relocation. In four out of five patients with ALCARPA, unroofing of intra-aortic intramural course was performed. RESULTS: Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 9 (8.5%) patients had in-hospital mortality. Five infants (5.0%) with ALCAPA and one patient (1%) with ALCARPA died in the post-operative period due to severe left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation (MR) and sepsis. One adult patient (1%) with ALCAPA, who underwent coronary relocation using in situ trap door technique and mitral valve (MV) repair, died due to massive intracranial bleeding. Two patients out of three (66.6%) with left main coronary atresia died in intensive care unit (ICU) after 3rd and 4th postoperative day, due to low cardiac output, severe ventricular dysfunction and severe MR. Patients were followed up for a median 5.9 years. Seven patients were lost to follow-up, including the sole survivor of left main coronary atresia, after a median follow-up of 4 years after surgery. Three patients underwent mitral valve replacement for progressive residual MR. There has been no late mortality. CONCLUSION: AOCAPA is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, which usually presents in infancy with left ventricular dysfunction and mitral valve regurgitation. Early diagnosis and surgical re-establishment of the dual coronary system has given gratifying results, with improvement in left ventricular function in survivors. Mitral valve intervention for MR was required, in both early and late phases.","Mishra, Amit",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7840225/,501

METHODS: Cultured explants from the frontal cortex of rhesus monkey brain (n=3) were treated with live Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6, 12, and 24 h. Total protein was collected for sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. In addition, changes in protein expression in the explants over time following Bb treatment were screened. RESULTS: We identified 1237 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.67, P-value ≤0.05). One of these, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), was highly expressed at all time points in the explants. The results of the protein-protein interaction network analysis of DEPs suggested that GAP-43 plays a role in the neuroinflammation associated with LNB. In HMC3 cells incubated with live Bb or PBS for 6, 12, and 24 h, real-time PCR and western blot analyses confirmed the increase of GAP-43 mRNA and protein, respectively.

TE is a teaching process for training patients so that they can self-manage their care plan. Alongside traditional methods of providing educational content, there are now alternative forms of delivery thanks to the implementation of advanced Information Technologies systems such as conversational agents (CAs). In this context, we present the AIDA project: an ensemble of two different CAs intended to provide a TE tool for people with diabetes. The Artificial Intelligence Diabetes Assistant (AIDA) consists of a text-based chatbot and a speech-based dialog system. Their content has been created and validated by a scientific board. AIDA Chatbot—the text-based agent—provides a broad spectrum of information about diabetes, while AIDA Cookbot—the voice-based agent—presents recipes compliant with a diabetic patient’s diet. We provide a thorough description of the development process for both agents, the technology employed and their usage by the general public. AIDA Chatbot and AIDA Cookbot are freely available and they represent the first example of conversational agents in Italian to support diabetes patients, clinicians and caregivers.

DATA SOURCES EMBASE, MEDLINE, SportsDiscus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PEDro. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies that evaluated hip pain, ADL function, sport function and quality of life before and after hip arthroscopy and postoperative satisfaction in patients with symptomatic FAI. RESULTS Twenty-six studies (22 case series, 3 cohort studies, 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT)) were included in the systematic review and 19 in the meta-analysis. Clinically relevant pain and ADL function improvements were first reported between 3 and 6 months, and sport function improvements between 6 months and 1 year after surgery. It is not clear when quality of life improvements were first achieved. On average, residual mild pain and ADL and sport function scores lower than their healthy counterparts were reported by patients following surgery. Postoperative patient satisfaction ranged from 68% to 100%.

Several therapies used in the treatment of acute migraine are thought to be associated with medication overuse headache, including opioids and triptans. With limited treatment options, it is critical to determine the risk profile of novel therapies prior to their widespread use. The current study explores the potential medication overuse risk of two novel therapeutic drug classes, namely the ditans: 5-HT1F receptor agonists, and the gepants: calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, in a preclinical model of medication overuse. Persistent exposure of mice to the 5-HT1F agonist LY344864, but not olcegepant produced a significant reduction in hind paw and orofacial mechanical withdrawal thresholds as a surrogate readout of allodynia. In agreement, only LY344864 induced neuroplastic changes in trigeminal sensory afferents, increasing calcitonin gene-related peptide expression and basal trigeminal nociception. Our data highlight a differential medication overuse headache risk profile for the ditan and gepant classes of drugs that has important implications for their clinical use and patient education to help reduce the burden of medication overuse headache.","Saengjaroentham, Chonlawan; Strother, Lauren C; Dripps, Isaac; Sultan Jabir, Mohammad Rayhan; Pradhan, Amynah; Goadsby, Peter J; Holland, Philip R",Brain : a journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810212/,501

The JHM strain (also called MHV-4 or JHM.SD) causes fatal encephalitis and only minimal hepatitis. Previous analysis of chimeric recombinant MHVs in which the spike gene, encoding the protein that mediates viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion, was exchanged between JHM and A59 showed that the spike plays a major role in determining organ tropism and neurovirulence but that other genes also play important roles in pathogenic outcome. Here, we have investigated the role of the nucleocapsid protein in MHV-induced disease. The multifunctional nucleocapsid protein is complexed with the genomic RNA, interacts with the viral membrane protein during virion assembly, and plays an import role in enhancing the efficiency of transcription. A pair of chimeric recombinant viruses in which the nucleocapsid gene was exchanged between JHM and A59 was selected and compared to wild-type parental strains in terms of virulence. Importantly, expression of the JHM nucleocapsid in the context of the A59 genome conferred increased mortality and spread of viral antigen in the mouse central nervous system compared to the parental A59 strain, while having little effect on the induction of hepatitis. While the JHM nucleocapsid did not appear to enhance neuron-to-neuron spread in primary neuronal cultures, the increased neurovirulence it conferred may be due in part to the induction of a less robust T-cell response than that induced by strain A59.","Cowley, Timothy J; Long, Simon Y; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01758-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20007284/,501

Following activation of the UK pandemic response, our institution began planning for admission of COVID-19 patients to the neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU) to support the local critical care network which risked being rapidly overwhelmed by the high number of cases. This report will detail our experience of repurposing a neuro-ICU for the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 while retaining capacity for urgent neurosurgical and neurology admissions. METHODS We conducted a retrospective process analysis of the repurposing of a quaternary level neuro-ICU during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We retrieved demographic data, diagnosis, and outcomes from the electronic health care records of all patients admitted to the ICU between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Processes for increase in surge capacity, reduction in ICU demand, and staff redeployment and rapid training are reported. RESULTS Over a 10-day period, total ICU capacity was increased by 21.7% (from 23 to 28 beds) while the capacity to provide mechanical ventilation was increased by 77% (from 13 to 23 beds). There were 30 ICU admissions of 29 COVID-19 patients between March 1 and April 30, 2020; median (range) length of ICU stay was 9.9 (1.3 to 32) days, duration of mechanical ventilation 11 (1 to 27) days, and ICU mortality rate 41.4%. There was a 44% reduction in urgent neurosurgical and neurology admissions compared with the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to repurpose a dedicated neuro-ICU for the management of critically ill non-neurological patients during a pandemic response, while maintaining access for urgent neuroscience referrals.","Raith, Eamon P; Luoma, Astri M V; Earl, Mark; Dalal, Meera; Fairley, Sandra; Fox, Felicity; Hunt, Katharine; Willett, Charlotte; Reddy, Ugan",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815827/,501

Herein, we demonstrate that in vitro, NAC has the same boosting activity with various combinations of first- and second-line TB drugs against drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Similar to cysteine, NAC increased M. tuberculosis respiration. However, in M. tuberculosis-infected mice, the addition of NAC did not augment the activity of first- or second-line TB drugs.

This study was conducted with a survey based on 5-point Likert scales (LS-2/2) designed for both parents and physicians. We compared first versus follow-up encounters as well as physicians' and parents' opinions. RESULTS We had a total of 224 responses, among which 204 were completed by physicians (91%) and 173 (84,4%) by parents. Twenty five were first encounters (14,2%). Physicians pointed out the need for clinical examination (42.6%), mainly for first encounters (p=0.0004). Physicians rated the quality of communication lower (p=0.003) as their capacity to answer parents' questions (p=0.004). They were significantly less satisfied with remote encounters compared to parents (p<10-4). We identified six urgent (2.9%) and 50 semi-urgent (24%) situations requiring programming face-to-face encounter during or shortly after the lockdown. CONCLUSION Remote encounters could be a helpful practice for pediatric patients with epilepsy in emergency situations such as pandemics. It allowed the identification and prioritization of emergency situations. Physicians were less positive than parents. We raised the possible use of remote encounters in association to face-to-face encounters for routine follow-up of pediatric patients with epilepsy.","Teng, T; Sareidaki, D E; Chemaly, N; Bar, C; Coste-Zeitoun, D; Kuchenbuch, M; Nabbout, R",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2021.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098318/,501

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while the evidence is still limited. Methods We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality [risk ratio (RR) =2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69 to 5.75, I2=90.9%] or the duration of lung inflammation [weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91], while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD =-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR =1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD =0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD =0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.","Lu, Shuya; Zhou, Qi; Huang, Liping; Shi, Qianling; Zhao, Siya; Wang, Zijun; Li, Weiguo; Tang, Yuyi; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Zhou, Chenyan; Peng, Donghong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566564/,501

We discuss how the results may reconcile several theories of selective attention, by showing how β rhythms support anticipatory information routing through increased network efficiency and β-γ coupling in functionally specialized regions (V1 for orientation, V5 for motion), while reactive α-band desynchronization patterns and increased α-γ coupling in V1 and V5 mediate stimulus-evoked processing of task-relevant signals.","Pagnotta, Mattia F.; Pascucci, David; Plomp, Gijs",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.969253,501

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 of student nurses in Manila, Philippines. Methods: This study utilized a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 314 individuals from October 2020 to December 2020 to evaluate the association of different factors to knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19. Frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, Mest, and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data gathered. Results: The survey revealed that the respondents have a mean knowledge score of 18.76 (SD = 1.64), a mean score for attitude of 26.58 (SD = 2.71) and a mean score for practice of 4.26 (SD = 0.93). A significant different were noted in terms of year level with level 3 having a higher mean score (M = 19.01, F = 2.696, p = 0.046) compared to other levels and type of school, with public university students having a higher level of knowledge (M = 18.97, t = 2.070, p = 0.039). In terms of attitude, females have higher mean scores (M = 26.85, t = -2.630, p = 0.009 and students from public university have higher scores (M = 2.81, t = -4.406, p = 0.000) than students from private university. For practice, a significant difference was noted in terms of year level, with level 3 students having a higher mean score (M = 4.42, F = 3.180, p = 0.024) compared to other year levels. Conclusion: Filipino student nurses have a high level of knowledge about COVID-19 and are mainly optimistic about controlling the pandemic. Nevertheless, having constant reminder from the authorities and health care professionals are the solution to aid public knowledge and comprehension relating to COVID-19.","Quisao, E. Z.

176464,La forza fragile della solidarietà. Povertà sanitaria e terzo settore nella pandemia,2021,"As per the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronaviruses represents a huge virus family that creates diseases in humans/animals. The newly discovered coronavirus is known as Covid-19 (Cov-19). In December 2019, this virus broke out in Wuhan, China causing massive havoc worldwide. The design, development, theory and application of standards related to computation form the Computational Intelligence (CI) methods. Conventionally, the 3 key components of CI are the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy System (FS), & Computation related to Evolution (EC). Lately, techniques like chaotic systems, support vector machines (SVM), etc. have been included into the CI techniques. Machine Learning (ML) enables systems to automatically learn without being programmed explicitly. Deep Learning (DL) represents a family of ML techniques based on ANN. A great potential has been observed while applying CI, ML, and DL techniques for predicting Cov-19. In this regard, the key objective of this chapter is to present an extensive review to the readers on how CI, ML, and DL techniques can be utilized to effectively predict Cov-19. The chapter deals with the review of the different CI, ML, and DL techniques such as ANN, FS, and EC that have been applied for Cov-19 prediction. The application and suitability of CI, ML, and DL techniques for screening and treating the patients, tracing the contacts along with Cov-19 forecasting is discussed in detail. A discussion of why certain CI, ML, and DL techniques are useful for the Cov-19 prediction is also presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Shastry, K.

Carencias En La Sanidad Y En La Política,2020,"This study explores the tourism industry's cash-driven resilience capabilities. To map these capabilities, it enhances the existing analytical approaches to develop the two-dimensional evaluation of cash holdings of tourism businesses from four Central European Countries. The empirical investigation indicates that the non-resilient companies prevail over the resilient ones. If we consider the tourism industry sectors, cash-driven resilience capabilities differ statistically significantly at businesses size level but do not differ at the country level. It is observed that companies with greater cash-driven resilience capabilities are distinguished by a higher profitability and are less financially constrained. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the COVID-19 impacts on the tourism industry by specifying the importance of financial slack and cash holdings in determining the resilience capabilities. In this respect, this study highlights the desired directions of system interventions and managerial concerns.","Wieczorek-Kosmala, Monika",Tourism Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104396,501
176926,"Nationalism, consolidation, and rationalization in the aviation industry",2021,"The LIBOR rate is currently scheduled for discontinuation, and the replacement advocated by regulators in the US is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The change has the potential to disrupt the $200 trillion market of derivatives and debt tied to the LIBOR. The only SOFR linked derivative with any significant liquidity and trading history is the SOFR futures contract, traded at the CME since 2018. We use the historical record of futures prices to construct dynamic arbitrage-free models for the SOFR term structure. The models allow you to construct forward-looking SOFR term rates, imply a SOFR discounting curve and price and risk and risk manage SOFR derivatives, not yet liquidly traded in the market. We find that a standard three-factor Gaussian arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel model describes term rates very well but a shadow-rate extension is needed to describe the behaviour near the zero-boundary. We also find that the jumps and seasonal effects observed in SOFR, do not need to be specifically accounted for in a model for the futures prices. Finally we study the so-called convexity correction and find that it becomes significant beyond the 2 year maturity. For validation purposes we demonstrate that our model aligns closely with the methodology used by the Federal Reserve to publish indicative SOFR term rates.","Skov, Jacob Bjerre; Skovmand, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11180v1.pdf,501

Offers have been compared in terms of demand satisfaction, revenue, costs, accessibility and appealing values that are important information that can help the decision maker to choose the best offer in accordance with the trend of the demand, the future business development and the future companys strategies. The current situation due to COVID-19 pandemic represents an extreme case that poses new decision problems and requires different analysis due to very high level of uncertainty. The present paper can furnish useful insights for facing some of the emerging decision problems but it is dedicated to help decision makers in evaluating the cruise offer when changes occur in a single market or in a limited area.","Ambrosino, D.; Asta, V.",Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems,https://doi.org/10.5220/0010350203750383,501
187962,Social determinants of health.,2009,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Growth factors produced by platelets enhance tissue healing. The aim of this study was to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that, in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the tibial and femoral tunnels and in the graft enhances graft maturation and graft-bone interface healing and thus improves knee function at 3 and 12 months post-operatively in comparison with the control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 patient had the surgery; 20 underwent single-bundle hamstring reconstruction with PRP application (PRP group) and 20 had the same surgery without PRP addition (control group). A 5 ml amount of PRP was obtained from the patient's peripheral blood. A graft inserted in the bone tunnels was fixed with interference screws and, after intra-articular fluid aspiration, 1 ml of PRP was injected into each tunnel and 3 ml were evenly applied to the intra-articular portion of the graft. The patients were examined by MRI at 3 and 12 months after surgery. The subsidence of swelling in the tunnelsurrounding tissues was taken as a sign of graft-bone interface healing, and increased signal intensity of the graft was considered as a result of its ligamentisation. The knee functional status was evaluated at 3 and 12 post-operative months, using the scoring systems (Cincinnati score, IKDC score). RESULTS Bone swelling was found at 3 post-operative months in 18 of 20 patients in both the PRP and the control group. Graft signal intensity was increased in most patients (19 of the PRP group; 18 control patients; p = 0.949). The Cincinnati score at 3 months had an average value of 72.7 (34-100; SO, 18.7) in the PRP group and 73.4 (42-99; SO, 16.3) in the control group (p = 0.793). The functional score after 12 months improved to 97.5 (75-100; SO, 12.8) in the PRP group and to 95.1 (66-100; SO, 13.1) in the control group; there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.885) at either 3 or 12 months. The IKDC score showed similar results. At 12 months bone swelling was recorded in seven out of 20 patients in the PRP group and in nine patients in the control group (p = 0.751). Graft signal intensity was increased in three and four patients of the PRP and control groups, respectively (p = 0.681). There was a statistical difference between the findings at 3 and 12 months within each group, but no difference between the groups. DISCUSSION In ACL reconstruction, the process of tendon graft-to-bone healing has several stages involving inflammation, cell proliferation and graft ligamentisation. At each stage, an important role is played by growth factors produced by thrombocytes, and therefore their potential use in the treatment of injuries to ligaments and tendons has recently come into focus. A number of experimental studies dealing with the effect of platelet-rich plasma on soft tissue healing has been published. Therefore, the method of using PRP to enhance graft healing in ACL reconstruction in humans is still being studied. CONSLUSIONS The use of PRP in ACL reconstruction does not accelerate graft remodelling and bone ingrowth into the tendon. The function scoring results showed a statistically significant improvement in knee function between 3 and 12 months of followup within each group studied but revealed no difference between the groups. The hypothesis postulated above was disproved. Key words: anterior cruciate ligament, platelet-rich plasma, anatomic single-bundle reconstruction.","Komzák, M; Hart, R; Šmíd, P; Puskeiler, M; Jajtner, P",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317184/,501

192163,Binding effects of concanavalin A on a coronavirus.,1977,"OBJECTIVE To explore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also SARS) occurred recently in some regions of our country. METHOD Organ samples of 7 dead cases of SARS were collected from Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic examination. 293 cell line was inoculated with the materials derived from the lungs to isolate causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell cultures were revealed by immunoassay. RESULTS Both Chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like particles were found in EM. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies, reticulate antibodies and intermediate bodies of Chlamydia-like agent were visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs (7 cases), spleens (2 cases), livers (2 cases), kidneys (3 cases) and lymph nodes (1 cases), by ultrathin section electron microscopy (EM). In some few sections, coronavirus-like particles were concurrently seen. A coronavirus RNA- polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of two cases of the SARS. After inoculated with materials from the lung samples, the similar Chlamydia-like particles were also found in the inoculated 293 cells. Since the Chlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures could not react with the genus specific antibodies against Chlamydia and monoclonal antibodies against C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci, the results might well be suggestive of a novel Chlamydia-like agent. CONCLUSION Since the novel Chlamydia-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like agent in the dead cases of SARS, it looks most likely that both the agents play some roles in the disease. At the present time, however, one can hardly determining how did these agents interact each other synergetically, or one follows another, need further study.","Hong, Tao; Wang, Jian-wei; Sun, Yi-lin; Duan, Shu-min; Chen, Liang-biao; Qu, Jian-guo; Ni, An-ping; Liang, Guo-dong; Ren, Li-li; Yang, Ren-quan; Guo, Lan; Zhou, Wei-min; Chen, Jie; Li, De-xin; Xu, Wen-bo; Xu, Hong; Guo, Yuan-ji; Dai, Shu-ling; Bi, Sheng-li; Dong, Xiao-ping; Ruan, Li",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12887816/,501

To evaluate our initial experience, patients treated with SILS cholecystectomy were compared with a comparable group of patients treated with a conventional four trocart technique (LC). METHODS Between May 2009 and April 2010, 60 SILS cholecystectomies were performed. These patients were matched by Body Mass Index (BMI) with 60 cases of conventional LC. RESULTS The operative time was significantly longer in the SILS group 55 min (range, 25-126 min) compared to 49 min (range, 28-75 min) for the LC group. Excluding the first 15 SILS cases the operative time became comparable to the conventional technique, with a mean operative time of 51 min (range, 25-90 min). No patients were converted to open cholecystectomy. In the SILS group 3 patients developed a wound infection, in the conventional LC group 2. CONCLUSION SILS cholecystectomy seems to be a safe and feasible procedure when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Complication rates are comparable to conventional LC. With a learning curve of around 10 to 15 procedures, operative times approach those of conventional LC.","van den Boezem, P B; Kruyt, P M; Cuesta, M A; Sietses, C",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23175927/,501

Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered the same doses for up to 18 months and were evaluated at 2 weeks and 3, 12, and 18 months for hematology. Survival of all dosed groups of rats was similar to that of the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 25 and 50 mg/kg male rats were less than those of the vehicle controls after weeks 29 and 21, respectively. In the 25 and 50 mg/kg females, mean body weights were less after weeks 73 and 53. Dosed male and female rats developed methemoglobinemia, and females developed a regenerative Heinz body anemia. The incidences of pancreatic islet cell adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were increased in all dosed groups of males, were significantly increased in 25 mg/kg males, and exceeded the historical range in controls (all routes). The incidence of pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia was significantly increased in the 50 mg/kg males. In the spleen, the incidence of hematopoietic cell proliferation in 50 mg/kg males was significantly increased; the incidences of capsular fibrosis were significantly increased in all dosed groups of males and in 5 and 50 mg/kg females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered methylene blue trihydrate in a 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution by gavage at doses of 0, 2.5, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 2 years. Additional groups of 30 male and 30 female mice were administered the same doses for up to 18 months and were evaluated at 2 weeks and 3, 12, or 18 months for hematology. Survival of dosed male and female groups exceeded that of the vehicle controls in a generally dose-related manner. Mean body weights of dosed female mice began to increase after weeks 29, 61, and 85, reaching final values that were 113%, 111%, and 106% of vehicle controls for the 2.5, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg groups, respectively. Dosed mice developed methemoglobinemia and a regenerative Heinz body anemia. The incidences of carcinoma and of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) of the small intestine occurred with a positive trend in males. The incidences of malignant lymphoma occurred with a positive trend in females, and the incidence in 25 mg/kg males exceeded the historical control range. The incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen were significantly increased in 12.5 and 25 mg/kg males and in 25 mg/kg females.

211278,The strategic value of corporate social responsibility CSR: the present and future of its management,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious global health threat. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anticoronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist diABZI robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.IMPORTANCE The highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health. Other coronaviruses are likely to jump from a nonhuman animal to humans in the future. Novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics are therefore needed to control known pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its newly mutated variants, as well as future coronavirus outbreaks. STING signaling is a well-established host defense pathway, but its role in coronavirus infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that activation of the STING signaling pathway robustly inhibits infection of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These results identified the STING pathway as a novel target for controlling the spread of known pathogenic coronaviruses, as well as emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, Wei; Reyes, Hanako M; Yang, June F; Li, Yize; Stewart, Kathleen M; Basil, Maria C; Lin, Susan M; Katzen, Jeremy; Morrisey, Edward E; Weiss, Susan R; You, Jianxin",J. virol,,501

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of AVCs by paramedics with a base physician on the rate of patients treated on site without the need of hospital transfer. The co-primary safety outcome was the frequency of repeated ambulance trips within 48 hours to the same patient. Secondary objective was the qualitative analysis of perception of the AVCs. METHODS: During a six-week period, the dispatching center of Karlovy Vary Emergency Medical Service (EMS) randomized low-urgency events from a rural area (n = 791) to receive either a mandatory phone-call consult (PHONE), AVC (VIDEO), or performed by the paramedic crew in a routine manner, when phone-call consultation is for paramedic crew optional (CONTROL). Secondarily, the qualitative analysis of subjective perception of AVCs compared to consultation over the phone by the paramedic and consulting physician was performed. RESULTS: Per-protocol analysis (PPA) was performed (CONTROL, n = 258; PHONE, n = 193; and VIDEO, n = 192) in addition to the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Patients (PPA) in both mandatory consulted groups were twice as likely to be treated and left on site compared to the CONTROL (PHONE: OR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.58; P = 0.01 or VIDEO: OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.49; P = .01). Repeated trips to patients treated and left on site in 48 hours occurred in three (8.6%) of 35 cases in the PHONE group and in eight (23.5%) of 34 cases in the VIDEO group. CONCLUSIONS: The AVCs of the emergency physician by paramedics was not superior to the mandatory conventional phone call in increasing the proportion of patients treated and left at home after a low-urgency call. The AVC improved the subjective feelings of safety by physicians, but not the satisfaction of patients or paramedics, and may lead to an increased need of repeated trips.","Sykora, Roman; Renza, Metodej; Ruzicka, Jiri; Bakurova, Petra; Kukacka, Milos; Smetana, Jiri; Duska, Frantisek",Prehosp Disaster Med,,501

METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective international registry comprising 109 consecutive patients (age 64â¯±â¯16â¯years; 62% male) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and noncontrast chest CT imaging. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the burden (%) of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. EAT volume (mL) and attenuation (Hounsfield units) were measured using deep learning software. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death. RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for patient comorbidities, the total burden of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with EAT volume (ßâ¯=â¯10.6, pâ¯=â¯0.005) and EAT attenuation (ßâ¯=â¯5.2, pâ¯=â¯0.004). EAT volume correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (râ¯=â¯0.361, pâ¯=â¯0.001) and C-reactive protein (râ¯=â¯0.450, pâ¯<â¯0.001). Clinical deterioration or death occurred in 23 (21.1%) patients at a median of 3â¯days (IQR 1-13â¯days) following the chest CT. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EAT volume (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.8-14.1] per doubling pâ¯=â¯0.011) and EAT attenuation (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5-7.5] per 5 Hounsfield unit increase, pâ¯=â¯0.003) were independent predictors of clinical deterioration or death, as was total pneumonia burden (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, pâ¯=â¯0.002), chronic lung disease (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7], pâ¯=â¯0.011), and history of heart failure (OR 3.5 [95% 1.1-8.2], pâ¯=â¯0.037).

As of March 31, 2020, a total of 82,631 cases of COVID-19 in China were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. METHODS: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A total of 198 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 139 dates of infections were identified among 14,829 confirmed cases outside Hubei Province as reported as of March 31, 2020. Based on this information, we found that the serial interval had an average of 4.60 days with a standard deviation of 5.55 days, the incubation period had an average of 8.00 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days and the infectious period had an average of 13.96 days with a standard deviation of 5.20 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, Rc, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R0. CONCLUSIONS: The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now. It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic. Nonetheless, efforts are still needed in order to end the current epidemic as imported cases from overseas pose a high risk of a second outbreak.","You, Chong; Deng, Yuhao; Hu, Wenjie; Sun, Jiarui; Lin, Qiushi; Zhou, Feng; Pang, Cheng Heng; Zhang, Yuan; Chen, Zhengchao; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,501
237768,Les psychomotriciens dans la tourmente du COVID : retours sur la période mars/juin 2020,2020,"Purpose This paper aims to discuss how the tourism industry is contending with the economic and interorganizational challenges wrought by the COVID-19 outbreak and heightened by a lack of communication between the government and local businesses in the state of Israel. The researchers examine the dependency of the tourism industry on the general preparation programs that were developed and are currently being deployed by the relevant national stakeholders and question whether instead, it should use the pandemic as a catalyst for formulating its own nuanced tourism-travel-and-hospitality-oriented strategies and procedures. Design/methodology/approach Applying an ethnographic-based mix-methods research approach, this paper draws on insights from data compiled by fusing existing theoretical and emerging practical knowledge with empirical research (qualitative and quantitative) conducted among numerous relevant macro (governmental/centralized industry) and micro (hotels, travel and tourism operators and service providers) stakeholders as well as potential consumers. Findings It is essential that national and local government bodies form collaborative interorganizational relationships with local stakeholders to jointly activate case-specific hospitality and travel-specific risk mitigation management strategies. Moreover, the pandemic laid bare the tentative and fragile nature of the globalized tourism industry supply and demand chains, a condition that may be remedied via a pivot toward using national or even regional supply chains and goods and service providers. Within Israel, such changes could lead to increased economic benefits that extend beyond the tourism industry to provide certain security-related benefits.

Students who were previously at most risk for falling behind their peers and through the cracks because of academic, financial, racial, and/or generational disadvantage faced a wide range of additional obstacles in the pursuit of their college goals. This qualitative study sought to uncover postsecondary advising implications for students through the perspectives of near-peer college advisers (n = 23) serving in high-need schools in two different states as intensive, in-person advising was forced to adapt to virtual formats. Two key thematic findings reveal that advisers faced new communication challenges and existing systemic barriers for marginalized students became even larger.

We aimed to compare hemodynamic and respiratory parameters of moderate and severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.These patients were monitored with an advanced hemodynamic measurement system by the transpulmonary thermodilution method in prone and supine positions. Patients and methods: Data of 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 16 patients diagnosed with other types of diseases with moderate and severe ARDS, mechanically ventilated, placed in a prone position, had advanced hemodynamic measurements with PICCO, and stayed in the intensive care unit for more than a week were analyzed retrospectively. Patient characteristics and arterial blood gases analysis recorded at admission and respiratory and advanced hemodynamic parameters during the first week were compared in prone and supine positions. Results: No difference was observed in the respiratory parameters including respiratory system compliance between COVID-19 and non-COVD-19 patients in prone and supine positions. In comparison of advanced hemodynamic parameters in the first week of intensive care, the extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indexes measured in supine position of COVID-19 ARDS patients were found to be significantly higher than non-COVID-19 patients. Duration of prone position was significantly longer in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 ARDS. Conclusions: The results of this study suggested that COVID-19 ARDS is a variant of typical ARDS with a different pathophysiology.","Asar, S.; Acicbe, O.; Sabaz, M.

As the virus has spread, critical questions arose about how to best deliver health care in emergency situations where material and personnel resources become scarce. Clinicians who excel at caring for the individual patient at the bedside are now being reoriented into a system where they are being asked to see the collective public as their responsibility. As such, the clinical ethics that clinicians are accustomed to practicing are being modified by a framework of public health ethics defined by the presence of a global pandemic. There are many unknowns about Coronavirus disease 2019, which makes it difficult to provide consistent recommendations and guidelines that uniformly apply to all situations. This lack of consensus leads to the clinicians' confusion and distress. Real-life dilemmas about how to allocate resources and provide care in hotspot cities make explicit the need for careful ethical analysis, but the need runs far deeper than that; even when not trading some lives against others, the responsibilities of both individual clinicians and the broader healthcare system are changing in the face of this crisis.","Dunham, Alexandra M; Rieder, Travis N; Humbyrd, Casey J",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,501

As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,501

METHODS: The (2012-2015) National Readmission Database was queried for all adult (age &#8805;18 y) trauma patients with penetrating injuries who underwent exploratory laparotomy and were readmitted within 6 mo of index hospitalization discharge. Patients were stratified by firearm injuries (FIs) and stab injuries (SIs). Primary outcomes were rates of MAC: intra-abdominal abscesses (IAAs), superficial surgical site infection (SSI), and fascial dehiscence within 6 mo after discharge. Secondary outcomes were both nonabdominal complications and mortality, postdischarge, and 6-mo readmission. Regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 4473 patients (FI, 2326; SI, 2147) were included in the study; the mean age was 32 ± 14 y, the Injury Severity Score was 19 (15-25), and 23% underwent damage control laparotomy (DCL). The rate of MAC within 6 mo was 22% (IAA 19%, SSI 7%, and fascial dehiscence 4%). Patients with FIs had a higher rate of IAA (27% versus 10%; P < 0.01), SSI (11% versus 3%; P < 0.01), fascial dehiscence (5% versus 3%; P = 0.03), nonabdominal complications (54% versus 24%; P < 0.01), and postdischarge mortality (8% versus 6%; P < 0.01) compared with patients with SIs . On regression analysis, DCL (P < 0.01), large bowel perforation (P < 0.01), biliary-pancreatic injury (P < 0.01), hepatic injury (P < 0.01), and blood transfusion (P = 0.02) were predictors of MAC. CONCLUSIONS: MAC developed in one in five patients after PAT. FIs have a higher potential for hollow viscus injury and peritoneal contamination, and are more predictive of MAC and nonabdominal complications, especially after DCL. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III Prognostic.","Hanna, Kamil; Asmar, Samer; Ditillo, Michael; Chehab, Mohamad; Khurrum, Muhammad; Bible, Letitia; Douglas, Molly; Joseph, Bellal",J Surg Res,,501

We conducted a longitudinal web-based survey of 217 Italian participants at two time points: lockdown and subsequent follow-up. To thoroughly investigate lockdown-related changes in sleep quality, we first evaluated variations in overall sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We then examined sleep changes in specific components of sleep quality. Results revealed a clear dissociation of sleep effects, as a function of the specific domain considered, with longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, and massive sleep medication use during forced confinement. On the other hand, we simultaneously observed an increased sleep duration and better daytime functioning. Our present findings highlight the importance of an accurate examination of sleep quality during lockdown, as the effects were not uniform across populations and different sleep domains.","Alfonsi, Valentina; Gorgoni, Maurizio; Scarpelli, Serena; Zivi, Pierpaolo; Sdoia, Stefano; Mari, Emanuela; Fraschetti, Angelo; Ferlazzo, Fabio; Giannini, Anna Maria; De Gennaro, Luigi",J Sleep Res,,501
269810,Modifications des modes de vie et impact psychosocial du confinement lié à la COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease associated with endotheliitis and microthrombosis. OBJECTIVES: To correlate endothelial dysfunction to in-hospital mortality in a bi-centric cohort of COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: Consecutive ambulatory and hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. A panel of endothelial biomarkers and von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers were measured in each patient &#8804; 48 h following admission. RESULTS: Study enrolled 208 COVID-19 patients of whom 23 were mild outpatients and 189 patients hospitalized after admission. Most of endothelial biomarkers tested were found increased in the 89 critical patients transferred to intensive care unit. However, only von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) scaled according to clinical severity, with levels significantly higher in critical patients (median 507%, IQR 428-596) compared to non-critical patients (288%, 230-350, p < 0.0001) or COVID-19 outpatients (144%, 133-198, p = 0.007). Moreover, VWF high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) were significantly higher in critical patients (median ratio 1.18, IQR 0.86-1.09) compared to non-critical patients (0.96, 1.04-1.39, p < 0.001). Among all endothelial biomarkers measured, ROC curve analysis identified a VWF:Ag cut-off of 423% as the best predictor for in-hospital mortality. The accuracy of VWF:Ag was further confirmed in a Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis and a Cox proportional Hazard model adjusted on age, BMI, C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:Ag is a relevant predictive factor for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. More than a biomarker, we hypothesize that VWF, including excess of HMWM forms, drives microthrombosis in COVID-19.","Philippe, Aurélien; Chocron, Richard; Gendron, Nicolas; Bory, Olivier; Beauvais, Agathe; Peron, Nicolas; Khider, Lina; Guerin, Coralie L; Goudot, Guillaume; Levasseur, Françoise; Peronino, Christophe; Duchemin, Jerome; Brichet, Julie; Sourdeau, Elise; Desvard, Florence; Bertil, Sébastien; Pene, Frédéric; Cheurfa, Cherifa; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Planquette, Benjamin; Rivet, Nadia; Jourdi, Georges; Hauw-Berlemont, Caroline; Hermann, Bertrand; Gaussem, Pascale; Mirault, Tristan; Terrier, Benjamin; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Fontenay, Michaela; Smadja, David M",Angiogenesis,,501
271050,Covid-19: Les étudiants face à la crise,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of preventable death after a traumatic event, and early intervention to control bleeding improves opportunities for survival. It is imperative to prepare for local and national disasters by increasing public knowledge on how to control bleeding, and this preparation should extend to both adults and children. The purpose of this study is to describe a training effort to teach basic hemorrhage control techniques to early adolescent children. METHODS: The trauma and emergency departments at a combined level I adult and level II pediatric trauma center piloted a training initiative with early adolescents (grades 6-8) focused on 2 skills: packing a wound and holding direct pressure, and applying a Combat Application Tourniquet. Students were evaluated on each skill and completed presurveys and postsurveys indicating their likelihood to use the skills. RESULTS: Of the 194 adolescents who participated in the trainings, 97% of the students could successfully pack a wound and hold pressure, and 97% of the students could apply a tourniquet. Before the training, 71% of the adolescents indicated that they would take action to assist a bleeding victim; this increased to 96% after the training. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that basic hemorrhage control skills can be effectively taught to adolescents as young as 6th grade (ages 11-12 years) in a small setting with age-appropriate content and hands-on opportunities to practice the skills and such training increases students' perceived willingness to take action to assist a bleeding victim.","Sidwell, Richard A; Spilman, Sarah K; Feist, Brian; Fuchsen, Elizabeth A; Taber, Philip S; Pelaez, Carlos A",Pediatr. emerg. care,,501

This high infection rate resulted in the spread of the virus in China, Europe, and, eventually, the rest of the world, including Mexico. At present, around 9 million people are infected, and around 470,000 have died worldwide. In this context, the need to generate protective immunity, and especially the generation of a vaccine that can protect the world population against infection in the shortest possible time, is a challenge that is being addressed in different countries using different strategies in multiple clinical trials. This opinion article will present the evidence of the induction of immune response in some of the viruses of the coronavirus family before COVID-19, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The information collected about the induction of an immune response by SARS-CoV-2 will be presented, as well as a description of the vaccine candidates reported to date in the various ongoing clinical trials.

The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS: The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize the risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS: We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience. Over time, we refined the workflows using a cyclical improvement system. We present our checklists and workflows as well as the system we used for their development, so that others may use them to their benefit.","Li, Yunping; Ciampa, Erin J; Zucco, Liana; Levy, Nadav; Colella, Meredith; Golen, Toni; Shainker, Scott A; Lunderberg, J Mark; Ramachandran, Satya Krishna; Hess, Philip E",Anesth Analg,,501

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that COVID-19 and HLH have an overlap of signaling pathways and gene signatures commonly dysregulated, which were defined by investigating the transcriptomes of 1253 subjects (controls, COVID-19, and HLH patients) using microarray, bulk RNA-sequencing (RNAseq), and single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq). COVID-19 and HLH share pathways involved in cytokine and chemokine signaling as well as neutrophil-mediated immune responses that associate with COVID-19 severity. These genes are dysregulated at protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins which converge to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature neutrophils. Artificial intelligence modeling confirmed the strong association of these genes with COVID-19 severity.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a significant threat to international health. COVID-19 is highly infectious and can lead to fatal comorbidities especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is conducive to early identification and precise treatment. We aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences from ARDS caused by other factors. COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. The onset time of COVID-19-related ARDS was 8-12 days, which was inconsistent with ARDS Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit. Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance. The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe. HFNO can be safe in COVID-19-related ARDS patients, even in some moderate-severe patients. The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure. Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important. The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain. We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.","Li, Xu; Ma, Xiaochun",Crit Care,,501

Our goal was to determine the frequencies of Influenza A and B viruses (FLUAV/FLUBV), human mastadenovirus C (HAdV-C), Enterovirus 68 (EV-68), and rhinovirus (RV) besides SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients suspect of COVID-19 with cases of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) in the period of March to December 2020 and to detect possible coinfections among them. Nucleic acid detection was performed using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in respiratory samples using naso-oropharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage. A total of 418 samples of the 987 analyzed (42.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 16 (1.62%) samples were positive for FLUAV, no sample was positive for FLUBV or EV-68, 67 (6.78%) samples were positive for HAdV-C, 55 samples were positive for RV 1/2 (26.3%) and 37 for RV 2/2 (13.6%). Coinfections were also detected, including a triple coinfection with SARS-CoV-2, FLUAV, and HAdV-C. In the present work, a very low frequency of FLUV was reported among hospitalized patients with ARDS compared to the past years, probably due to preventive measures taken to avoid COVID-19 and the high influenza vaccination coverage in the region in which this study was performed.","Eisen, Ana Karolina Antunes; Gularte, Juliana Schons; Demoliner, Meriane; de Abreu Goés Pereira, Vyctoria Malayhka; Heldt, Fágner Henrique; Filippi, Micheli; de Almeida, Paula Rodrigues; Hansen, Alana Witt; Fleck, Juliane Deise; Spilki, Fernando Rosado",J Med Virol,,501

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 25-minute online survey was distributed worldwide through social media from 5/21/2020 to 7/1/2020. MEASUREMENTS: Participants reported sociodemographic/economic information, the impact of the pandemic on major life domains, insomnia and depressive symptoms, and changes in sleep midpoint, time-in-bed, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and nightmare and nap frequency from prior to during the pandemic. Sleep pattern changes were subjected to latent profile analysis. The identified profiles were compared to one another on all aforementioned factors using probit regression analyses. RESULTS: The sample of 991 participants (ages: 18-80 years; 72.5% women; 60.3% residing outside of the United States) reported significantly delayed sleep midpoint, reductions in TST and SE, and increases in nightmares and naps. Over half reported significant insomnia symptoms, and almost two-thirds reported significant depressive symptoms. Latent profile analysis revealed 4 sleep pattern change profiles that were significantly differentiated by pre-pandemic sleep patterns, gender, and various COVID-19-related impacts on daily living such as severity of change in routines, and family stress and discord. CONCLUSIONS: In an international online sample, poor sleep and depressive symptoms were widespread, and negative shifts in sleep patterns from pre-pandemic patterns were common. Differences in sleep pattern response to the COVID-19 crisis suggest potential and early targets for behavioral sleep health interventions.","Petrov, Megan E; Pituch, Keenan A; Kasraeian, Kimiya; Jiao, Nana; Mattingly, Jennifer; Hasanaj, Kristina; Youngstedt, Shawn D; Buman, Matthew P; Epstein, Dana R",Sleep Health,,501

Compared to the national benchmark. Our goal was to identify opportunities for quality improvement. METHODS: We compared NSQIP general surgery data from January 2015-December 2016 (period 1) to January 2017-December 2018 (period 2). A multidisciplinary committee was developed and patient centered education implemented to enhance VTE compliance. RESULTS: Over 50% of all the patients who developed VTE were non-compliant with chemical prophylaxis. The majority of non-compliance was due to pain. During period 1 there were 12 VTEs in 482 cases, while in period two, 18 VTEs in 2347 cases (2.5% vs. 0.8%; RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.7, p < 0.001). Missed chemical prophylaxis decreased from 50 to 17 per week after the intervention.

Three time intervals defined by the progressive containment measures implemented by the Italian Government were considered. Main outcome measures were the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, the Risk Perception Index, the Index of Self-restraint Behaviours, and Institutional and Interpersonal Trust Measures. Results confirmed that significant changes in the time progression have occurred in the perception of risk, in the perception of individual self-efficacy, in the value attributed to social responsibility, in interpersonal trust and in trust in health authorities. The study also identified the participants' personality traits and locus of control as predictors (positive and negative) of perceived self-efficacy and tested a mediation model of trust on the effect of risk perception on self-restraint intentions.","Diotaiuti, Pierluigi; Valente, Giuseppe; Mancone, Stefania; Falese, Lavinia; Bellizzi, Fernando; Anastasi, Daniela; Langiano, Elisa; Dominski, Fábio Hech; Andrade, Alexandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,501

METHODS: A cross-sectional representative sample of 485 US residents was collected in mid-April 2020. Participants were asked about (a) perceptions of COVID-19 risk, (b) demographic factors known to be associated with increased COVID-19 risk, and (c) the impact of COVID-19 on different life domains. We used a three-step hierarchical linear regression model to assess the differential contribution of the factors listed above on perceived COVID-19 risk. RESULTS: The final model accounted for 16% of variability in perceived risk, F(18,458) = 4.8, p < .001. Participants who were White reported twice as much perceived risk as participants of color (B = -2.1, 95% CI[-3.4,-0.8]. Higher perceived risk was observed among those who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their sleep (B = 1.5, 95% CI[0.8,2.1]) or work (B = 0.7, 95%CI[0.1,1.3]). The number of cases per capita in their state of residence, age, or proximity to someone with a COVID-19 diagnosis were not found to meaningfully predict perceived risk. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived risk was not found to be associated with known demographic risk factors, except that the effect of race/ethnicity was in the opposite direction of existing evidence. Perception of COVID-19 risk was associated with the perceived personal impact of the pandemic.","Seehuus, Martin; Stanton, Amelia M; Handy, Ariel B; Haik, Amanda K; Gorman, Rebecca; Clifton, Jessica",J Psychosom Res,,501

Most cytokines utilize the JAK-STAT and Ras-ERK pathways to promote gene transcription and proliferation; however, this signaling is tightly regulated. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family and SPRED family are a representative negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway and the Ras-ERK pathway, respectively. The SOCS family regulates the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells, and is involved in immune tolerance, anergy, and exhaustion. SPRED family proteins have been shown to inactivate Ras by recruiting the Ras-GTPase neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) protein. Human genetic analysis has shown that SOCS family members are strongly associated with autoimmune diseases, allergies, and tumorigenesis, and SPRED1 is involved in NF1-like syndromes and tumors. We also identified the NR4a family of nuclear receptors as a key transcription factor for immune tolerance that suppresses cytokine expression and induces various immuno-regulatory molecules including SOCS1.","Yoshimura, Akihiko; Aki, Daisuke; Ito, Minako",Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,,501

BACKGROUND: After coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, front-line nurses embraced remarkable potential stress and huge workload when caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients, which may lead to new challenges to work engagement. DESIGN: A large sample survey was conducted at the end of February 2020 in a designated hospital treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, in China. t Test, one-way ANOVA, chi-squared test, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were performed among 1,040 nurses using SPSS 24.0. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: The final model interpreted 27.3% of the variance, of which each block could explain 11.7%, 10.3% and 7.9% R2 changes including sociodemographic characteristics, stress and workload, respectively. Work engagement was negatively correlated with stress and workload. The potential influencing factors included sociodemographic characteristics (married, rescue staff, cabin ward), stress (infection control, PPE discomfort) and workload (mental demand, performance, frustration). CONCLUSIONS: Front-line nurses perceived low stress and workload, but high work engagement, especially in self-dedication. However, infection control, PPE discomfort and frustration were negatively associated with nurses' work engagement, while mental demand and good performance were positively associated with nurses' work engagement. Future interventions focused on decreasing front-line staff's infection risk and enhancing their self-confidence may be recommendable to promote their work engagement.","Zhang, Meng; Zhang, Ping; Liu, Yu; Wang, Hui; Hu, Kaili; Du, Meichen",J. clin. nurs,,501

345529,Comentarios sobre la crisis del Coronavirus,2020,"Purpose: A recent global pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affects the manufacturing supply chains most significantly. This effect becomes more challenging for the manufacturers of high-demand and most essential items, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. In a pandemic situation, the demand of the essential products increases expressively; on the other hand, the supply of the raw materials decreases considerably with a constraint of production capacity. These dual disruptions impact the production process suddenly, and the process can collapse without immediate and necessary actions. To minimize the impacts of these dual disruptions, we aim to develop a recovery model for making a decision on the revised production plan. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors use a mathematical modeling approach to develop a production recovery model for a high-demand and essential item during the COVID-19. The authors also analyze the properties of the recovery plan, and optimize the recovery plan to maximize the profit in the recovery window. Findings: The authors analyze the results using a numerical example. The result shows that the developed recovery model is capable of revising the production plan in the situations of both demand and supply disruptions, and improves the profit for the manufacturers. The authors also discuss the managerial implications, including the roles of digital technologies in the recovery process. Originality/value: This model, which is a novel contribution to the literature, will help decision-makers of high-demand and essential items to make an accurate and prompt decision in designing the revised production plan to recover during a pandemic, like COVID-19.","Paul, Sanjoy Kumar; Chowdhury, Priyabrata",Int.

This study aims to test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health above and beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the Western United States. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, ß = 0.45, p = 0.002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, ß = -0.39, p = 0.03; lower perceived stress, ß = -0.26, p = 0.002; and less loneliness, ß = -0.12, p = 0.04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis. BCEs should be included along with ACEs in future research, assessment, and screening with distressed and vulnerable populations.","Doom, Jenalee R; Seok, Deborah; Narayan, Angela J; Fox, Kathryn R",Advers Resil Sci,,501

Knowledge about the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 infection should help physicians in diagnoses and in taking appropriate precautions, as some manifestations can appear before typical pulmonary symptoms. Various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion are discussed and symptoms are described, which can be subdivided into manifestations of the central nervous system (CNS) (headache, dizziness, stroke, impaired consciousness, encephalitis, meningitis, seizures) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) (characteristic hyposmia and hypogeusia, Guillain Barré syndrome, myalgia). Additionally, the implications of COVID-19 infection for treatment of patients with common neurological diseases and their management is presented. It can be concluded that neurological symptoms are part of a clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection, involving the CNS and PNS.

In this context, betweenness centrality has demonstrated to be a very effective measure to identify nodes that act as focus of congestion, or bottlenecks, in the network. However, there is not a way to define betweenness outside the network framework. By analytically linking dynamical systems and network theory, we provide a trajectory-based formulation of betweenness, called Lagrangian betweenness, as a function of Lyapunov exponents. This extends the concept of betweenness beyond the context of network theory relating hyperbolic points and heteroclinic connections in any dynamical system to the structural bottlenecks of the network associated with it. Using modeled and observational velocity fields, we show that such bottlenecks are present and surprisingly persistent in the oceanic circulation across different spatio-temporal scales and we illustrate the role of these areas in driving fluid transport over vast oceanic regions. Analyzing plankton abundance data from the Kuroshio region of the Pacific Ocean, we find significant spatial correlations between measures of diversity and betweenness, suggesting promise for ecological applications.","Ser-Giacomi, Enrico; Baudena, Alberto; Rossi, Vincent; Follows, Mick; Clayton, Sophie; Vasile, Ruggero; López, Cristóbal; Hernández-García, Emilio",Nat Commun,,501

While these drugs may increase cardiac toxicity risk, cardiomyocyte mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly understood in humans. Therefore, we evaluated the pro-arrhythmia risk and inotropic effects of these drugs in the cardiomyocyte contractility-based model of the human heart. We found Hydroxychloroquine to have a low pro-arrhythmia risk, while Chloroquine and Azithromycin were associated with high risk. Hydroxychloroquine pro-arrhythmia risk changed to high with low level of K+, while high level of Mg2+ protected against pro-arrhythmic effect of high Hydroxychloroquine concentrations. Moreover, therapeutic concentration of Hydroxychloroquine caused no enhancement of elevated temperature-induced pro-arrhythmia. Polytherapy of Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin and sequential application of these drugs were also found to influence pro-arrhythmia risk categorization. Hydroxychloroquine pro-arrhythmia risk changed to high when combined with Azithromycin at therapeutic concentration. However, Hydroxychloroquine at therapeutic concentration impacted the cardiac safety profile of Azithromycin and its pro-arrhythmia risk only at concentrations above therapeutic level. We also report that Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, but not Azithromycin, decreased contractility while exhibiting multi-ion channel block features, and Hydroxychloroquine's contractility effect was abolished by Azithromycin. Thus, this study has the potential to inform clinical studies evaluating repurposed therapies, including those in the COVID-19 context. Additionally, it demonstrates the translational value of the human cardiomyocyte contractility-based model as a key early discovery path to inform decisions on novel therapies for COVID-19, malaria, and inflammatory diseases.","Jordaan, Pierre; Dumotier, Bérengère; Traebert, Martin; Miller, Paul E; Ghetti, Andre; Urban, Laszlo; Abi-Gerges, Najah",Toxicol. sci,,501

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether greenness was related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US. METHODS: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and in counties with stay-at-home orders.

The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the PANBIO COVID-19 Ag RAD (Abbott) test, a lateral flow immunoassay that detects the nucleocapsid protein, using as a reference RT-PCR method the Cobas®8800 System (Roche Diagnostics). This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary Children's Hospital and included individuals aged &#8804;16 years with COVID-19-related symptoms or epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected to perform the PANBIO RAD test and RT-PCR. Of 744 children included, 51 (6.86%) had a positive RT-PCR result. The RAD test detected 42 of 51 PCR-positive children while there were no false-positive results. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 82.35% (95% CI, 71.9%-92.8%) and 100%, respectively. Sensitivity was >95% in symptomatic children. The assay performed poorly in asymptomatically infected children. In agreement with previous studies in adults, the PANBIO RAD test can be useful in screening for COVID-19 in children admitted with symptoms suggestive of the disease, especially in the first days of the illness.","Eleftheriou, Irini; Dasoula, Foteini; Dimopoulou, Dimitra; Lebessi, Evangelia; Serafi, Eftihia; Spyridis, Nikos; Tsolia, Maria",J Med Virol,,501

The aim was to assess the variation of alcohol drinking habits in a sample of Italian citizens during lockdown and to identify the psychosocial factors surrounding it. METHODS: An online anonymous questionnaire was created and submitted from 9th April 2020 to 28th April 2020. Questions were related to personal psychosocial details and alcohol drinking habits during the lockdown, including Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT C) questions. RESULTS: On a total of 1234 surveys the increase of both anxiety and fear was largely detected (63% and 61% respectively). The 18% increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown and it showed a significant correlation with anxiety and fear experienced (both p<0.001). The relative risk for 7 to 9 and more than 10 drinks per day consumption were directly linked to these symptoms (p<0.001). The most involved categories of participants showed this harmful association were self-employed workers and participants who live alone, subject aged 30-50 with high level of instruction or students and not occupied people in the age range 18-19 (all p<0.001). Additionally, the subset of the study population that showed low alcohol consumption before the lockdown has demonstrated the worsening of alcohol assumption during the quarantine (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Several psychosocial factors are involved in determining the increase of alcohol consumption during lockdown and need the healthcare support to avoid awful impact on human life.","Mazzarella, Chiara; Spina, Annamaria; Dallio, Marcello; Gravina, Antonietta G; Romeo, Mario; DI Mauro, Maurizio; Loguercio, Carmelina; Federico, Alessandro",Minerva med,,501

Informed by a systematic review of the burgeoning empirical research on the COVID-19 pandemic and research on prior coronavirus pandemics, we link pandemic risk factors, negative mental health outcomes and appropriate intervention strategies. We describe how social risk factors and pandemic stressors will contribute to negative mental health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations. We evaluate the scalability of primary, secondary and tertiary interventions according to mental health target, population, modality, intensity and provider type to provide a unified strategy for meeting population mental health needs. Traditional models, in which evidence-based therapies delivered are delivered in-person, by a trained expert, at a specialty care location have proved difficult to scale. The use of non-traditional models, tailoring preventive interventions to populations based on their needs, and ongoing coordinated evaluation of intervention implementation and effectiveness will be critical to refining our efforts to increase reach.","Boden, Matt; Zimmerman, Lindsey; Azevedo, Kathryn J; Ruzek, Josef I; Gala, Sasha; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Cohen, Nichole; Walser, Robyn; Mahtani, Naina D; Hoggatt, Katherine J; McLean, Carmen P",Clin Psychol Rev,,501

Black adolescents are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19, have high mental health service needs, and have low mental health services utilization. During this time of great physical threat due to COVID-19, it is equally important to understand and support the mental health of Black adolescents. METHOD: This study collected open-ended survey item responses from adolescents (12-17 years old) that identified as Black, living in a city in the Southeastern United States (n = 33). Grounded theory was used to analyze the data, revealing details of the lived experience of these Black adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Black adolescents reported that COVID-19 has been both positive and negative for them. Family is of utmost importance to them, as are their peers, whom they do not get to interact with due to changes in the operation of schools. Despite experiencing stress, adaptive responses to COVID-19 are reported. Black adolescents continue to cite issues with mental health services and providers. Financial issues were a common theme for these youth, blocking access to services and causing issues in the home environment. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health service providers must address the service access and quality issues repeatedly reported by Black adolescents. Direct action must be taken to facilitate an increase in Black adolescents mental health services utilization and satisfaction.

We hypothesized that the previously reported rates of ED may have improved with the advent of modern technology. The purpose of this project was to evaluate modern external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy techniques to determine the incidence of radiotherapy (RT) induced ED. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature published between January 2002 and December 2018 was performed to obtain patient reported rates of ED after definitive external beam radiotherapy, ultrafractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, and brachytherapy (BT) to the prostate in men who were potent prior to RT. Univariate and multivariate analyses of radiation dose, treatment strategy, and length of follow-up were analyzed to ascertain their relationship with RT-induced ED. RESULTS: Of 890 articles reviewed, 24 met inclusion criteria, providing data from 2714 patients. Diminished erectile function status post RT was common and similar across all studies. The median increase in men reporting ED was 17%, 26%, 23%, and 23%, 3DCRT, IMRT, low dose rate BT, and SBRT, respectively, at 2-year median follow-up. CONCLUSION: ED is a common side effect of RT. Risk of post-RT ED is similar for both LDR brachytherapy and external beam RT with advanced prostate targeting and penile-bulb sparing techniques utilized in modern RT techniques.","Hunt, Anastasia A; Choudhury, Kingshuk Roy; Nukala, Varun; Nolan, Michael W; Ahmad, Alina; Ashcraft, Kathleen A; Koontz, Bridget F",Prostate cancer prostatic dis,,501

RECENT FINDINGS: Aging is a complex process that leads to changes in all the systems of the body and all the functions of the person; however, aging develops at different rates in different people, and chronological age is not always consistent with biological age. Gerontologists are focused not only on finding the best theory able to explain aging but also on identifying one or more markers, which are able to describe aging processes. These biomarkers are necessary to better define the aging-related pathologies, manage multimorbidity, and improve the quality of life. The aim of this paper is to review the most recent evidence on aging biomarkers and the clusters related to them for personalization of treatments.","Colloca, Giuseppe; Di Capua, Beatrice; Bellieni, Andrea; Fusco, Domenico; Ciciarello, Francesca; Tagliaferri, Luca; Valentini, Vincenzo; Balducci, Lodovico",Curr Oncol Rep,,501

This is a retrospective single-center study for patients who were admitted with COVID-19 infection. Data collection was from 1 March through 24 April 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. The &#967;2 test and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association of risk factors and clinical outcomes. A total of 242 inpatients were included with a mean age of 66 ± 14.75 (±standard deviation). A total of 50% were female and 70% were African American. Comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes mellitus (49%), and 19% had either COPD or asthma.

Patients and methods: A total of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females;median age: 12 years;range, 6.6 to 16 years) suspected of having COVID-19 at our pediatric rheumatology clinic between March 11th and October 15th 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic and clinical features, treatments, laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) were retrieved from the medical records. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made based on the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. Results: The most common rheumatic diseases were juvenile idiopathic arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (35.6% and 34.5%, respectively). Twenty-six of these patients were treated with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested as positive in 84 (96.5%) patients. Also, 51 (58.6%) patients had an epidemiological contact to a person with COVID-19. Eighteen patients met the clinical criteria and diagnosed with MIS-C. The COVID-19 outbreak also caused exacerbation of systemic disease in 56 children due to medication cessation, postponed drug switch, or recurrent viral infection. Conclusion: Children with rheumatic disease do not appear to present a higher risk of severe COVID-19. The immunosuppressive treatments can be adjusted in case of infection;otherwise, it is not recommended to interrupt the treatments. Physicians should be cautious about the hyperinflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in rheumatic children, which may be severe in this group of patients and may be confused with primary diseases.","Sozeri, B.; Demir, F.; Kalin, S.; Akkus, C.

420756,In regard to Kabarriti et al,2020,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented event for the entire world. Stay-at-home orders, many children being taught at home, health anxieties, and the subsequent economic downturn have collectively resulted in significant stress. Recent work has established that some individuals report drinking more in response to experiencing pandemic-related stress, but data has largely been limited to individuals and to psychological stress. Methods: This research investigated how own (actor) and partner psychological and financial stress about the pandemic were associated with alcohol consumption, high-intensity drinking frequency, coping motives, and alcohol-related problems in a sample of 118 couples during the month of July 2020. We also explored whether own (actor) and partner effects were moderated by gender. Results: Results using indistinguishable Actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) demonstrated that own psychological stress was associated with higher scores on all drinking indices, and own financial stress was associated with higher coping motives and alcohol-related problems. Partner psychological and financial stress was related to own greater endorsement of coping motives, and partner financial stress was related to own greater endorsement of alcohol-related problems. In APIMs with mixed-sex couples, men's psychological and financial stress were positively related to both his own and his partner's drinks per week, high-intensity drinking, and coping motives. Men's financial stress was also positively related to his own and his partner's alcohol-related problems. Conclusions: Results provide considerable insight into couple dynamics related to pandemic stress and have direct implications for alcohol prevention and treatment efforts as we navigate this serious crisis.

431510,Primo-prescription de la PrEp et Covid : c’est non pour les généralistes,2021,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenia is commonly encountered in cancer patients. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim), a cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes, is widely given to oncology patients to counteract neutropenia, reducing susceptibility to infection. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: An observational cohort of 379 actively treated cancer patients with COVID-19 was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia and G-CSF administration on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were encoded as time-dependent predictors in an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, the degree of response to G-CSF, based on rise in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 24 hours after growth factor administration, was also incorporated into a similar Cox model. RESULTS: In the setting of active COVID-19 infection, outpatient receipt of G-CSF led to an increased number of hospitalizations (HR: 3.54, 95% CI: 1.25-10.0, P value: 0.017). Furthermore, among inpatients, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high levels of oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.19-10.2, P value: 0.024). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 7.78, 95% CI: 2.05-27.9, P value: 0.004). CONCLUSION: The potential risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be considered in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19, since G-CSF administration may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status.","Zhang, Allen W; Morjaria, Sejal; Kaltsas, Anna; Hohl, Tobias M; Parameswaran, Rekha; Patel, Dhruvkumar; Zhou, Wei; Predmore, Jacqueline; Perez-Johnston, Rocio; Jee, Justin; Daniyan, Anthony F; Perales, Miguel; Taur, Ying",Clin. infect. dis,,501
432966,Migración internacional y política migratoria en Chile: tensiones entre la soberanía estatal y las ciudadanías emergentes,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has challenged societies around the globe. Technologies based on ozone, a powerful oxidant, have been evaluated to inactivate this virus in aerosols and fomites. However, the high data diversity hinders the possibility of establishing a common ground for determining best practices for the use of these technologies. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus regarding which are the main mechanisms of ozone virus inactivation. This critical review examined the most relevant information available regarding ozone application in gas-phase for different viruses inactivation (including recent publications dealing with SARS-CoV-2), and pointed towards envelope alteration as the main reaction pathway for enveloped viruses, such as is the case of SARS-CoV-2. It could also be concluded that gaseous ozone can be indeed an effective disinfectant, successfully inactivating viruses such us influenza A H1N1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 or even SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols or fomites. In reviewed works, low ozone exposures, just around 0.1-0.4 mg L-1 min, achieve about 4 log10 of inactivation in aerosols, while exposures between 1 and 4 mg L-1 min may be needed to guarantee an inactivation of 3-4 log10 in different fomites. Although further studies are required, ozone is an effective candidate to be used against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses in surfaces and indoor locations.","Bayarri, Bernardí; Cruz-Alcalde, Alberto; López-Vinent, Núria; Micó, María M; Sans, Carme",J Hazard Mater,,501

This paper reconsiders Rosenberg's seminal essay and the central question it addresses-what is an epidemic?-from the vantage of a historian in Hong Kong working on colonial and postcolonial Asia in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper begins by setting Rosenberg's essay in its historical context and then considers whether explanatory models developed in a Northern American context may be applicable (or not) to other non-Western settings. The paper makes the case for a re-interrogation of the ""epidemic"" as an epidemiological and social category, and it concludes by suggesting that COVID-19 is challenging underlying assumptions about what a ""crisis"" is to the extent that the pandemic may be understood as a crisis of crisis itself.","Peckham, Robert",Bull Hist Med,,501

As there is no effective vaccine yet, the development of the vaccine is urgently in progress. Materials and methods: Immunoinformatics methods were applied to predict epitopes from the Spike protein through mining literature associated with B- and T-cell epitopes prediction published or preprinted since the outbreak of the virus till June 1, 2020. 3D structure of the Spike protein were obtained (PDB ID: 6VSB) for prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes and localization of epitopes in the hotspot regions. Results: Methods provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) server were the most frequently used to predict epitopes. Sequence alignment of the epitopes extracted from literature with the Spike protein demonstrated that the epitopes in different studies converged to multiple short hotspot regions. There were three hotspot regions found in RBD of the Spike protein harboring B-cell linear epitopes ('RQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD', 'SYGFQPTNGVGYQ' and 'YAWNRKRISNCVA') predicted to have high antigenicity score. Two T-cell epitopes ('KPFERDISTEIYQ' and 'NYNYLYRLFR') predicted to be highly antigenic in the original studies were discovered in the hotspot region. Toxicity and allergenicity analysis confirmed all the five epitopes are of non-toxin, and four of them are of non-allergen. The five epitopes identified in hotspot regions of RBD were found fully exposed based on the 3D structure of the Spike protein. Conclusion: The five epitopes we discovered from literature mining may be potential candidates for diagnostics and vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Wendong; Li, Lin; Sun, Ting; He, Yufei; Liu, Guang; Xiao, Zixuan; Fan, Yubo; Zhang, Jing",Med Nov Technol Devices,,501

METHODS: All patients between the ages of 0-18 years visiting the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Research and Training Hospital, Pediatric Emergency Service between April to October 2019 and April to October 2020 with no missing information in their records were involved in this retrospective cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The total number of pediatric emergency service consultations was 74,739; the number of emergency visits between April-October 2019 was 55,678, whereas it was 19,061 between April-October 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic period. There was a 67.7% decrease in consultations during the pandemic period. The mean age of participants between April-October 2019 was 8.11±5.31 years, and 52.4% of cases were male. The mean age between April-October 2020 was 8.58±5.93 years, and 51% of cases were male. COVID-19 related symptoms were higher during the pandemic period (p<0.05), with fever and gastroenteritis being the most frequently received diagnosis in both periods. During the pandemic period, the newborn consultation ratio was higher (p>0.05), there was a decrease in consultation ratios related to suicide attempts (p<0.05), and a threefold increase in death rates was observed (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In Turkey, where emergency consultation rates are quite high, these decreases look fearsome for secondary injuries that can develop in children. For this reason, families should be made aware of the importance of bringing their children to the hospital during emergencies, and that all necessary health precautions are being taken to decrease the spread of infection in hospitals.","Fidanci, Ilknur; Tasar, Medine Aysin; Akintug, Bahar; Fidanci, Izzet; Bulut, Ismail",Int J Clin Pract,,501
457065,Perception des rhumatologues marocains sur la formation médicale continue par webinaires en ce temps de pandémie COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, aggressive Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures have been adopted to prevent health care-associated transmission of COVID-19. We evaluated the impact of a multimodal IPC strategy originally designed for the containment of COVID-19 on the rates of other hospital-acquired-infections (HAIs). METHODOLOGY: From February-August 2020, a multimodal IPC strategy was implemented across a large health care campus in Singapore, comprising improved segregation of patients with respiratory symptoms, universal masking and heightened adherence to Standard Precautions. The following rates of HAI were compared pre- and postpandemic: health care-associated respiratory-viral-infection (HA-RVI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and CP-CRE acquisition rates, health care-facility-associated C difficile infections and device-associated HAIs. RESULTS: Enhanced IPC measures introduced to contain COVID-19 had the unintended positive consequence of containing HA-RVI. The cumulative incidence of HA-RVI decreased from 9.69 cases per 10,000 patient-days to 0.83 cases per 10,000 patient-days (incidence-rate-ratioâ¯=â¯0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05-0.13, P< .05). Hospital-wide MRSA acquisition rates declined significantly during the pandemic (incidence-rate-ratioâ¯=â¯0.54, 95% CIâ¯=â¯0.46-0.64, P< .05), together with central-line-associated-bloodstream infection rates (incidence-rate-ratioâ¯=â¯0.24, 95% CIâ¯=â¯0.07-0.57, P< .05); likely due to increased compliance with Standard Precautions. Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, there was no increase in CP-CRE acquisition, and rates of other HAIs remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal IPC strategies can be implemented at scale to successfully mitigate health care-associated transmission of RVIs. Good adherence to personal-protective-equipment and hand hygiene kept other HAI rates stable even during an ongoing pandemic where respiratory infections were prioritized for interventions.","Wee, Liang En Ian; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Tan, Jing Yuan; Magesparan, Kamini Devi; Amin, Ismawati Binte Mohamad; Ismail, Bushra Binte Shaik; Toh, Hui Xian; Jin, Pinhong; Zhang, Jing; Wee, Elaine Geok Ling; Ong, Sheena Jin Min; Lee, Gillian Li Xin; Wang, Amanda En-Min; How, Molly Kue Bien; Tan, Kwee Yuen; Lee, Lai Chee; Phoon, Poh Choo; Yang, Yong; Aung, May Kyawt; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Ling, Moi Lin",Am. j. infect. control,,501

As distress is assumed to be high in these times, the role of personal resources becomes more important. The current study aimed to investigate the predictive role of COVID-19-related stress, positive affect, and self-care behavior for subjective sleep quality and sleep change measures since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. A sample of 991 adults (M = 34.11 years; SD = 12.99) answered questionnaires during the first lockdown period in Germany and afterward (between April 1 and June 5, 2020). A higher stress level predicted lower sleep quality and more negative changes in overall sleep and pre-sleep arousal. Higher levels of positive affect and self-care predicted higher sleep quality and more positive changes in sleep. Analyses showed a moderation of positive affect on the association between stress and change in pre-sleep arousal. The improvement in personal resources, especially positive affect, in times of high stress seems relevant to overcome sleep problems. Future research should include objective measurements of sleep and longitudinal designs to uncover causal directions of effects.","Werner, Anika; Kater, Maren-Jo; Schlarb, Angelika A; Lohaus, Arnold",Applied psychology.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16â442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65·3 years (SD 15·7) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·87-1·07; p=0·50). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to >28] vs 11 days [5 to >28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·98-1·10; p=0·19). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, no significant difference was seen in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·87-1·03; p=0·24). INTERPRETATION: In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, azithromycin did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Azithromycin use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients in whom there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

476350,"Hypertendus, pas de risque augmenté avec IECA et ARA-2",2020,"Aim: Recently, with the second wave of COVID-19, the Indian subcontinent has witnessed a dramatic rise in mucormycosis infection in patients recovered from COVID-19. This association has been documented in various case reports/case series and institutional experiences, and the mortality associated with this fungal infection is emerging as a cause of concern. The aim of the present paper is to provide a scientific overview on the pathogenesis of mucormycosis in COVID-19 beyond the conventional understanding of the disease process, which may not otherwise explain the increased incidence of mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2. Methodology: This paper is structured as a narrative review of the published literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 which contributes to the development of mucormycosis. Apart from the acknowledged role of ketoacidosis, high blood sugar, and iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis, other factors involved in pathophysiology of COVID-19 which might alter or enhance the mucormycosis infection such as (1) the role of ferritin, (2) high serum iron, (3) free radical-induced endothelitis, (4) hepcidin activation, (5) upregulation of glucose receptor protein (GRP78) are discussed in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. Conclusion: A new proposal for the pathogenesis based on the ferritin, viral mimicry of hepcidin and GRP78-CotH3 interaction, which clearly explains the surge in mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been explained.","Jose, Anson; Singh, Shagun; Roychoudhury, Ajoy; Kholakiya, Yathin; Arya, Saurabh; Roychoudhury, Sunanda",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,501

Crowded indoor environments, such as schools, represent possible hotspots for virus transmission since the basic non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures applied so far (e.g. social distancing) do not eliminate the airborne transmission mode. There is widespread consensus that improved ventilation is needed to minimize the transmission potential of airborne viruses in schools, whether through mechanical systems or ad-hoc manual airing procedures in naturally ventilated buildings. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding exactly what ventilation rates are required, and how to best achieve these targets with limited time and resources. This paper uses a mass balance approach to quantify the ability of both mechanical ventilation and ad-hoc airing procedures to mitigate airborne transmission risk in the classroom environment. For naturally-ventilated classrooms, we propose a novel feedback control strategy using CO2 concentrations to continuously monitor and adjust the airing procedure. Our case studies show how such procedures can be applied in the real world to support the reopening of schools during the pandemic. Our results also show the inadequacy of relying on absolute CO2 concentration thresholds as the sole indicator of airborne transmission risk.","Stabile, L.; Pacitto, A.; Mikszewski, A.; Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.",Building and Environment,,501

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the published studies to assess the association of RAS inhibitors with mortality as well as disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve relevant original studies investigating mortality and severity (severe/critical disease) in COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to RAS inhibitors. RESULTS: A total of 59 original studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Twenty-four studies that reported adjusted effect sizes (24 studies reported mortality outcomes and 16 studies reported disease severity outcomes), conducted in RAS inhibitor-exposed and unexposed groups, were pooled in random-effects models to estimate overall risk. Quality assessment of studies revealed that most of the studies included were of fair quality. The use of an ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with lower odds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.95; n = 18,749) or hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; n = 26,598) of mortality compared with non-use of ACEI/ARB. However, the use of an ACEI/ARB was non-significantly associated with lower odds (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.75-1.10; n = 7446) or hazard (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.33-1.66; n = 6325) of developing severe/critical disease compared with non-use of an ACEI/ARB. DISCUSSION: Since there was no increased risk of harm, the use of RAS inhibitors for hypertension and other established clinical indications can be maintained in COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Hadi, Muhammad Abdul; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi; Merchant, Hamid A",Am. j. cardiovasc. drugs,,501

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending.

Thalassemia syndromes are the most prevalent monogenic hemoglobin disorder in world and Iran is located on thalassemia belt, so this type of hemoglobinopathy has a critical importance in our country. Materials and Methods: In this overview, the research was conducted by screening the relevant articles evaluating the COVID-19 in patients with thalassemia. An electronic search was performed in online data bases of Scopus, Sid.ir, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science and Medline (via PubMed) with English and Persian language from December 2019 up to November 2020. Results Overall, 59 articles could be originally identified, 43 of which were excluded and 16 articles have been investigated. Thalassemic patients had a higher risk for severe clinical events due to 2019 novel corona virus. Presence of comorbidities could aggravate the course of COVID-19 in these patients. In thalassemic patients, the protocol of transfusion should not be altered. Also in asymptomatic thalassemic cases, iron chelation should not be stopped but in thalassemic patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, iron chelation must be discontinued. Conclusion According to low number of reported cases of infected thalassemic patient with confirmed COVID19, there are many unanswered question in management of these vulnerable patients. In this setting treatment decision need to be individualized on a case-by-case basis.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015-2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. METHODS: Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. RESULTS: Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. CONCLUSION: Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; Buxton, Jane A; Desai, Roshni",Drug Alcohol Depend,,501

We explored whether Kawasaki-like disease (KD), when associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has specific characteristics. METHODS: We included children and adolescents with KD criteria admitted in the department of general pediatrics of a university hospital in Paris, France, between January 1, 2018, and May 26, 2020. The incidence of KD was compared between the outbreak and a pre-outbreak control period (January 1, 2018, to April 25). Characteristics of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (KD-SARS-CoV-2) were compared to those of the pre-outbreak period (classic KD). RESULTS: A total of 30 and 59 children with KD were admitted during the outbreak and pre-outbreak periods, respectively (incidence ratio 13.2 [8.3-21.0]). During the outbreak, 23/30 (77%) children were diagnosed as KD-SARS-CoV-2. When compared with patients with classic KD, those with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently of sub-Saharan African ancestry (OR 4.4 [1.6-12.6]) and older (median 8.2 vs. 4.0 years, p < 0.001), had more often initial gastrointestinal (OR 84 [4.9-1456]) and neurological (OR 7.3 [1.9-27.7] manifestations, and shock syndrome (OR 13.7 [4.2-45.1]). They had significantly higher CRP and ferritin levels. Noticeably, they had more frequently myocarditis (OR 387 [38-3933]).

During oral surgery, the risk of viral transmission is high during instrumentation in these areas, while performing airway management procedures, the oral surgery itself, and related procedures. During the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with an oral pathology usually present for emergency procedures. However, patients with oral cancer, being a semi-emergency, may also present for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When elective surgeries are resumed, these patients will come to the operating room. In asymptomatic patients, the false-negative rate can be as high as 30%. These patients are a source of infection to the healthcare workers and other patients. This mandates universal precautions to be taken for all patients presenting for surgery. Lesions along the airway, distorted anatomy secondary to cancer therapy, shared airway with the surgeon, surgical handling of the airway and the risk of bleeding, make airway management challenging in these patients, especially while wearing personal protective equipment. Airway management procedures, oral surgery, use of cautery, and other powered surgical instruments in the aero digestive tract, along with constant suctioning are a source of significant aerosol generation, further adding to the risk of viral transmission. Maintaining patient safety, while protecting the healthcare workers from getting infected during oral surgery is paramount. Meticulous advance planning and team preparation are essential.

Patients with potentially curable cancers are at risk of not receiving timely SOC multidisciplinary treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combination treatments. Hospital resources are in such high demand for COVID-19 patients that procedures, such as surgery, dentistry, interventional radiology, and other ancillary services, are not available for cancer patients. Our tertiary care center is considered the center of the epicenter in the USA. As a result, all non-emergent surgeries have been suspended in order to provide hospital beds and other resources for COVID-19 patients. Additionally, ambulatory efforts to avoid treatment-related morbidity are critical for keeping patients out of emergency departments and hospitals.

Epidemiological triangle chain models can be used to present both these types of epidemic. By merging these two triangles we suggest a new four-sided pyramidal model of bioterrorism attack and appropriate levels of prevention. Primordial prevention of biological attacks should comprise the impeding of access of both terrorists and biological agents to the territory. The primary prevention level should comprise internal surveillance of potential sources of agents and terrorists. Secondary prevention activities should be directed toward breaking both the epidemic of infectious disease and that of fear and panic. Tertiary prevention should include measures for repair following the attack. This is a task mainly for mental health professionals, curing and rehabilitating those affected by the epidemic of fear and panic. The suggested epidemiological model can be implemented into training programmes for detecting and responding to bioterrorist attacks around the world.","Radosavljević, V.; Jakovljević, B.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350607000133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481679/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350607000133,501

We present here a novel approach for the selection of immunoprevalent SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes using an in silico cohort of HLA-genotyped individuals with different ethnicities. Nine 30-mer peptides derived from the four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were selected and included in a peptide vaccine candidate to recapitulate the broad virus-specific T cell responses observed in natural infection. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were detected in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents' blood against on average seven different vaccine peptides. Furthermore, convalescents' complete HLA-genotype predicted their T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides with 84% accuracy. Computational extrapolation of this relationship to a cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination will likely elicit multi-antigenic T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 administered with Montanide ISA 51 VG generated robust, Th1-biased CD8(+), and CD4(+) T cell responses against all represented proteins, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and hCD34(+) transgenic mice modeling human immune system. These results have implications for the development of global, highly immunogenic, T cell-focused vaccines against various pathogens and diseases.","Somogyi, Eszter; Csiszovszki, Zsolt; Molnár, Levente; Lőrincz, Orsolya; Tóth, József; Pattijn, Sofie; Schockaert, Jana; Mazy, Aurélie; Miklós, István; Pántya, Katalin; Páles, Péter; Tőke, Enikő R.",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249101/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.684152,501

Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for disease control. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification assay similar to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the former being a simple, low cost, and rapid method. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the RT-LAMP assay with RT-PCR using the Loopamp(TM) SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-one nasopharyngeal swab and 88 sputum samples obtained from individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: RT-LAMP had high specificity (98.5% (95% CI: 96.9–100%)), sensitivity (87.0% (95% CI: 82.8–91.3%)), positive predictive value (97.9% (95% CI: 96.1–99.7%)), negative predictive value (90.2% (95% CI: 86.4–94.0%)), and concordance rate (93.3% (95% CI: 90.1–96.5%)). Nasopharyngeal and sputum samples positive in RT-LAMP contained as few as 10.2 and 23.4 copies per 10 μL, respectively. RT-LAMP showed similar performance to RT-PCR for samples with cycle threshold value below 36. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that RT-LAMP is a highly reliable and at least equivalent to RT-PCR in utility, and potentially applicable in settings that are more diverse as a point-of-care tool.","Kitajima, Heita; Tamura, Yoshitaka; Yoshida, Hiroko; Kinoshita, Hitomi; Katsuta, Hiroki; Matsui, Chika; Matsushita, Akane; Arai, Tsuyoshi; Hashimoto, Shoji; Iuchi, Atsuhiko; Hirashima, Tomonori; Morishita, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Hiroto; Tanaka, Toshio; Nagai, Takayuki",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848785/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221000809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221000809?v=s5,501

International guidelines recommend systematic TB screening at health facilities, but implementation is challenging. We investigated completion of recommended TB screening steps in Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS: A prospective cohort recruited adult outpatients attending Bangwe primary clinic. Entry interviews were linked to exit interviews. The proportion of participants progressing through each step of the diagnostic pathway were estimated. Factors associated with request for sputum were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 5442 clinic attendances 2397 (44%) had exit interviews. In clinically indicated participants (n = 445) 256 (57.5%) were asked about cough, 36 (8.1%) were asked for sputum, 21 (4.7%) gave sputum and 1 (0.2%) received same-day results. Significant associations with request for sputum were: any TB symptom (aOR:3.20, 95%CI:2.02–5.06), increasing age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.01–1.04 per year) and for HIV-negative participants only, a history of previous TB (aOR:3.37, 95%CI:1.45–7.81). Numbers requiring sputum tests (26/day) outnumbered diagnostic capacity (8–12/day). CONCLUSIONS: Patients were lost at every stage of the TB care cascade, with same day sputum submission following all steps of the diagnosis cascade achieved in only 4.7% if clinically indicated. Infection control strategies should be implemented, with reporting on early steps of the TB care cascade formalised. High-throughput screening interventions, such as digital CXR, that can achieve same-day TB diagnosis are urgently needed to meet WHO End TB goals.

603051,Professions de santé et Covid : quid des secrétaires médicaux ?,2020-06-30,"Infecting large portions of the global poultry populations, the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major economic burden in North America. With more than 30 serotypes globally distributed, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, and Massachusetts are among the most predominant serotypes in the United States. Even though vaccination is widely used, the high mutation rate exhibited by IBV is continuously triggering the emergence of new viral strains and hindering control and prevention measures. For that reason, targeted strategies based on constantly updated information on the IBV circulation are necessary. Here, we sampled IBV-infected farms from one US state and collected and analyzed 65 genetic sequences coming from three different lineages along with the immunization information of each sampled farm. Phylodynamic analyses showed that IBV dispersal velocity was 12.3 km/year. The majority of IBV infections appeared to have derived from the introduction of the Arkansas DPI serotype, and the Arkansas DPI and Georgia 13 were the predominant serotypes. When analyzed against IBV sequences collected across the United States and deposited in the GenBank database, the most likely viral origin of our sequences was from the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Delaware. Information about vaccination showed that the MILDVAC-MASS+ARK vaccine was applied on 26% of the farms. Using a publicly accessible open-source tool for real-time interactive tracking of pathogen spread and evolution, we analyzed the spatiotemporal spread of IBV and developed an online reporting dashboard. Overall, our work demonstrates how the combination of genetic and spatial information could be used to track the spread and evolution of poultry diseases, providing timely information to the industry. Our results could allow producers and veterinarians to monitor in near-real time the current IBV strain circulating, making it more informative, for example, in vaccination-related decisions.","Jara, Manuel; Crespo, Rocio; Roberts, David L.; Chapman, Ashlyn; Banda, Alejandro; Machado, Gustavo",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017870/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.624233,501

Our findings show that gender and types of telework by workplace and ICT-use intensity are crucial factors affecting working conditions and job quality. Occasional teleworkers are the group with the best job quality, while highly mobile teleworkers are those with the worst job quality and work–life balance. Home-based teleworkers, especially women, present better results than highly mobile workers in terms of working time quality and intensity, though in exchange for lower skills and discretion, income, and career prospects.

This study aims to describe patients’ lived experiences, challenges faced by people with chronic conditions, their coping strategies, and the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a qualitative study using a syndemic framework to understand the patients’ experiences of chronic disease care, challenges faced during the lockdown, their coping strategies and mitigators during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of socioecological and biological factors. A diverse sample of 41 participants with chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases) from four sites (Delhi, Haryana, Vizag and Chennai) in India participated in semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, anonymised and coded using MAXQDA software. We used the framework method to qualitatively analyse the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on health, social and economic well-being. RESULTS: Participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were categorised into four themes: challenges faced during the lockdown, experiences of the participants diagnosed with COVID-19, preventive measures taken and lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A subgroup of participants faced difficulties in accessing healthcare while a few reported using teleconsultations. Most participants reported adverse economic impact of the pandemic which led to higher reporting of anxiety and stress. Participants who tested COVID-19 positive reported experiencing discrimination and stigma from neighbours. All participants reported taking essential preventive measures. CONCLUSION: People with chronic conditions experienced a confluence (reciprocal effect) of COVID-19 pandemic and chronic diseases in the context of difficulty in accessing healthcare, sedentary lifestyle and increased stress and anxiety.

Accordingly, there have been calls for more evidence on the determinants of resilience. We answer this call by identifying financial and non-financial resources associated with psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using longitudinal survey data, psychological resilience is measured by comparing distress reported pre-COVID-19 with distress reported during the outbreak and initial lockdown in April 2020. Methodologically, we compare differences in resilience and resources between people with identical gender, ethnicity, health, parenthood status, education, employment status, and region of residence (all measured pre-2020). We also provide estimates from within-household comparisons. Surprisingly, income, savings, and debt levels did not affect the likelihood of psychologically resilient outcomes. Cognitive ability, religiosity, and neighborhood social capital also had no protective effect. In contrast, we find robust evidence that non-cognitive skills, measured by self-efficacy, strongly protected against psychological distress. Self-efficacy also dampened the increase in distress caused by large earnings shocks.

We assessed family disruption and family functioning with measures of key family‐level and parenting dimensions, including family cohesion, conflict and routines, and parents’ harsh discipline, lax discipline and warmth. In all models, pre‐pandemic parent emotional distress, financial strain and child maladjustment were included as covariates. METHODS: The sample included 204 families, comprised of parents who had children (M (Age) = 4.17; 45.1% girls). Parents (M (Age) = 27.43) completed the first survey prior to COVID‐19 onset in the United States, a second survey after COVID‐19 onset in May 2020 and a third survey two weeks later. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted in a model‐building fashion, first computing structural equation models for each family and parenting dimension separately, then advancing significant dimensions into one integrated model for the family‐level factors and a second model for parenting quality factors. Results provided more support for the family disruption hypothesis across all tests. In the family‐level domain, decreases in family cohesion and increases in family conflict each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. In the parenting domain, increases in harsh discipline and lax discipline each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. Family routines and parental warmth were not associated with child adjustment. However, parents’ emotional distress prior to the pandemic exhibited a robust association with children’s internalizing problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that efforts to support families in adapting to unique conditions of the pandemic will yield the greatest effect for child adjustment. Specifically, interventions should include efforts to help families maintain cohesion and manage conflict, and help parents minimize increases in harsh and lax discipline.","Fosco, Gregory M.; Sloan, Carlie J.; Fang, Shichen; Feinberg, Mark E.",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101185/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13458,501

Studies assessed the virucidal efficacy of CHX against Herpes Simplex Type-1 (HSV-1) (10 studies), Influenza A (InfluA) (4 studies), human coronavirus (HCoV) (4 studies) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (11 studies). Most studies demonstrated that CHX has a positive virucidal efficacy against HSV-1 and InfluA strains. However, lower efficacy was shown to InfluA strain in comparison to povidone-iodine. Lower to none virucidal efficacy of CHX is expected for HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains for in vitro studies. Three RCT demonstrated that CHX was able to significantly reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 for a short period. CHX may present an interesting virucidal efficacy against HSV-1 and InfluA viruses. CHX also presents transient efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when used as a mouthwash.","Fernandez, Matheus dos Santos; Guedes, Maria Izabel Florindo; Langa, Gerson Pedro José; Rösing, Cassiano Kuchenbecker; Cavagni, Juliano; Muniz, Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes",Odontology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637092/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10266-021-00660-x,501

In some cases, treating SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant with other diseases can be particularly challenging, as finding an appropriate treatment may involve some risks. Case presentation: A 34-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient admitted due to fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pneumonia, developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. Due to his severe state, abnormalities in laboratory tests and rapidly progressing loss of kidney function, kidney biopsy, as well as antibody panel were carried out, in which perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were found with a high titer (>200; N: <1:20). The results of kidney biopsy, combined with clinical manifestation and laboratory findings prompted the diagnosis of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the course of p-ANCA vasculitis. Initial treatment consisted of heamodialyses, remdesivir, plasmaphereses, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics, corticosteroids and fraxiparine. Once the haemorrhage had subsided, kidney function had been partially retrieved and heamodialyses had no longer been necessary, cyclophosphamide treatment was initiated, despite being contraindicated in COVID-19 according to its summary of product characteristics. Immunotherapy is still continued. The patient has already received a total of 2.4g of cyclophosphamide (4 cycles of 600mg each every three weeks). Pulmonary and radiological regression, as well as improvement of renal parameters have been achieved. Conclusions: We suspect that cyclophosphamide, the drug of choice in p-ANCA vasculitis, could be a potential factor providing regression of the radiological changes in the lungs and it could have prevented the patient from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 diagnosis should not exclude searching for other diseases which can have a similar course. When treating a patient in a life-threatening condition, a departure from trying to find the perfect timing of cyclophosphamide delivery should be considered, as delaying it could cause potentially greater harm.","Bołtuć, Kamila; Bielejewska, Ada; Coloma-Millar, Alejandro; Dziugieł, Robert; Bociek, Arkadiusz; Perkowska-Ptasińska, Agnieszka; Jaroszyński, Andrzej",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646504/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.55625.1,501

They will get increasingly humanlike and lifelike. This paper addresses the conceptual question: Even if robots can assist and ease people’s suffering, can such machines provide humanistic care? Arguably, humanistic care is the most humanly distinctive and deepest form of care there is. As such, it may be thought to show most starkly the gulf between human and robot caregiving. The paper argues that humanistic caregiving is indeed a distinctive form of ‘affective’ care dependent on certain uniquely human characteristics or aspects of our humanity which can provide a profound kind of comfort to suffering people. It then argues that there is an important conceptual sense in which robots cannot provide humanistic care. Nonetheless, the paper subsequently suggests that we may recognize a useful sense in which robots, of a suitably anthropomorphic type, can provide humanistic care. Robots might ‘express’ to people with physical, social, or emotional needs the kind of humanistic care that only human beings can provide but that sufferers can nonetheless receive comfort from precisely because of what is expressed to them. Although this sense of humanistic robot care is derivative from uniquely human care, and although it is wide open to social and ethical criticism, it is nonetheless an idea worth clarifying for anyone interested in the possibilities and limits of robot care.","Coghlan, Simon",Int J Soc Robot,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00804-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221183/,501

Although the spreading rate of COVID-19 is very high on October 6, 2020, the death rate is still less than 2.94%. Nonetheless, this review article shows that the lockdown has induced numerous positive impacts on the environment and on energy consumption. For instance, the lockdown has decreased the electricity demand by 30% in Italy, India, Germany, and the USA, and by 12–20% in France, Germany, Spain, India, and the UK. Additionally, the expenditure of the fuel supply has been decreased by 4% in 2020 as compared to the previous years (2012–2019). In particular, The global demand for coal fuel has been reduced by 8% in March and April 2020 as compared to the same time in 2019. In terms of harmful emissions, the lockdowns reduced the emissions of nitrous oxides by 20–30% in China, Italy, France, Spain, and by 77.3% in São Paulo, Brazil. Similarly, the particulate matter level has been reduced from 5–15% in Western Europe, to 200% in New Delhi, India, which in turn has enhanced the air quality in a never-seen manner in recent times. In some places, such as New York, USA, CO(2) emission was also reduced by 5–10%. The water quality, in several polluted areas, has also been remarkably enhanced, for example, the dissolved oxygen content in the Ganga River, India, has increased by about 80%. Traffic congestion has also been reduced worldwide, and in some areas, it has been reduced by 50%, such as New York and Los Angeles, USA. Overall, while the COVID-19 pandemic has shrinked the global economy by 13–32%, the pandemic has also clearly benefited to other sectors, which must be considered as the spotlight for the permanent revival of the global ecosystem.","Mousazadeh, Milad; Paital, Biswaranjan; Naghdali, Zohreh; Mortezania, Zohreh; Hashemi, Marjan; Karamati Niaragh, Elnaz; Aghababaei, Mohammad; Ghorbankhani, Melika; Lichtfouse, Eric; Sillanpää, Mika; Hashim, Khalid S.; Emamjomeh, Mohammad Mahdi",Environ Dev Sustain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558801/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01240-3,501

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 patients without PE and non-COVID-19 patients with PE were included as control groups. Adjusted comparisons for baseline characteristics, acute episode characteristics, and outcomes were made between cases and randomly selected controls (1:1 ratio). We identified 368 PE in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs (4.92‰). The standardized incidence of PE in the COVID-19 population resulted in 310 per 100 000 person-years, significantly higher than that observed in the non-COVID-19 population [35 per 100 000 person-years; odds ratio (OR) 8.95 for PE in the COVID-19 population, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.51–9.41]. Several characteristics in COVID-19 patients were independently associated with PE, the strongest being D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, and chest pain (direct association) and chronic heart failure (inverse association). COVID-19 patients with PE differed from non-COVID-19 patients with PE in 16 characteristics, most directly related to COVID-19 infection; remarkably, D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, leg swelling/pain, and PE risk factors were significantly less present. PE in COVID-19 patients affected smaller pulmonary arteries than in non-COVID-19 patients, although right ventricular dysfunction was similar in both groups. In-hospital mortality in cases (16.0%) was similar to COVID-19 patients without PE (16.6%; OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65–1.42; and 11.4% in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with PE ruled out by scanner, OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97–2.27), but higher than in non-COVID-19 patients with PE (6.5%; OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66–4.51). Adjustment for differences in baseline and acute episode characteristics and sensitivity analysis reported very similar associations. CONCLUSIONS: PE in COVID-19 patients at ED presentation is unusual (about 0.5%), but incidence is approximately ninefold higher than in the general (non-COVID-19) population. Moreover, risk factors and leg symptoms are less frequent, D-dimer increase is lower and emboli involve smaller pulmonary arteries. While PE probably does not increase the mortality of COVID-19 patients, mortality is higher in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients with PE.","Miró, Òscar; Jiménez, Sònia; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Freund, Yonathan; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Lamberechts, Eric Jorge; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Jacob, Javier; Llorens, Pere; Piñera, Pascual; Gil, Víctor; Guardiola, Josep; Cardozo, Carlos; Mòdol Deltell, Josep Maria; Tost, Josep; Aguirre Tejedo, Alfons; Palau-Vendrell, Anna; LLauger García, Lluís; Adroher Muñoz, Maria; del Arco Galán, Carmen; Agudo Villa, Teresa; López-Laguna, Nieves; López Díez, María Pilar; Beddar Chaib, Fahd; Quero Motto, Eva; González Tejera, Matilde; Ponce, María Carmen; González del Castillo, Juan",Eur Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164664/,501

As the situation with COVID-19 has evolved, wearing a face mask in public has grown commonplace. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a foundation, this study introduces three new variables, namely, perceived risk, social pressure, and social image, to establish an extended model for investigating the factors that influence if residents wear masks. A total of 1200 questionnaires were distributed in China, from 1 February to 30 May 2020, through China’s largest online platform. The results indicate the following: 1. Residents’ positive attitude towards mask wearing promotes their behavioral intention to wear masks. 2. Perceived risk, social pressure, and social image have a positive impact on attitude towards mask wearing. 3. The intention to wear masks and attitude were both positively influenced by perceived usefulness. 4. The perceived usefulness is more influential in rural than urban groups, in terms of behavioral intention. This article proposes that public education on the facts related to the coronavirus, the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to health, and the usefulness of face masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 could increase residents’ intention to wear a mask.","Zhang, Bo; Li, Zhongjie; Jiang, Lei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639290/,501
647390,La médecine par l’épreuve1,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND COVIID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic. However, many vulnerable individuals such as illiterate or low-literate, older adults, and rural populations have limited access to health information. In this context, these individuals are more likely to have poor knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices related to COVID-19. The current study was aimed to investigate COVID-19's awareness of the illiterate population of Pakistanis. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted among illiterate Pakistanis having age ≥ 18 years through a convenient sampling approach. The study participants were interviewed, face to face, by respecting the defined precautionary measures. All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22. RESULTS The mean age of the study participants' (N = 394) was 37.2±9.60 years, with the majority of males (80.7%). All participants were aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and television news channels (75.1%) were the primary source of information. The mean knowledge score was 5.33±1.88. About 27% of participants had good knowledge score (score ≥ 7) followed by moderate (score 4-6) and poor (score ≤ 3) knowledge in 41.6%, and 31.5% respondents, respectively. The attitude score was 4.42±1.22 with good (score ≥ 6), average (score 4-5), and poor attitude (score ≤ 3) in 19%, 66%, and 15% participants, respectively.

In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID-19-related information, including federal, state and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e., food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19-related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health-related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.","Weinberger-Litman, Sarah L.; Litman, Leib; Rosen, Zohn; Rosmarin, David H.; Rosenzweig, Cheskie",J Relig Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32651728/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01064-x,501

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global threat of increasing concern to human and animal health. It also has implications for both food safety and food security and the economic well-being of millions of humans. Among other zoonotic infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance in food chain and livestock-associated pathogens such as Salmonella is of great concern. In the present study, the genomic characterization of antimicrobial resistance in food chain and livestock-associated Salmonella was summarized. Several antimicrobial resistance determinants were reported in Salmonella isolated from food chain animals and livestock. Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella in livestock and food chain animals through genomic characterization is significant to control and protect humans from the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Salmonella, a foodborne zoonotic enterobacterium species can transmit antimicrobial resistance from the microbiome of animals to humans. This study summarizes the genomic characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella species with special focus on resistance against carbapenems and colistin which are the last resort antibiotics used against infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. The present review aims to draw attention to prudent use of antibiotics, a good example of the One Health concept. ABSTRACT: The rising trend of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by foodborne bacteria is a public health concern as these pathogens are easily transmitted to humans through the food chain. Non-typhoid Salmonella spp. is one of the leading foodborne pathogens which infect humans worldwide and is associated with food and livestock. Due to the lack of discovery of new antibiotics and the pressure exerted by antimicrobial resistance in the pharmaceutical industry, this review aimed to address the issue of antibiotic use in livestock which leads to AMR in Salmonella. Much attention was given to resistance to carbapenems and colistin which are the last-line antibiotics used in cases of multi drug resistant bacterial infections. In the present review, we highlighted data published on antimicrobial resistant Salmonella species and serovars associated with livestock and food chain animals. The importance of genomic characterization of carbapenem and colistin resistant Salmonella in determining the relationship between human clinical isolates and food animal isolates was also discussed in this review. Plasmids, transposons, and insertion sequence elements mediate dissemination of not only AMR genes but also genes for resistance to heavy metals and disinfectants, thus limiting the therapeutic options for treatment and control of Salmonella. Genes for resistance to colistin (mcr-1 to mcr-9) and carbapenem (blaVIM-1, blaDNM-1, and blaNDM-5) have been detected from poultry, pig, and human Salmonella isolates, indicating food animal-associated AMR which is a threat to human public health. Genotyping, plasmid characterization, and phylogenetic analysis is important in understanding the epidemiology of livestock-related Salmonella so that measures of preventing foodborne threats to humans can be improved.","Mthembu, Thobeka P.; Zishiri, Oliver T.; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803844/,501

These methods visualize airflow by visualizing density gradients in transparent media. The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers, were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high and a single low note as well as an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was still quantifiable. The results presented in this article show there is no airflow escaping from the instruments, which is transported farther than 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air. The findings discussed below help to estimate the risk of cross-infection for wind instrument players and singers and to develop efficacious safety precautions, which is essential during critical health periods such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Becher, L.; Gena, A.

The early detection, diagnosis, reporting, isolation, and clinical management of patients during a public health emergency required the extensive involvement of hospitals in all aspects. The response capacity of hospitals directly determined the outcomes of the prevention and control of an outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all nations and territories regardless of their development level or geographic location, although suitable risk mitigation measures differ between developing and developed countries. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the consequences of the pandemic could be more complicated because incidence and mortality might be associated more with a fragile health care system and shortage of related resources.2, 3 As evidenced by the situation in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, South Africa, and other LMICs, socioeconomic status (SES) disparity was a major factor in the spread of disease, potentially leading to alarmingly insufficient preparedness and responses in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.(4) Conversely, the pandemic might also bring more unpredictable socioeconomic and long-term impacts in LMICs, and those with lower SES fare worse in these situations.

Clinical data suggest that famotidine may mitigate COVID-19 disease, but both mechanism of action and rationale for dose selection remain obscure. We explore several plausible avenues of activity including antiviral and host-mediated actions. We propose that the principal famotidine mechanism of action for COVID-19 involves on-target histamine receptor H (2) activity, and that development of clinical COVID-19 involves dysfunctional mast cell activation and histamine release.","Malone, Robert W.; Tisdall, Philip; Fremont-Smith, Philip; Liu, Yongfeng; Huang, Xi-Ping; White, Kris M.; Miorin, Lisa; Olmo, Elena Moreno Del; Alon, Assaf; Delaforge, Elise; Hennecker, Christopher D.; Wang, Guanyu; Pottel, Joshua; Bona, Robert; Smith, Nora; Hall, Julie M.; Shapiro, Gideon; Clark, Howard; Mittermaier, Anthony; Kruse, Andrew C.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Roth, Bryan L.; Glasspool-Malone, Jill; Francone, Victor; Hertzog, Norbert; Fremont-Smith, Maurice; Ricke, Darrell O.",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-30934/v2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702719/,501

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","Mesquita, Dinis; Carmo, Pedro; Cabanelas, Nuno; Santos, Nuno; Martins, Vítor; Sanfins, Victor; Costa, Helena Cristina; Fontes, José Paulo; Fonseca, Paulo; Parreira, Leonor",Rev Port Cardiol (Engl Ed),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392900/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2174204921002166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.repce.2020.11.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2174204921002166,501

The aim was “to ascertain the characteristics of patients, uncertainty over diagnosis, or features of the emergency response to the pandemic that could be modified to mitigate against future excess deaths”. METHODS: Review of the entire pathway of care of patients whose death was registered in Salford during the 8 week period of the first wave (primary care, secondary care, 111 and 999 calls) in order to create a single record of healthcare prior to death. An expert panel judged avoidability of death against the National Mortality Case Record Review Programme scale. The panel identified themes using a structured judgement review format. RESULTS: There were 522 deaths including 197 in hospital, and 190 in care homes. 51% of patients were female, 81% Caucasian, age 79 ± 9 years. Dementia was present in 35%, COVID-19 was cause of death in 44%. Healthcare contact prior to death was most frequently with primary care (81% of patients). Forty-six patients (9%) had healthcare appointments cancelled (median 1 cancellation, range 1–9). Fewer than half of NHS 111 calls were answered during this period. 18% of deaths contained themes consistent with some degree of avoidability. In people aged ≥75 years who lived at home this was 53%, in care home residents 29% and in patients with learning disability 44% (n = 9). Common themes were; delays in patients presenting to care providers (10%), delays in testing (17%), avoidable exposure to COVID-19 (26%), delays in provider response (5%), and sub-optimal care (11%). For avoidability scores of 2 or 3 (indicating more than 50% chance of avoidability), 44% of cases had > 2 themes. CONCLUSIONS: The initial emergency response had unforeseen consequences resulting in late presentation, sub-optimal assessments, and delays in receiving care. Death in more vulnerable groups was more likely to display avoidability themes.

Therefore, it behaves creating several space-time manifestations of its dynamics. However, these physical manifestations in nature have not yet been fully disclosed or understood. Here we show 4-3 and 2-D space-time patterns of rate of infected individuals on a global scale, giving quantitative measures of transitions between different dynamical behaviour. By slicing the spatio-temporal patterns, we found manifestations of the virus behaviour such as cluster formation and bifurcations. Furthermore, by analysing the morphogenesis processes by entropy, we have been able to detect the virus phase transitions, typical of adaptive biological systems3. Our results for the first time describe the virus patterning behaviour processes all over the world, giving for them quantitative measures. We know that the outcomes of this work are still partial and more advanced analyses of the virus behaviour in nature are necessary. However, we think that the set of methods implemented can provide significant advantages to better analyse the viral behaviour in the approach of system biology4, thus expanding knowledge and improving pandemic problem solving.","Bertacchini, Francesca; Bilotta, Eleonora; Pantano, Pietro Salvatore",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428384,501

A growing body of evidence points to the important role of overwhelming inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of anti-inflammation therapy against COVID-19 is emerging. In addition to affecting the lungs, COVID-19 can be a severe systemic inflammatory disease that is related to endothelial dysfunction. We are calling for closer attention to endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 not only for fully revealing the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 but also for properly adjusting the strategy of clinical intervention.","Hang, Weijian; Chen, Chen; Zhang, Xin A.; Wang, Dao Wen",Front Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-021-0831-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748924/,501

In this study, we found that PEDV infected not only the small intestines, but also the respiratory tract. Infection and replication of PEDV in the respiratory tract from naturally PEDV-infected piglets were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and virus re-isolation. Our observations were confirmed by experimental inoculation, and we found that PEDV infection in the respiratory tract was specifically associated with alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was able to replicate in both primary alveolar macrophages and continuous porcine alveolar macrophage cells. Sequencing analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that mutations in S might be a potential determinant of auxiliary targets for PEDV. The discovery that PEDV infects and replicates in alveolar macrophages provides new insights into its pathogenesis.","Park, Jung-Eun; Shin, Hyun-Jin",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003281; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116392/,501

We conducted the first investigation to use the genome wide association (GWA) approach to identify putative risk variants for ALI. Genome wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Quad 610 BeadChip. We performed a two-stage GWA study followed by a third stage of functional characterization. In the discovery phase (Phase 1), we compared 600 European American trauma-associated ALI cases with 2266 European American population-based controls. We carried forward the top 1% of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at p<0.01 to a replication phase (Phase 2) comprised of a nested case-control design sample of 212 trauma-associated ALI cases and 283 at-risk trauma non-ALI controls from ongoing cohort studies. SNPs that replicated at the 0.05 level in Phase 2 were subject to functional validation (Phase 3) using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses in stimulated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) in family trios. 159 SNPs from the discovery phase replicated in Phase 2, including loci with prior evidence for a role in ALI pathogenesis. Functional evaluation of these replicated SNPs revealed rs471931 on 11q13.3 to exert a cis-regulatory effect on mRNA expression in the PPFIA1 gene (p = 0.0021). PPFIA1 encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell-matrix interactions. This study supports the feasibility of future multi-center GWA investigations of ALI risk, and identifies PPFIA1 as a potential functional candidate ALI risk gene for future research.","Christie, Jason D.; Wurfel, Mark M.; Feng, Rui; O'Keefe, Grant E.; Bradfield, Jonathan; Ware, Lorraine B.; Christiani, David C.; Calfee, Carolyn S.; Cohen, Mitchell J.; Matthay, Michael; Meyer, Nuala J.; Kim, Cecilia; Li, Mingyao; Akey, Joshua; Barnes, Kathleen C.; Sevransky, Jonathan; Lanken, Paul N.; May, Addison K.; Aplenc, Richard; Maloney, James P.; Hakonarson, Hakon",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22295056/,501
