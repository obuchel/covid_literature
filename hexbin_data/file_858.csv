While it has a relatively low terrorist risk, events globally have wide-ranging repercussions putting first responders and emergency health workers at risk. Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) is rapidly emerging as a sub-specialty needed to address these threats on the front line. This study aims to provide the epidemiological context for the past decade, detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter, and to develop training programs utilizing these data. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in Australia from the years 2009-2019. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the following terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD. Ambiguous events were excluded when there was uncertainty as to whether the incident met all of the criteria for inclusion as a GTD terrorist incident. The grey literature was reviewed, and each event was cross-matched with reputable international and national newspaper sources online to confirm or add details regarding weapon type used, and whenever available, details of victim and perpetrator fatalities and injuries. RESULTS Thirty-seven terrorist events occurred in the study time period. Of the thirty-seven incidents, twenty-six (70.2%) involved incendiary weapons, five (13.5%) involved firearms, four (10.8%) involved melee (bladed weapon/knife) attacks, two (5.4%) were explosive/bombing/dynamite attacks, and one (2.7%) was a mixed attack using both incendiary and melee weapons. All except one firearms-related incident (four out of five) resulted in either a fatality or injury or both. Every melee incident resulted in either a fatality or injury or both. CONCLUSIONS In the decade from 2009 to 2019, terrorist attacks on Australian soil have been manageable, small-scale incidents with well-understood modalities. Eleven fatalities and fourteen injuries were sustained as a result of terrorist events during that period. Incendiary weapons were the most commonly chosen methodology, followed by firearms, bladed weapons, and explosive/bombings/dynamite attacks.","Tin, Derrick; Hart, Alexander; Hertelendy, Attila J; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,858,17

Sequence analysis revealed a retinoblastoma protein-binding motif (LXCXE/D) in the majority of the Nsp15 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its orthologs in the alpha and beta coronaviruses. The endoribonuclease activity of the SARS-CoV Nsp15 (sNsp15) was stimulated by retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in vitro, and the two proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated from cellular extracts. Mutations in the pRb-binding motif rendered sNsp15 to be differentially modified by ubiquitin in cells, and cytotoxicity was observed upon its expression. Expression of the sNsp15 in cells resulted in an increased abundance of pRb in the cytoplasm, decreased overall levels of pRb, an increased proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, and an enhanced expression from a promoter normally repressed by pRb. The endoribonuclease activity of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 Nsp15 was also increased by pRb in vitro, and an MHV with mutations in the LXCXE/D-motif, named vLC, exhibited a smaller plaque diameter and reduced the virus titer by ∼1 log. Overexpression of pRb delayed the viral protein production by wild-type MHV but not by vLC. This study reveals that pRb and its interaction with Nsp15 can affect coronavirus infection and adds coronaviruses to a small but growing family of RNA viruses that encode a protein to interact with pRb.","Bhardwaj, Kanchan; Liu, Pinghua; Leibowitz, Julian L; Kao, C Cheng",Journal of virology,858,27

In order to develop new insights on the immune-based treatments against this disease, it is vital to understand the immunopathology of the COVID-19, implications of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2. There is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. It is, thus, promising to design immune-based treatments that inhibit the infectious mechanism of the virus, improve the inadequate immune response, or regulate the hyperactivated immune response in severely ill patients. According to the antiviral immune response against the virus, antibody-based immunotherapies of COVID-19 include injection of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies.

Methods and Results In a single-center parallel group, open label, randomized controlled trial, 110 participants were randomized to receive either TIC (n=55) or TIC+ASP (n=55) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the platelet aggregation response with 10 μmol/L thrombin receptor activation peptide-6 (TRAP-6). The secondary outcomes were platelet aggregation responses and binding of surface activation markers with a panel of other activators. The mean percentage aggregation for 10 μmol/L TRAP-6 was similar for the TIC and TIC+ASP groups (mean difference+4.29; 95% CI, -0.87 to +9.46). Aggregation was higher in the TIC group compared with the TIC+ASP group with 1 μg/mL (+6.47; +2.04 to +10.90) and 0.5 μg/mL (+14.00; +7.63 to +20.39) collagen related peptide. Aggregation responses with 5 μmol/L TRAP-6, 5 μmol/L or 2.5 μmol/L thromboxane A2 receptor agonist and surface activation marker binding with 5 μmol/L TRAP-6 or 0.5 μg/mL collagen related peptide were the same between the treatment groups. Conclusions Patients with PCI show similar levels of inhibition of most platelet activation pathways with TIC compared with dual therapy with TIC + ASP. However, the greater aggregation response with collagen related peptide during TIC indicates incomplete inhibition of glycoprotein VI (collagen) receptor-mediated platelet activation. This difference in pharmacodynamic response to anti-platelet medication may contribute to the lower bleeding rates observed with TIC compared with dual antiplatelet therapy in recent clinical trials.

This role can stipulate a groundwork for further investigation of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could propose targets for specific intervention. In addition, we delineated current treatments for thrombosis and the potential therapies by using agents to block the terminal complement pathway.

RECENT FINDINGS There is growing evidence that right ventricular function is a key determinant in survival in cardiac surgery, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of this condition is helped by the use of specific hemodynamic parameters and echocardiography. In that regard, international consensus guidelines on the echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function have been recently published. New monitoring modalities in cardiac surgery such as regional near-infrared spectroscopy can also assist management. Management of right ventricular failure will be influenced by the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction. The differential diagnosis and management will be facilitated using a systematic approach. SUMMARY The use of right ventricular pressure monitoring and the publications of guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular anatomy and function allow the early identification of right ventricular failure. The treatment success will be associated by optimization of the hemodynamic, echocardiographic and near-infrared spectroscopy parameters.","Denault, André Yvan; Haddad, Francois; Jacobsohn, Eric; Deschamps, Alain",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,858,12

Design/methodology/approach: Horizon scanning was used to conduct a qualitative policy analysis of key regulatory developments in international anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFTP) and tax governance, from the perspective of Commonwealth Caribbean countries. Findings: This paper finds that the COVID-19 pandemic might widen several fault lines, along the Global North/South axis, in international AML/CFTP and tax regulatory governance. These include the “sustainable development” gap in AML/CFTP norm-making;making the Financial Action Task Force fit-for-purpose;renewed campaigns against “harmful tax competition”;and international commitment to scaling up technical assistance to combat economic crimes in developing countries. It questions the sustainability of the prevailing “levelling the playing field” regulatory approach to AML/CFTP and tax matters and whether serious consideration ought not to be given to mainstreaming “differential treatment” in international AML/CFTP and tax standards, for resource-strapped Caribbean countries. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to assess the strategic policy risks and challenges that will arise from balancing economic recovery and fighting economic crimes by small and vulnerable Commonwealth Caribbean States in the post-pandemic era. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Clarke, R.

WPA2/WPA3 solutions take user interaction and a strong passphrase for granted. However, the often weak passphrases are subject to guessing attacks. Notably, there has been a significant rise of cyberattacks on Wi-Fi home or small office networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the device provisioning problem in Wi-Fi (personal mode) and proposes ComPass protocol to supplement WPA2/WPA3. ComPass replaces the pre-installed or user-selected passphrases with automatically generated ones. For this, ComPass employs Physical Layer Security and extracts credentials from common random physical layer parameters between devices. Two major features make ComPass unique and superior compared to previous proposals: First, it employs phase information (rather than amplitude or signal strength) to generate the passphrase so that it is robust, scaleable, and impossible to guess. Our analysis showed that ComPass generated passphrases have 3 times more entropy than human generated passphrases (113-bits vs. 34-bits). Second, ComPass selects parameters such that two devices bind only within a certain proximity (≤ 3m), hence providing practically useful in-build PLS-based authentication. ComPass is available as a kernel module or as full firmware. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Reaz, K.; Wunder, G.","15th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing, IMIS 2021",858,1

Data acquired in recent months show that chronic PM and NO2 pollution, rather than their peaks, are associated with case numbers and severe forms of the disease. There are two possible explanations: an increase in pulmonary inflammation among individuals already weakened by an overexpression of the ACE2 receptor under the effect of chronic pollution, and the idea that atmospheric particles transport SARS-CoV-2, which has not yet been demonstrated.","Marano, F.; Squinazi, F.",Environnement Risques &amp; Sante,858,19

We therefore conducted an analysis to assess if there has been a reduction in new haematological malignancy diagnoses within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT). METHODS: We observed a significant decline in diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis of haematological malignancies. We therefore decided to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the volume of tests performed to see if this impacted the number of new cases of haematological malignancies diagnosed. To ascertain the number of new diagnoses referred to Clinical Haematology we decided to analyse the number of new diagnoses discussed at the local Multidisciplinary Team Meetings (MDM) between March and June 2020 and compare this with the same period in 2019. In line with NICE guidelines2 there has been no change to the referral pathway for patients with new haematological malignancy. RESULTS: Results show that there is no significant difference between the number of new malignant haematological diagnoses discussed during March to June 2020 and the same period in 2019. This confirms that the number of new diagnoses remains the same within the two time periods. CONCLUSION: This analysis highlights that despite a reduction in primary and secondary care diagnostic blood tests, there is no difference in the number of new cases of haematological malignancies discussed at Haematology MDM throughout the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic locally.","Waddell, David; Benson, Gary",Ulster Med J,858,28

However, no recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein (S)-based ELISA is currently available. In this article, we describe the problems and solutions of setting up the recombinant SARS-CoV S-based ELISA for antibody detection. The SARS-CoV S-based immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG ELISAs were evaluated and compared with the corresponding N-based ELISA for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia, using sera from 148 healthy blood donors who donated blood 3 years ago as controls and 95 SARS-CoV pneumonia patients in Hong Kong. Results obtained by the recombinant S (rS)-based IgG ELISA using the regenerated S prepared by dialysis with decreasing concentrations of urea or direct addition of different coating buffers, followed by addition of different regeneration buffer, identified 4 M urea and 1 M sarcosine for plate coating and no regeneration buffer as the most optimal conditions for antibody detection. The specificities of the S-based ELISA for IgG and IgM detection were 98.6% and 93.9%, with corresponding sensitivities of 58.9% and 74.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rN IgG ELISA (94.7%) is significantly higher than that of the rS IgG ELISA (P < 0.001), whereas the sensitivity of the rS IgM ELISA is significantly higher than that of the rN IgM ELISA (55.2%) (P < 0.01). An ELISA for detection of IgM against S and N could be more sensitive than one that detects IgM against N alone for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Wong, Beatrice H L; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Fung, Ami M Y; Kao, Richard Y T; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Peiris, J S Malik; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of clinical microbiology,858,1

The purpose of our study was to determine characteristics associated with the transmission of SARS within households. METHODS A retrospective cohort of SARS-affected households was studied to determine risk factors for household transmission. Questionnaires addressed characteristics of the index case, the household and behaviours among household members. Potential risk factors for secondary transmission of infection were assessed in regression models appropriate to the outcome (secondary cases) and nonindependence of household members. RESULTS The 74 households that participated included 18 secondary cases and 158 uninfected household members in addition to the 74 index cases. The household secondary attack rate was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7%-23.5%). There was a linear association between the time the index patient spent at home after symptom onset and the secondary attack rate. Infected health care workers who were index cases had lower rates of household transmission.

Persons who reported sweeping and cleaning outdoors (relative risk [RR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.6), digging (RR = 2.6, CI = 1.1-6.1), or working in a bird or bat roosting area (RR = 1.8, CI = 1.3-2.4) had a greater risk for illness. The findings emphasize the need for travelers and persons involved in construction activities to use personal protective equipment and decrease dust-generation when working in areas where histoplasmosis is endemic. Clinicians should consider histoplasmosis as a possible cause of acute respiratory or influenza-like illness in travelers returning from areas in which histoplasmosis is endemic.",,MMWR.

Baculoviruses are not pathogenic to mammalian cells. Nevertheless, live baculovirus is shown here to induce interferons (IFN) from murine and human cell lines and induces in vivo protection of mice from encephalomyocarditis virus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the baculovirus envelope gp67 neutralize baculovirus-dependent IFN production. Moreover, UV treatment of baculovirus eliminates both infectivity and IFN-inducing activity. In contrast, the IFN-inducing activity of the baculovirus was unaffected by DNase or RNase treatment. These data demonstrate that IFN production can be induced in mammalian cells by baculovirus even though the cells fail to serve as a natural host for an active viral infection. Baculoviruses, therefore, provide a novel model in which to study at least one alternative mechanism for IFN induction in mammalian cells.","Gronowski, A M; Hilbert, D M; Sheehan, K C; Garotta, G; Schreiber, R D",Journal of virology,858,17

Elements capable of forming strand-specific stem-loop structures were inserted at the modified 3' noncoding regions of BMV RNA3 and RNA2 in either positive or negative orientations, and various combinations of parental RNAs were tested for patterns of the accumulating recombinant RNA3 components. The structured negative-strand stem-loops that were inserted in both RNA3 and RNA2 reduced the accumulation of RNA3-RNA2 recombinants to a much higher extent than those in positive strands or the unstructured stem-loop inserts in either positive or negative strands. The use of only one parental RNA carrying the stem-loop insert reduced the accumulation of RNA3-RNA2 recombinants even further, but only when the stem-loops were in negative strands of RNA2. We assume that the presence of a stable stem-loop downstream of the landing site on the acceptor strand (negative RNA2) hampers the reattachment and reinitiation processes. Besides RNA3-RNA2 recombinants, the accumulation of nontargeted RNA3-RNA1 and RNA3-RNA3 recombinants were observed. Our results provide experimental evidence that homologous recombination between BMV RNAs more likely occurs during positive- rather than negative-strand synthesis.","Olsthoorn, R C L; Bruyere, A; Dzianott, A; Bujarski, J J",Journal of virology,858,1

High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods designed to be virus-specific or aim to be limited to group of viral agents, hinder identifying of novel viruses or viral variants. Recently developed approaches of next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide culture-independent methods that are useful for understanding viral diversity and discovery of novel virus, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control. This review discusses the different possible steps of a NGS study utilizing sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS lead to the identification of a wide range of new viruses such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus and avian gamma coronavirus associated with fulminating disease in guinea fowl and is also used in describing viral diversity among avian species. The review also briefly discusses areas of viral-host interaction and disease associated causalities with newly identified avian viruses.","Kapgate, S S; Barbuddhe, S B; Kumanan, K",Acta virologica,858,17

According to the official files of reported cases of SARS from February 21 to June 19, 2003, there were 586 cases in southern Taiwan. Symptom onset occurred between February 21 and June 19 in reported cases, between March 13 and May 30 in probable cases, and between March 17 and May 23 in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive probable cases. Dates of symptom onset were earliest for six imported cases, followed by 53 cases related to nosocomial infections and 51 cases without known sources of infection. The positive rates of the PCR for these three groups decreased from 50.0% to 28.3% to 3.9% , respectively (P < 0.001, by chi-square test for linear trend). Three other cases resulted from exposure to contaminated hospitals in northern Taiwan, one of which was the index case of the nosocomial infection. Imported cases following nosocomial infection were the major cause of SARS infections in southern Taiwan. Due to the low positive rate of the PCR for SARS coronavirus, and the low positive predictive value of reported cases, the factuality of cases with unknown sources of infection should be further verified.","Lu, Sheng-Nan; Jiang, Donald Dah-Shyong; Liu, Jien-Wei; Lin, Meng-Chih; Chen, Chao-Long; Su, Ih-Jen; Chen, Shun-Sheng",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,858,1

The genome was found to be 29 125 nt in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. Analysis of the sequence identified conserved open reading frames and revealed an overall genome organization similar to that of other coronaviruses. The genomic RNA was analysed for putative cis-acting elements and the pattern of subgenomic mRNA synthesis was analysed by Northern blotting. Comparative sequence analysis of the predicted FCoV proteins identified 16 replicase proteins (nsp1-nsp16) and four structural proteins (spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid). Two mRNAs encoding putative accessory proteins were also detected. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that FIPV WSU-79/1146 belongs to the coronavirus subgroup G1-1.

Genetic studies indicate that the efficiency with which reovirus strains induce apoptosis is determined by the viral S1 gene, which encodes attachment protein sigma1. However, the biochemical properties of sigma1 that influence apoptosis induction are unknown. To determine whether the capacity of sigma1 to bind cell surface sialic acid determines the magnitude of the apoptotic response, we used isogenic reovirus mutants that differ in the capacity to engage sialic acid. We found that T3SA+, a virus capable of binding sialic acid, induces high levels of apoptosis in both HeLa cells and L cells. In contrast, non-sialic-acid-binding strain T3SA- induces little or no apoptosis in these cell types. Differences in the capacity of T3SA- and T3SA+ to induce apoptosis are not due to differences in viral protein synthesis or production of viral progeny. Removal of cell surface sialic acid with neuraminidase abolishes the capacity of T3SA+ to induce apoptosis. Similarly, incubation of T3SA+ with sialyllactose, a trisaccharide comprised of lactose and sialic acid, blocks apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that reovirus binding to cell surface sialic acid is a critical requirement for the efficient induction of apoptosis and suggest that virus receptor utilization plays an important role in regulating cell death.","Connolly, J L; Barton, E S; Dermody, T S",Journal of virology,858,26

This review elaborates on disorders of the spinal cord caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. OBJECTIVES: To review the published data about SARS-CoV-2-associated spinal cord disorders and assess their clinical, neuroimaging, treatment, and prognostic aspects. METHODS: The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for published cases using the search items ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelitis"", ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelopathy"", and ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND spinal cord"". RESULTS: Thirty-three isolated cases were included in the present review, of which 14 were aged 60 years and above (range: 3-70 years). Eighteen patients had lung abnormalities on chest imaging. Eight patients had developed either an areflexic paraparesis or quadriparesis. In 17 patients, neuroimaging demonstrated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, while 3 cases showed neuroimaging changes in the spinal cord as a part of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed inflammatory changes in 18 patients. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the CSF was discovered in 2 patients. In 2 patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were demonstrated in the CSF. Following treatment, 13 patients were able to walk. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of COVID-19-related spinal cord manifestations, such as acute transverse myelitis, acute necrotizing myelitis, SARS-CoV-2 myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, hypoxic myelopathy, MOG antibody-associated myelitis, spinal cord infarction, and spinal epidural abscess, have been reported. The possible mechanisms of this involvement being direct invasion, cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and an autoimmune response. However, response to treatment has been generally unsatisfactory, with many patients having residual weakness necessitating long-term rehabilitation.","Garg, Ravindra Kumar; Paliwal, Vimal Kumar; Gupta, Ankit",J Spinal Cord Med,858,24
