In the present study, complete genome sequences of ASF viruses (ASFV) that caused the 2018 outbreak in Burundi (BUR/18/Rutana) and the 2019 outbreak in Malawi (MAL/19/Karonga) were produced using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform and compared with other previously described ASFV complete genomes. The complete nucleotide sequences of BUR/18/Rutana and MAL/19/Karonga were 176,564 and 183,325 base pairs long with GC content of 38.62 and 38.48%, respectively. The MAL/19/Karonga virus had a total of 186 open reading frames (ORFs) while the BUR/18/Rutana strain had 151 ORFs. After comparative genomic analysis, the MAL/19/Karonga virus showed greater than 99% nucleotide identity with other complete nucleotides sequences of p72 genotype II viruses previously described in Tanzania, Europe and Asia including the Georgia 2007/1 isolate. The Burundian ASFV BUR/18/Rutana exhibited 98.95 to 99.34% nucleotide identity with genotype X ASFV previously described in Kenya and in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The serotyping results classified the BUR/18/Rutana and MAL/19/Karonga ASFV strains in serogroups 7 and 8, respectively. The results of this study provide insight into the genetic structure and antigenic diversity of ASFV strains circulating in Burundi and Malawi. This is important in order to understand the transmission dynamics and genetic evolution of ASFV in eastern Africa, with an ultimate goal of designing an efficient risk management strategy against ASF transboundary spread.","Hakizimana, Jean N.; Ntirandekura, Jean B.; Yona, Clara; Nyabongo, Lionel; Kamwendo, Gladson; Chulu, Julius L.

Among these, the trypsin-like serine proteases comprise one of the best characterized subfamilies due to their essential roles in blood coagulation, food digestion, fibrinolysis, or immunity. Trypsin-like serine proteases possess primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids. Most of the well-characterized trypsin-like proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, or urokinase are soluble proteases that are secreted into the extracellular environment. At the turn of the millennium, a number of novel trypsin-like serine proteases have been identified that are anchored in the cell membrane, either by a transmembrane domain at the N- or C-terminus or via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Meanwhile more than 20 membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) have been identified in human and mouse, and some of them have emerged as key regulators of mammalian development and homeostasis. Thus, the MASP corin and TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 have been demonstrated to be the activators of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and key regulator of hepcidin expression, respectively. Furthermore, MASPs have been recognized as host cell factors activating respiratory viruses including influenza virus as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. In particular, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to be essential for proteolytic activation and consequently spread and pathogenesis of a number of influenza A viruses in mice and as a factor associated with severe influenza virus infection in humans. This review gives an overview on the physiological functions of the fascinating and rapidly evolving group of MASPs and a summary of the current knowledge on their role in proteolytic activation of viral fusion proteins.","Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,718,1
26022,26022,26022,Conclusions,14.401344,4.0242076,2019-05-23,"Geraniaceae family plants are highly reputed aromatic and medicinal perennial branched herbs. The high economic value of these plants is due to their secondary metabolites, especially essential oil of foliage, which is a complex mixture of volatile phytochemicals, such as terpenes, esters, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and phenols. The main phytoconstituents of the essential oil belong to the terpenoid group of metabolites, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their esters. Of these, geraniol, linalool, citronellol and their esters (50–70%) generally constitute a major portion of essential oil, responsible for its fragrance. Essential oil is biosynthesized in specialized tissues known as glandular trichomes present in leaves, green branches and fresh flowers. Geraniaceae family plants have been highly useful in the perfumery, cosmetics, aromatherapy, pharmaceuticals and food industries. Several pharmacological properties such as antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-depressant, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiseptic, anti-dysentery, and antidiabetic properties are attributed to the presence of geranium oil. Further, it improves blood circulation, treats congestion, cleans the lymphatic system, strengthens the immune system, and is effective in combating nervousness, constipation, insomnia, anxiety and high blood pressure. The chapter discusses the phytochemical composition, pharmacological properties, genomics of essential oil biosynthetic pathway, enhancement of essential oil yield, and several biotechnological approaches to enhance the quantity as well as quality of essential oil in geranium.","Narnoliya, Lokesh Kumar; Jadaun, Jyoti Singh; Singh, Sudhir P.",Essential Oil Research,718,1

Although light-weight agile software development approaches are favored by software development service providers, additional requirements elicitation practices should be incorporated when scaling factors apply, since design team members need to have a shared understanding of the operating context and high-level requirements. Research indicated that the organization construction diagram (OCD) could be useful to create a shared context for enterprise operation, linking detailed functional requirements to this shared context during software development. Although the OCD is concise, its associated concepts are abstract and an additional story-card method (SCM) is needed to transform existing enterprise implementations into an OCD. Since additional evaluation of the SCM was required, this study focused on a real-world demonstration of the SCM at a Fintech company where an agile software development approach is applied. The results indicate that the SCM is useful when incorporated within an agile software development approach.","Djan, Elijah; de Vries, Marné","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",718,28

In the majority of symptomatic cases COVID-19 results in a mild disease predominantly characterised by upper respiratory tract symptoms. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using a nasopharyngeal sample, is the mainstay of diagnosis, but there is an ~30% false negative rate early in the disease and in patients with mild disease. RT-PCR positivity can persist for several days after a resolution of symptoms. IgM and IgG antibody responses become positive several days after the onset of symptoms, and robust antibody responses are detectable in the second week of illness. Antibody-based immunoassays have a limited role in the diagnosis of early symptomatic disease. However, their incremental benefit over RT-PCR in the first 2 weeks of illness is currently being clarified in ongoing studies. Such assays may be useful for surveillance purposes. However, their role in potentially selecting individuals that may benefit from vaccination, or as a biomarker identifying persons that could be redeployed into essential employment roles are being investigated. Rapid antibody-based immunoassays that detect viral antigen in nasopharyngeal samples are being developed and evaluated.","Dheda, Keertan; Jaumdally, Shameem; Davids, Malika; Chang, Ju-Wei; Gina, Phindile; Pooran, Anil; Makambwa, Edson; Esmail, Ali; Vardas, Eftyxia; Preiser, Wolfgang",,718,1

In the first stage, a multicriteria model is developed for each of the conflicting parties, taken as decision makers (DMs) facing evaluations of a set of alternatives according to proper criteria. In the second stage, the composition of probabilistic preferences (CPP) methodology is applied to identify the best alternative for each of the conflicting parties. In the third stage, negotiation is carried out to remove alternatives and to focus on the subset of best alternatives for the group of DMs. The fourth stage consists of applying CPP again to choose one among the remaining alternatives. The model is illustrated by means of applying it to a real-world conflict in Brazil, related to implementation of the New Recife Project. The main features of the model are that it allows the DMs (i) to understand differences and proximities among the positions of each of them, (ii) to strategically reduce the initial set of alternatives, (iii) to advance in their positions towards a common goal, and (iv) to construct a unique final solution quickly.","Sant’anna, Annibal P.; Costa, Ana Paula C.

To address the redundancy of option statements, a novel option statement reduction method as well as an effective reduction algorithm is developed in this research based on the rough set theory. Furthermore, the Elmira conflict is utilized to show how the proposed option statement reduction method can be employed for efficiently eliminating redundant option statements of DMs.","Zhao, Shinan; Xu, Haiyan",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,718,1

Systems-level analysis of protein-protein interactions is made possible through network science and modeling of high-throughput data. From these analyses, small protein complexes are traditionally represented graphically as complete graphs or dense clusters of nodes. However, there are certain graph theoretic properties that have not been extensively studied in PPI networks, especially as they pertain to cluster discovery, such as planarity. Planarity of graphs have been used to reflect the physical constraints of real-world systems outside of bioinformatics, in areas such as mapping and imaging. Here, we investigate the planarity property in network models of protein complexes. We hypothesize that complexes represented as PPI subgraphs will tend to be planar, reflecting the actual physical interface and limits of components in the complex. When testing the planarity of known complex subgraphs in S. cerevisiae and selected mammalian PPIs, we find that a majority of validated complexes possess this planar property. We discuss the biological motivation of planar versus nonplanar subgraphs, observing that planar subgraphs tend to have longer protein components. Functional classification of planar versus nonplanar complex subgraphs reveals differences in annotation of these groups relating to cellular component organization, structural molecule activity, catalytic activity, and nucleic acid binding. These results provide a new quantitative and biologically motivated measure of real protein complexes in the network model, important for the development of future complex-finding algorithms in PPIs. Accounting for this property paves the way to new means for discovering new protein complexes and uncovering the functionality of unknown or novel proteins.","Cooper, Kathryn; Cornelius, Nathan; Gasper, William; Bhowmick, Sanjukta; Ali, Hesham",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,718,1

We examine the task difficulty sequence data of 236 undergraduate students in a simulation-based Predict-Observe-Explain environment. The findings suggest that if students perceive the TDs as easy or hard, it may lead to poorer learning outcomes, while the medium or moderate TDs may result in better learning outcomes. In terms of TD transitions, difficulty level hard followed by a hard may lead to poorer learning outcomes. By contrast, difficulty level medium followed by a medium may lead to better learning outcomes. Understanding how task difficulties manifest over time and how they impact students’ learning outcomes is useful, especially when designing for real-time educational interventions, where the difficulty of the tasks could be optimised for students. It can also help in designing and sequencing the tasks for the development of effective teaching strategies that can maximize students’ learning.","Nawaz, Sadia; Srivastava, Namrata; Yu, Ji Hyun; Baker, Ryan S.; Kennedy, Gregor; Bailey, James",Artificial Intelligence in Education,718,1

While it is expected that students are given free rein to work on their projects, facilitators have to strike a difficult balance between micromanaging them and letting the community support itself. In this paper, we explore how Kinect sensors can continuously monitor students’ collaborative interactions so that instructors can gain a more comprehensive view of the social dynamics of the space. We employ heatmaps to examine the diversity of student collaborative interactions and Markov transition probabilities to explore the transitions between instances of collaborative interactions. Findings indicate that letting students work on their own promotes the development of technical skills, while working together encourages students to spend more time in the makerspace. This confirms the intuition that successful projects in makerspaces necessitate both individual and group efforts. Furthermore, such aggregation and display of information can aid instructors in uncovering the state of student learning in makerspaces. Identifying the instances and diversity of collaborative interactions affords instructors an early opportunity to identify struggling students and having these data in a near real-time manner opens new doors in terms of making (un)productive behaviors salient, both for teachers and students.

We evaluated the relevance of a new syndromic rapid multiplex PCR test (rm-PCR) on respiratory samples to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study was conducted in four French university hospitals. Respiratory samples were obtained from patients with clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia and simultaneously tested using conventional microbiological methods and the rm-PCR. A committee composed of an intensivist, a microbiologist, and an infectious diseases specialist retrospectively assessed all medical files and agreed on the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for each pneumonia episode, according to the results of rm-PCR and blinded to the culture results. The rm-PCR-guided antimicrobial regimen was compared to the empirical treatment routinely administered to the patient in standard care. RESULTS: We included 159 pneumonia episodes. Most patients were hospitalized in intensive care units (n = 129, 81%), and episodes were HAP (n = 68, 43%), CAP (n = 54, 34%), and VAP (n = 37, 23%). Conventional culture isolated ≥ 1 microorganism(s) at significant level in 95 (60%) patients. The syndromic rm-PCR detected at least one bacteria in 132 (83%) episodes. Based on the results of the rm-PCR, the multidisciplinary committee proposed a modification of the empirical therapy in 123 (77%) pneumonia episodes. The modification was a de-escalation in 63 (40%), an escalation in 35 (22%), and undetermined in 25 (16%) patients. In microbiologically documented episodes (n = 95), the rm-PCR increased appropriateness of the empirical therapy to 83 (87%), as compared to 73 (77%) in routine care. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a syndromic rm-PCR test has the potential to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and increase the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy in adult patients with pneumonia.","Monard, Céline; Pehlivan, Jonathan; Auger, Gabriel; Alviset, Sophie; Tran Dinh, Alexy; Duquaire, Paul; Gastli, Nabil; d’Humières, Camille; Maamar, Adel; Boibieux, André; Baldeyrou, Marion; Loubinoux, Julien; Dauwalder, Olivier; Cattoir, Vincent; Armand-Lefèvre, Laurence; Kernéis, Solen",Crit Care,718,12

This study was undertaken using Straussian grounded theory to address the question: “What are healthcare providers’ perspectives on training current and future HCPs in compassion?” METHODS: Fifty-seven HCPs working in palliative care participated in this study, beginning with focus groups with frontline HCPs (n = 35), followed by one-on-one interviews with HCPs who were considered by their peers to be skilled in providing compassion (n = 15, three of whom also participated in the initial focus groups), and end of study focus groups with study participants (n = 5) and knowledge users (n = 10). RESULTS: Study participants largely agreed that compassionate behaviours can be taught, and these behaviours are distinct from the emotional response of compassion. They noted that while learners can develop greater compassion through training, their ability to do so varies depending on the innate qualities they possess prior to training. Participants identified three facets of an effective compassion training program: self-awareness, experiential learning and effective and affective communication skills. Participants also noted that healthcare faculties, facilities and organizations play an important role in creating compassionate practice settings and sustaining HCPs in their delivery of compassion. CONCLUSIONS: Providing compassion has become a core expectation of healthcare and a hallmark of quality palliative care. This study provides guidance on the importance, core components and teaching methods of compassion training from the perspectives of those who aim to provide it—Healthcare Providers—serving as a foundation for future evidence based educational interventions.","Sinclair, Shane; Hack, Thomas F.; McClement, Susan; Raffin-Bouchal, Shelley; Chochinov, Harvey Max; Hagen, Neil A.",BMC Med Educ,718,1

Our aim is to review the clinical and neuroimaging findings seen in congenital Zika syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: ZIKV injures neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus, a brain region important for learning, memory, cognition, and emotion/stress response. Positron emission tomography has revealed global neuroinflammation in ZIKV infection in animal models. SUMMARY: Congenital Zika syndrome is associated with a spectrum of brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, parenchymal calcifications, malformations of cortical development and defective neuronal migration, corpus callosum abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, and brainstem and cerebellar abnormalities.","VHP, Leão; Aragão, MM; Pinho, RS; Hazin, AN; Paciorkowski, AR; Penalva de Oliveira, AC; Masruha, Marcelo Rodrigues",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,718,1

A long-term study was conducted to determine the possible chronic toxicity and oncogenicity of methylene chloride. Rats and hamsters were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 hr per day, 5 days a week, for 2 years. No exposure-related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Females rats exposed to 3500 ppm had an increased mortality rate while female hamsters exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had decreased mortality rates. Carboxyhemoglobin values were elevated in rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm with the percentage increase in hamsters greater than in rats. Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. While the number of female rats with a benign tumor was not increased, the total number of benign mammary tumors was increased in female rats in an exposure-related manner. This effect was also evident in male rats in the 1500- and 3500-ppm exposure groups. Finally, male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sarcomas in the ventral neck region located in or around the salivary glands. Therefore, in this 2-year study, some effects were observed in male and female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride. In contrast, hamsters exposed to the same exposure concentrations had less extensive spontaneous geriatric changes, decreased mortality (females), and lacked evidence of definite target organ toxicity.","BUREK, J.

The key idea is to define constructions yielding an extended version of a given arbitrary big-step semantics, where the difference is made explicit. The extended semantics are exploited in the meta-theory, notably they are necessary to show that the proof technique works. However, they remain transparent when using the proof technique, since it consists in checking three conditions on the original rules only, as we illustrate by several examples.","Dagnino, Francesco; Bono, Viviana; Zucca, Elena; Dezani-Ciancaglini, Mariangiola",Programming Languages and Systems,718,5

We hypothesized that vascular injury and pro-coagulant activity are evident in alloHCT survivors without existing alloHCT complications or relapse. (2) Methods: we enrolled consecutive adult alloHCT survivors without established cardiovascular disease and control individuals matched for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (January–December 2019). Circulating microvesicles (MVs) of different cellular origins (platelet, erythrocyte, and endothelial) were measured by a standardized flow cytometry protocol as novel markers of vascular injury and pro-coagulant activity. (3) Results: we recruited 45 survivors after a median of 2.3 (range 1.1–13.2) years from alloHCT, and 45 controls. The majority of patients suffered from acute (44%) and/or chronic (66%) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although the two groups were matched for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, alloHCT survivors showed significantly increased platelet and erythrocyte MVs compared to controls. Within alloHCT survivors, erythrocyte MVs were significantly increased in patients with a previous history of thrombotic microangiopathy. Interestingly, endothelial MVs were significantly increased only in alloHCT recipients of a myeloablative conditioning. Furthermore, MVs of different origins showed a positive association with each other. (4) Conclusions: endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombotic risk are evident in alloHCT recipients long after alloHCT, independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

To illustrate various aspects of brain tumors that potentially underlie the emergence of suicidality, the review is supplemented with a clinical exemplar of a long-term survivor of brain tumor (glioblastoma) who experienced persistent SI. Furthermore, we discuss putative both neurobiological (including anatomical and immunological) and psychosocial mechanisms that might be accountable for the development of SI and SB in patients with brain tumors. Conclusions: While the etiology of this phenomenon appears to be multifactorial and still remains a subject of much debate, it is of critical importance to identify patients for which a psychiatric evaluation could recognize, in a timely manner, a possible suicide risk and alleviate the deep related suffering, by appropriate psychopharmacological and supportive and psychotherapeutic interventions.","Costanza, Alessandra; Zenga, Francesco; Rudà, Roberta; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Bondolfi, Guido; Berardelli, Isabella; Nguyen, Khoa Dinh",Medicina (Kaunas),718,1

If pulmonary infiltrates remain unexplained or progress despite treatment, the histopathological result of a lung biopsy could have significant impact on change in therapy. Surgical lung biopsy is the commonly used technique, but due to its considerable morbidity and mortality, less invasive bronchoscopic transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) may be a valuable alternative. METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric, observational study in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, subjected to TBLB due to unexplained pulmonary infiltrates in the period January 2014 to July 2019. Patients’ medical records were reviewed to obtain data on baseline clinical characteristics, modality and adverse events (AE) of the TBLB, and impact of the histopathological results on treatment decisions. A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of AE and hospital mortality, and survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with in total 42 TBLB procedures after a median of 12 days of mechanical ventilation were analyzed, of which 16.7% were immunosuppressed, but there was no patient with prior lung transplantation. Diagnostic yield of TBLB was 88.1%, with AE occurring in 11.9% (most common pneumothorax and minor bleeding). 92.9% of the procedures were performed as a forceps biopsy, with organizing pneumonia (OP) as the most common histological diagnosis (54.8%). Variables independently associated with hospital mortality were age (odds ratio 1.070, 95%CI 1.006–1.138; p = 0.031) and the presence of OP (0.182, [0.036–0.926]; p = 0.040), the latter being confirmed in the survival analysis (log-rank p = 0.040). In contrast, a change in therapy based on histopathology alone occurred in 40.5%, and there was no evidence of improved survival in those patients. CONCLUSIONS: Transbronchial lung biopsy remains a valuable alternative to surgical lung biopsy in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. However, the high diagnostic yield must be weighed against potential adverse events and limited consequence of the histopathological result regarding treatment decisions in such patients.","Ghiani, Alessandro; Neurohr, Claus",BMC Pulm Med,718,7

Our approach is based on Supervised Learning, with the centralized controller providing the training data, in the form of trajectories of state-action pairs. We use Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the centralized controller, an approach that we have successfully demonstrated on flocking problems. MPC-based flocking controllers are high-performing but also computationally expensive. By learning a symmetric and distributed neural flocking controller from a centralized MPC-based one, we achieve the best of both worlds: the neural controllers have high performance (on par with the MPC controllers) and high efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate the sophisticated nature of the distributed controllers we learn. In particular, the neural controllers are capable of achieving myriad flocking-oriented control objectives, including flocking formation, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, predator avoidance, and target seeking. Moreover, they generalize the behavior seen in the training data to achieve these objectives in a significantly broader range of scenarios. In terms of verification of our neural flocking controller, we use a form of statistical model checking to compute confidence intervals for its convergence rate and time to convergence.","Mehmood, Usama; Roy, Shouvik; Grosu, Radu; Smolka, Scott A.; Stoller, Scott D.; Tiwari, Ashish",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,718,28

This paper presents and extension of AARA to exponential bounds that preserves the benefits of the technique, such as compositionality and efficient type inference based on linear constraint solving. A key idea is the use of the Stirling numbers of the second kind as the basis of potential functions, which play the same role as the binomial coefficients in polynomial AARA. To formalize the similarities with the existing analyses, the paper presents a general methodology for AARA that is instantiated to the polynomial version, the exponential version, and a combined system with potential functions that are formed by products of Stirling numbers and binomial coefficients. The soundness of exponential AARA is proved with respect to an operational cost semantics and the analysis of representative example programs demonstrates the effectiveness of the new analysis.","Kahn, David M.; Hoffmann, Jan",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,718,7

As in the classical case due to Church, the system selects actions depending on the program run so far, with the aim of fulfilling a given specification. The difficulty is that, at the same time, the environment executes actions that the system cannot control. In contrast to the case of fixed, finite alphabets, here we consider the case of parameterized alphabets. An alphabet reflects the number of processes, which is static but unknown. The synthesis problem then asks whether there is a finite number of processes for which the system can satisfy the specification. This variant is already undecidable for very limited logics. Therefore, we consider a first-order logic without the order on word positions. We show that even in this restricted case synthesis is undecidable if both the system and the environment have access to all processes. On the other hand, we prove that the problem is decidable if the environment only has access to a bounded number of processes. In that case, there is even a cutoff meaning that it is enough to examine a bounded number of process architectures to solve the synthesis problem.","Bérard, Béatrice; Bollig, Benedikt; Lehaut, Mathieu; Sznajder, Nathalie",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,718,7

Although we have made an extensive use of the existing generic tools, certain principled changes had to be made to enable the desired construction: while the original monad works over total heaps (to disable dangling pointers), our version involves partial heaps (heaplets) to enable compositional reasoning using separating conjunction. Another remarkable feature of our construction is that, in contrast to the existing generic approaches, our BI-algebra does not directly stem from an internal categorical partial commutative monoid.","Polzer, Miriam; Goncharov, Sergey",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,718,16

However, the chlorination of membrane foulants results in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), which will cause the deterioration of the MBR effluent and increase the antibiotic resistance in bacteria in the MBR tank. In this study, the formation of 14 DBPs during chemical cleaning offouled MBR membrane modules was investigated. Together with the effects of biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), influences of reaction time, NaClO dosage, initial pH, and cleaning temperature on the DBP formation were investigated. Haloacetic acids (HAAs) and trichloromethane (TCM), composed over 90% of the DBPs, were increasingly accumulated as the NaClO cleaning time extended. By increasing the chlorine dosage, temperature, and pH, the yield of TCM and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) was increased by up to a factor of 1–14, whereas the yields of haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloketones (HKs) were decreased. Either decreasing in the chlorine dosage and cleaning temperature or adjusting the pH of cleaning reagents toward acidic or alkaline could effectively reduce the toxic risks caused by DBPs. After the EPS extraction pretreatment, the formation of DBPs was accelerated in the first 12 h due to the damage of biofilm structure. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images showed that EPS, particularly polysaccharides, were highly resistant to chlorine and might be able to protect the cells exposed to chlorination.

Nonetheless, the country´s electricity consumption per capita is one of the lowest in the world and the transmission and distribution network has one of the highest losses in Latin America. This paper presents an electricity expansion investment outlook (2018–2040) for Paraguay using OSeMOSYS, analyzing three electricity demand scenarios under different electricity export prices to Brazil. The study identifies the least-cost power generation mix, future investments and the financial requirements to meet the needs of different demand scenarios. We find that Paraguay will need to invest in hydropower plants, by mainly expanding the capacity of Yacyreta to cover its electricity needs and sustain national electricity exports levels. In the High demand scenario, where the electricity demand could approximately double by 2040, the country's overall electricity exports decrease by 50% compared to the Reference scenario. Based on the different scenarios examined, the government spends approximately 18.3–31.2 billion USD on power plant investments for the period 2018–2040 to cover future electricity demand. The findings could be useful in supporting decision-making concerning socio-economic development pathways in the country.

We investigated the impact of transfusions on neurodevelopmental outcome in the Preterm Erythropoietin (Epo) Neuroprotection (PENUT) Trial population. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of 936 infants 24-0/6 to 27-6/7 weeks’ gestation enrolled in the PENUT Trial. Epo 1000 U/kg or placebo was given every 48 h × 6 doses, followed by 400 U/kg or sham injections 3 times a week through 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Six hundred and twenty-eight (315 placebo, 313 Epo) survived and were assessed at 2 years of age. We evaluated associations between BSID-III scores and the number and volume of pRBC transfusions. RESULTS: Each transfusion was associated with a decrease in mean cognitive score of 0.96 (95% CI of [−1.34, −0.57]), a decrease in mean motor score of 1.51 (−1.91, −1.12), and a decrease in mean language score of 1.10 (−1.54, −0.66). Significant negative associations between BSID-III score and transfusion volume and donor exposure were observed in the placebo group but not in the Epo group. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusions in ELGANs were associated with worse outcomes. We speculate that strategies to minimize the need for transfusions may improve outcomes. IMPACT: Transfusion number, volume, and donor exposure in the neonatal period are associated with worse neurodevelopmental (ND) outcome at 2 years of age, as assessed by the Bayley Infant Scales of Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). The impact of neonatal packed red blood cell transfusions on the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants is unknown. We speculate that strategies to minimize the need for transfusions may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Vu, Phuong T.; Ohls, Robin K.; Mayock, Dennis E.; German, Kendell R.; Comstock, Bryan A.; Heagerty, Patrick J.; Juul, Sandra E.",Pediatr Res,718,1

The study aims to develop an innovative decision-making technology to handle the supplier selection problems arising from the frequent impreciseness and incompleteness in the nowadays' SC reports within the framework of the gresilient supply chain management. Through the integration of green and resilience aspects of the SCs, the supply chain 'gresilience' has been conceptualized. In light of this construct and based on the data collected from a manufacturing firm, the study deploys a two-fold decomposition of the core algorithm of the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA), one for attributes and other for alternatives. It extends the OPA to the Fuzzy OPA (OPA-F) for solving the supplier selection problems. The study illustrates how green and resilience aspects of the SC can be integrated to better understand the gresilient suppliers in the wake of the SC disruptions. A novel construct of SC Gresilience is also furnished along with a novel definition of SC Gresilience.

In these systems, the admission of customers is modulated by the state of the system at the instants of customer arrivals. Depending on the size of the queue upon arrival, customers that find place to join the system decide to enter the system with a certain probability. The number of customers in the system amounts to a Markov chain whose transition probabilities incorporate the balking probabilities. Using the Markovian regenerative property of the chain embedded at the instants of arrival or departure of customers, we characterize the joint probability distribution of the number of customers served and the number of customers lost in busy-periods, that is, during continuous occupation periods of the server. This is accomplished implementing a priori a recursive algorithmic procedure for computing the respective probability-generating function.

Following the referendum in June 2016, the UK Government has developed a series of policies in response to Brexit while the negotiations between the UK and EU are still ongoing. This chapter assesses the likely impact of these policies on UK universities’ main activities, namely student recruitment and student and staff mobility, research funding, recognition of qualifications and transnational education (TNE) activities/operations, in particular in East Asia. The findings suggest that Brexit will have a positive and indirect impact on UK universities’ relations with East Asia, in particular with the People’s Republic of China, in terms of student recruitment and student and staff mobility, research collaboration, including funding and TNE activities/operations. Brexit will not have an impact on the mutual recognition of academic and professional qualification between the UK and East Asian countries. This chapter also identifies a number of factors that influence UK universities’ relations with East Asia that are not related to Brexit, but to more general economic, social, political and cultural trends. The most important of these factors are the ongoing trade war between the United States and China and the COVID-19 pandemic, which affect the number of students from East Asia in the UK, and a growing competition from East Asian universities.","Susan Lin, Pei Hsi",A New Beginning or More of the Same?,718,1

The exercise has been made for evaluating the effects of such process for the sustainability of the global economy and society. In this view, we explored how Keynes’ contribution could be useful for the global economy in building a new paradigm of socio-economic development underpinning the transition to circular economy (CE). We also evaluated the adoption of the Global Green New Deal including a case study of Italy for the purpose of suggesting how that topical political programme can be key in the CE transition. Given the urgency of environmental problems, we underline the importance of the adoption of Keynesian expansionary “green mission oriented” fiscal policies with the purpose of allowing the triggering of a virtuous circle of sustainable welfare involving the Green New deal and the transition to CE. At the basis of such virtuous circle, we propose a new paradigm based on a revisited Keynesian paradigm and models of economy within the framework of Genovesi’s “civil economy” that entails an active role and responsibility of all the societal actors (consumers, companies and institutions). In this view, the “spirit” of Keynes in the economy, policy and society could be appreciated once more and be extremely useful along with other scholars’ contributions in accelerating the CE transition and a more sustainable development.","Ghisellini, Patrizia; Passaro, Renato; Ulgiati, Sergio",Circ.Econ.Sust.,718,1

We investigated the impact of the enforced changes on theatre waste due to Covid-19. METHOD: Over a 1week period data on waste bag availability and number of bags of each category of waste per surgical case in an elective theatre complex was collated; this was compared to waste generated during Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Prior to Covid-19 only clinical waste bins were available in many non-dominant clinical areas providing evidence of inappropriate routine disposal of domestic/recyclable waste. Pre-Covid-19 a mean of 6waste bags were used per surgical case (3.7yellow clinical bags, 1.3black domestic bags, 0.4clear recycling bags), with Covid-19 changes to waste management practice the mean number of waste bags used per case increased to 11 (9 orange contaminated bags, 0.5black, 0.3clear bags). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical waste management has a significant economic and environmental impact. Covid-19 has led to nearly all waste being deemed to be contaminated and so requiring incineration, with increased volumes of waste generated per case through widespread adoption of PPE. This has increased cost and reduced the ability to recycle non-contaminated waste.","Luney, C; Little, C",Br J Surg,718,29

To fulfil the above demands, spectrometers such as ultraviolet, Fourier transformation infrared, Raman, HPLC, gas chromatography are used as confirmation tool for identification of materials. The cost and space of above-mentioned instruments are more and to build low-cost spectrometer with high efficiency is a challenging research area for material scientists and engineers. In the present work, an attempt has been made to manufacture a low-cost spectrometer. The spectrometer has been designed using cardboard, DVD, a webcam and free available spectrum software named as theremino. The DVD is used as a diffraction grating and webcam as an image sensor with an overall cost of Rs 1000. This can be used as an instrument for practical demonstration for students and other research purposes for detecting pesticides level in fruits and vegetables, sensing water purity level, edible oils, etc. The spectral range can be improved by removing infrared filter integrated in webcam. The performance of the constructed spectrometer could be upgrade using effective filters and high intense low-cost lasers. This designed spectrometer will be a boon towards application in healthcare, biomedicals and food processing applications.","Likith, G.; Jayram, Naidu Dhanpal; Yaswanth, B.; Sreekanth, D.; Deny, J.; Karuthapandi, M.; Vishwa, S.

The study used the dynamic system GMM framework and found that both aggregate and disaggregated infrastructural development indices impact positively on GDP per capita growth in Africa. These impacts were shown to be significant in all cases, except for the transportation infrastructure index. The results overwhelmingly confirmed the prevalence of the symmetric hypothesis in the infrastructure–growth relationship in Africa. The study also found some evidence in support of the significant roles of capital, labour and initial GDP per capita in Africa’s economic performance, while the role of trade remained negative and muted. The study concluded that through effective public administration, African leaders and policymakers can promote economic performance on the continent by evolving policies that favour increased infrastructural development, human capital development and capital accumulation.","Ekeocha, Davidmac O.; Ogbuabor, Jonathan E.; Orji, Anthony",Econ Change Restruct,718,22

The findings reveal that Twitter social capital is more strongly associated with participation in political organizations while Facebook social capital is more strongly associated with participation in non-political charitable organizations. Between Twitter followers and following, the number of people one follows is more strongly associated with participation in both types of organizations than the number of one’s followers.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of the annual suicide rates for ICE detainees from federal fiscal years (FY) 2010–2020. Death date and cause of death were directly extracted from publicly available ICE Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Library, ICE death reports, and ICE press releases. Annual suicide rates were calculated as suicides per 100,000 person-years and suicides per 100,000 admissions. RESULTS: From 2010–2019, the mean number of suicides per 100,000 person-years was 3.3 (standard deviation (SD): 2.6). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 5.3 times the prior 10-year average to 17.4 suicides per 100,000 person-years. When calculating suicide rate based on admissions per FY, the mean number of suicides from 2010–2019 per 100,000 admissions was 0.3 (SD: 0.3). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 11.0 times the prior 10-year average to 3.4 suicides per 100,000 admissions. CONCLUSION: In 2020, the detainee suicide rate increased substantially compared to the past decade.

A better understanding of subtypes and their different response to therapy is needed and further studies in aetiology are warranted. Larger studies are needed to explore risk factors for developing delirium and for examining long-term consequences. Finally, a stronger focus on experienced delirium and considering the perspectives of both patients and their families is encouraged.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of 70 patients who underwent manual aspiration thrombectomy using Penumbra catheters for treatment of M1 occlusion between January 2012 and December 2014. We evaluated immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes through review of patient electronic medical records. RESULTS Male was the dominant sex in this study (M:F = 38:32) and median age was 72 (age range, 36-91). The rate of successful recanalization (TICI grade ≥2 b) was 91.4% (64/70). The successful recanalization rate by single Penumbra was 82.9% (58/70). Six patients were treated in combination with Solitaire stent. Median NIHSS score was 11 (range, 4-20) at admission and was 3 (range 0-23) at discharge. Favorable clinical outcomes (mRS score at three months ≤2) were seen in 42 patients (60%). Two patients were observed to have subarachnoid hemorrhage after the procedure. Another two patients died related to massive symptomatic hemorrhage, brain edema and herniation in the hospital.

FBG feedback enhances the stability of P1 oscillations compared to the conventional mirror feedback in the form of P1 microwave linewidth and phase noise reduction and residual noise peaks suppression. In the proposed scheme, the FBG has a narrow bandwidth smaller than the laser relaxation oscillation frequency. Then it effectively suppresses the coherence collapse of the laser by filtered feedback. Hence it can keep the laser in P1 operation even under relatively strong feedback. Besides, a uniform FBG has a comb-filtered reflectivity spectrum with a main lobe surrounded by several side lobes. Hence it can limit the external cavity modes by each lobe. As a result, FBG feedback can reduce microwave linewidth and phase noise by sustaining stronger feedback power and improve side-peak suppression ratio (SPSR) by filtering external cavity modes. The effects of stabilization are enhanced by properly increasing grating bandwidth. By fine-tuning the feedback delay time, the microwave linewidth can be reduced to a local minimum which reveals the optimal locking between P1 frequency and one of the external cavity modes. Increasing the feedback delay time, the local minimum linewidth can be further reduced. FBG feedback reduces the microwave linewidth by up to more than an order of magnitude and improves the SPSR by up to more than two orders of magnitude than mirror feedback using the same delay time.","Li, Song-Sui; Zou, Xihua; Wang, Longsheng; Wang, Anbang; Pan, Wei; Yan, Lianshan",Optics express,718,26

Hampered vision is commonly caused by laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF), which has prompted the development of various antifogging fluids and warming devices. However, limited comparative evidence exists in contemporary literature. Despite technologic advancements there remains no consensus as to superior methods to prevent LLF or restore visual acuity once LLF has occurred. We performed a review of literature to present the current body of evidence supporting the use of numerous techniques. METHODS A standardized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis review was performed, and PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. Articles pertaining to mechanisms and prevention of LLF were reviewed. We applied no limit to year of publication or publication type and all articles encountered were included in final review. Limited original research and heterogenous outcome measures precluded meta-analytical assessment. RESULTS Vision loss has a multitude of causes and although scientific theory can be applied to in vivo environments, no authors have completely characterized this complex problem. No method to prevent or correct LLF was identified as superior to others and comparative evidence is minimal. Robotic LLF was poorly investigated and aside from a single analysis has not been directly compared to standard laparoscopic fogging in any capacity. CONCLUSIONS Obscured vision during surgery is hazardous and typically caused by LLF. The etiology of LLF despite application of scientific theory is yet to be definitively proven in the in vivo environment. Common methods of prevention of LLF or restoration of vision due to LLF have little evidence-based data to support their use. A multiarm comparative in vivo analysis is required to formally assess these commonly used techniques in both standard and robotic laparoscopes.","Manning, Todd G; Perera, Marlon; Christidis, Daniel; Kinnear, Ned; McGrath, Shannon; O'Beirne, Richard; Zotov, Paul; Bolton, Damien; Lawrentschuk, Nathan",Journal of endourology,718,1

This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans. However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans. To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131). Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower. These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains. Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in env, a G413R substitution in gp120. The infectivity of the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 was significantly higher than that of parental MB897. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the gp120 G413R mutant of MB897 augments the capacity for viral replication in both in vitro cell cultures and humanized mice. Taken together, this is the first experimental investigation to use an animal model to demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz into pandemic HIV-1.IMPORTANCE From the mid-20th century, humans have been exposed to the menace of infectious viral diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. These outbreaks of emerging/reemerging viruses can be triggered by cross-species viral transmission from wild animals to humans, or zoonoses. HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, emerged by the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz, the HIV-1 precursor in chimpanzees, around 100 years ago. However, the process by which SIVcpz evolved to become HIV-1 in humans remains unclear. Here, by using a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized-mouse model, we experimentally recapitulate the evolutionary process of SIVcpz to become HIV-1. We provide evidence suggesting that a strain of SIVcpz, MB897, preadapted to infect humans over other SIVcpz strains. We further demonstrate a gain-of-function evolution of SIVcpz in infected humanized mice. Our study reveals that pandemic HIV-1 has emerged through at least two steps: preadaptation and subsequent gain-of-function mutations.","Sato, Kei; Misawa, Naoko; Takeuchi, Junko S; Kobayashi, Tomoko; Izumi, Taisuke; Aso, Hirofumi; Nagaoka, Shumpei; Yamamoto, Keisuke; Kimura, Izumi; Konno, Yoriyuki; Nakano, Yusuke; Koyanagi, Yoshio",Journal of virology,718,13

Stratification by aneurysm size and location is essential for correct evaluation of treatment outcomes and risks of flow diversion. OBJECTIVE To compare neurological and anatomic outcomes and evaluate the risk of complications after endovascular treatment of large or giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with FD/FDs alone or together with coil embolization. METHODS We reviewed all patients with large or giant, ruptured or unruptured ICA aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with flow diversion alone (group A) or with concomitant coiling (group B) in 4 international institutions between 2010 and 2015. Anatomic outcome was evaluated using the Byrne scale on digital subtraction angiography and/or angioMRI and/or angioCT scans 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS We collected 44 patients with large or giant ICA aneurysms. Four patients (9%) presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). FD/FDs were used alone in 26 patients and in combination with coil embolization in the 18 remaining patients. The mortality rate due to procedure-related and/or neurological complications was 2.2%. Twelve months after the procedure, 88.6% (n = 39) of patients had a favorable neurological outcome. One year after the procedure, the aneurysm was completely occluded in 72.7% of patients: 61.5% (16/18) in group A and 88.9% (16/26) in group B. CONCLUSION Clinical outcomes and rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Better anatomic results using FD/FDs combined with coils were documented 6 months after the procedure; this option seems to provide a higher aneurysm occlusion rate and reduce the need for retreatment.","Peschillo, Simone; Caporlingua, Alessandro; Resta, Maria Chiara; Peluso, Jo Peter Paul; Burdi, Nicola; Sourour, Nader; Diana, Francesco; Guidetti, Giulio; Clarençon, Frédéric; Bloemsma, Gijs Coenraad; Di Maria, Federico; Donatelli, Massimo; Resta, Maurizio",Operative neurosurgery,718,17

However, the evidence for an association between PFAS and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) is equivocal and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between background levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and the development of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in a Canadian pregnancy cohort. We also explored the potential for effect modification according to fetal sex. METHODS Maternal plasma samples were collected in the first trimester from participants in the MIREC study and were analyzed for PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS. Blood pressure was measured during each trimester. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were defined using the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines. Logistic regression models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between PFAS concentrations (per doubling of concentration as well as according to tertiles) and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association between PFAS concentrations and changes in blood pressure throughout pregnancy. RESULTS Data from 1739 participants were analyzed. 90% of women were normotensive throughout pregnancy, 7% developed gestational hypertension without preeclampsia, and 3% developed preeclampsia. In the full analyses, neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. However, each doubling of PFHxS plasma concentration was associated with higher odds of developing preeclampsia (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). In addition, participants in the highest PFHxS tertile (1.4-40.0 μg/L) had higher odds of developing preeclampsia relative to those in the lowest tertile (OR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.27, 7.39). In stratified analyses, this effect was only apparent among women carrying a female fetus (OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 1.02, 22.3). However, among women carrying a male fetus, both PFOS and PFHxS were associated with gestational hypertension, but not preeclampsia. Higher plasma concentrations of all three PFAS were associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy, and PFOA and PFHxS were also associated with systolic blood pressure. Discrepant findings were similarly revealed in analyses stratified by fetal sex. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of PFHxS were associated with the development of preeclampsia, but not gestational hypertension. Neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with either outcome. However, we show, for the first time, that fetal sex may modify these associations, a finding which warrants replication and further study.","Borghese, Michael M; Walker, Mark; Helewa, Michael E; Fraser, William D; Arbuckle, Tye E",Environment international,718,0

During the investigation, it was determined that all persons who met the CDC contact exposure guidelines would undergo COVID testing, which consequently was 109 team members due to the exposure risk identified in the break room space. Infection Prevention worked with the Anesthesia Pre-Op Clinic to test all team members identified over a 3-day period (approximately 5-7 days post-exposure). CONCLUSIONS Out of the 109 team members who were tested post-exposure, there were zero conversions. The department attributes this to the consistency in PPE training, support and collaboration between Anesthesia and Infection Prevention led to successful care for COVID patients with a limited provider infection rate as evidenced by our low sero-positivity rate amongst healthcare providers when multiple team members tested positive and unknowingly exposed other team members in the department.","Holdsworth, Jill; Sanford, Dr Jay",American journal of infection control,718,1

Sustained mTORC1 activity favors the generation of terminally differentiated effector T cells instead of follicular helper and memory T cells. This is particularly pertinent for T cell responses of older adults who have sustained mTORC1 activation despite dysfunctional lysosomes. Here, we show that lysosome-deficient T cells rely on late endosomes rather than lysosomes as an mTORC1 activation platform, where mTORC1 is activated by sensing cytosolic amino acids. T cells from older adults have an increased expression of the plasma membrane leucine transporter SLC7A5 to provide a cytosolic amino acid source. Hence, SLC7A5 and VPS39 deficiency (a member of the HOPS complex promoting early to late endosome conversion) substantially reduced mTORC1 activities in T cells from older but not young individuals. Late endosomal mTORC1 is independent of the negative-feedback loop involving mTORC1-induced inactivation of the transcription factor TFEB that controls expression of lysosomal genes. The resulting sustained mTORC1 activation impaired lysosome function and prevented lysosomal degradation of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells from older adults, thereby inhibiting their proliferative responses. VPS39 silencing of human T cells improved their expansion to pertussis and to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of CD4+ Vps39-deficient LCMV-specific SMARTA cells improved germinal center responses, CD8+ memory T cell generation, and recall responses to infection. Thus, curtailing late endosomal mTORC1 activity is a promising strategy to enhance T cell immunity.","Jin, Jun; Kim, Chulwoo; Xia, Qiong; Gould, Timothy M; Cao, Wenqiang; Zhang, Huimin; Li, Xuanying; Weiskopf, Daniela; Grifoni, Alba; Sette, Alessandro; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jorg J",Science immunology,718,24

Stopping medicines (deprescribing) that are no longer needed can be beneficial to reduce the risk of adverse events. We summarized the willingness of patients and their caregivers towards deprescribing. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in four databases from inception until April 30, 2021 as well as search of citation of included articles. Studies that reported patients' and/or their caregivers' attitude towards deprescribing quantitatively were included. All studies were independently screened, reviewed, and data extracted in duplicates. Patients and caregivers willingness to deprescribe their regular medication was pooled using random effects meta-analysis of proportions. RESULTS Twenty-nine unique studies involving 11,049 participants were included. All studies focused on the attitude of the patients towards deprescribing, and 7 studies included caregivers' perspective. Overall, 87.6% (95% CI: 83.3 to 91.4%) patients were willing to deprescribe their medication, based upon the doctors' suggestions. This was lower among caregivers, with only 74.8% (49.8% to 93.8%) willing to deprescribe their care recipients' medications. Patients' or caregivers' willingness to deprescribe were not influenced by study location, study population, or the number of medications they took. DISCUSSION Most patients and their caregivers were willing to deprescribe their medications, whenever possible and thus should be offered a trial of deprescribing. Nevertheless, as these tools have a poor predictive ability, patients and their caregivers should be engaged during the deprescribing process to ensure that the values and opinions are heard, which would ultimately improve patient safety. In terms of limitation, as not all studies may published the methods and results of measurement they used, this may impact the methodological quality and thus our findings.

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent SMA stenting with EPDs from 2007 to 2016. EPDs were used selectively in patients with occlusions, severe calcification, or acute thrombus. A two-wire technique with SpiderFX 0.014-inch filter wire (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) combined with a 0.018-inch wire was used to provide support and to facilitate stenting and EPD retrieval. Presence of macroscopic debris in the EPD was recorded and graded as minor (minimal debris) or major (large thrombus or plaque). End points were technical success, presence of EPD debris, embolization, early morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS SMA stenting was performed in 179 patients, of whom 65 (36%) had EPDs. The mean age was 73 ± 11 years, and 49 were female (75%). Clinical presentation was CMI in 48 patients (74%) and AMI or acute-on-CMI in 17 (26%). Indications for EPD were severe calcification in 22 patients (34%), acute thrombus in 18 (28%), and total occlusion in 16 (25%). Bare-metal stents were used in 33 patients, covered stents in 26, and both types in 6. Adjunctive therapy included thrombolysis in seven patients, thrombectomy in four, and atherectomy in three. Technical success was 100%. There were no instances of filter retention or arterial trauma due to filter manipulation. Distal embolization was noted in four patients (6%), of whom two had AMI. All large emboli were retrieved using catheter aspiration devices, but one small distal embolus was left untreated with no clinical consequences. Two patients had vessel spasm treated by nitroglycerin. Macroscopic debris was noted in 43 patients (66%) and was major in 21 (49%) or minor in 22 (51%). Of the patients with AMI, five (29%) required exploratory laparotomy and four (23%) had bowel resection. Eight additional patients (12%) had early complications (five CMI, three AMI), including cardiac complications, brachial hematoma, acute cholecystitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in two patients each. There were no deaths among CMI patients and two early deaths (12%) among those who had AMI. CONCLUSIONS Use of EPDs during SMA stenting is safe and feasible with a two-wire technique. Large macroscopic debris was noted in one-third of the patients when the filter was applied selectively in patients with acute symptoms, occlusions, or severely calcified lesions. Despite the use of EPD, distal embolization occurred in 6% of patients and was successfully treated using catheter aspiration devices.","Mendes, Bernardo C; Oderich, Gustavo S; Tallarita, Tiziano; Kanamori, Karina S; Kalra, Manju; DeMartino, Randall R; Shuja, Fahad; Johnstone, Jill K",Journal of vascular surgery,718,17

We aimed to explore a refined stratification mode based on the integrated analysis of ctDNA tracking. METHODS ctDNA was prospectively collected at baseline and every eight weeks in advanced treatment-naïve EGFR-mutant LUAD patients under gefitinib treatment enrolled in a phase II trial, and analyzed using next-generation sequencing of a 168-gene panel. RESULTS Three subgroups categorized by baseline co-mutations: EGFR-sensitizing mutations (59, 32.8%), EGFR-sensitizing mutations with tumor suppressor mutations (97, 53.9%) and EGFR-sensitizing mutations with other driver mutations (24, 13.3%), exhibited distinct progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [PFS 13.2 (11.3-15.2) vs. 9.3 (7.6-10.5) vs. 4.0 (2.4-9.3) months; OS 32.0 (29.2-41.5) vs. 21.7 [(19.3-27.0) vs. 15.5 (10.5-33.7) months], providing evidence for initial stratification. 63.7% of the patients achieved week-8 ctDNA-clearance, with significant difference among three subgroups (74.5% vs. 64.0% vs. 29.4%, P=0.004, fisher's exact test). Patients without week-8 ctDNA-clearance had worse PFS [clearance vs. non-clearance 11.2 (9.9-13.2) vs. 7.4 (5.6-9.6) months, P=0.016, cox regression], especially in the second subgroup [5.8 (5.6-11.5) months], suggesting the necessity of adaptive stratification during treatment. During follow-up, 56.0% and 20.8% of the patients eventually harbored p.T790M and non-p.T790M mutations, with significant difference in non-p.T790M mutations among three subgroups (7.5% vs. 15.7% vs. 80.0%, P<0.001, fisher's exact test), giving clues to post-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS The patients with baseline co-mutations and ctDNA non-clearance at first visit might require combined therapy due to limited survival benefit of EGFR-TKI monotherapy. We proposed a refined stratification mode for the whole-course management of EGFR-mutant LUAD.","Duan, Jianchun; Xu, JiaChen; Wang, Zhijie; Bai, Hua; Cheng, Ying; An, Tongtong; Gao, Hongjun; Wang, Kai; Zhou, Qing; Hu, Yanping; Song, Yong; Ding, Cuimin; Peng, Feng; Liang, Li; Hu, Yi; Huang, Cheng; Zhou, Caicun; Shi, Yuankai; Han, Jiefei; Wang, Di; Tian, Yanhua; Yang, Zhenlin; Zhang, Li; Chuai, Shaokun; Ye, Junyi; Zhu, Guanshan; Zhao, Junhui; Wu, Yi-Long; Wang, Jie",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,718,1

This employed quantitative and qualitative methods through a survey and an interview respectively sought to gather data from 639 university students. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and narrative analysis. Results revealed that most mothers are high school graduates, while fathers enjoy an elementary-level and belong to under low-income families. Most students possess just mobile phones and use mobile data as their primary internet access source, ranging from moderate to poor connection. Also, the majority are not fully equipped with enough skills in digital media. For challenges, students experienced the unavailability of a network, economic instability, digital divide, the shortage of digital devices, distractive learning environment, expensive internet data, health-related problems, lack of resources, lack of digital literacy skills, and loss of motivation .Hence, even if flexible online learning is the best solution for the university to replace face-to-face classes, it is not best applicable and suitable to all students living in rural areas or other places with an unstable network and students who belong to financially unstable families.

Delays in diagnosis are common [1], awareness is low, and paediatric rheumatological conditions have a considerable impact on young people and their families [2]. A lack of understanding amongst families of newly-diagnosed children leads to uncertainty and anxiety. Objectives: This patient and parent-led project developed a resource pack for parents of CYP newly-diagnosed with JIA, to provide information and support. Following a pilot, feedback from recipients was collated and analysed to help improve future provision. Methods: A young person with JIA identified the need for direct family support. Juvenile Arthritis Research (a UK charity) developed a unique pack of support information, containing resources for both children and their families -called A Little Box Of Hope. This included information about JIA and support services available for families, as well as Kipo (a children's book about JIA) and accompanying finger puppet. Clinicians at one paediatric rheumatology centre provided information about the packs to newly diagnosed families, who then requested a free box to be posted to them. Following an initial pilot study, recipients were invited to complete a short online questionnaire and provide feedback to allow refinement of the provision. Results: Respondents were asked a series of questions, each on a scale of 1-5. Every respondent gave a score of 5 in response to What do you think of the idea of A Little Box Of Hope Every parent of children under ten years old gave a score of 5 for every item when asked How useful is each item in your Little Box Of Hope Respondents also gave free-text comments: ∗ It was very well thought out and I felt supported ∗ I know so much more about JIA now than I did before. I cannot thank you enough. ∗ It was extremely useful and made me feel supported during a very stressful time and this enabled me to support my son more effectively. ∗ It made my daughter feel less alone. Some parents of older children felt that some information specifically for teens would be useful, and a Teen pack is being developed. Conclusion: Recipients of A Little Box Of Hope have found the information useful and feel supported. Following the pilot study, we have developed My JIA, a booklet reviewed by a multi-disciplinary clinical team, with comprehensive information for families affected by JIA. A Teen pack, for children aged around 10 years or older, is being developed to provide targeted support to this group. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected access to healthcare services, increasing the need for remote parent-and charity-provided support through A Little Box Of Hope. As such, we intend to expedite the roll-out of the project across the country building on the success of the pilot project.","Chibnell-Smith, S.; Chibnell-Smith, A.

The tail risk measure peaks at stock market crashes, financial crises, political shocks and disaster events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, I find that tail risk is countercyclical, has strong predictive power for market returns and negatively predicts real economic activity. In order to identify the investors’ concerns associated with tail risk, I extract daily news from the largest financial newspaper in Brazil. The co-movement between news and tail risk indicates that tail risk variation is mainly driven by disaster concerns, followed by economic and government uncertainty. While economic uncertainty explains the countercyclical property of tail risk, investors only require compensation for bearing tail risk implied by disaster concerns. Similarly, tail risk negatively impacts real outcomes because of the disaster concerns that it identifies.

As a result, the efficacy of most antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann and Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high efficacy, the viral load as well as the number of infected cells monotonously decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as a function of time. We show that the term related to the basic reproduction ratio increases when the CTL response step up.

This research focuses on one of the aspects of this problem, aiming to analyse interregional interactions, the activation of which can become a driver of growth. Based on the idea of ‘double circulation’ from the China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, we demonstrate that Russia also has the ability to shift the focus of economic policy towards expanding the domestic market and developing ties between regions. The paper draws parallels between the early 1920s and 2020s. It is noted that the need to overcome economic depression was determined by justifying close cooperation of individual regions in Russia. The article describes the use of interregional interactions as a tool for spatial development based on the existing federal strategic plans. The study demonstrates that that the task of strengthening interregional interactions is only briefly touched upon in the plans. However, it is important to note that this process balances the constraints and opportunities for the development of the whole country. The analysis of the spatial markets’ hierarchy in the context of economic macroregions revealed their incomplete nature as complete economic systems. The obtained results show that in order for the idea of macro-regions to actually work, real interregional projects should appear inside of these macro-regions. It is determined that on the international level the demand for special tools for enhancing interregional interactions is gradually growing. The author proposes measures based on successful examples to support such interregional interactions in Russia. Finally, the author concludes that in the current situation the increase in interregional interactions can positively affect the economic development of Russia as well as create new spatially distributed value-added chains. © Котов А.В., 2021","Kotov, A.

Mitigation practices of physical distancing and sheltering-in-place continue to impose a significant burden on face-to-face healthcare visits. As a result, telehealth adoption and utilization have increased significantly after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services waived telehealth payment requirements. These changes have been rapid and affect both individuals and organizations, ranging from healthcare and technology to news and policy. We turn to Twitter, as a broad-reaching communication platform, to elucidate and characterize Telehealth communication patterns. While different aspects of tweeting about telehealth have been used to answer specific questions, we sought to understand the collective telehealth tweeting behavior as a system of different types of users tweeting with various intent and sentiment. Such an approach combines the typically independent analysis of structure, using social network analysis, and purpose or function of communication, with topic analysis and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we apply a systems-based approach-called hetero-functional graph theory-to comprehensively describe the structure and function of the Twitter Telehealth communication system. We modeled 13 different types of telehealth users and 15 combinations of tweet intent and sentiment, which together describe 195 system capabilities. We applied machine learning to classify individual user tweeting behavior for different classes of telehealth stakeholders. We identified several patterns of longitudinal tweeting behaviors that varied by system form and function. By applying an interdependent methodology to understand both form and function, we provide deeper insights into tweeting behaviors between different classes of stakeholders. In doing so, we achieve a greater understanding of the various needs of different stakeholders, which can be leveraged as a valuable resource in informing more equitable policies as telehealth becomes a more permanent and scaled healthcare delivery service. © 2021 IEEE.","Lit, C.

The recommendation only specifies semantics for non-recursive SHACL; recently, some efforts have been made to allow recursive SHACL schemas. In this paper, we argue that for defining and studying semantics of recursive SHACL, lessons can be learned from years of research in non-monotonic reasoning. We show that from a SHACL schema, a three-valued semantic operator can directly be obtained. Building on Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT), this operator immediately induces a wide variety of semantics, including a supported, stable, and well-founded semantics, related in the expected ways. By building on AFT, a rich body of theoretical results becomes directly available for SHACL. As such, the main contribution of this short paper is providing theoretical foundations for the study of recursive SHACL, which can later enable an informed decision for an extension of the W3C recommendation.","Bogaerts, Bart; Jakubowski, Maxime",,718,25

However, population-representative variations in the total burden of psychiatric episodes across cancer types and treatment modalities have not been examined. We sought to estimate the risk of self-harm after incident psychiatric disorder diagnosis in patients with cancer, and the risk of unnatural deaths after self-harm. Design, Setting, Participants Population-based cohort study with multiphase study designs. Population-based linked patient records in England (1998-2020) from primary care practices, hospitals, cancer registry and death registry were employed. We identified 459,542 individuals age [≥] 18 years with an incident diagnosis of a site-specific cancer of interest. Main outcome measures Using outpatient and inpatient records, we identified patients with five psychiatric disorders of interest: depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality disorder. Cumulative burden for all psychiatric events was estimated using the mean cumulative count method. We considered 10 cancer treatment regimens, 11 chemotherapy drug classes, deprivation status and 21 non-cancer comorbidities in stratified analyses. Propensity score matching was employed to identify controls who did not have any record of a psychiatric disorder of interest. For each psychiatric disorder category, we fitted a Cox regression model to estimate the risk of self-harm. We also estimated the risk of all-cause mortality and excess years of life lost comparing patients with and without psychiatric disorders. A separate matched cohort was generated to explore the risk of suicide and unnatural deaths following self-harm. Results Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder in patients with cancer, where some of the highest cumulative burdens were observed in patients with testicular cancer (98.05 per 100 individuals [CI: 83.08-127.25]), cervical cancer (78.74 [73.61-90.14]) and Hodgkin lymphoma (69.87 [61.05-69.48]) by age 60. Patients who received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery had the highest cumulative burden of psychiatric disorders, while patients who received radiotherapy alone had the lowest burden. Patients treated with alkylating agent chemotherapeutics had the highest burden of psychiatric disorders while those treated with kinase inhibitors had the lowest burden. Among patients with cancer, 5,683 individuals were identified as having an incident self-harm episode. A previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorder before self-harm was at least twice as prevalent than a subsequent diagnosis of psychiatric disorder where the prevalence ratio was the highest in patients with brain tumours (5.36, CI: 4.57-6.14). Younger individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness before the first self-harm episode. However, individuals from more deprived regions (2.46, CI: 2.32-2.60) and individuals with [≥]4 pre-existing comorbidities (2.19, CI: 1.92-2.46) were less likely to be diagnosed with mental illness before self-harm. Patients with mental illness had a higher cumulative burden of self-harm events compared with matched controls. All mental illnesses were associated with an increased risk of subsequent self-harm, where the highest risk was observed within 12 months of the mental illness diagnosis. Risks of self-harm during the first year in matched cohorts were as follow: depression (adjusted HR 44.1, CI: 34.0-57.1), anxiety disorder (HR 21.1, CI: 16.4-27.0) and schizophrenia (HR 7.5, CI: 5.0-11.2). Patients with cancer and psychiatric disorder experienced excess years of life lost. Patients who harmed themselves were 6.8 times more likely to die of unnatural causes of death compared with controls within 12 months of self-harm (HR 6.8, CI: 4.3-10.7). The risk of unnatural death after 12 months was markedly lower (HR 2.0, CI: 1.5-2.7). Conclusions This study quantifies the total burden of psychiatric events and self-harm in patients with cancer. The cumulative burden of psychiatric events varies across cancer type, treatment regimen and chemotherapy type. Incident psychiatric disorder diagnoses were significantly associated with increased risk of subsequent self-harm, where risks varied across psychiatric diagnostic categories and follow-up periods. Patients who harm themselves experienced the highest risk of dying from unnatural deaths within the first year of self-harm. We provide an extensive knowledge base to help inform collaborative cancer-psychiatric care initiatives by prioritising patients who are most at risk.","Chang, W. H.; Lai, A. G.",,718,22

We generalize the Multivariate Asymmetric Laplace (MAL) joint quantile regression of Petrella and Raponi (2019) to a time-varying setting, which allows us to specify a dynamic process for the evolution of both VaR and ES of each asset. The proposed methodology accounts for the dependence structure among asset returns. By exploiting the properties of the MAL distribution, we then propose a new portfolio optimization method that minimizes the portfolio risk and controls for well-known characteristics of financial data. We evaluate the advantages of the proposed approach on both simulated and real data, using weekly returns on three major stock market indices. We show that our method outperforms other existing models and provides more accurate risk measure forecasts compared to univariate ones.","Merlo, Luca; Petrella, Lea; Raponi, Valentina",,718,7

The ability of the cold rolling emulsion to prevent corrosion on the cold rolled steel, the mild steel coolant tank, the mill housing and pipelines stems from the presence of oil soluble corrosion inhibitors, anti-oxidants or anti-wear additives present in rolling oil formulation. During normal operational conditions, the mill coolant (mixture of oil and water) along with the generated iron fines is continuously recirculated through the rolling mill application system. The concentration of the coolant is maintained by periodic addition of oil and demineralized water in the system. During Covid-19 unprecedented lockdown, voluminous corrosion was observed in the inner walls of coolant tanks, pipelines and other accessories, which remained in contact with the emulsion. Though normal rolling operations were halted, the bath temperature and recirculation of the mill coolant were maintained to sustain the emulsion health against bacterial attack. It has been earlier observed that during indefinite mill shutdowns, if emulsion is left without heating, circulation and stirring the health of emulsion deteriorates leaving a characteristic rancid odor which resembles bacterial attack. This study primarily highlights the role of acidic by-products formed due to depletion of anti-oxidants leading to rapid deterioration of emulsion triggering corrosion within the roll coolant tank. Techniques, like FTIR, SEM-EDS and Raman Spectroscopy were employed to understand the morphology and nature of the corrosion. Corrosion rust formed after simulation under accelerated laboratory conditions was finally subjected to Raman Spectroscopy, and Protective Ability Index (PAI) was applied to verify the variation in rust protection ability of the fresh and lockdown period rolling oil. It clearly shows the connection between the loss of protective nature of the rust and increase in acidity due to lockdown leading to accelerated corrosion of the tank system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chakraborty, S.; Giri, S.

However, less information is available about the peculiarities of such attitude of the most vulnerable groups including chronic somatic patients who are in need of operative treatment.ObjectivesTo identify the specificity of preoperative cardiac surgery patients’ attitudes toward COVID-19 as compared to that of healthy people.MethodsWe used the Attitudes towards COVID-19 questionnaire (Nikolaev E.) to survey 60 preoperative cardiac patients and 327 healthy university students. Difference validity was assessed with significance level of p<0.05.ResultsCardiac patients are more likely to trust the government measures to fight COVID-19 (t=3.131;p=.002), and their COVID-19-related fears for their life are higher (t=2.793;p=.005). As compared to healthy people, patients are less likely to think that pandemic broke their customary way of life (t=-2.793;p=.005) and plans for the future (t=-3.337;p=.000). Credibly more often than healthy people, cardiac surgery patients consider that it is useless to wear a mask and limit contacts, as any person will eventually catch the virus (t=2.401;p=.017). We did not reveal any more evidently expressed COVID-19-related anxiety in preoperative cardiac surgery patients.ConclusionsAttitudes of cardiac surgery patients toward COVID-19 manifest in an adequate assessment of threat to their personal health, trust in the government measures, and readiness to change their daily plans.

Methods: The NCT MOBILE trial was a monocentric open-label randomized controlled clinical trial of patients with solid tumors undergoing systemic cancer therapy with need of a follow-up visit with their consulting physician at outpatient clinics. 66 patients were 1:1 randomized to receive either a standard in-person follow-up visit at outpatient clinics or a video call via a mobile phone application. The primary outcome was feasibility defined as the number of successful appointments at the first follow up visit. Secondary outcomes included success rate of further video calls, time spent by patient and physician, patient satisfaction, and quality of physician-patient relationship. Findings: Success rate of the first follow up visit in the intention-to-treat cohort was 87.8% for in-person visits and 78.7% for video calls (p=0.51, RR=0.88-1.43 95%CI). The most common reasons for failure were software incompatibility (12%) in the video call and no-show (6%) in the in-person visit arm. The success rate for further video visits was 91.6% (11 of 12 calls). Standardized patient questionnaires showed significantly decreased total time spent and less direct costs for patients (95 to 246min 95%CI, & 4.8 to 23.9 Euro 95%CI) and comparable time spent for physicians in the video call arm (-6.4 to 5.4min 95%CI).

It became clear that high volume inter-hospital transfers would be required to dissipate capacity pressures across the region and prevent units from becoming overwhelmed. However, ICU transfers are highly complex, requiring specialist teams and intensive coordination – resources that individual units could not spare - and to perform this at scale presented a real challenge.In response, the North West London Critical Care Network (NWLCCN) rapidly created an ICU ‘Transfer Hub’ to coordinate the strategy and logistics of capacity transfers. It was staffed by three doctors who communicated closely with ICU leads for real-time metrics on the fluctuating capacity pressures to plan the volume and destinations of patient transfers. An emergency bank of stand-by transfer volunteers was created, consisting of 69 critical care clinicians from across London, and the Hub partnered with a staff-bank management app to create a bespoke digital platform to facilitate shift scheduling and payment. This automation provided a way to onboard new staff swiftly and scale the bank with ease.Between 17 March - 6 May 2020, the Hub coordinated the transfer of 238 patients, at its peak organising 13 patient transfers in a single day - the highest frequency of ICU transfers ever carried out in NWL.These inter-hospital transfers were essential for NWL to cope with pandemic-driven ICU admission pressures and created greater equity of access to critical care for patients. The strengths of a network uniting to deliver mutual aid were maximised by having a single hub as the conduit to support information flow and co-ordinate decision making. Partnering with a tech platform and having access to key decision-makers were other enablers that allowed the Hub to innovate at pace and their experience has informed discussions about developing a pan-London ICU transfers service.","Taylor, Emily Hai lin Leung Pett Eleanor Walsh Angela",BMJ Leader,718,25

Activation of T2Rs leads to calcium-driven NO production that increases cilia beating and directly kills bacteria. Several airway diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, are characterized by epithelial remodeling, including loss of motile cilia and/or squamous metaplasia. To understand the function of T2Rs within the altered landscape of airway disease, we studied T2Rs in non-ciliated airway cell lines and primary cells de-differentiated to a squamous phenotype. In differentiated cells, T2Rs localize to cilia, however in de-differentiated, non-ciliated cells they localize to the nucleus. Cilia and nuclear import utilize many shared proteins, thus in the absence of motile cilia some T2Rs may target to the nucleus. T2R agonists selectively elevated both nuclear and mitochondrial calcium through a G-protein-coupled receptor, phospholipase C, and InsP3 receptor-dependent mechanism. Additionally, T2R agonists decreased nuclear cAMP, increased nitric oxide, and increased cGMP, consistent with T2R signaling. Furthermore, exposure to T2R agonists led to nuclear calcium-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. T2R agonists induced apoptosis in primary bronchial and nasal cells differentiated at air-liquid interface but then induced to a squamous phenotype by apical submersion. Air-exposed well-differentiated cells did not die. This T2R-induced apoptosis may be a last-resort defense against infection, possibly when bacteria have breached the epithelial barrier and reach non-ciliated cells below. However, it may also increase susceptibility of de-differentiated or remodeled epithelia to damage by bacterial metabolites. Moreover, the T2R-activated apoptosis pathway occurs in airway cancer cells. T2Rs may thus contribute to microbiome-tumor cell crosstalk in airway cancers. T2R agonists may also be useful topical therapeutics (e.g., delivered by nasal rinse or nebulizer) for activating airway cancer cell apoptosis without killing surrounding differentiated tissue.","McMahon, Derek B.; Kuek, Li Eon; Johnson, Madeline E.; Johnson, Paige O.; Horn, Rachel L.J.; Carey, Ryan M.; Adappa, Nithin D.; Palmer, James N.; Lee, Robert J.",bioRxiv,718,28

Here, we investigated the role of RABL6A in pNET progression in vivo using a well-established model of the disease. RIP-Tag2 (RT2) mice develop functional pNETs (insulinomas) due to SV40 large T-antigen expression in pancreatic islet β cells. RABL6A loss in RT2 mice significantly delayed pancreatic tumor formation, reduced tumor angiogenesis and mitoses, and extended survival. Those effects correlated with upregulation of anti-angiogenic p19ARF and downregulation of proangiogenic c-Myc in RABL6A-deficient islets and tumors. Our findings demonstrate that RABL6A is a bona fide oncogenic driver of pNET angiogenesis and development in vivo.","Maharjan, Chandra K.; Kaemmer, Courtney A.; Muniz, Viviane P.; Bauchle, Casey; Mott, Sarah L.; Zamba, K.D.; Breheny, Patrick; Leidinger, Mariah R.; Darbro, Benjamin W.; Stephens, Samuel B.; Meyerholz, David K.; Quelle, Dawn E.",bioRxiv,718,1

Training programs must educate physicians to perform regional blocks safely and efficiently. Hands-on learning with simulation and live models is the gold standard. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly hampered our ability to safely hold in-person workshops. We describe an at-home, guided virtual workshop using portable ultrasound to safely continue experiential trainee education. The primary objective of this pilot virtual workshop was to develop an effective experiential learning program without the need for live child models. The main goal was to give trainees hands-on experience obtaining anatomical ultrasound images necessary for regional anesthesia blocks in a guided-virtual setting and to evaluate the effectiveness of skills acquisition. This workshop included two pediatric anesthesiology fellows and a pediatric anesthesiologist. Trainees were instructed on ultrasound-guided regional block acquisition. For two weeks, trainees acquired images/movies of regional block anatomy at home using their own children. Virtual video assistance was available. Trainees then used acquired images/movies to discuss needle and local anesthetic placement with a pediatric regional anesthesiologist. Trainees completed pre-and post-workshop surveys assessing attitudes, perceived educational efficacy, and procedural skill acquisition. The faculty member also assessed trainees' skills. The virtual workshop was successful. Trainees expressed successful active learning and increased comfort in performing regional blocks on live patients. They correctly identified relevant anatomy of acquired images/movies, as well as needle and local anesthetic placement at the time of debriefing. Faculty were pleased with trainees' initial performance of regional blocks. Adapting an in-person workshop to an at-home guided experience is a safe, feasible, and well-received method for anesthesiology trainees to obtain experiential learning of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. This facilitated at-home learning experience allows for hands-on skill practice while preventing exposure of child models to the hospital setting during a pandemic.","Greenberg, M. R.; Lawrence, M.

Among them were more Russian students than international ones (p=.0272). They also certainly exceeded the students with the developed anti-suicidal barrier in taking alcohol (p=.0126), in underestimating their own health (p=.0053), in expressing happiness (p=.0001), and in degree of religious belief (p=.0001). They perceived the situation associated with the COVID-19 outbreak with a more strongly manifested anxiety due to the fear of their own infection with coronavirus (p=0.0347). At the same time, they acted less responsibly in following personal restrictive measures aimed to reduce the risk of infection (p=.0002).ConclusionsStudents with suicidal tendencies during the COVID-19 outbreak present a risk group in COVID-19 spread and infection. The pandemic can intensify anti-vital sufferings and enhance the risk of committing suicide in individuals with suicidal tendencies, which should be taken into account in prevention programs.","Nikolaev, E.",European Psychiatry,718,1
176292,176292,176292,Challenges deploying robots during a pandemic: An effort to fight social isolation among children,14.387769,0.55318505,2021,"Background: The SIR model is often used to analyse and forecast the expansion of an epidemic. In this model, the number of patients exponentially increases and decreases, resulting in two phases. Therefore, in these phases, the logarithm of infectious patients changes at a constant rate, the logarithmic growth rate K. However, in the case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) epidemic, K never remains constant but increases and decreases linearly; therefore, the SIR model does not fit that seen in reality. We would like to clarify the cause of this phenomenon and predict the occurrence of COVID19 epidemics. Methods: We simulated a situation in which smaller epidemics were repeated with short time intervals. The results were compared with the epidemic data from 279 countries and regions. Results: In the simulations, the K values increased and decreased linearly, similar to the real data. Because the previous peak covered the initial increase in the epidemic, K did not increase as much as expected; rather, the difference in the basic reproduction number R0 appeared in the slope of increasing K. Additionally, the mean infectious time {tau} appeared in the negative peaks of K. By using the R0 and {tau} estimated from the changes in K, changes in the number of patients could be approximated using the SIR model. This supports the appropriateness of the model for evaluating COVID-19 epidemics. By using the model, the distributions of the parameters were identified. On average, an epidemic started every eleven days in a country. The worldwide mean R0 was 2.9; however, this value showed an exponential character and could thus increase explosively. In addition, the average {tau} was 12 days; this is not the native value but represents a shortened period because of the isolation of patients. As {tau} represents the half-life, the infectious time varies among patients; hence, prior testing should be performed before isolation is lifted. The changes in K represented the state of epidemics and were several weeks to a month ahead of the changes in the number of confirmed cases. In the actual data, when K was positive on consecutive days, the number of patients increased a few weeks later. In addition, if the negative peaks of K could not be reduced to as small as 0.1, the number of patients remained high. Thus, the number of K-positive days and mean infectious time had a clear correlation with the total number of patients. In such cases, mortality, which was lognormally distributed, with a mean of 1.7%, increased. To control the epidemic, it is important to observe K daily, not to allow K to remain positive continuously, and to terminate a peak with a series of K-negative days. To do this, it was necessary to shorten {tau} by finding and isolating a patient earlier. The effectiveness of the countermeasures is apparent in {tau}. The effect of vaccination, in terms of controlling the epidemic, was limited.","Konishi, T.",,718,1

Both, substitution of interferon and blocking interferon signaling through JAK STAT inhibition to limit cytokine storms have been proposed. However, little is known so far about possible abnormalities in STAT signaling in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the current study, we investigated downstream targets of interferon signaling, including STAT1, pSTAT1 and 2 and IRF1, 7 and 9 by flow cytometry in 30 patients with COVID-19, 17 with mild and 13 with severe infection. We report an upregulation of STAT1 and IRF9 in mild and severe COVID-19 cases, which correlated with the IFN-signature assessed by Siglec-1 (CD169) expression on peripheral monocytes. Most interestingly, Siglec-1 and STAT1 in CD14+ monocytes and plasmablasts showed lower expression among severe COVID-19 cases compared to mild cases. Contrary to the baseline whole protein STAT1 expression, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was enhanced in severe COVID-19 cases, indicating a dysbalanced JAK STAT signaling that fails to induce transcription of interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE). This abnormality persisted after IFN- and IFN-{gamma} stimulation of PBMCs from patients with severe COVID-19. The data suggest impaired STAT1 transcriptional upregulation among severely infected patients which may represent a potential predictive biomarker and may allow stratification of patients for certain interferon-pathway targeted treatments.","Rincon-Arevalo, H.; Aue, A.; Ritter, J.; Szelinski, F.; Khadzhynov, D.; Zickler, D.; Stefanski, A.-L.; Lino, A.

Though adults with diabetes suffer higher rates of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, pediatric data is limited. We aimed to study the number and characteristics of new onset type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes pre- and during the pandemic. Method: This was a retrospective study using inpatient data at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland. We examined newly diagnosed T1D and T2D, aged < 18 years old, from May 2019 to Jan 2021. COVID-19 pandemic was defined from Mar 2020 onward. Results: Respectively, there were 59 and 64 new T1D, and 25 and 34 new T2D pre- and during COVID-19 pandemic. No difference was observed in time-adjusted incidence rate in T1D, but a rising trend in T2D was seen. A higher infection rate (PCR or IgG) was shown in T2D than T1D (11.8% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.05). During COVID-19, individuals with T1D had higher BMI z-scores (0.4 vs. -0.2, p = 0.03) and c-peptide levels (0.8 ng/ml vs. 0.5 ng/ml, p <0.01), and more Hispanics were diagnosed (46.9% vs. 27.1%, p = 0.02). Individuals with T2D were younger (mean age 12.8 yr vs. 14.5 yr, p = 0.02) and had more DKA on presentation (35.3% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.04) during the pandemic. Insurance and income were not associated with T1D nor T2D. No differences in patient demographics were observed in relation to COVID-19. Conclusion: We observed a rising trend of new onset T2D in the pediatric population during COVID-19, who were younger and sicker at presentation, and had a higher COVID-19 positivity rate than T1D. T1D incidence was similar, but individuals were more obese, had greater beta cell reserve at presentation, and a higher proportion were Hispanic compared to pre-pandemic. The roles of COVID-19, stress, and/or lifestyle changes associated with shelter-in-place orders, contributing to increased BMI and c-peptide levels in T1D, or increasing the risk for new onset diabetes and DKA in youths with T2D needs to be elucidated further and studied.","Nip, Angel Ahmad Tariq",Diabetes,718,24

Our estimates are computed with the Gaussian process models presented in Garnett et al. (2017); Ho et al.

We compute the column density distribution function (CDDF) at $2<z<5$, the line density ($\textrm{d} N/ \textrm{d} X$), and the neutral hydrogen density ($\Omega_{\textrm{DLA}}$). Our Gaussian process model provides a posterior probability distribution of the number of DLAs per spectrum, thus allowing unbiased probabilistic predictions of the statistics of DLA populations even with the noisiest data. We measure a non-zero column density distribution function for $N_{\textrm{HI}}<3 \times 10^{22} \,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ with $95\%$ confidence limits, and $N_{\textrm{HI}} \lesssim 10^{22} \,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $>4$. Our results for DLA line density and total hydrogen density are consistent with previous measurements. Despite a small bias due to the poorly measured blue edges of the spectra, we demonstrate that our new model can measure the DLA population statistics when the DLA is in the Lyman-$\beta$ forest region. We verify our results are not sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratios and redshifts of the background quasars although a residual correlation remains for detections from $z_{\textrm{QSO}}<2.5$, indicating some residual systematics when applying our models on very short spectra, where the SDSS spectral observing window only covers part of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest.","Ho, Ming-Feng; Bird, Simeon; Garnett, Roman",,718,1

Here we show that, in addition to the effects of overfishing, fluctuations in plankton have resulted in long-term changes in cod recruitment in the North Sea (bottom-up control). Survival of larval cod is shown to depend on three key biological parameters of their prey: the mean size of prey, seasonal timing and abundance. We suggest a mechanism, involving the match/mismatch hypothesis, by which variability in temperature affects larval cod survival and conclude that rising temperature since the mid-1980s has modified the plankton ecosystem in a way that reduces the survival of young cod.","Beaugrand, Grégory; Brander, Keith M; Alistair Lindley, J; Souissi, Sami; Reid, Philip C",Nature,718,24

This review integrates clinical, microbiological, architectural and surgical aspects to develop indications on strategies to manage colorectal cancer patients and ensure safety during the pandemic. Telephone or virtual clinics must be encouraged and phone follow-up should be implemented. Indications for surgery must be rigorous, balancing the advantage of early surgical treatment and risks of treatment delay. To decrease the occupancy rate of intensive care unit beds, elective surgical treatment should be delayed until local endemic control, according to stage of disease. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be treated only after clinical recovery, two consecutive negative oropharyngeal swabs and, if available, a negative stool sample. Before any elective oncologic procedure, a multidisciplinary oncologic team including an anaesthesiologist and an infectious disease specialist must assess every patient to evaluate the risk of infection and its impact on perioperative morbidity, mortality and oncologic prognosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional randomized study was conducted in Moscow region from March to May 2020. Two groups were examined for EBV-markers: hospital patients (n = 95) treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood donors (n = 92). RESULTS: With equal EBV prevalence the detection of active infection markers in donors (10.9%) was noticeably lower than in SARS-CoV-2 patients (80%). Significant differences in this indicator were also found when patients from subgroups with interstitial pneumonia with the presence (96.6%) and absence (97.2%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal smear were compared with the subgroup of patients with mild COVID-19 (43.3%). The average IgG VCA and IgG EBNA positivity coefficients in donor group were higher than in patient group (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with active EBV infection markers were significantly more likely to have pneumonia, exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes (odds ratio - 23.6; 3.5; 9.7, respectively). DISCUSSION: The present study examined the incidence and analyzed epidemiological features of active EBV infection in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A significantly higher rate of detection of active EBV infection markers in hospital patients indicates a combined participation SARS-CoV-2 and EBV in the development of interstitial pneumonia. Low levels of specific IgG EBV serve as predictors of EBV reactivation. Exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes in patients should serve as a reason for examination for active EBV infection markers.","Solomay, T V; Semenenko, T A; Filatov, N N; Vedunova, S L; Lavrov, V F; Smirnova, D I; Gracheva, A V; Faizuloev, E B",Vopr Virusol,718,22

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments.

In this study, Indian traditional spices owing to various medicinal properties were tested in silico for their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (SP) and main proteases (Mpro) play a significant role in infection development were considered as potential drug targets. METHODS: A total of 75 phytochemicals present in traditional Indian spices retrieved from the published literature and Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database, were docked with Mpro (PDB IDs: 6YNQ), and the SP (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6YOR). RESULTS: Through the screening process, 75 retrieved phytochemicals were docked with spike protein (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6YOR) and main protease (PDB ID: 6YNQ) of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, myricetin, a flavonoid (rank score: 6LXT: -11.72383; 6YOR: -9.87943; 6YNQ: -11.68164) from Allium sativumL and Isovitexin, an example of flavone (rank score:6LXT: -12.14922; 6YOR: -10.19443; 6YNQ: - 12.60603) from Pimpinella anisumL were the most potent ligands against SP and Mproof SARS-CoV-2. Whereas, Astragalin from Crocus sativusL.; Rutin from Illicium verum, Oxyguttiferone from Garcinia cambogia; Scopolin from Apium graveolens L, Luteolin from Salvia officinalis, Emodin, Aloe-emodin from Cinnamomum zeylanicium and Apigenin from Allium sativumL showed better inhibition against Mpro than SP of SARS-CoV-2. The amino acid residues like SER, LYS, ASP and TYR were found playing important role in protein-ligand interactions via hydrogen bonding and Vander Waals forces. CONCLUSION: Optimal use of traditional spices in our daily meals may help fight against COVID-19.

Given that several work-related risk factors are associated with headache and neck pain, it seems important to determine those associated with headache and neck pain in telecommuters. The main objective of this study was to identify which telecommuting and individual associated factors are related with headache and neck pain occurrence in telecommuters over a five days follow-up. The second objective was to evaluate the impact of wearing a headset on headache and neck pain intensity in telecommuters. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two participants in telecommuting situation were recruited. Baseline assessment included sociodemographic data, headache and neck pain-related disability (6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ)), headache and neck pain frequency and intensity as well as questions about the wearing of a headset (headset wearing, headset type and headset wearing hours). A prospective data collection of headache, neck pain and headset wearing was conducted using daily e-mail over a 5-day follow-up. A stepwise multivariate regression model was performed to determine associated factors of headache or neck pain occurrence during the follow-up. A t-test was conducted to assess the impact of headset wearing on headache and neck pain intensity during the follow-up. RESULTS: Regarding headache, the stepwise multivariate regression model showed that the HIT-6 score was associated with future headache occurrence in telecommuters (OR (95% CI) = 1.094 (1.042-1.148); R2 = 0.094; p < 0.001). For neck pain, the stepwise multivariate regression showed that the NBQ score was related to future neck pain occurrence in telecommuters (OR (95% CI) = 1.182 (1.102-1.269); R2 = 0.182; p < 0.001). T-test showed no difference between participants that wore a headset and participant that did not wore a headset on mean headache (p = 0.94) and neck pain (p = 0.56) intensity during the five days follow-up. CONCLUSION: Although several work-related risk factors are associated with headache and neck pain in workers, telecommuting did not present the same risks. Working set-up did not have a significant impact on headache and neck pain as headache-related disability was the only associated factor of future headache episodes and neck-pain related disability was the only associated factor of future neck pain episodes.

However, it is unclear if all data being released convey anything useful beyond the reputational benefits of governments wishing to appear open and transparent. In this analysis we use Ontario, Canada as a case study to assess the value of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 positive case numbers. Using a combination of real data and simulations, we find that daily publicly available test results probably contain considerable error about individual risk (measured as proportion of tests that are positive, population based incidence and prevalence of active cases) and that short term variations are very unlikely to provide useful information for any plausible decision making on the part of individual citizens. Open government data can increase the transparency and accountability of government, however it is essential that all publication, use and re-use of these data highlight their weaknesses to ensure that the public is properly informed about the uncertainty associated with SARS-CoV-2 information.","Yiannakoulias, Nikolaos; Slavik, Catherine E; Sturrock, Shelby L; Darlington, J Connor",Soc Sci Med,718,1

Initially, a mediation model verified a partially mediated population role in the relationship between landscape pattern and infection number. Adjusted incidence rate (AIR) and community safety index (CSI), two indicators for infection risk in sub-districts, were 25.82â¼63.56 &#8241; and 3.00â¼15.87 respectively, and central urban sub-districts were at higher infection risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) performed better than OLS regression with AICc differences of 7.951â¼181.261. The adjusted R2 in GWR models of class-level index and infection risk were 0.697 to 0.817, while for the landscape-level index they were 0.668 to 0.835. Secondly, 16 key landscape metrics were identified based on GWR, and then a prediction model for infection risk in sub-districts and communities was developed. Using principal component analysis (PCA), development intensity, landscape level, and urban blue-green space were considered to be principal components affecting disease infection risk, explaining 73.1% of the total variance. Cropland (PLAND and LSI), urban land (NP, LPI, and LSI) and unused land (NP) represent development intensity, greatly affecting infection risk in urban areas. Landscape level CONTAG, DIVISION, SHDI, and SHEI represent mobility and connectivity, having a profound impact on infection risk in both urban and suburban areas. Water (PLAND, NP, LPI, and LSI) and woodland (NP, and LSI) represent urban blue-green spaces, and were particularly important for infection risk in suburban areas. Based on urban landscape pattern, we proposed a framework to understand and evaluate infection risk. These findings provide a basis for risk evaluation and policy-making of urban infectious disease, which is significant for community management and urban planning for infectious disease worldwide.","Ye, Yang; Qiu, Hongfei",Urban For Urban Green,718,20

During the last year, autopsy reports have revealed that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most significant observed finding. The aim of this study is to review cases in the literature about COVID-19 autopsies that reported microthrombi in different organs. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: In total, 151 autopsies were included, and 91 cases presented microthrombi in the lung (73%), heart (11.2%), kidney (24%), and liver (16.3%). The age range was between 27 and 96 years. Males were 64.8%. The patients with microthrombi had more comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (62%), obesity or overweight (64%), diabetes mellitus type 2 (51%), and heart disease (53%). The most common histopathological changes found in patients with lung microthrombosis were DAD in exudative phase (78%), pulmonary embolism (59%), and lung infarct (81%). Presence of microthrombi was associated with arterial hypertension (p < 0.0001) and DAD in exudative and proliferative phases (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The analysis of these results shows that microthrombi in COVID-19 autopsies may be found in different organs and are more frequent in patients with comorbidities, pulmonary embolism, and lung infarct.","Parra-Medina, Rafael; Herrera, Sabrina; Mejia, Jaime",Acta Haematol,718,23

Experimental studies and sporadic reports have confirmed susceptibility of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the importance of pet animals in the epidemiology of this infection is unclear. This study reports on a first large-scale serosurvey of SARS-CoV-2 infections in dogs and cats in Europe. From 26 February 2020, just one day after the first confirmed human case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Croatia, to 15 June 2020, dog and cat serum samples were collected from animals admitted to three veterinary facilities in Croatia. Additionally, on 25 May 2020, a total of 122 serum samples from employees of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Zagreb were collected. Total of 656 dogs and 131 cat serum samples were tested using an in-house microneutralisation test (MNT). Human serum samples, as well as 172 randomly selected, dog sera were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA-positive human sera were subsequently tested using MNT. Neutralising antibodies were confirmed in 0.76% cats and 0.31% dogs. ELISA reactivity was recorded in 7.56% tested dog sera. On the other hand, 5.19% of administrative, basic and pre-clinical sciences department personnel and 5.13% of animal health service providers and laboratory personnel tested ELISA positive. Neutralising antibodies were not confirmed in any of the human samples. In conclusion, seropositivity among pet animals in Croatia is low, especially when compared to results from China. A small number of seropositive animals with a low titre of neutralising antibodies suggest infections are rare and are following infections in the human population. Additionally, contact with animals does not seem to be an occupational risk for veterinary practitioners.","Stevanovic, Vladimir; Vilibic-Cavlek, Tatjana; Tabain, Irena; Benvin, Iva; Kovac, Snjezana; Hruskar, Zeljka; Mauric, Maja; Milasincic, Ljiljana; Antolasic, Ljiljana; Skrinjaric, Alenka; Staresina, Vilim; Barbic, Ljubo",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Time-of-addition and pseudotype virus infection studies indicated that carrimycin inhibited one or multiple post-entry replication events of human coronavirus infection. In support of this notion, metabolic labelling studies showed that carrimycin significantly inhibited the synthesis of viral RNA. Our studies thus strongly suggest that carrimycin is an antiviral agent against a broad-spectrum of human coronaviruses and its therapeutic efficacy to COVID-19 is currently under clinical investigation.","Yan, Haiyan; Sun, Jing; Wang, Kun; Wang, Huiqiang; Wu, Shuo; Bao, Linlin; He, Weiqing; Wang, Dong; Zhu, Airu; Zhang, Tian; Gao, Rongmei; Dong, Biao; Li, Jianrui; Yang, Lu; Zhong, Ming; Lv, Qi; Qin, Feifei; Zhuang, Zhen; Huang, Xiaofang; Yang, Xinyi; Li, Yuhuan; Che, Yongsheng; Jiang, Jiandong",,718,11

Graduate social work students need advanced knowledge and skills in leadership and supervision to become future leaders in human service organizations. However, social workers are often promoted to management from direct service positions without adequate skills and training and schools of social work may not formally educate students for leadership and administrative positions. Scholarly literature and research about leadership training for social work students, specifically online training, is also scarce. This article examines how two Canadian schools of social work addressed this gap through the development of graduate master of social work courses on leadership and supervision as mandatory components of their curriculum, through on-campus and online formats. Varying course approaches, topics, instructional strategies, assignments, and themes collected and analyzed from online surveys of student feedback are described, emphasizing strengths (satisfaction, relevance, benefits, course design), challenges (content, timing), and lessons learned (importance, new learning, confidence, future roles). Recommendations for similar educational disruptions, future courses, and practice implications, including teaching resources and instructor adaptability to support the rapid transition to online and blended learning formats, are also discussed.

In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase. Safety data warrant monitoring of drug-drug interactions and subsequent cardiac adverse events, especially with hydroxychloroquine.

An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.","Imran, Ali; Posokhova, Iryna; Qureshi, Haneya N.; Masood, Usama; Riaz, Sajid; Ali, Kamran; John, Charles N.; Nabeel, Muhammad",,718,16

The COVID-19 pandemic is a broad stressor with significant physical and social threats. In the current study, we were interested in ascertaining the degree to which AS would relate to distress and disability in the context of COVID-19. We hypothesized that AS would be associated with increased distress and disability. Moreover, we hypothesized that AS would be uniquely predictive while controlling for other relevant risk factors such as age, race, and perceived local COVID-19 infection rates. METHOD: Participants (N = 249) were U.S. adults assessed using online data resourcing and re-assessed one month later. RESULTS: At the first time point, during the beginning phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, AS was significantly related to COVID-19 distress and disability with a moderate effect size. AS was longitudinally associated with higher COVID-19 worry and depression. LIMITATIONS: Our findings are limited by the use of a relatively small online sample. Additionally, assessment of pre-pandemic and post-pandemic symptoms and functioning would be beneficial for future research. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the current study provided evidence consistent with AS as a causal risk factor for the development of distress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schmidt, Norman B; Morabito, Danielle M; Mathes, Brittany M; Martin, Alex",J Affect Disord,718,16

With the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), obesity and impaired metabolic health also emerged as important determinants of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, novel findings indicate that specifically visceral obesity and characteristics of impaired metabolic health such as hyperglycaemia, hypertension and subclinical inflammation are associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight how obesity and impaired metabolic health increase complications and mortality in COVID-19. We also summarize the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection for organ function and risk of NCDs. In addition, we discuss data indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic could have serious consequences for the obesity epidemic. As obesity and impaired metabolic health are both accelerators and consequences of severe COVID-19, and might adversely influence the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, we propose strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity and impaired metabolic health on a clinical and population level, particularly while the COVID-19 pandemic is present.","Stefan, Norbert; Birkenfeld, Andreas L; Schulze, Matthias B",Nat Rev Endocrinol,718,1

PLpro is also implicated in cleaving proteinaceous post-translational modifications on host proteins as an evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses3-5. Here we perform biochemical, structural and functional characterization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PLpro (SCoV2-PLpro) and outline differences with SARS-CoV PLpro (SCoV-PLpro) in regulation of host interferon and NF-&#954;B pathways. SCoV2-PLpro and SCoV-PLpro share 83% sequence identity but exhibit different host substrate preferences; SCoV2-PLpro preferentially cleaves the ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15), whereas SCoV-PLpro predominantly targets ubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of SCoV2-PLpro in complex with ISG15 reveals distinctive interactions with the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15, highlighting the high affinity and specificity of these interactions. Furthermore, upon infection, SCoV2-PLpro contributes to the cleavage of ISG15 from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) and attenuates type I interferon responses. Notably, inhibition of SCoV2-PLpro with GRL-0617 impairs the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect, maintains the antiviral interferon pathway and reduces viral replication in infected cells. These results highlight a potential dual therapeutic strategy in which targeting of SCoV2-PLpro can suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and promote antiviral immunity.","Shin, Donghyuk; Mukherjee, Rukmini; Grewe, Diana; Bojkova, Denisa; Baek, Kheewoong; Bhattacharya, Anshu; Schulz, Laura; Widera, Marek; Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; Tascher, Georg; Geurink, Paul P; Wilhelm, Alexander; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J; Ovaa, Huib; Müller, Stefan; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter; Rajalingam, Krishnaraj; Schulman, Brenda A; Cinatl, Jindrich; Hummer, Gerhard; Ciesek, Sandra; Dikic, Ivan",Nature (Lond.),718,1

Thus, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis and intracellular transport, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection were seen to modulate pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake as monitored by testing for CD36, SREBP-1, PPARÎ³, and DGAT-1 expression in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cell lines. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected Vero cells. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells show viral particles colocalizing with LDs, suggestive that LDs might serve as an assembly platform. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of mediators pro-inflammatory response. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.","Dias, Suelen Silva Gomes; Soares, Vinicius Cardoso; Ferreira, André C; Sacramento, Carolina Q; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Temerozo, Jairo R; Teixeira, Lívia; Nunes da Silva, Marcos Alexandre; Barreto, Ester; Mattos, Mayara; de Freitas, Caroline S; Azevedo-Quintanilha, Isaclaudia G; Manso, Pedro Paulo A; Miranda, Milene D; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Hottz, Eugenio D; Pão, Camila R R; Bou-Habib, Dumith C; Barreto-Vieira, Debora F; Bozza, Fernando A; Souza, Thiago M L; Bozza, Patricia T",PLoS Pathog,718,21

METHODS: The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). RESULTS: Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups. Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19 group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients. Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.","Cetinkaya, Tugba; Kurt, Muhammed M; Akpolat, Cetin",,718,23

This study assesses COVID-19 knowledge and case management of informal providers (IPs), trained practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) medical doctors providing primary care services in rural Bihar, India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care providers conducted via telephone between 1 and 15 July 2020. SETTING: Primary care providers from 224 villages in 34 districts across Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: 452 IPs, 57 AYUSH practitioners and 38 doctors (including 23 government doctors) were interviewed from a census of 1138 primary care providers used by community members that could be reached by telephone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Providers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with choice-based answers to gather information on (1) change in patient care seeking, (2) source of COVID-19 information, (3) knowledge on COVID-19 spread, symptoms and methods for prevention and (4) clinical management of COVID-19. RESULTS: During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 72% of providers reported a decrease in patient visits. Most IPs and other private primary care providers reported receiving no COVID-19 related engagement with government or civil society agencies. For them, the principal source of COVID-19 information was television and newspapers. IPs had reasonably good knowledge of typical COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, and at levels similar to doctors. However, there was low stated compliance among IPs (16%) and qualified primary care providers (15% of MBBS doctors and 12% of AYUSH practitioners) with all WHO recommended management practices for suspect COVID-19 cases. Nearly half of IPs and other providers intended to treat COVID-19 suspects without referral. CONCLUSIONS: Poor management practices of COVID-19 suspects by rural primary care providers weakens government pandemic control efforts. Government action of providing information to IPs, as well as engaging them in contact tracing or public health messaging can strengthen pandemic control efforts.","Rao, Krishna D; Kaur, Japneet; Peters, Michael A; Kumar, Navneet; Nanda, Priya",BMJ Open,718,16

Different countries implemented their own combinations of NPIs to prevent local epidemics and healthcare system overloaded. Portfolios, as temporal sets of NPIs have various systemic impacts on preventing cases in populations. Here, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to evaluate the effectiveness of NPI portfolios at the macroscale. We employed a deconvolution method to back-calculate incidence of infections and estimate the effective reproduction number by using the package EpiEstim. We then evaluated the effectiveness of NPIs using ratios of the reproduction numbers and considered them individually and as a portfolio systemically. Based on estimates from Japan, we estimated time delays of symptomatic-to-confirmation and infection-to-confirmation as 7.4 and 11.4 days, respectively. These were used to correct surveillance data of other countries. Considering 50 countries, risk communication and returning to normal life were the most and least effective yielding the aggregated effectiveness of 0.11 and - 0.05 that correspond to a 22.4% and 12.2% reduction and increase in case growth. The latter is quantified by the change in reproduction number before and after intervention implementation. Countries with the optimal NPI portfolio are along an empirical Pareto frontier where mean and variance of effectiveness are maximized and minimized independently of incidence levels. Results indicate that implemented interventions, regardless of NPI portfolios, had distinct incidence reductions and a clear timing effect on infection dynamics measured by sequences of reproduction numbers. Overall, the successful suppression of the epidemic cannot work without the non-linear effect of NPI portfolios whose effectiveness optimality may relate to country-specific socio-environmental factors.","Chan, Louis Yat Hin; Yuan, Baoyin; Convertino, Matteo",Sci Rep,718,10

The effectiveness of CP likely depends on its antiviral neutralizing potency and is determined using in vitro neutralizing antibody assays. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated abilities of three immunoassays for anti-spike antibodies (EUROimmun, Ortho, Roche), a pseudotype-based neutralization assay, and two assays that quantify ACE2 binding of spike protein (GenScript and hemagglutination test [HAT]-based assay) to predict neutralizing antibody titers in 113 CP donations. Assay outputs were analyzed through linear regression and calculation of sensitivities and specificities by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Median values of plasma samples containing neutralizing antibodies produced conversion factors for assay unitage of ×6.5 (pseudotype), ×19 (GenScript), ×3.4 (HAT assay), ×0.08 (EUROimmun), ×1.64 (Roche), and ×0.10 (Ortho). All selected assays were sufficient in identifying the high titer donations based on ROC analysis; area over curve ranged from 91.7% for HAT and GenScript assay to 95.6% for pseudotype assay. However, their ability to predict the actual neutralizing antibody levels varied substantially as shown by linear regression correlation values (from 0.27 for Ortho to 0.61 for pseudotype assay). DISCUSSION: Overall, the study data demonstrate that all selected assays were effective in identifying donations with high neutralizing antibody levels and are potentially suitable as surrogate assays for donation selection for CP therapy.","Lamikanra, Abigail; Nguyen, Dung; Simmonds, Peter; Williams, Sarah; Bentley, Emma M; Rowe, Cathy; Otter, Ashley David; Brooks, Tim; Gilmour, Kimberly; Mai, Annabelle; Dadhra, Jusvinder; Csatari, Mabel; Ziyenge, Sheba; Oliveira, Marta; Ploeg, Rutger; Tsang, Pat; Zambon, Maria; Gopal, Robin; Xiao, Julie Huiyuan; Townsend, Alain; Roberts, David; Harvala, Heli",Transfusion,718,24

We assessed the economic impact of such policies on dental practices in Germany using a modelling approach. METHODS: A providers' perspective within German healthcare was taken, with two provider scenarios (low/high volume practice, low/high proportion of non-statutory insurance revenue, low/high staff pool and costs; S1 and S2 scenarios) being modelled. Providers' costs were estimated in different blocks (staff, material, laboratory, others). A telephone-based survey was conducted on 24th March to 2nd April 2020 on a random sample of 300 German dentists (response: nâ¯=â¯146) to determine the experienced dental services utilization changes in these service blocks. A Markov model was constructed, following 100 practices in each scenario for a total of 365 days. Different Covid-19 mitigation/suppression periods (90 days: base-case, 45, 135 days: sensitivity analyses) were modelled. Monte-Carlo micro-simulation was performed and uncertainty introduced via probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Mitigation/suppression reduced utilization of all services, the most severe for prevention (-80 % in mean), periodontics (-76 %) and prosthetics (-70 %). Within the base-case, mean revenue reductions were 18.7 %/15.7 % from the public insurance, 18.7/18.6 % from private insurers and 19 %/19 % for out-of-pocket expenses in S1/S2, respectively. If the mitigation/suppression was upheld for 135 days, overall revenue decreased by 31 %/30 % in S1/S2, respectively. In this case, 29 %/12 % S1/S2 would have a negative net profit over the course of one year. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 and associated policies have profound economic effect on dental practices. CLINICAL SIGNIFIANCE: Policy makers will want to consider our findings when designing governmental subsidy and safety nets with immediate and midterm economic relieve effects. Dentists may consider practice re-organization to reduce costs and maintain minimum profitability.","Schwendicke, Falk; Krois, Joachim; Gomez, Jesus",J Dent,718,26

The object of this paper was to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic on global gross domestic product. We analyzed data relating to 176 countries in the 11-month period from February 2020 to December 2020. We employed SARS-CoV-19 morbidity and fatality rates reported by different countries as proxies for the development of the pandemic. The analysis employed in our study was based on moving median and quartiles, Kendall tau-b coefficients, and multi-segment piecewise-linear approximation with Theil-Sen trend lines. In the study, we empirically confirmed and measured the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic on the respective national economies. The relationship between the pandemic and the economy is not uniform and depends on the extent of the pandemic's development.

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65 ± 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores. AI algorithm is as robust a predictor of adverse patient outcome (death or need for mechanical ventilation) as subjective RALE scores in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ebrahimian, Shadi; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Rockenbach, Marcio A B C; Putha, Preetham; Raj, Tarun; Dayan, Ittai; Bizzo, Bernardo C; Buch, Varun; Wu, Dufan; Kim, Kyungsang; Li, Quanzheng; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K",Sci Rep,718,17

The effect of PVDF-PVP-TiO2-FeCl3 (PPTFe) membrane filtration-photocatalytic system on the removal of trace concentration of sulfadiazine (SD) in water was evaluated. A two-factor four-level experiment was established to optimize 16 self-made modified membranes. The optimal membrane was then characterized in seven tests (SEM, EDS, membrane pure water flux, contact angle, porosity, mean pore size, ATR-FTIR), resulting in the optimal ratio (PPTFe membrane with 1.2 wt%TiO2 and 0.8 wt%FeCl3). Compared with the original membrane, the pore number, pore size, permeability, and hydrophilicity of the PPTFe membrane were all enhanced. The removal efficiency (92.63%) of SD by PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalysis system was investigated. The reaction rate (0.0214 min-1) of the removal SD of the system was determined according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The removal performance of membrane type, pH, and water quality parameters (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HA) on PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalytic system were also made a deep inquiry. The results reflected that acidic conditions (pH = 3) were beneficial to SD removal, the presence of Cl-, SO42-, and HA could inhibit SD removal, while the existence of NO3- was unaffected. Furthermore, the removal rate of SD in the actual water body was displayed well in this system. Finally, the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was proposed.Graphical abstract.","Zhou, Anran; Wang, Yonglei; Sun, Shaohua; Xin, Xiaodong; Wang, Mingquan; Zhao, Qinghua; Zhu, Huanhuan; Jia, Ruibao",,718,16

The objective was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, evolution and severity of COVID-19 in a third-level hospital, in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We conducted a retrospective cohort of 101 patients with COVID-19 from March 3 to June 21, 2020. The patients were divided according to the presence or absence of pneumonia and the severity of the disease. The median age was 42 years and 53% were women. The most common symptoms were fever 66% and cough 57%. Dyspnea and fever were associated with the presence of pneumonia. The most prevalent comorbidities were: hypertension 22%, obesity 18%, cardiovascular disease 7% and chronic respiratory disease 7%. The presence of any comorbidity and hypertension were more common in severe cases. The most frequent laboratory findings were: lymphopenia 55%, elevated D-dimer 38%, and thrombocytopenia 20%. In severe diseases, the level of C-reactive protein and D-dimer were higher. Twenty six patients had pneumonia and 24% were healthcare workers. For diagnosis, more than one reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample was needed in 24% of cases. A moderate-high value of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was more prevalent in severe than mild pneumonia (63% vs. 17%, p 0.032). A mortality of 5% was registered (95% CI 1-11%). The clinical characteristics, severity and prognosis were similar to those described worldwide. We highlight a high proportion of healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 positive, the false negative rate of the RT-PCR and the usefulness of the PSI to discriminate the severity of pneumonia.","Castro, H.

They have a strong demand for remote healthcare that despite the great potential of artificial intelligence are not met in the current (e)-health services. Understanding the real needs of these persons is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to contribute with a fine grained understanding of the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms, in order to enhance AI in eHealth services. METHODS: Design research in which a qualitative approach was used to map the patient journey. Data on the home isolation experiences of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms was collected from top viewed personal video stories on YouTube and their additional comment threads. For the analysis this data was transcribed, coded and mapped into the patient journey map. RESULTS: The key findings on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms concern: (a) Considerable awareness period before testing positive and home-recovery period; (b) Less generic but more personal symptoms experiences; (c) Negative mood experience curve; (d) Inadequate home healthcare service support for mild COVID-19 patients through all stages. (e) Benefits and drawbacks of Social media support for mild COVID-19 patients; (f) Several touchpoint needs for home healthcare interaction with AI. CONCLUSIONS: The design of the patient journey map and underlying insights on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms serves Health - and IT professionals to more effectively apply AI technology into eHealth services for mild Covid-19 patients, for which three main service concepts are proposed: (I) Trustful public health information to release stress; (II) Personal Covid-19 health monitoring.

Lots of countries had closed their schools. As the first country to do so, Chinese colleges and universities were making use of different modes of learning, including online-learning based on different platforms to achieve the goal suggested by Ministry of Education in China, “suspending classes without suspending learning,” since middle February. This paper is the first one which aims to investigate the anxiety of Chinese university students after the outbreak of COVID-19 right before the start of new spring term. 3611 university students (female: male = 1.48:1) aged between 18 to 24 from all over China were enrolled to this study from a top university in China. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale – SAS (Zung, 1971) was used to assess anxiety 2 days before the start of new spring term in middle February. All four-year undergraduate students were included in the study. The mean SAS score was 40.53 (SD = 10.15), significantly higher than the national norm (Mean = 29.78, SD = 10.07, and p ≤.001), and there were still 557 (15.43%, Mean = 58.75, and SD = 8.9) students met the cutoff of 50 and were screened positive. Comparisons among sexes, grades and majors were also conducted. Significant differences were found between all males and all female (p ≤.001), and between all students majoring arts and sciences in the anxiety sample (n = 557, p = 0.05). The results also showed that the mean SAS scores were not correlated with the regions they came from/lived in.

These models are useful as simulators and can help in understanding the natural processes being studied. One key challenge in this pursuit has been to enable statistical inference over these models, which would allow these simulation-based models to learn from real-world observations. Recent efforts, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), show promise in performing a new kind of inference to leverage these models. While the scope of applicability of these inference algorithms is limited by the capabilities of contemporary computational hardware, they show potential of being greatly parallelized. In this work, we explore hardware accelerated simulation-based inference over probabilistic models, by combining massively parallelized ABC inference algorithm with the cutting-edge AI chip solutions that are uniquely suited for this purpose. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate inference over a probabilistic epidemiology model used to predict the spread of COVID-19. Two hardware acceleration platforms are compared - the Tesla V100 GPU and the Graphcore Mark1 IPU. Our results show that while both of these platforms outperform multi-core CPUs, the Mk1 IPUs are 7.5x faster than the Tesla V100 GPUs for this workload.","Kulkarni, S.; Tsyplikhin, A.; Krell, M.

The in silico analysis of 2086 whole genome sequences from India performed in this study provides the first observation on the extensive deletion of amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in 34 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These amino acid deletions map to the homopentameric interface and PDZ binding motif (PBM) present in the C-terminal region of E protein as well as immediately after the reverse primer binding region as per Charité protocol in 26 of these genomes, hence, their detection through RT-qPCR may not be hampered and therefore E gene-based RT-qPCR would still detect these isolates. Eight genomes from the State of Odisha had deletion even in the primer binding site. It is possible that the deletions in the C-terminal region of E protein of these genomes are a result of adapting to a newer geographical area and host. The information on the clinical status was available only for 9 out of 34 cases and these were asymptomatic. However, further studies are indispensable to understand the functional consequences of amino acid deletion in the C terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein in the viral pathogenesis and host adaptation.","Kumar, Ballamoole Krishna; Rohit, Anusha; Prithvisagar, Kattapuni Suresh; Rai, Praveen; Karunasagar, Indrani; Karunasagar, Iddya",Virus Res,718,7

Compared to survivors, patients who died were older (79.7 ± 10.8 vs 65.6 ± 14.1, p < 0.001), with a more complex cardiovascular history, including coronary artery disease (CAD, 33.3% vs 13.3%, p = 0.004), atrial fibrillation (23.8 vs 8.8, p = 0.011) and chronic kidney disease (CKD 35.7% vs 7.0%, p < 0.001). 30-day mortality was 20,9% in these patients; atrial fibrillation (OR 12.74, 95% CI 3.65-44.48, p < 0.001), ST-segment depression (OR 5.30, 95% CI 1.50-18.81, p = 0.010) and QTc-interval prolongation (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.24-8.10, p = 0.016) at ECG admission were associated to an increased mortality risk. On the contrary, sinus rhythm (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.27, p < 0.001) and low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.29, p < 0.001) were related to reduced mortality. At multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, CAD, and MCA admission, sinus rhythm (HR 2.7, CI 95% 1.1-7.0, p = 0.038) and LMWH (HR 8.5, 95% CI 2.0-36.6, p = 0.004) were confirmed to be independent predictors of increased survival. CONCLUSION: Sinus rhythm at ECG admission in COVID-19 pneumonia patients was associated with greater survival as well as LMWH administration, which conferred an overall better outcome.","Denegri, Andrea; Pezzuto, Giuseppe; D039,; Arienzo, Matteo; Morelli, Marianna; Savorani, Fulvio; Cappello, Carlo G; Luciani, Antonio; Boriani, Giuseppe",Intern. emerg. med,718,1

To fight against COVID-19 in a more efficient way, drug-drug or drug-herb combinations are frequently used in clinical settings. The concomitant use of multiple medications may trigger clinically relevant drug/herb-drug interactions. This study aims to assay the inhibitory potentials of Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD, a Chinese medicine compound formula recommended for combating COVID-19 in China) against human drug-metabolizing enzymes and to assess the pharmacokinetic interactions in vivo. The results demonstrated that QPD dose-dependently inhibited CYPs1A, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 but inhibited CYP3A in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. In vivo test showed that QPD prolonged the half-life of lopinavir (a CYP3A substrate-drug) by 1.40-fold and increased the AUC of lopinavir by 2.04-fold, when QPD (6 g/kg) was co-administrated with lopinavir (160 mg/kg) to rats. Further investigation revealed that Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (Zhishi) in QPD caused significant loss of CYP3A activity in NADPH-generating system. Collectively, our findings revealed that QPD potently inactivated CYP3A and significantly modulated the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate-drugs, which would be very helpful for the patients and clinicians to avoid potential drug-interaction risks in COVID-19 treatment.","Zhang, Feng; Huang, Jian; Liu, Wei; Wang, Chao-Ran; Liu, Yan-Fang; Tu, Dong-Zhu; Liang, Xin-Miao; Yang, Ling; Zhang, Wei-Dong; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Ge, Guang-Bo",Food Chem Toxicol,718,12

Early recognition of severe forms of COVID-19 infection is critically essential for timely triaging of COVID-19 patients. Biochemical Parameters correlating clinically with the severity of COVID-19 infection amidst testing of Peripheral Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) levels can serve in timely management of severe COVID-19 infections. Aim: To estimate the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokine serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum ferritin levels and to clinically correlate these markers with COVID-19 disease severity. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional single center study conducted in a Tertiary care Hospital and Research Center from July 2020 to September 2020, 113 COVID-19 positive patients confirmed by Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) were included, Serum IL-6 and Serum Ferritin levels were measured in the patient's blood sample using standard Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and Vitros ECi Immunodiagnostics respectively. Data obtained was statistically analysed using SPSS Software version 22. Results: Of the 113 COVID-19 infected patients, 53 were included in Group A, 27 patients in Group B and 33 patients in Group C. Mean±SD of Serum IL-6 levels were 10.92±2.65, 40.05±11.66 and 120.92±40.96 (p&lt;0.001) and Serum Ferritin levels 368.21±374.85, 309.15±291.58, and 433.45±376.13, respectively. Conclusion: IL-6 correlated significantly with disease severity of COVID-19 infection and can be judiciously used for stratification and management of COVID-19 infected patients. Serum Ferritin concentration were found to be high in severe cases of COVID-19 infections and did not show any significant variation compared with Mild to Moderate COVID-19 infection.","Yesupatham, S.

METHODS: This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates. The sample, representing 161 countries, comprised the number of confirmed cases, deaths, stringency indices, population density and GNI per capita (USD). Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. RESULTS: Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries. Multivariate visualization of the two dominating principal components provided a standardized comparison of the situation in the161 countries, performed on day-30, day-60 and day-90 since the first confirmed cases in countries worldwide. CONCLUSION: Visualization of the global spread of COVID-19 showed the unequal severity of the pandemic across continents and over time. Distinct patterns in clusters of countries, which separated many European countries from those in Africa, suggested a contrast in terms of stringency measures and wealth of a country. The African continent appeared to fare better in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burden of mortality in the first 90 days. A noticeable worsening trend was observed in several countries in the same relative time frame of the disease's first 90 days, especially in the United States of America.","Teh, Jane K L; Bradley, David A; Chook, Jack Bee; Lai, Kee Huong; Ang, Woo Teck; Teo, Kok Lay; Peh, Suat-Cheng",PLoS One,718,20

We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad and polyfunctional S-specific CD4+ (mainly Th1) and CD8+ T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of December 23, 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs. Our findings prove the robust immunogenicity and efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.","García-Arriaza, Juan; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Pérez, Patricia; Lázaro-Frías, Adrián; Zamora, Carmen; Gastaminza, Pablo; Del Fresno, Carlos; Casasnovas, José M; Sorzano, Carlos Óscar S; Sancho, David; Esteban, Mariano",J. virol,718,20

As of mid-July 2020, more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called""TV-UNet"". Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%.","Saeedizadeh, Narges; Minaee, Shervin; Kafieh, Rahele; Yazdani, Shakib; Sonka, Milan",,718,24

With the dawn of this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), there was a requirement to select potential therapies that might effectively kill the virus, accelerate the recovery, or decrease the case fatality rate. Besides the currently available antiviral medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) regimen with or without azithromycin has been repurposed in China and was recommended by the National Health Commission, China in mid-February 2020. By this time, the selection of this regimen was based on its efficacy against the previous SARS-CoV-1 virus and its potential to inhibit viral replication of the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. There was a shortage of robust clinical proof about the effectiveness of this regimen against the novel SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, extensive research effort has been made by several researchers worldwide to investigate whether this regimen is safe and effective for the management of COVID-19. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of the CQ/HCQ regimen, summarizing data from in vitro studies and clinical trials for the protection against or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Despite the initial promising results from the in vitro studies and the widespread use of CQ/HCQ in clinical settings during the 1st wave of COVID-19, current data from well-designed randomized controlled trials showed no evidence of benefit from CQ/HCQ supplementation for the treatment or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, the two largest randomized controlled trials to date (RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY trials), both confirmed that CQ/HCQ regimen does not provide any clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients.

The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case ""zero"" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ""effective"" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to ""forecast"" the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: â¼10% to â¼30%).","Russo, Lucia; Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Tsakris, Athanasios; Bifulco, Gennaro Nicola; Campana, Emilio Fortunato; Toraldo, Gerardo; Siettos, Constantinos",PLoS One,718,22

The urgency of the situation requires the development of SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines. Immunoinformatic and molecular modelling are time-efficient methods that are generally used to accelerate the discovery and design of the candidate peptides for vaccine development. In recent years, the use of multiepitope vaccines has proved to be a promising immunization strategy against viruses and pathogens, thus inducing more comprehensive protective immunity. The current study demonstrated a comprehensive in silico strategy to design stable multiepitope vaccine construct (MVC) from B-cell and T-cell epitopes of essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the help of adjuvants and linkers. The integrated molecular dynamics simulations analysis revealed the stability of MVC and its interaction with human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an innate and adaptive immune response. Later, the in silico cloning in a known pET28a vector system also estimated the possibility of MVC expression in Escherichia coli. Despite that this study lacks validation of this vaccine construct in terms of its efficacy, the current integrated strategy encompasses the initial multiple epitope vaccine design concepts. After validation, this MVC can be present as a better prophylactic solution against COVID-19.","Rehman, Hafiz Muzzammel; Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Ahmad, Mian Azhar; Saleem, Mahjabeen; Froeyen, Matheus; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Gul, Roquyya; Alghamdi, Huda Ahmed; Aslam, Muhammad Shahbaz; Sajjad, Muhammad; Bhinder, Munir Ahmad",,718,16

This study aimed to explore the association between early treatment with Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and favorable clinical outcomes. In this retrospective multicenter study, we included 782 patients (males, 56 %; median age 46) with confirmed COVID-19 from 54 hospitals in nine provinces of China, who were divided into four groups according to the treatment initiation time from the first date of onset of symptoms to the date of starting treatment with QFPDD. The primary outcome was time to recovery; days of viral shedding, duration of hospital stay, and course of the disease were also analyzed. Compared with treatment initiated after 3 weeks, early treatment with QFPDD after less than 1 week, 1-2 weeks, or 2-3 weeks had a higher likelihood of recovery, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence interval [CI]) of 3.81 (2.65-5.48), 2.63 (1.86-3.73), and 1.92 (1.34-2.75), respectively. The median course of the disease decreased from 34 days to 24 days, 21 days, and 18 days when treatment was administered early by a week (P < 0.0001). Treatment within a week was related to a decrease by 1-4 days in the median duration of hospital stay compared with late treatment (P<0.0001). In conclusion, early treatment with QFPDD may serve as an effective strategy in controlling the epidemic, as early treatment with QFPDD was associated with favorable outcomes, including faster recovery, shorter time to viral shedding, and a shorter duration of hospital stay. However, further multicenter, prospective studies with a larger sample size should be conducted to confirm the benefits of early treatment with QFPDD.","Shi, Nannan; Liu, Bin; Liang, Ning; Ma, Yan; Ge, Youwen; Yi, Honggang; Wo, Hongmei; Gu, Heng; Kuang, Yuan; Tang, Shaowen; Zhao, Yang; Tong, Lin; Liu, Sihong; Zhao, Chen; Chen, Renbo; Bai, Weiguo; Fan, Yipin; Shi, Zhan; Li, Li; Liu, Jia; Gu, Hao; Zhi, Yingjie; Wang, Zhifei; Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Huizhen; Wang, Jingya; Jiao, Liwen; Tian, Yaxin; Xiong, Yibai; Huo, Ruili; Zhang, Xiaohui; Bai, Jiangfeng; Chen, Hong; Chen, Liying; Feng, Qiao; Guo, Tuanmao; Hou, Yong; Hu, Guifen; Hu, Xiaomei; Hu, Yunhong; Huang, Jin; Huang, Qiuhua; Huang, Shaozhen; Ji, Liang; Jin, Haihao; Lei, Xiao; Li, Chunyan; Wu, Guihui; Li, Jike; Li, Minqing",Pharmacol Res,718,16

Hypertension and respiratory inflammation are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure via Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, counteracting its chronic effects, and serves as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we do not yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) to help understand the relationship of the RAAS to COVID-19, we must identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes and understand their expression patterns. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic and phylogenetic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have one or more zebrafish orthologs or co-orthologs. Results identified a specific type of enterocyte as the specific site of expression of zebrafish orthologs of key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, Slc6a19 (SARS-CoV-2 co-receptor), and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep (receptor for the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E), and Dpp4 (receptor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, MERS-CoV). Results identified specific vascular cell subtypes expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes.

The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions).

Although healthcare workers are well-known to be at increased risk, data for other occupations are lacking. In lieu of this, models have been used to forecast occupational risk using various predictors, but no model heretofore has used data from actual case numbers. This study assesses the differential risk of COVID-19 by occupation using predictors from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and correlating them with case counts published by the Washington State Department of Health to identify workers in individual occupations at highest risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The O*NET database was screened for potential predictors of differential COVID-19 risk by occupation. Case counts delineated by occupational group were obtained from public sources. Prevalence by occupation was estimated and correlated with O*NET data to build a regression model to predict individual occupations at greatest risk. RESULTS: Two variables correlate with case prevalence: disease exposure (r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002), and predict 47.5% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003) on multiple linear regression analysis. The highest risk occupations are in healthcare, particularly dental, but many nonhealthcare occupations are also vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: Models can be used to identify workers vulnerable to COVID-19, but predictions are tempered by methodological limitations.

We evaluated the performance and added value of a commercial deep learning (DL) algorithm in detecting pneumonia on chest radiographs (CRs) of patients visiting the emergency department (ED) with acute FRI. This single-centre, retrospective study included 377 consecutive patients who visited the ED and the resulting 387 CRs in August 2018–January 2019. The performance of a DL algorithm in detection of pneumonia on CRs was evaluated based on area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values (NPVs), and positive predictive values (PPVs). Three ED physicians independently reviewed CRs with observer performance test to detect pneumonia, which was re-evaluated with the algorithm eight weeks later. AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity measurements were compared between “DL algorithm” vs. “physicians-only” and between “physicians-only” vs. “physicians aided with the algorithm”. Among 377 patients, 83 (22.0%) had pneumonia. AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the algorithm for detection of pneumonia on CRs were 0.861, 58.3%, 94.4%, 74.2%, and 89.1%, respectively. For the detection of ‘visible pneumonia on CR’ (60 CRs from 59 patients), AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.940, 81.7%, 94.4%, 74.2%, and 96.3%, respectively. In the observer performance test, the algorithm performed better than the physicians for pneumonia (AUROC, 0.861 vs. 0.788, p = 0.017; specificity, 94.4% vs. 88.7%, p &lt; 0.0001) and visible pneumonia (AUROC, 0.940 vs. 0.871, p = 0.007; sensitivity, 81.7% vs. 73.9%, p = 0.034; specificity, 94.4% vs. 88.7%, p &lt; 0.0001). Detection of pneumonia (sensitivity, 82.2% vs. 53.2%, p = 0.008; specificity, 98.1% vs. 88.7%; p &lt; 0.0001) and ‘visible pneumonia’ (sensitivity, 82.2% vs. 73.9%, p = 0.014; specificity, 98.1% vs. 88.7%, p &lt; 0.0001) significantly improved when the algorithm was used by the physicians. Mean reading time for the physicians decreased from 165 to 101 min with the assistance of the algorithm. Thus, the DL algorithm showed a better diagnosis of pneumonia, particularly visible pneumonia on CR, and improved diagnosis by ED physicians in patients with acute FRI.","Kim, Jae Hyun; Kim, Jin Young; Kim, Gun Ha; Kang, Donghoon; Kim, In Jung; Seo, Jeongkuk; Andrews, Jason R.; Park, Chang Min",J.

Our hypothesis was that text messaging would be an effective way to convey updates. METHODS: In this observational study, 295 patients received text messaging alerts. Eligibility included patients who had their surgery postponed and had a cell phone that received text messages. Engagement rates were determined using embedded smart links. Patient survey responses were collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,032 texts were delivered. Engagement rates averaged 90%. Survey responses (n = 111) demonstrated that 98.2% of patients liked the text messages and 95.5% said that they felt more connected to their care team;91.9% of patients agreed that the text updates helped them avoid calling the office. Patients with higher pain levels reported more frustration with their surgery delay (5.3 versus 2.8 on 1 to 10 scale, P value &lt; 0.01). More frustrated patients wished they received more text messages (24.4% versus 4.6%, P value = 0.04) and found the content less helpful (8.2 versus 9.2 on 1 to 10 scale, P value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Text messaging updates are an efficient way to communicate with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campbell, K. J.; Blackburn, B. E.; Erickson, J. A.; Pelt, C. E.; Anderson, L.

Within only half a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 19 million reported cases across 188 countries with more than 700,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike any other disease in history, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of data, well documented, continuously updated, and broadly available to the general public. Yet, the precise role of mathematical modeling in providing quantitative insight into the COVID-19 pandemic remains a topic of ongoing debate. Here we discuss the lessons learned from six month of modeling COVID-19. We highlight the early success of classical models for infectious diseases and show why these models fail to predict the current outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. We illustrate how data-driven modeling can integrate classical epidemiology modeling and machine learning to infer critical disease parameters-in real time-from reported case data to make informed predictions and guide political decision making. We critically discuss questions that these models can and cannot answer and showcase controversial decisions around the early outbreak dynamics, outbreak control, and exit strategies. We anticipate that this summary will stimulate discussion within the modeling community and help provide guidelines for robust mathematical models to understand and manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

This review provided strong support for central nervous system (CNS) infection with SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the neurological mechanism underlying the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the published data, only 1.28% COVID-19 patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. However, this does not mean the absence of CNS infection in most COVID-19 patients because postmortem studies revealed that some patients with CNS infection showed negative results in CSF tests for SARS-CoV-2. Among 20 neuropathological studies reported so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain of 58 cases in nine studies, and three studies have provided sufficient details on the CNS infection in COVID-19 patients. Almost all in vitro and in vivo experiments support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. In infected animals, SARS-CoV-2 was found within neurons in different brain areas with a wide spectrum of neuropathology, consistent with the reported clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 used the hematopoietic route to enter the CNS. But more evidence supports the trans-neuronal hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to invade the brain via the olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal pathways, especially at the early stage of infection. Severe COVID-19 patients with neurological deficits are at a higher risk of mortality, and only the infected animals showing neurological symptoms became dead, suggesting that neurological involvement may be one cause of death.","Liu, Jia-Mei; Tan, Bai-Hong; Wu, Shuang; Gui, Yue; Suo, Jia-Le; Li, Yan-Chao",J Med Virol,718,16

In a systematic analysis we identified 142 datasets with information on severity of disease by age for 32 different infectious diseases, 19 viral and 13 bacterial. For almost all infections, school-age children have the least severe disease, and severity starts to rise long before old age. Indeed, for many infections even young adults have more severe disease than children, and dengue was the only infection that was most severe in school-age children. Together with data on vaccine response in children and young adults, the findings suggest peak immune function is reached around 5-14 years of age. Relative immune senescence may begin much earlier than assumed, before accelerating in older age groups.

We report the results of a resident led initiative to standardize postoperative prescription practices within the Department of Otolaryngology at a single tertiary-care academic hospital in order to reduce overall opioid distribution. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Following approval by the Institutional Review Board, performed a retrospective review of 12 months before (July 2016-June 2017) and after (July 2017-June 2018) implementation of the Postoperative Analgesia Protocol, which included all adults undergoing tonsillectomy, septoplasty, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, tympanoplasty, middle ear exploration, stapedectomy, and ossicular chain reconstruction. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty eight procedures met inclusion criteria. Following implementation, total morphine milligram equivalents decreased by 26% (P < .0001). The number of patients requiring opioid refills decreased by 49%, and morphine milligram equivalents received as refills decreased by 16% (P < .001). Thyroid and parathyroid surgery had the greatest reduction in morphine milligram equivalents prescribed (84%, P < .001), followed by septoplasty (30%, P = .001) and tonsillectomy (18%, P < .001). The number of patients receiving refills of opioid medications decreased for all procedures (tonsillectomy 54%; septoplasty 67%; thyroid/parathyroid surgery 80%, middle ear surgery 100%). CONCLUSIONS: While every patient and surgery must be treated individually, this study demonstrates that a resident led standardization of pain control regimes can result in significant reductions in total quantity of opioids prescribed.

Aim: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. Methods: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV­2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.","Streng, A; Hartmann, K; Armann, J; Berner, R; Liese, J G",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,718,1

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon. We designed this study to better understand the correlation of interpersonal trauma exposures and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-seven women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined three questions examining firearm perceptions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics. RESULTS: Ease of firearm acquisition: Women who were older (mean 44.92 years +/- SD 12.05), compared to women who were younger (40.91 +/- SD 11.81 years) were more likely to describe it as easy or very easy to acquire a gun (aOR 1.05, 95%CI 1.004, 1.10). Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14, 0.67). Odds of guns in the home: Women who were divorced or separated (aOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.09, 0.54), women were widowed or single (aOR0.23, 95%CI 0.08, 0.67), and women who were partnered (aOR 0.45 95%CI 0.20, 0.97) had lower odds of having a gun in the home, compared to married women. There was no significant effect of the trauma variables on the odds of having a gun at home. CONCLUSIONS: Women with more severe childhood trauma felt less safe around firearms, but trauma exposures did not predict the perception of gun prevalence in the local community or gun ownership. Instead, demographic factors of marriage predicted presence of a gun in the home.","Leuenberger, Laura; Lehman, Erik; McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer",BMC Womens Health,718,1

ISGs antagonize viral pathogens directly through diverse mechanisms acting at different stages of viral life cycles, and indirectly by modulating cell cycle and promoting programmed cell death. The mechanisms of action and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable the high throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating the potentially confounding effects of endogenous IFN and potential antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG induction in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to IFN. Engineered CRISPRa cell lines demonstrated inducible, robust, and specific gRNA-directed expression of ISGs, which are functional in restricting viral infection. Using this platform, we screened for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of candidate hits by complementary targeted CRISPRa and ectopic cDNA expression infection experiments, which, among other hits, confirmed OAS1 as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor. OAS1 exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, and these effects required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a robust, high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by the identification of multiple novel SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.","Danziger, Oded; Patel, Roosheel S; DeGrace, Emma J; Rosen, Mikaela R; Rosenberg, Brad R",,718,4

Delays prolong myocardial ischemia and increase the risk of complications, including death. The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted STEMI management. We evaluated the relative volume of hospitalizations and clinical time intervals within a regional STEMI system. Methods: 494 patients with STEMI were grouped into pre-lockdown, lockdown and re-opening cohorts. Clinical, temporal and outcome data were collected and compared between groups for both urban and rural patients, receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and pharmacoinvasive revascularization, respectively. Data was compared to a 10-year historical comparator. Results: During pre-lockdown there was 238 cases versus 193 in lockdown; a 19.0% reduction in volume. When lockdown was compared to the median caseload from a 10-year historical cohort, a 19.8% reduction was observed. For patients treated with primary PCI during lockdown, median symptom-to-balloon time increased by 44-minutes [217 (IQR 157-387) vs. 261 (160-659) minutes; p=0.03]; driven by an increase in median symptom-to-door time of 41-minutes [136 (IQR 80-267) vs. 177 (IQR 90-569) minutes; p<0.01]. Only patients transferred from non-PCI facilities demonstrated an increase in door-to-reperfusion time [116 (IQR 93-150) vs. 139 (IQR 100-199) minutes; p<0.01]. More patients had left ventricular dysfunction during the lockdown [35% vs. 44%; p=0.04], but there was no difference in mortality. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 lockdown, fewer patients presented with STEMI. Time-to-reperfusion was significantly prolonged and appeared driven predominantly by patient-level and transfer delays. Public education and systems-level changes will be integral to STEMI care during the second wave of COVID-19.","Clifford, Cole R; Le May, Michel; Chow, Alyssa; Boudreau, Rene; Fu, Angel Y N; Barry, Quinton; Chong, Aun Yeong; So, Derek Y F",,718,19

A land use planning vision for the Italian Mezzogiorno in the post pandemic",14.332188,0.8728691,2020,"During a disease pandemic, there is still a requirement to perform postmortem examinations within the context of legal considerations. The management of the dead from COVID-19 should not impede the medicolegal investigation of the death where required by the authorities and legislation but additional health and safety precautions should be adopted for the necessary postmortem procedures. The authors have therefore used the craniotomy box in an innovative way to enable a safe alternative for skull and brain removal procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 bodies. The craniotomy box technique was tested on a confirmed COVID-19 positive body where a full postmortem examination was performed by a team of highly trained personnel in a negative pressure Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy suite in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (IPFN) Malaysia. This craniotomy box is a custom-made transparent plastic box with five walls but without a floor. Two circular holes were made in one wall for the placement of arms in order to perform the skull opening procedure. A swab to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was taken from the interior surface of the craniotomy box after the procedure. The result from the test using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) proved that an additional barrier provided respiratory protection by containing the aerosols generated from the skull opening procedure. This innovation ensures procedures performed inside this craniotomy box are safe for postmortem personnel performing high risk autopsies during pandemics.","Hasmi, Ahmad Hafizam; Khoo, Lay See; Koo, Zhao Peng; Suriani, Muhammad Uzair Ahmad; Hamdan, Ain Nurfarahana; Yaro, Siti Wira Md; Arshad, Salmah; Siew, Sheue Feng; Ibrahim, Mohamad Azaini; Mahmood, Mohd Shah",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,718,26

With this topology, a global landscape of the steady states is found. We show how to predict the noise-selected pattern which agrees with those from stochastic simulations. Our formalism and the topology might offer an approach to explore similar systems, such as the Navier Stokes equation.","Chen, Yong-Cong; Shi, Chunxiao; Kosterlitz, J M; Zhu, Xiaomei; Ao, Ping",Proc.

We conducted a survey to evaluate patients’ perspective of telephone visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients receiving a scheduled telephone call, as a virtual visit, from urologists at our clinic were asked to participate in a three-minute, self-administered, online questionnaire. After verbal permission was obtained, the survey was emailed to each participant. The outcomes evaluated were telephone visit satisfaction and preference for type of appointment. Non-parametric tests were used to analyze the results. The study was approved by the Sunnybrook Research Ethics Board. Results: A total of 102 participants were included; 96% of participants assessed the telephone visit as a positive experience in every survey question, while 45% expressed no preference. In those who expressed a preference, this was evenly divided between in-office visits and phone visits (p=0.0614). Participants who lived more than 75 km from the hospital were less likely to prefer an in-office visit compared to those residing locally (U=433; p=0.006; odds ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.106–0.779; p=0.0142). Conclusions: In this survey, most participants assessed the telephone visit positively. Almost half had no preference and a similar proportion expressed a preference for in-office and telephone visits. Patients who resided farther from the hospital were more likely to prefer the telephone visit. This is the first study that we know of to assess patients’ preferences regarding remote encounters in urology.","Locke, Jennifer; Herschorn, Sender; Neu, Sarah; Klotz, Laurence; Kodama, Ron; Carr, Lesley",Can.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the &#916;QTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and &#916;QTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2-62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2-425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0-443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a &#916;QTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) &#916;QTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [-4.0-18.0; -75.0-51.0] vs. 7.0 [-10.5-23.5; -53.0-59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine was well tolerated, and there were no drug-related non-serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who were stable and did not require hospitalization.","Sogut, Ozgur; Can, Mehmet Mustafa; Guven, Ramazan; Kaplan, Onur; Ergenc, Hüseyin; Umit, Tuba Betül; Demir, Olgun; Kaya, Murat; Akdemir, Tarik; Cakmak, Sümeyye",Am J Emerg Med,718,1

We use a micro-macro approach to examine whether and to what extent barriers to accessing healthcare measured by reported unmet healthcare needs vary within and between countries. We consider various aspects of barriers and distinguish among: (1) respondents who forewent medical treatment because they were afraid of becoming infected with the Coronavirus; (2) respondents who had pre-scheduled medical appointments postponed by health providers due to the outbreak; and (3) respondents who tried to arrange a medical appointment but were denied one. Limited access to healthcare during the initial outbreak was more common for the occupationally active, women, the more educated and those living in urban areas. A bad economic situation, poor overall health and higher healthcare utilisation were robust predictors of unmet healthcare. People aged 50+ in countries of 'Old' Europe, countries with higher universal health coverage and stricter containment and closure policies were more likely to have medical services postponed. Policymakers should address the healthcare needs of older people with chronic health conditions and a poor socio-economic status who were made more vulnerable by this pandemic. In the aftermath of the health crisis, public health systems might experience a great revival in healthcare demand, a challenge that should be mitigated by careful planning and provision of healthcare services.","Smolic, Sime; Cipin, Ivan; Medimurec, Petra",Eur J Ageing,718,24

We assessed contamination during routine sample analysis in automated clinical chemistry and microbiology laboratories. METHODS: A fluorescent marker was applied to specimen container exteriors to assess the impact of gross contamination. Nonpathogenic MS2 virus was added to remnant blood, urine, and ESwab matrices as a biomarker of cross-contamination. Samples were processed and analyzed using Roche Cobas 8100 and ISE, c502, e602, and c702 modules (blood) and BD Kiestra total laboratory automation (blood, urine, ESwabs) over 3 experiments. Fluorescence transfer to laboratory surfaces and personnel was visualized using ultraviolet light. Surfaces were swabbed and assessed for MS2 cross-contamination by RT-PCR. Adherence to standard precautions by laboratory staff was assessed by observation. RESULTS: Fluorescence was observed on 49 of 165 (30%) laboratory surfaces and personnel and 21 of 93 (23%) total laboratory automation instruments. Fluorescence transferred most frequently to gloves (31/40), computer accessories (9/18), and specimen loading racks (12/12). None of 123 areas swabbed were positive for MS2. Improper personal protective equipment use occurred at a rate of 0.36 and 0.15 events per staff per hour in the chemistry and microbiology laboratories, respectively. Hand-washing compliance was observed for 61 of 132 (46%) staff members evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of grossly contaminated specimens on automated chemistry and microbiology equipment elicits a low likelihood of instrument contamination. However, handling contaminated specimen containers can result in contamination of environmental laboratory surfaces, representing a source of risk that is heightened by low adherence to appropriate personal protective equipment.","Farnsworth, Christopher W; Wallace, Meghan A; Liu, Albert; Gronowski, Ann M; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Yarbrough, Melanie L",Clin Chem,718,25

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary widely and the spectrum of clinical presentation has yet to be fully characterised (2). Many countries have detailed their early experience with COVID-19, with a focus on the clinical characteristics of the disease. However, to our knowledge, there has been no such study detailing symptoms in the Irish population. AIM: Our aim is to describe COVID-19 symptoms in the Irish population at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare symptoms between those reporting positive and negative test results. METHOD: A Web page MyCovidSymptoms.ie was created by researchers at the National University of Ireland, Galway, in April 2020 to investigate COVID-19 symptoms in Ireland. The Web page invited participants to self-report RT-PCR test outcome data (positive, negative, untested), temperature and a range of symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of taste, loss of smell). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three Irish participants who had a RT-PCR test for COVID-19 logged their symptoms. Eighty-four patients reported that they tested positive for COVID-19, and 39 patients reported a negative COVID-19 test. In our cohort of respondents with a positive COVID-19 test, 49/84 (58%) respondents reported a cough. Of the 39 respondents with a negative COVID-19 test, 17 (44%) reported having a cough. The distribution of temperature was similar in both those with and without COVID-19. Levels of self-reported fatigue were high in both groups with 65/84 (77%) of COVID-19-positive patients reporting fatigue and 30/39 (77%) of those who were COVID-19-negative reporting fatigue. New symptoms emerging at the time of data collection included loss of taste and smell. We demonstrated a higher proportion of loss of smell (p = 0.02) and taste (p = 0.01) in those reporting a positive result, compared to those reporting a negative result. CONCLUSION: These data represents an early picture of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in an Irish population. It also highlights the potential use of self-reported data globally as a powerful tool in helping with the pandemic.","Gibbons, Claire; Hussain, Mouzzam; O039,; Keeffe, Derek T; Simpkin, Andrew J",Ir. j. med. sci,718,26

Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities. However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs. The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic. In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications. In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

Data on a daily number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of COVID-19-related deaths were gatheredfrom the official governmental website. Meteorological observations from 55 synoptic stations in Poland were used. Moreover, reports on the movement of people across different categories of places were collected. A cross-correlation function, principal component analysis and random forest were applied. Maximum temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity and variability of mean daily temperature affected the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase intemperature and sunshine hours decreased the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The occurrence of high humidity caused an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases 14 days later. Decreased sunshine duration and increased air humidity had a negative impact on the number of COVID-19-related deaths.

It considers the various contributions of the special issue and shows how the Treaty emerged in an era of shifting cleavages, disputed steps towards a more political Union and rising populism. This legacy has led to more polarisation and politicisation – a phenomenon that the Treaty of Lisbon struggles to encapsulate and conciliate with the culture of consensus and compromise inherent to its institutional structures. As a result, we observe a bias towards policy stability – and even failure – that affects the legitimacy and democratic standards of the European Union. In a context of polycrisis, the difficulty to find compromises – especially in highly normative issues – leads to the de-politicisation of the EU and reinforces the gap between EU institutions and its citizens.

According to WHO guidelines, continuous use of face mask is mandatory for personal protection for restricting the spread of bacteria and virus. Here, we report a 3-ply cotton-PLA-cotton layered biodegradable face-mask containing encapsulated phytochemicals in the inner-filtration layer. The nano-fibrous PLA filtration layer was fabricated using needleless electrospinning of PLA & phytochemical-based herbal-extracts. This 3-layred face mask exhibits enhanced air permeability with a differential pressure of 35.78â¯Pa/cm2 and superior bacterial filtration efficiency of 97.9% compared to conventional face masks. Close-packed mesh structure of the nano-fibrous mat results in effective adsorption of particulate matter, aerosol particles, and bacterial targets deep inside the filtration layer. The outer hydrophobic layer of mask exhibited effective blood splash resistance up to a distance of 30â¯cm, ensuring its utilization for medical practices. Computational analysis of constituent phytochemicals using the LibDock algorithm predicted inhibitory activity of chemicals against the protein structured bacterial sites. The computational analysis projected superior performance of phytochemicals considering the presence of stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and Arachidic acid exhibiting structural complementarity to inhibit targeted bacterial interface. Natural cotton fibers and PLA bio-polymer demonstrated promising biodegradable characteristics in the presence of in-house cow-dung based biodegradation slurry. Addition of jaggery to the slurry elevated the biodegradation performance, resulting in increment of change of weight from 07% to 12%. The improved performance was attributed to the increased sucrose content in biodegradation slurry, elevating the bacterial growth in the slurry. An innovative face mask has shown promising results for utilization in day-to-day life and medical frontline workers, considering the post-pandemic environmental impacts.","Patil, Nikhil Avinash; Gore, Prakash Macchindra; Prakash, Niranjana Jaya; Govindaraj, Premika; Yadav, Ramdayal; Verma, Vivek; Shanmugarajan, Dhivya; Patil, Shivanand; Kore, Abhay; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian",Chem Eng J,718,16

Both coagulation methods achieved â¼5-log removal/inactivation of Ï6 in 20 min. Enhanced removal was attributed to the high hydrophobicity of Ï6 imparted by its characteristic phospholipid envelope. Ï6 adhesion to freshly precipitated iron (hydr)oxide also led to envelope damage causing inactivation in both coagulation techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed oxidative damages to Ï6 lipids only for electrocoagulation consistent with electro-Fenton reactions. Monitoring Ï6 dsRNA by a novel reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method quantified significantly lower viral removal/inactivation in water compared with the plaque assay demonstrating that relying solely on RT-qPCR assays may overstate human health risks arising from viruses.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (Bærum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS: In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital.

DESIGN: An online survey among Dutch midwives, obstetricians and obstetric residents. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between the respondents' characteristics and answers. RESULTS: Reported advantages of the changes were fewer prenatal and postpartum consultations (50.1%). The necessity and safety of medical interventions and ultrasounds were considered more critically (75.9%); 14.8% of community midwives stated they referred fewer women to the hospital for decreased fetal movements, whereas 64.2% of the respondents working in hospital-based care experienced fewer consultations for this indication. Respondents felt that women had more confidence in giving birth at home (57.5%). Homebirths seemed to have increased according to 38.5% of the community midwives and 65.3% of the respondents working in hospital-based care. Respondents appreciated the shift to more digital consultations rather than face-to-face consultations. Mentioned disadvantages were that women had appointments alone, (71.1%) and that the community midwife was not allowed to join a woman to obstetric-led care during labour and subsequently stay with her (56.8%). Fewer postpartum visits by family and friends led to more tranquility (59.8%). Overall, however, 48.0% of the respondents felt that the safety of maternity care was compromised due to policy changes. CONCLUSIONS: Maternity care professionals were positive about the decrease in routine care and the increased confidence of women in home birth, but also felt that safety in maternity care was sometimes compromised. According to the respondents in a future crisis situation it should be possible for community midwives to continue to deliver a personal handover after the referral of women to the hospital, and to stay with them.","van Manen, Eline L M; Hollander, Martine; Feijen-de Jong, Esther; de Jonge, Ank; Verhoeven, Corine; Gitsels, Janneke",PLoS One,718,16

It has been reported that text clustering algorithms are hard to achieve better performance than supervised methods and their clustering performance is highly dependent on the picked text features. Currently, there are many different types of text feature generation algorithms, each of which extracts text features from some specific aspects, such as VSM and distributed word embedding, thus seeking a new way of obtaining features as complete as possible from the corpus is the key to enhance the clustering effects. In this paper, we present a hybrid multisource feature fusion (HMFF) framework comprising three components, feature representation of multimodel, mutual similarity matrices and feature fusion, in which we construct mutual similarity matrices for each feature source and fuse discriminative features from mutual similarity matrices by reducing dimensionality to generate HMFF features, then k-means clustering algorithm could be configured to partition input samples into groups. The experimental tests show our HMFF framework outperforms other recently published algorithms on 7 of 11 public benchmark datasets and has the leading performance on the rest 4 benchmark datasets as well. At last, we compare HMFF framework with those competitors on a COVID-19 dataset from the wild with the unknown cluster count, which shows the clusters generated by HMFF framework partition those similar samples much closer.","Chen, Jiaxuan; Gui, Shenglin",,718,1

Intradermal immunization with SARS-CoV N protein was demonstrated to elicit non-protective T cell responses which may be avoided by intranasal vaccination. Therefore, we conducted intranasal vaccination of BALB/c mice with recombinant adenovirus type-5 expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Such procedure induced CD8 T cell responses in the lung. Meanwhile CD4 T cell responses were observed in the spleen, which was associated with robust antibody production.

In the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, health information is being produced, revised, updated and disseminated at an increasingly rapid rate. The general public are faced with a plethora of misinformation regarding COVID-19 and the readability of online information has an impact on their understanding of the disease. The accessibility of online healthcare information relating to COVID-19 is unknown. We sought to evaluate the readability of online information relating to COVID-19 in four English speaking regions: Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, and compare readability of website source provenance and regional origin. METHODS: The Google® search engine was used to collate the first 20 webpage URLs for three individual searches for 'COVID', 'COVID-19', and 'coronavirus' from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (FKG) Score, Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) score were calculated to assess the readability. RESULTS: There were poor levels of readability webpages reviewed, with only 17.2% of webpages at a universally readable level. There was a significant difference in readability between the different webpages based on their information source (p < 0.01). Public Health organisations and Government organisations provided the most readable COVID-19 material, while digital media sources were significantly less readable. There were no significant differences in readability between regions. CONCLUSION: Much of the general public have relied on online information during the pandemic. Information on COVID-19 should be made more readable, and those writing webpages and information tools should ensure universal accessibility is considered in their production. Governments and healthcare practitioners should have an awareness of the online sources of information available, and ensure that readability of our own productions is at a universally readable level which will increase understanding and adherence to health guidelines.","Worrall, Amy P; Connolly, Mary J; O039,; Neill, Aine; Doherty, Murray; Thornton, Kenneth P; McNally, Cora; McConkey, Samuel J; de Barra, Eoghan",BMC Public Health,718,21

TGF-ß1 and oxidative stress cooperate to drive fibrosis. Cells can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through activation and/or induction of NADPH oxidases, such as dual oxidase (DUOX1/2). Since DUOX enzymes, as extracellular H2O2-generating systems, are involved in extracellular matrix formation and in wound healing in different experimental models, we hypothesised that DUOX-based NADPH oxidase plays a role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis.Our in vivo data (IPF patients and mouse models of lung fibrosis) showed that the NADPH oxidase DUOX1 is induced in response to lung injury. DUOX1-deficient mice (DUOX1+/- and DUOX1-/-) had an attenuated fibrotic phenotype. In addition to being highly expressed at the epithelial surface of airways, DUOX1 appears to be also well expressed in the fibroblastic foci of remodelled lungs. By using primary human and mouse lung fibroblasts, we showed that TGF-ß1 upregulates DUOX1 and its maturation factor DUOXA1 and that DUOX1-derived H2O2 promoted the duration of TGF-ß1-activated Smad3 phosphorylation by preventing phospho-Smad3 degradation. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that DUOX1 inhibited the interaction between phospho-Smad3 and the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, preventing NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination of phospho-Smad3 and its targeting for degradation.These findings highlight a role for DUOX1-derived H2O2 in a positive feedback that amplifies the signalling output of the TGF-ß1 pathway and identify DUOX1 as a new therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis.","Louzada, Ruy Andrade; Corre, Raphaël; Ameziane El Hassani, Rabii; Meziani, Lydia; Jaillet, Madeleine; Cazes, Aurélie; Crestani, Bruno; Deutsch, Eric; Dupuy, Corinne",Eur. respir. j,718,24

Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.","Rhee, Chanu; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Baker, Meghan; Klompas, Michael",Clin. infect. dis,718,24

They are at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting this virus. This study aims to assess perception and attitude of HCWs in Saudi Arabia with regard to Covid-19, and to identify potential associated predictors. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, HCWs at three tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia were surveyed via email with an anonymous link, by a concern scale about Covid-19 pandemic during 15-30 April, 2020. Concerns of disease severity, governmental efforts to contain it and disease outcomes were assessed using 32 concern statements in five distinct domains. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of high concern scores. RESULTS: A total of 844 HCW responded to the survey. Their average age was 40.4 ± 9.5 years, 40.3% were nurses, 58.2% had direct patient contact, and 77.3% were living with others. The majority of participants (72.1%) had overall concern scores of 55 or less out of a maximum score of 96 points, with an overall mean score of 48.5 ± 12.8 reflecting moderate level of concern. Three-fourth of respondents felt at risk of contracting Covid-19 infection at work, 69.1% felt threatened if a colleague contracted Covid-19, 69.9% felt obliged to care for patients infected with Covid-19 while 27.7% did not feel safe at work using the standard precautions available. Nearly all HCWs believed that the government should isolate patients with Covid-19 in specialized hospitals (92.9%), agreed with travel restriction to and/or from areas affected by Covid-19 (94.7%) and felt safe the government implemented curfew and movement restriction periods (93.6%). Predictors of high concern scores were; HCWs of Saudi nationality (p < 0.001), younger age (p = 0.003), undergraduate education (p = 0.044), living with others (p = 0.003) working in the western region (p = 0.003) and direct contact with patients (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high concern among HCWs about Covid-19 and identifies the predictors of those with highest concern levels. To minimize the potential negative impact of those concerns on the performance of HCWs during pandemics, measures are necessary to enhance their protection and to minimize the psychological effect of the perceived risk of infection.","Abolfotouh, Mostafa A; Almutairi, Adel F; BaniMustafa, Ala039; a, A; Hussein, Mohamed A",BMC Infect Dis,718,24

This study was done as there is scarce data on mortality predictors in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to ICU in the Indian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to tertiary care center during June-October 2020. The records of patients admitted to ICU were collected and data included demography, symptoms, comorbidites and vital parameters. Laboratory parameters included complete hemogram, random blood sugar, S.Ferritin, S.LDH, renal function test, liver function test. Treatment-associated information such as the use of remdesivir, timing of initiating rem-desivir after the symptom onset, the use of steroids, use of anticoagulants, use of HFNC, NIV, ventilator were collected. 30 days mortality data post-discharge was collected via telephonic interview. RESULTS: 4,012 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, of which 560 (13.95%) with severe pneumonia were included in the study. Mean age was 57.75 ± 13.96 years. The mortality rates were 54.64% among severe COVID-19 cases and 5% among mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. The Cox multinominal regression analysis identified SpO2/FiO2 < 400, age > 50 years, duration of symptom > 4 days, serum ferritin > 450 µg/L, respiratory rate > 23/min, the presence of comorbidities and non-usage of remdesivir were independently associated with increased mortality. Mortality rate at 30 days was 56.60%. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with very high mortality, especially in a resource-constrained setting. The use of remdesivir may have to be considered early in the course of disease to prevent excess mortality related to COVID-19.","Mahendra, M; Nuchin, Abhishek; Kumar, Ranjith; Shreedhar, S; Mahesh, Padukudru Anand",Adv Respir Med,718,1

Objective: To explore the association of audio-only virtual prenatal care with perinatal outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study compared perinatal outcomes of women who delivered between May 1 and October 31, 2019 (n = 6559), and received in-person prenatal visits only with those who delivered between May 1 and October 31, 2020 (n = 6048), when audio-only virtual visits were integrated into prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic, as feasible based on pregnancy complications. Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, Texas, provides care to the vulnerable obstetric population of the county via a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital. All deliveries of infants weighing more than 500 g, whether live or stillborn, were included. Exposures: Prenatal care incorporating audio-only prenatal care visits. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit admission in a full-term (&#8805;37 weeks) infant, and umbilical cord blood pH less than 7.0. Visit data, maternal characteristics, and other perinatal outcomes were also examined. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 6559 women who delivered in 2019 was 27.8 (6.4) years, and the age of the 6048 women who delivered in 2020 was 27.7 (6.5) years (P = .38). Of women delivering in 2020, 1090 (18.0%) were non-Hispanic Black compared with 1067 (16.3%) in 2019 (P = .04). In the 2020 cohort, 4067 women (67.2%) attended at least 1 and 1216 women (20.1%) attended at least 3 audio-only virtual prenatal visits. Women who delivered in 2020 attended a greater mean (SD) number of prenatal visits compared with women who delivered in 2019 (9.8 [3.4] vs 9.4 [3.8] visits; P < .001). In the 2020 cohort, 173 women (2.9%) experienced the composite outcome, which was not significantly different than the 195 women (3.0%) in 2019 (P = .71). In addition, the rate of the composite outcome did not differ substantially when examined according to the number of audio-only virtual visits attended. Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of audio-only virtual prenatal visits was not associated with changes in perinatal outcomes and increased prenatal visit attendance in a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic when used in a risk-appropriate model.","Duryea, Elaine L; Adhikari, Emily H; Ambia, Anne; Spong, Catherine; McIntire, Donald; Nelson, David B",JAMA Netw Open,718,20

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.","La Rosa, Giuseppina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Suffredini, Elisabetta",Water Res,718,26

We observed higher levels of CCC-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2-seronegative HCW compared to community donors, consistent with potential higher occupational exposure of HCW to CCC. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 T-cell reactivity of seronegative HCW was higher than community controls and correlation between CCC and SARS-CoV-2 responses is consistent with cross-reactivity and not associated with recent in vivo activation. Surprisingly, CCC T-cell reactivity was decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses, either directly or indirectly. This result was unexpected, but consistently detected in independent cohorts derived from Miami and San Diego. CD4+ T-cell responses against common cold coronaviruses (CCC) are elevated in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative high-risk health care workers (HCW) compared to COVID-19 convalescent HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses and/or cross-reactivity associated with a protective effect.","da Silva Antunes, Ricardo; Pallikkuth, Suresh; Williams, Erin; Dawen Yu, Esther; Mateus, Jose; Quiambao, Lorenzo; Wang, Eric; Rawlings, Stephen A; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Jiang, Kaijun; Amanat, Fatima; Arnold, David; Andrews, David; Fuego, Irma; Dan, Jennifer M; Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Krammer, Florian; Crotty, Shane; Hoffer, Michael E; Pahwa, Savita G; Sette, Alessandro",J Infect Dis,718,16

COVID-19 is a medium-sized, coated virus with a single-stranded RNA. This virus has one of the largest RNA genomes and is approximately 120 nm. The X-Ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging modalities are widely used to obtain a fast and accurate medical diagnosis. Identifying COVID-19 from these medical images is extremely challenging as it is time-consuming, demanding, and prone to human errors. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies can be used to obtain consistent high performance. Among the AI methodologies, deep learning (DL) networks have gained much popularity compared to traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike ML techniques, all stages of feature extraction, feature selection, and classification are accomplished automatically in DL models. In this paper, a complete survey of studies on the application of DL techniques for COVID-19 diagnostic and automated segmentation of lungs is discussed, concentrating on works that used X-Ray and CT images. Additionally, a review of papers on the forecasting of coronavirus prevalence in different parts of the world with DL techniques is presented.

In this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan (nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk of airborne transmission. Methods: The photochemical deposition method was used to synthesize the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS was evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical particle counter and culture method. Results and Conclusions: In the MS2 PRA, 3 g of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid culture (2 ± 0.5 × 1016 PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter were inactivated within 20 minutes. The Wells-Riley model predicted that when the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter was used in the ventilation system, airborne infection probability would reduce from 99% to 34.6%. The nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter could remain at 50% of its original antiviral efficiency after continuous operation for 1 week, indicating its feasibility for the control of the airborne transmission.","Wang, I-Jen; Chen, Yen-Chi; Su, Chien; Tsai, Ming-Hsuan; Shen, Wan-Tien; Bai, Chun-Hsuan; Yu, Kuo-Pin",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,718,16

Patients with underlying respiratory disease are considered at increased risk of contracting severe COVID-19. Many respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis, have elevated inflammation driven by recruitment of neutrophils, known as neutrophilia, and contributes to disease pathogenesis. In response to viral infection, neutrophils are the first, and predominant, leukocyte recruited to the respiratory tract. Neutrophils release inflammatory mediators as part of the acute inflammatory response and contribute to pathogen clearance through virus internalization and killing, secretion of antimicrobial peptides and extracellular traps. It remains uncertain how critical the neutrophil response is in SARS-CoV-2 and to what extent this contributes to the cytokine response of the airways in COVID-19. We hypothesized that neutrophils are responsible for elevated inflammatory responses in patients who progress to severe COVID-19. Methods: To investigate, we developed a co-culture model of neutrophilic airways to study SARS-CoV-2 infection, combining primary human neutrophils and airway epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface. These cultures, with and without neutrophils, were infected with live SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory responses analyzed. In addition, extensive analysis of ACE2, neutrophils and inflammatory response, was performed comparing our models and COVID-19 patient and non-infected lung tissues. Results: ACE2 protein, the receptor binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, was predominantly expressed in submucosal glands, ciliated cells and in alveolar type 2 cells in human lung tissues. Surprisingly, substantial co-localization of ACE2 was also observed with neutrophil elastase and CD15 expressing neutrophils infiltrating the airways. Analysis of mono-and co-cultures of airway epithelial cells and neutrophils in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated significant increases in the expression of squamous epithelium associated cytokeratins, damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) and a downregulation of interleukin 8 (IL-8) specifically in the co-culture models. Airway supernatants from the basolateral and apical surfaces were profiled. In the neutrophil co-cultures significant increases in IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα were observed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrate that co-culture with neutrophils has a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, changing the inflammatory response and upregulating gene expression patterns associated with tissue remodeling and tissue damage. This study highlights the need to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in more complex, tissue-level models to fully understand the mechanisms driving the severe inflammatory response and the long-term consequences of infection.","Calvert, B.

But little is known about the true frequency of DVT in patients who attend emergency department (ED) and are diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of DVT in patients with COVID-19 attending the ED before hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with DVT in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We compared DVT-COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 without DVT patients (control group). Relative frequencies of DVT were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients visiting the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Sixty-three patient characteristics and four outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 112 DVT in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED [1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-1.80]. This relative frequency was similar than that observed in non-COVID patients [2109/1 388 879; 1.52; 95% CI, 1.45-1.69; odds ratio (OR) = 0.98 [0.82-1.19]. Standardized incidence of DVT was higher in COVID patients (98,38 versus 42,93/100,000/year; OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 2.03-2.38). In COVID patients, the clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting DVT were older age and having a history of venous thromboembolism, recent surgery/immobilization and hypertension; chest pain and desaturation at ED arrival and some analytical disturbances were also more frequently seen, d-dimer >5000 ng/mL being the strongest. After adjustment for age and sex, hospitalization, ICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were more frequent in cases than controls, whereas mortality was similar (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.77-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: DVT was an unusual form of COVID presentation in COVID patients but was associated with a worse prognosis.","Jiménez, Sònia; Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco J; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Piñera, Pascual; Martín, Alfonso; Alquézar, Aitor; García-Lamberechts, Eric J; Jacob, Javier; Grima, María L L; Millán, Javier; Molina, Francisca; Albero, Patricia B; Cardozo, Carlos; Mòdol, Josep M; Aguirre, Alfons; Gaya, Ruth; Adroher, María; Llauger, Lluís; Díaz, Juan J L; González, Nayra C; Aragües, Paula L; Gómez, Ana P; Del Castillo, Juan G",Eur J Emerg Med,718,2

However, the evolving science of COVID-19, the need for quick action, and the disruption of conventional knowledge networks pose challenges to existing CPD practices. To meet these emergent and rapidly evolving needs, what is required is an approach to CPD that draws insights from the domain of knowledge mobilization (KMb). METHODS: This short report describes a research protocol for exploring rapid KMb responses to COVID-19 at one Canadian academic teaching hospital. The proposed research will proceed as a case study using a mixed methods design collecting quantitative (surveys and Web site use metrics) and qualitative data (interviews) from individuals involved in developing, using, and supporting the KMb resources. Analysis will proceed in two phases: descriptive analysis of data to share insights and integrative analysis of data to build theory. RESULTS: Results from this study will inform the immediate KMb and CPD contribution to the COVID-19 response. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will also make a broader contribution to the field of CPD, theoretically informing intersections between KMb and CPD and therefore contributing to an integrated science of CPD.","Rowland, Paula; Tavares, Walter; Lowe, Mandy; Tripp, Tim; Richardson, Juanita; Anderson, Melanie; Oja, Lori Anne; Paton, Morag; Wiljer, David; Woods, Nicole; Ng, Stella",J. contin. educ. health prof,718,1

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small circulating membrane-enclosed entities shed from the cell surface in response to cell activation or apoptosis. EVs transport various kinds of bioactive molecules between cells, including functional RNAs, such as viral RNAs and proteins. Therefore, when EVs are at high levels, changes in cell activation, inflammation, angioplasty and transportation suggest that EVs are associated with various diseases. Clinical research on EVs includes studies on the coagula-tory system. In particular, abnormal enhancement of the coagulatory system through EVs can cause thrombosis. In this review, we address the functions of EVs, thrombosis, and their involvement in viral infection.","Nomura, Shosaku; Taniura, Takehito; Ito, Tomoki",Int. J. Gen. Med.,718,27

Was it responsible for the defeat of incumbent President Donald Trump? The present study makes an initial attempt at, and provides a model for, understanding the pandemic's influence on Trump support. The study employed a mixed experimental and correlational design and surveyed separate samples of adults (N = 1,763) in six waves beginning March 23, 2020 and ending June 1, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to report their Trump support either before or after being reminded of the pandemic with a series of questions gauging their level of concern about it. Results revealed complex and dynamic effects that changed over time. Depending on survey wave, the pandemic seems to have lowered Trump support among Democrats, while (marginally) raising it among independents. Republicans' reactions also changed over time; of particular note, Republicans who were more concerned about the pandemic reported higher Trump support after being reminded of the pandemic in its early stages, but this effect reversed by the time the economy began reopening (coinciding with a dip in Trump's approval ratings). Although the correlational results in the present study did not converge neatly with the experimental results, the combined experimental and correlational approach has the potential to increase researchers' confidence in the causal effects of salient national and international events on political attitudes.","Hart, Joshua",PLoS One,718,24

The aims of the present study were twofold: (i) to study the attitudes, emotional responses, and worries among the dental personnel; and (ii) to look for the ability of dental personnel to experience posttraumatic self-growth as a result of the distress caused by the pandemic. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A cross-sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire was performed simultaneously in Israel, Canada, and France during the initial lockdown period. RESULTS: Israeli dental practitioners were less worried about their physical health, mental health, or relationships with family and friends than their Canadian and French counterparts. The Canadian dental practitioners were most committed and most willing to treat their patients, as well as most concerned about not being able to treat patients in the same personal way as before the lockdown. French dental practitioners showed the highest level of fear to treat patients. There were no differences in dental practitioners' levels of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic growth among the countries. Dental practitioners' posttraumatic growth was significantly associated with worries regarding their physical health. CONCLUSION: Responses of dental personnel to the COVID-19 pandemic varied worldwide. Despite the differences, evidence exists that some of the dental practitioners' worries and concerns are associated with psychologic growth as a result of the pandemic. Better understanding and acknowledgment of dental personnel's worries and concerns can facilitate growth and enable positive functioning under the continuous situation of uncertainty.","Uziel, Nir; Gilon, Efrat; Meyerson, Joseph; Levin, Liran; Khehra, Anahat; Emodi-Perlman, Alona; Eli, Ilana",Quintessence Int,718,16

This may provide insight for addressing similar future events. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MTP logs from March 2020 to August 2020 were compared to logs from March to August 2019. The data were de-identified, and MTP activations and component usage were categorized by activation reason. These categories were compared across the 2-year period to examine the impact of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders, and civil unrest. RESULTS: For the examined 6 months of the year 2020, there were a total of 140 MTP activations, compared to 143 in 2019. There were more activations for violent trauma (VT) in 2020 than 2019 (44 vs. 32). This increase in activations for VT was offset by a decrease in non-trauma activations (54 vs. 66). There was a significant increase in the number of components used in VT activations. DISCUSSION: During 2020, the initial mild decrease in MTP activations was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of activations and component usage for VT in June and July of that year.","Braun, Alexander L; Gorlin, Jed B; Peters, Jessica; Murphy, Sherrie; Van Buren, Nancy L",Transfusion,718,12

We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. Thirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33, respectively.

To detect low viral loads and perform large-scale screening, a low-cost diagnostic test is necessary. Here, we developed a cost-effective test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. We validated an auxiliary protocol for molecular diagnosis with the SYBR Green RT-PCR methodology to successfully screen negative cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed a set of primers with high specificity and no homology with other viruses from the Coronovideae family or human respiratory tract pathogenic viruses, presenting with complementarity only for rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and Legionella spp. Optimization of the annealing temperature and polymerization time led to a high specificity in the PCR products. We have developed a more affordable and swift methodology for negative SARS-CoV-2 screening.

Access to scientifically correct information can assist patients in early detection or prevention of the disease. However, misinformation on social networking sites (SNSs) about breast cancer can be propagated rapidly, posing a threat to health communication efforts. The aim of this study is to analyse the characteristics of the most shared news stories referencing the disease that circulated on SNSs, including the credibility of this content. METHODS: This is an exploratory quali-quantitative study. Data collection was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020. We performed statistical and content analysis of the stories that had at least 1,000 total shares. Each story was classified in accordance to the following aspects: credibility; type of rumour; source; content type; mentions prevention or early detection/screening exams. RESULTS: The abundance of news stories in our sample (n = 1,594) were not classified according to their credibility, as they do not address science, risk factors, prevention, treatment, or other aspects which can be assessed for scientific accuracy. However, content classified as ""rumours"" are 3.29 times more shared than those considered scientifically correct. Regarding content type, most stories are classified as 'real-life story' or 'solidarity' (67.69%). In our sample, 5.08% of the total comment on prevention and 19.7% reference early detection. CONCLUSION: We consider it can be a good strategy, in SNSs, to combine content of greater popularity, such as real-life stories, with subjects that can make a difference in a patient's life, such as early detection, breast cancer symptoms and disease prevention strategies. Doctors, scientists and health journalists can expand the dialogue with the lay public regarding breast cancer, helping to counteract online misinformation.","Biancovilli, Priscila; Makszin, Lilla; Csongor, Alexandra",BMC Womens Health,718,2

This study aimed to assess whether the operational changes put in place to reduce infection risks were effective in engaging and supporting staff. METHODS: Our service's response saw staff and patients split into morning or afternoon shifts without overlap. Changes included extended clinic hours, modified treatment regimens, expanded online/electronic communication and remote working. Staff were invited to respond to an electronic questionnaire in September 2020, just after the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in Victoria. Responses captured demographic data, parental status, profession, happiness levels, fear of COVID-19 and e-communication efficacy. RESULTS: A 57% response rate was achieved. 69% of respondents were female; 40% were aged 45+ and 35% had school-aged children. Staff aged 45+ showed a significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than younger staff. 36% of respondents reported feeling nervous or anxious watching news reports about COVID-19. 92% of staff were happy with their work arrangements; staff with children were happier than staff without children with their shifts. Online chat/channels were reported as the preferred e-communication method between colleagues. CONCLUSION: Staff provided predominantly positive feedback to the changes made in response to the pandemic, reporting high levels of happiness and willingness to continue with the changes implemented during COVID-19.

Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to assess effectiveness of the vaccine in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the durability and mechanism of BCG trained immunity remain unclear. Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections as well as of reported transcriptomic alterations in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that mimic viral infections by, consistent with the present concept of trained immunity, upregulation of antiviral defense response, and oppose viral infections by, inconsistent with the concept, downregulation of myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights argue against possible indiscriminate use of the vaccine and activated innate immune response associated safety concerns in COVID-19, in that order.","Sharma, Abhay",Gene,718,1

Severe forms of COVID-19 are characterized by dysregulated immune response and ""cytokine storm"". The role of IgG and IgM antibodies in COVID-19 pathology is reasonably well studied, whereas IgA is neglected. To improve clinical outcome of patients, immune modulatory drugs appear to be beneficial. Such drugs include intravenous immunoglobulin preparations, which were successfully tested in severe COVID-19 patients. Here we established a versatile in vitro model to study inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory processes by therapeutic human immunoglobulins. We dissect the inflammatory activation on neutrophil-like HL60 cells, using an immune complex consisting of latex beads coated with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and opsonized with specific immunoglobulins from convalescent plasma. Our data clarifies the role of Fc-receptor-dependent phagocytosis via IgA-Fc&#945;RI and IgG-FcÎ³R for COVID-19 disease followed by cytokine release. We show that COVID-19 associated inflammation could be reduced by addition of human immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG and trimodulin), while trimodulin elicits stronger immune modulation by more powerful ITAMi signaling. Besides IgG, the IgA component of trimodulin in particular, is of functional relevance for immune modulation in this assay setup, highlighting the need to study IgA mediated immune response.","Bohländer, Fabian; Riehl, Dennis; Weißmüller, Sabrina; Gutscher, Marcus; Schüttrumpf, Jörg; Faust, Stefanie",Front Immunol,718,20

METHODS: This study respectively enrolled a cohort of surgical patients who underwent surgery in 2018 (group I), 2019 (group II), and 2020 (group III) and a cohort of follow-up patients who had follow-up in 2017 (group A), 2018 (group B), and 2019 (group C) in 13 children hospitals. RESULTS: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 era, there was a significant decrease in total surgical volume and a change in case mix in terms of an increase in the proportion of emergency operations. Decrease in migration scale index was correlated to the decrease in both surgical volume (r = 0.64, P = .02) and outpatient visit volume (r = 0.61, P = .03). There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who had follow-up through the internet or phone in group C (26.4% vs 9.6% in group B and 8.9% in group A; P < .0001). There was no statistical difference in death or rehospitalization among the 3 follow-up groups (P = .49). There was higher parents' anxiety score (P < .0001) and more use of telemedicine (P = .004) in group C compared with groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a considerable decrease in total surgical volume and a change of case mix, which seems to be related to the strict traffic ban.

PCBs are present in the environment as mixtures of multiple isomers at different degree of chlorination. These compounds are manmade and possess useful industrial properties including extreme longevity under harsh conditions, heat absorbance, and the ability to form an oily liquid at room temperature that is useful for electrical utilities and in other industrial applications. They have been widely used for a wide range of industrial purposes over the decades. Despite a ban in production in 1979 in the US and many other countries, they remain persistent and ubiquitous in environment as contaminants due to their improper disposal. Humans, independent of where they live, are therefore exposed to PCBs, which are routinely found in random surveys of human and animal tissues. The prolonged exposures to PCBs have been associated with the development of different diseases and disorders, and they are classified as endocrine disruptors. Due to its ability to interact with thyroid hormone, metabolism and function, they are thought to be implicated in the global rise of obesity diabetes, and their potential toxicity for neurodevelopment and disorders, an example of gene by environmental interaction (GxE). The current review is primarily intended to summarize the evidence for the association of PCB exposures with increased risks for metabolic dysfunctions and neurobehavioral disorders. In particular, we present evidence of gene expression alterations in PCB-exposed populations to construct the underlying pathways that may lead to those diseases and disorders in course of life. We conclude the review with future perspectives on biomarker-based research to identify susceptible individuals and populations.","Simhadri, Jyothirmai J; Loffredo, Christopher A; Trnovec, Tomas; Murinova, Lubica Palkovicova; Nunlee-Bland, Gail; Koppe, Janna G; Schoeters, Greet; Jana, Siddhartha Sankar; Ghosh, Somiranjan",Environ Res,718,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 2 major COVID-19 literature databases, the National Institutes of Health's LitCovid and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 database on March 9, 2021. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, 2 reviewers independently reviewed all the articles in 2 rounds of screening. RESULTS: In the 794 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, we identified 7 key COVID-19 research areas in which AI was applied, including disease forecasting, medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and prognosis (non-imaging), drug repurposing and early drug discovery, social media data analysis, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis, and other COVID-19 research topics. We also found that there was a lack of heterogenous data integration in these AI applications. DISCUSSION: Risk factors relevant to COVID-19 outcomes exist in heterogeneous data sources, including electronic health records, surveillance systems, sociodemographic datasets, and many more. However, most AI applications in COVID-19 research adopted a single-sourced approach that could omit important risk factors and thus lead to biased algorithms. Integrating heterogeneous data for modeling will help realize the full potential of AI algorithms, improve precision, and reduce bias. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data integration in the AI applications in COVID-19 research and a need for a multilevel AI framework that supports the analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources.","Guo, Yi; Zhang, Yahan; Lyu, Tianchen; Prosperi, Mattia; Wang, Fei; Xu, Hua; Bian, Jiang",J Am Med Inform Assoc,718,3

As such, the identification and precise quantification of mosaic mutations is essential for a wide range of research applications, clinical diagnoses, and early detection of cancers. Currently, the low-throughput nature of single allele assays (e.g., allele-specific ddPCR) commonly used for genotyping known mutations at very low alternate allelic fractions (AAFs) have limited the integration of low-level mosaic analyses into clinical and research applications. The growing importance of mosaic mutations requires a more rapid, low-cost solution for mutation detection and validation. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we developed Multiple Independent Primer PCR Sequencing (MIPP-Seq) which combines the power of ultra-deep sequencing and truly independent assays. The accuracy of MIPP-seq to quantifiable detect and measure extremely low allelic fractions was assessed using a combination of SNVs, insertions, and deletions at known allelic fractions in blood and brain derived DNA samples. RESULTS: The Independent amplicon analyses of MIPP-Seq markedly reduce the impact of allelic dropout, amplification bias, PCR-induced, and sequencing artifacts. Using low DNA inputs of either 25 ng or 50 ng of DNA, MIPP-Seq provides sensitive and quantitative assessments of AAFs as low as 0.025% for SNVs, insertion, and deletions. CONCLUSIONS: MIPP-Seq provides an ultra-sensitive, low-cost approach for detecting and validating known and novel mutations in a highly scalable system with broad utility spanning both research and clinical diagnostic testing applications. The scalability of MIPP-Seq allows for multiplexing mutations and samples, which dramatically reduce costs of variant validation when compared to methods like ddPCR. By leveraging the power of individual analyses of multiple unique and independent reactions, MIPP-Seq can validate and precisely quantitate extremely low AAFs across multiple tissues and mutational categories including both indels and SNVs. Furthermore, using Illumina sequencing technology, MIPP-seq provides a robust method for accurate detection of novel mutations at an extremely low AAF.","Doan, Ryan N.; Miller, Michael B.; Kim, Sonia N.; Rodin, Rachel E.; Ganz, Javier; Bizzotto, Sara; Morillo, Katherine S.; Huang, August Yue; Digumarthy, Reethika; Zemmel, Zachary; Walsh, Christopher A.",BMC Med Genomics,718,6

They play an important role in the host immune response to respiratory viral infection. However, evidence on the human microbiome and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relationship is insufficient. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate existing evidence on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans and summarize these data in the pandemic era. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for articles in English published up to October 31, 2020. The results were analyzed qualitatively. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195982). RESULTS: Of the 543 articles identified by searching databases, 16 in line with the research objectives were eligible for qualitative review: eight sampled the microbiome using stool, four using nasopharyngeal or throat swab, three using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and one using lung tissue. Fecal microbiome dysbiosis and increased opportunistic pathogens were reported in COVID-19 patients. Several studies suggested the dysbiosis in the lung microbiome of COVID-19 patients with an abundance of opportunistic pathogens using lower respiratory tract samples. The association between COVID-19 severity and the human microbiome remains uncertain. CONCLUSION: The human fecal and respiratory tract microbiome changed in COVID-19 patients with opportunistic pathogen abundance. Further research to elucidate the effect of alternation of the human microbiome in disease pathogenesis is warranted.","Yamamoto, Shinya; Saito, Makoto; Tamura, Azumi; Prawisuda, Diki; Mizutani, Taketoshi; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi",PLoS One,718,24

Five select underlying conditions were more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black control-patients than among control-patients of other races/ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Selected underlying conditions were risk factors for death, and most prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities. Social services; health care resources, including vaccination; and tailored public health messaging are important for COVID-19 prevention. Strengthening these strategies for racial/ethnic minority groups could minimize COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities.","Bushman, Dena; Davidson, Alexander; Pathela, Preeti; Greene, Sharon K.; Weiss, Don; Reddy, Vasudha; Team, New York City Fatal Case-Control Study; Latash, Julia",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,718,16

The progression of morbid conditions—especially of cancer—and the uncontained increase of waiting list for scheduled interventions are the major drawbacks. We propose a possible organization of a COVID-19 free hospital or hub, that include both patients’ and workforce’s preparation before entering the facility. The addition of a planned pathway for the whole workforce (physicians, nurses, cleaning and transporting crews, etc.) represents the basis of the program, and involves COVID-19 testing and subsequent self-isolation before entering the hospital, avoidance of work in non-COVID free areas, a strategic fractioning with a multilayer coverage system of care, periodic re-testing. Based on these suggestions, the realization of a COVID-19 free hospital could be achieved, allowing the continuation of a safe surgical activity in view of a possible restoration of non-urgent activity.","Rocco, Bernardo; Bagni, Alessandra; Bertellini, Elisabtta; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara",Urologia,718,11

In this paper, with help of synthetic control method, regression discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been required.","Tian, T.; Luo, W.; Jiang, Y.; Chen, M.; Wen, C.; Pan, W.; Wang, X.",,718,18

According to the tremendous rate of interhuman transmission via aerosols and respiratory droplets, severe measures have been required to contain contagion spread. Accordingly, medical and surgical maneuvers involving the respiratory mucosa and, among them, transnasal transsphenoidal surgery have been charged of maximum risk of spread and contagion, above all for healthcare professionals. METHOD: Our department, according to the actual COVID-19 protocol national guidelines, has suspended elective procedures and, in the last month, only three patients underwent to endoscopic endonasal procedures, due to urgent conditions (a pituitary apoplexy, a chondrosarcoma causing cavernous sinus syndrome, and a pituitary macroadenoma determining chiasm compression). We describe peculiar surgical technique modifications and the use of an endonasal face mask, i.e., the nose lid, to be applied to the patient during transnasal procedures for skull base pathologies as a further possible COVID-19 mitigation strategy. RESULTS: The nose lid is cheap, promptly available, and can be easily assembled with the use of few tools available in the OR; this mask allows to both operating surgeon and his assistant to perform wider surgical maneuvers throughout the slits, without ripping it, while limiting the nostril airflow. CONCLUSIONS: Transnasal surgery, transgressing respiratory mucosa, can definitely increase the risk of virus transmission: we find that adopting further precautions, above all limiting high-speed drill can help preventing or at least reducing aerosol/droplets. The creation of a non-rigid face mask, i.e., the nose lid, allows the comfortable introduction of instruments through one or both nostrils and, at the same time, minimizes the release of droplets from the patient’s nasal cavity.","Solari, Domenico; Bove, Ilaria; Esposito, Felice; Cappabianca, Paolo; Cavallo, Luigi M.",Acta Neurochir (Wien),718,30

In this study, we determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells within CD45RA(–) memory T cells in the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA(–) memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens encountered by the donors throughout their life. It is of vital importance to resolve other secondary infections that usually develop in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We found SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells in all of the CD45RA(–) subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+)) and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations. The procedure for obtaining these cells is feasible, easy to implement for small-scale manufacture, quick and cost-effective, involves minimal manipulation, and has no GMP requirements.

As the mental health effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, continue to unfold, there are still large knowledge gaps about the variables that predispose individuals to, or protect individuals against the disease. However, there are few publications on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of citizens in Latin American countries. In this study, the effects that COVID-19 had on citizens of Peru have been described. For this, 1699 questionnaires, collected between 2 April and 2 September 2020, were analyzed. Descriptive, bivariate analysis was performed with odds ratio (OR) calculations and a data mining methodology. Sociodemographic variables (from the General Health Questionnaire), health conditions and perception, symptoms, and variables related to contact and preventive measures regarding COVID-19 were analyzed. As compared to other countries, less affectation of mental health and increased use of preventive measures were observed. It has been suggested that the country’s precarious health system and poverty rates prior to the pandemic may justify higher mortality figures in Peru than in other Latin American countries, despite prompt action for its containment and compliance with the protective measures. Psychological distress had a greater incidence in women, young people, people without a partner, and people without university studies. The most significant conditioning variables were self-perceived health status, headache or muscle pain over the past 14 days, level of studies, and age. The extensive use of preventive measures against COVID-19 is in line with the strict legislative measures taken, and this is, in turn, in line with other countries when looking at the lower effect on mental health, but contrary when focusing on the high lethality identified. The need to include the economy or availability and quality of healthcare in future studies arises, as well as the suitability to analyze the cause for differences between countries.","Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos; Palomino-Baldeón, Juan Carlos; Ortega-Moreno, Mónica; Villavicencio-Guardia, María del Carmen; Dias, Adriano; Bernardes, João Marcos; Gómez-Salgado, Juan",Healthcare (Basel),718,24

We estimated odds ratios (ORs) by multivariate logistic regression. Results With adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics, and previous frequency of sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in additional clinical services (a group that included care assistants) (OR 2.31), registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28) and allied health professionals (OR 1.94), and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55). Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented Covid-19 patients, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by staff group was somewhat greater. Conclusions After allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we estimated that relative risks for Covid-19 among most patient-facing occupations were between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services, nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these staff groups should be a priority.

To control TB effectively, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control implemented the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in 2006, modeled on the World Health Organization global TB control program. The goal of the program was to reduce the number of TB cases by half within a decade. This study was designed to describe the epidemiology of TB in Taiwan, and to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the NTP. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of data from the National Tuberculosis Registry System collected between 2002 and 2008. Demographics, geographic distribution of disease, and change in rates of TB incidence and mortality were analyzed. Results From 2002 to 2008, new TB cases declined from 16,758 to 14,265, and incidence decreased from 75 per 100,000 population to 62 per 100,000 population. More than 50% of new cases occurred among elderly adults. Over the study period, TB mortality decreased from 5.7 per 100,000 population to 3.3 per 100,000 population, with over half of TB deaths occurring among patients aged ≥ 65 years. Since the NTP was implemented, from 2005 to 2008, TB incidence and mortality declined by 14% and 23%, respectively. Conclusion TB-associated incidence and mortality decreased over the course of the study. Nevertheless, there continue to be high-incidence areas that show the opposite trend; these areas should strive to improve case management and consultation. In the most populous districts, rigorous surveillance is necessary to track incidence and mortality rate fluctuations.","Lo, Hsiu-Yun; Chou, Pesus; Yang, Shiang-Lin; Lee, Cheng-Yi; Kuo, Hsu-Sung",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,718,28

Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid`s Xpert(®) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%). Unlike single gene targeting strategies, the current method provides the amplification of two viral regions in the same PCR reaction. Therefore, an accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay was provided, which allows testing of 91 samples in 96-well plates in per run.

We have tried to search the epitopic component of the S-protein that might be served as crucial targets for the vaccine development and also tried to understand the molecular mechanism of epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex for adaptive immunity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we identified the antigenicity and the epitopic divergence of S-protein via immunoinformatics approach. The study was performed to identify the epitopes, composition of amino acids and its distribution in epitopic regions, composition of amino acid between the identified epitopes, secondary structure architecture of epitopes, physicochemical and biochemical parameters and molecular interaction between the identified epitope and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The SARS-CoV-2 can be possibly recognised by TLR4 of host immune cells that are responsible for the adaptive immune response. RESULTS: We identified four SARS-CoV-2 S-protein 9mer antigenic epitopes and observed that they bind with the TLR4/MD-2 complex by varied stable molecular bonding interactions. Molecular interaction between these characterized epitopes with TLR4/MD-2 complex might be indicated the binding affinity and downstream signalling of adaptive immune response. Different physicochemical and biochemical parameters such as O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation, Hydrophobicity, GRAVY were identified within epitopic regions of S-protein. These parameters help to understand the protein-protein interaction between epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The study also revealed different epitopic binding pockets of TLR4/MD-2 complex.

GCs maintain energy homeostasis in multiple tissues, including those in the liver and skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT stores energy as triglycerides, while BAT uses fatty acids for heat generation. The multiple genomic and non-genomic pathways in GC signaling vary with exposure duration, location (adipose tissue depot), and species. Genomic effects occur directly through the cytosolic GC receptor (GR), regulating the expression of proteins related to lipid metabolism, such as ATGL and HSL. Non-genomic effects act through mechanisms often independent of the cytosolic GR and happen shortly after GC exposure. Studying the effects of GCs on adipose tissue breakdown and generation (lipolysis and adipogenesis) leads to insights for treatment of adipose-related diseases, such as obesity, coronary disease, and cancer, but has led to controversy among researchers, largely due to the complexity of the process. This paper reviews the recent literature on the genomic and non-genomic effects of GCs on WAT and BAT lipolysis and proposes research to address the many gaps in knowledge related to GC activity and its effects on disease.","Mir, Negar; Chin, Shannon A.; Riddell, Michael C.; Beaudry, Jacqueline L.",Int J Mol Sci,718,1

The epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The presence of COVID-19 was manifested by several symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and death. The viral infection expanded internationally and WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To quickly diagnose and control such a highly infectious disease, suspicious individuals were isolated and diagnostic/treatment procedures were developed through patients’ epidemiological and clinical data. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO invited hundreds of researchers from around the world to develop a rapid quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines, but so far no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine has been approved by the FDA. At present, COVID-19 is managed by available antiviral drugs to improve the symptoms, and in severe cases, supportive care including oxygen and mechanical ventilation is used for infected patients.

In this context, focusing on the proteome of Trypanosoma cruzi, we investigated the link between the probabilities for pathogen peptides to be presented on a cell surface and their distance from human self. We found a reasonable but, as far as we know, undiscovered property: the farther the distance between a peptide and the human-self the higher the probability for that peptide to be presented on a cell surface. We also found that the most distant peptides from human self bind, on average, a broader collection of HLAs than expected, implying a potential immunological role in a large portion of individuals. Finally, introducing a novel quantitative indicator for a peptide to measure its potential immunological role, we proposed a pool of peptides that could be potential epitopes and that can be suitable for experimental testing. The software to compute peptide classes according to the distance from human self is free available at http://www.iasi.cnr.it/~dsantoni/nullomers.","Vergni, Davide; Gaudio, Rosanna; Santoni, Daniele",PLoS One,718,33
