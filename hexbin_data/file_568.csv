M. oleifera is also known as the miracle tree, which for centuries has been indicated for traditional medicine. With no reports of side effects, in doses achievable by ingestion, different parts of M. oleifera is used to treat several conditions, such as malnutrition, diabetes, blindness, anemia, hypertension, stress, depression, skin, arthritis, joints and kidney stones disorders. This plant also showed capacity of helping in maintenance of the cardiovascular system health, blood-glucose levels and providing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity as well as the regulation of urinary tract and lactation in nursing women. The seed and leaves powder has water purification properties through flocculation. It also supplements the food in the human diet and in the fortification of livestock feed, especially in developing countries. So, M. oleifera properties have also been applied to cosmetic and byproducts industries due to the high nutritive and protective properties of its seed oil. According to the holistic or traditional medicine, M. oleifera has very relevant therapeutic properties and applications depending on the constitution, somatic and psychological needs of patients. It is usually referred as a natural product that can treat different physical and psychological health aspects, offering an energetic action and structural rebuilder of the body and promoting emotions of highly positive attitudes towards life. The high and specific immunological potential of M. oleifera leads us to suggest an in-depth study to assess the hypothesis of conferring a supportive effect against Covid-19 disease.","Meireles, Diana; Gomes, João; Lopes, Lara; Hinzmann, Mariana; Machado, Jorge",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),568,7

The current treatment options for people with AD consist of drugs designed to slow the rate of decline in memory and cognition, but these treatments are not curative, and patients eventually suffer complete cognitive injury. With the substantial amounts of published data on targets for this disease, we proposed that machine learning software could be used to find novel small-molecule treatments that can supplement the AD drugs currently on the market. In order to do this, we used publicly available data in ChEMBL to build and validate Bayesian machine learning models for AD target proteins. The first AD target that we have addressed with this method is the serine–threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which is a proline-directed serine–threonine kinase that phosphorylates the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau. This phosphorylation prompts tau to dissociate from the microtubule and form insoluble oligomers called paired helical filaments, which are one of the components of the neurofibrillary tangles found in AD brains. Using our Bayesian machine learning model for GSK3β consisting of 2368 molecules, this model produced a five-fold cross validation ROC of 0.905. This model was also used for virtual screening of large libraries of FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates. Subsequent testing of selected compounds revealed a selective small-molecule inhibitor, ruboxistaurin, with activity against GSK3β (avg IC(50) = 97.3 nM) and GSK3α (IC(50) = 695.9 nM). Several other structurally diverse inhibitors were also identified. We are now applying this machine learning approach to additional AD targets to identify approved drugs or clinical trial candidates that can be repurposed as AD therapeutics. This represents a viable approach to accelerate drug discovery and do so at a fraction of the cost of traditional high throughput screening.","Vignaux, Patricia A.; Minerali, Eni; Foil, Daniel H.; Puhl, Ana C.; Ekins, Sean",ACS Omega,568,24

To obtain this context, a monitoring infrastructure with adequate functionality and quality levels is required. But this monitoring infrastructure needs to react to the context as well, raising the need for context-aware monitoring tools. Provide a generic solution for context-aware monitoring able to effectively react to contextual changes. We have designed CAMA, a service-oriented Context-Aware Monitoring Architecture that can be easily configured, adapted and evolved according to contextual changes. CAMA implements a decoupled architecture and manages a context domain ontology for modelling the inputs, outputs and capabilities of monitoring tools. CAMA has been demonstrated in three real use cases. We have also conducted different evaluations, including an empirical study. The results of the evaluations show that (1) the overhead introduced by the architecture does not degrade the behavior of the system, except in extreme conditions; (2) the use of ontologies is not an impediment for practitioners, even when they have little knowledge about this concept; and (3) the reasoning capabilities of CAMA enable context-aware adaptations. CAMA is a solution useful for both researchers and practitioners. Researchers can use this architecture as a baseline for providing different extensions or implementing new approaches on top of CAMA that require context-aware monitoring. Practitioners may also use CAMA in their projects in order to manage contextual changes in an effective way.","Cabrera, Oscar; Oriol, Marc; Franch, Xavier; Marco, Jordi",Computing,568,5

These variants aim to increase classification power whilst maintaining computational efficiency; achieving the ideal cost-to-accuracy balance. Four factors affecting the computational cost vs accuracy balance were identified: ‘Sampling’ strategy, ‘Optical Flow’ algorithm, ‘Saliency’ of extracted features and overall algorithm ‘Flexibility’. The practical effects of these factors were experimentally evaluated using the Dense Trajectories feature framework and the KTH and HMDB51 (a reduced version) datasets.

However, traditional diagnostic methods for PFPS mostly rely on the subjective experience of doctors and subjective feelings of the patient, which do not have an accurate-unified standard, and the clinical accuracy is not high. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, artificial neural networks are increasingly applied in medical treatment to assist doctors in diagnosis, but selecting a suitable neural network model must be considered. In this paper, an intelligent diagnostic method for PFPS was proposed on the basis of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), which used surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and lower limb joint angles as inputs, and discussed the model from three aspects, namely, accuracy, interpretability, and practicability. This article utilized the running and walking data of 41 subjects at their selected speed, including 26 PFPS patients (16 females and 10 males) and 16 painless controls (8 females and 7 males). In the proposed method, the knee flexion angle, hip flexion angle, ankle dorsiflexion angle, and sEMG signals of the seven muscles around the knee of three different data sets (walking data set, running data set, and walking and running mixed data set) were used as input of the 1D CNN. Focal loss function was introduced to the network to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples in the data set and make the network focus on learning the difficult-to-predict samples. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism was added to the network to observe the dimension feature that the network pays more attention to, thereby increasing the interpretability of the model. Finally, the depth features extracted by 1D CNN were combined with the traditional gender features to improve the accuracy of the model. After verification, the 1D CNN had the best performance on the running data set (accuracy = 92.4%, sensitivity = 97%, specificity = 84%). Compared with other methods, this method could provide new ideas for the development of models that assisted doctors in diagnosing PFPS without using complex biomechanical modeling and with high objective accuracy.","Shi, Wuxiang; Li, Yurong; Xu, Dujian; Lin, Chen; Lan, Junlin; Zhou, Yuanbo; Zhang, Qian; Xiong, Baoping; Du, Min",Front Public Health,568,20

Many are wondering whether these income support programs are there to stay or if the current crisis marks a turning point in the debate about the adequate level of intervention by the State. This article tries to establish if public opinion about this issue is affected by current circumstances. Survey data was collected in Quebec at the height of the pandemic. It shows that, compared to earlier surveys, Quebecers are much more tolerant of the level of general taxation that applies to them. It also shows that opinions about the level of taxation are not influenced by having individually benefited from an income support program such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. This new openness to possibly higher taxes in the future does not seem to depend on exposure to the current crop of emergency support programs. Other surveys will be required to assess whether these changes are permanent or if they will recede after the crisis is over.","Godbout, Luc; Genest-Grégoire, Antoine; Guay, Jean-Herman; Pham, Anthony",,568,33

Circular stapling (CS) immediately results in a GJ of standardized width, whereas linear stapling (LS) requires a technically challenging closure of the stapler defect. The aim was to study differences in outcomes between CS and LS. SETTING Nationwide Swedish cohort. METHODS The Scandinavian Obesity Registry (SOReg) included prospective data from 34,284 primary LRYGB patients operated on in 2007-2013. We studied operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and percent excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL) after 1 year. Outcomes were assessed through multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, age, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. RESULTS Preoperatively the groups were similar (40.9 yr, BMI 42.4 kg/m(2), 76% female). For CS and LS, operative time and hospital stay were 114 and 73 minutes (P<.001) and 4.6 and 2.0 days (P<.001), respectively. Using LS as a reference, adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CS patients to have anastomotic leakage was 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-5.0), postoperative hemorrhage 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-2.9), wound complication 9.7 (95% CI 6.8-13.9), and marginal ulcer 3.1 (95% CI 1.8-5.3). The %EBMIL at 1 year was 80% for both techniques and 31% of total weight was lost. Follow-up rate at 6 weeks and 1 year was 96% and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSION CS was found to be associated with disadvantages regarding operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications compared with LS.","Edholm, David; Sundbom, Magnus",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,568,19

METHODS A cross-sectional survey targeting OTO-HNS program directors (PD) was created and disseminated via email to PDs on May 28th 2020. Descriptive analyses of the 19-question survey was performed, and free text responses for certain suitable questions were thematically categorized into groups determined to be relevant during analysis. RESULTS Twenty-nine of 123 solicited PDs (23.6%) completed the survey. Nineteen (65.5%) respondents indicated they would not host away rotations (AR) in 2020, and 9 (31.0%) reported that they would consider away rotators without home programs. Regarding the historical importance of AR, 21 (72.4%) PDs stated they were either ""extremely"" or ""very"" important in evaluating candidates. Sixteen (55.2%) PDs stated that virtual interviews would impact their ability to properly gauge candidates and 12 (41.4%) were unsure. Eight PDs (27.6%) stated their evaluation of candidates will likely change, with a shift toward an increased reliance on letters of recommendation, research involvement, and clerkship grades. The large majority of PDs-25 (86.2%)-were not worried that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the abilities of new interns beginning in 2021. CONCLUSION Virtual interviews and engagement activities will mostly supplant sub-Is and AR for the 2020-2021 OTO-HNS application cycle. Surveyed PDs largely believe these will be insufficient in providing a comprehensive assessment of candidates, and will similarly limit applicants' ability to gauge residency programs.

This study examined the long term effects of the opioid growth factor (OGF, [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and a low dose of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (LDN) on expression of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE. C57BL/6 mice began receiving daily injections of 10mg/kg OGF (MOG+OGF), 0.1mg/kg naltrexone (MOG+LDN), or saline (MOG+Vehicle) at the time of EAE induction and continuing for 60days. In contrast to 100% of the MOG+Vehicle group with behavioral symptoms of EAE, 63% and 68% of the MOG+OGF and MOG+LDN mice expressed disease. Both severity and disease indices of EAE in OGF- and LDN-treated mice were notably decreased from MOG+Vehicle cohorts. By day 60, 6- and 3-fold more animals in the MOG+OGF and MOG+LDN groups, respectively, had a remission compared to MOG+Vehicle mice. Neuropathological studies revealed i) astrocyte activation and neuronal damage as early as day 10 (prior to behavioral symptoms) in all MOG-injected groups, ii) a significant reduction of activated astrocytes in MOG+OGF and MOG+LDN groups compared to MOG+Vehicle mice at day 30, and iii) no demyelination on day 60 in mice treated with OGF or LDN and not displaying disease symptoms. These results indicate that treatment with OGF or LDN had no deleterious long-term repercussions and did not exacerbate EAE, but i) halted progression of disease, ii) reversed neurological deficits, and iii) prevented the onset of neurological dysfunction across a considerable span of time.","Rahn, Kristen A; McLaughlin, Patricia J; Zagon, Ian S",Brain research,568,17

In the other case, the same antigen was conjugated to the anchor region of mucus binding protein (Mub) and was covalently associated with the cell wall by an LPXTG motif. These two recombinant L. acidophilus cell surface displays resulted in dissimilar maturation and cytokine production by human myeloid dendritic cells. The surface-associated antigen was highly sensitive to simulated gastric and small intestinal juices. By supplementation with bicarbonate buffer and soybean trypsin inhibitor, the cell surface antigen was protected from proteolytic enzymes during gastric challenge in vitro. The protective reagents also increased the viability of the L. acidophilus cells upon challenge with simulated digestive juices.

Here we examine the role of autophagy in the life cycle of JEV, a neurotropic flavivirus. JEV infection leads to induction of autophagy in several cell types. JEV replication was significantly enhanced in neuronal cells where autophagy was rendered dysfunctional by ATG7 depletion, and in Atg5-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), resulting in higher viral titers. Autophagy was functional during early stages of infection however it becomes dysfunctional as infection progressed resulting in accumulation of misfolded proteins. Autophagy-deficient cells were highly susceptible to virus-induced cell death. We also observed JEV replication complexes that are marked by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and dsRNA colocalized with endogenous LC3 but not with GFP-LC3. Colocalization of NS1 and LC3 was also observed in Atg5 deficient MEFs, which contain only the nonlipidated form of LC3. Viral replication complexes furthermore show association with a marker of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancer, mannosidase α-like 1). Our data suggest that virus replication occurs on ERAD-derived EDEM1 and LC3-I-positive structures referred to as EDEMosomes. While silencing of ERAD regulators EDEM1 and SEL1L suppressed JEV replication, LC3 depletion exerted a profound inhibition with significantly reduced RNA levels and virus titers. Our study suggests that while autophagy is primarily antiviral for JEV and might have implications for disease progression and pathogenesis of JEV, nonlipidated LC3 plays an important autophagy independent function in the virus life cycle.","Sharma, Manish; Bhattacharyya, Sankar; Nain, Minu; Kaur, Manpreet; Sood, Vikas; Gupta, Vishal; Khasa, Renu; Abdin, Malik Z; Vrati, Sudhanshu; Kalia, Manjula",Autophagy,568,16

Complementation of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with BVDV glycoproteins resulted in infectious pseudotyped viruses. To elucidate the specific role of each of the single envelope glycoproteins during viral entry, pseudotypes were generated bearing the BVDV envelope proteins in different combinations. Pseudoviruses that contained E1 and E2 but not Erns were infectious, indicating that Erns is dispensable for virus entry. VSV/BVDV pseudotypes with chimeric proteins (the ectodomain of the BVDV glycoprotein and the transmembrane domain of the VSV-G protein) were not infectious. The fact that E1-E2 heterodimers were not detected if one of the proteins was chimeric indicated that the heterodimers are crucial for BVDV entry. It was shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the charged amino acids in the transmembrane domains of BVDV E1 (lysine and arginine) and the charged amino acid in the transmembrane domain of E2 (arginine) play a key role in heterodimer formation. Pseudoviruses bearing the mutation E2-R/A, where the charged amino acid was substituted by alanine, were not infectious, supporting the hypothesis that E1-E2 heterodimers are essential for BVDV entry.","Ronecker, Saskia; Zimmer, Gert; Herrler, Georg; Greiser-Wilke, Irene; Grummer, Beatrice",The Journal of general virology,568,16

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all ages, particularly for newborns and children under the age of 5 (goal 3b), it is essential to generate and use quality data for evidence-based decision making to overcome barriers inherent in immunization systems. In Pakistan, only 66 % of children receive all basic vaccinations, and in Sindh province, the number is even lower at 49 %. In 2012, IRD developed and piloted Zindagi Mehfooz (Safe Life; ZM) ElR, an Android-based platform that records and analyses individual-level child data in real-time. In 2017 in collaboration with Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) Sindh, ZM was scaled-up across the entire Sindh province and is currently being used by 2521 government vaccinators in 1539 basic health facilities, serving >48 million population. OBJECTIVE The study aims to demonstrate how big immunization data from the ZM-EIR is being leveraged in Sindh, Pakistan for actionable decision making via three use cases (a) improving performance management of vaccinators to increase geographical coverage, (b) quantifying the impact of provincial accelerated outreach activities, and (c) examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization coverage to help devise a tailored approach for future efforts. METHODS From October 2017 to April 2020, more than 2.9 million children and 0.9 million women have been enrolled, and more than 22 million immunization events have been recorded in the ZM-EIR. We extracted de-identified data from ZM-EIR for January 1, 2019 - April 20, 2020, period. Given the needs of each use case, monthly and daily indicators on vaccinator performance (attendance and compliance), daily immunization visits, and the number of antigens administered were calculated. Geo-coordinate data of antigen administration was extracted and displayed on geographic maps using QGIS. All generated reports were shared at fixed frequency with various stakeholders, such as partners at EPI-Sindh, for utilization in decision making and informing policy. RESULT Our use-cases demonstrate the use of EIR data for data-driven decision making. From January - December 2019, the monthly monitoring of program indicators helped increase the vaccinator attendance from 44% to 88%, while an 85 % increase in geographical coverage was observed in a polio-endemic super high-risk union council (SHRUC) in Karachi. The analysis of daily average antigens administered during accelerated outreach efforts (AOE) as compared to routine activities showed an increase in average daily Pentavalent-3, Measles-1, and Measles-2 vaccines administered by 103%, 154%, and 180% respectively. These findings helped decide to continue the accelerated effort in high-risk areas (compared to the entire province) rather than discontinuing the activity due to high costs. During COVID-19 lockdown, the daily average number of child immunizations reduced from 16,649 to 4335 per day, a decline of 74% compared to 6 months preceding COVID-19 lockdown. ZM-EIR data is currently helping to shape the planning and implementation of critical strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The big data for vaccines generated through EIRs is a powerful tool to monitor immunization work-force and ensure chronically missed communities are identified and covered through targeted strategies. Geospatial data availability and analysis is changing the way EPI review meetings occur with stakeholders, taking data-driven decisions for better planning and resource allocation. In the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, as governments gradually begin to shift from containing the outbreak to strategizing a plan for sustaining the essential health services, the countries that will emerge most successful are likely the ones who can best use technology and real-time data for targeted efforts.","Siddiqi, Danya Arif; Abdullah, Sara; Dharma, Vijay Kumar; Shah, Mubarak Taighoon; Akhter, Mohammed Adil; Habib, Ali; Khan, Aamir Javed; Chandir, Subhash",International journal of medical informatics,568,0

Additionally, there has been no research examining the impact of consultation length on satisfaction. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the use of a single-question graphic scale to assess vet and client satisfaction and the impact of consultation length on satisfaction. METHODS Information on consultation timing was collected for 65 health problem consultations across six practices. These measurements were compared with postconsultation measurements of client and vet satisfaction. RESULTS A comparison between the long-form and single-question satisfaction instruments demonstrated significant correlation for both vet and client tools (ρ=0.609, P<0.005 and ρ=0.483, P<0.005, respectively). The average client satisfaction with the consultation was high; however, vet satisfaction levels were significantly lower (U=1073, P<0.005).

Among the potential determinants of screening uptake, only a few studies analysed the role of general practitioners (GPs). The aim was to evaluate the variation in screening uptake of the clusters of subjects assisted by single GPs. SETTING Ancona province, Central Italy. METHODS Cross-sectional study, including all residents aged 50-69 years, who were offered the public screening programme with biannual faecal immunochemical tests. Demographic (of all GPs) and screening data (of all eligible residents) for years 2018-2019 were collected from the official electronic datasets of the Ancona Local Health Unit. The potential predictors of acceptable screening uptake, including GP's gender, age, and number of registered subjects, were evaluated using random-effect logistic regression, with geographical area as the cluster unit. RESULTS The final sample consisted of 332 GP clusters, including 120,178 eligible subjects. The overall province uptake was 38.0% ± 10.7%. The uptake was lower than 30% in one-fifth of the GP clusters, and higher than 45% in another fifth. At multivariable analysis, the significant predictors of uptake were younger GP age (p = 0.010) and lower number of registered subjects (p < 0.001). None of the GP clusters with 500 subjects or more showed an uptake ≥45%. CONCLUSIONS The wide variation across GPs suggests they might substantially influence screening uptake, highlighting a potential need to increase their commitment to CRC screening.

Herein we report a Japanese patient with iMCD with a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene. METHODS We performed genetic analysis via targeted next-generation sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hydrophobic interactions around the 729th amino acid in human pyrin. RESULTS In February 2011, a 59-year-old man was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease at our department based on the findings of cervical and hilar lymphadenopathies, typical lung lesions and cervical lymph node biopsy. The patient was followed up without treatment, as he was asymptomatic. However, he had been experiencing prolonged fatigue and fever with high levels of CRP since June 2017. Axillary lymph node biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of iMCD. He was successfully treated with an IL-6 inhibitor and has been in remission for 12 months. Genetic analyses for hereditary autoinflammatory disease-related genes were performed, revealing a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the MEFV gene. We identified that this novel mutation significantly altered the local interaction of the human pyrin B30.2 domain by molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimentally had the potential for inflammasome activation with increased inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION The abnormal function of pyrin due to a mutation in the MEFV gene in this patient may have contributed to the development of MCD by inducing IL-6 production via inflammasome signalling.","Endo, Yushiro; Koga, Tomohiro; Otaki, Hiroki; Sasaki, Daisuke; Sumiyoshi, Remi; Furukawa, Kaori; Tanaka, Yoshimasa; Katsunori, Yanagihara; Kawakami, Atsushi",Rheumatology,568,4

Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy provides real-time regional oxygen saturation (CrSO2) that may be a marker of adverse MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcomes. AIM The aim of this study was to examine the value of CrSO2 monitoring in infants with HIE undergoing TH. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS In this prospective study, CrSO2 was continuously recorded in 21 infants with HIE admitted for TH. OUTCOME MEASURES Brain MRI signal abnormalities at 2weeks were scored in individual brain region and classified as none/mild, moderate and severe. 13 infants completed Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) testing at 18-24months. RESULTS Between 24 and 36h of life, there was a significant increase in odds of having moderate-severe brain MRI abnormalities with higher absolute CrSO2 values. Per 10% increase in absolute CrSO2, the odds ratio for moderate-severe brain MRI abnormalities was greatest at 30h (OR 3.78; confidence intervals (CI): 1.23-11.6, p=0.011). CrSO2 increased more rapidly in infants with greater injury seen on MRI (0.20/h for MRI scores 0/1, by 0.48/h for MRI score 2, and by 0.68/h for MRI score 3, p=0.05). At 30h, absolute CrSO2 correlated significantly with abnormal MRI findings in basal ganglia (92% vs. 78%, p=0.001), white matter (88% vs. 76%, p=0.01), posterior limb of internal capsule (92% vs. 78%, p=0.001), and brain stem (94% vs. 80%, p=0.03) but not with cortical injury (86% vs. 80%, p=0.17). Higher CrSO2 beyond 24h correlated with greater odds of worse BSID scores. CONCLUSIONS Increasing CrSO2 is associated with moderate-severe brain injury as assessed by MRI. Higher absolute CrSO2 values during TH correlates with subcortical injury on MRI and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants with HIE undergoing TH. CrSO2 can inform providers seeking early identification of patients at risk of worse injury who may benefit from further intervention.","Jain, Siddharth V; Pagano, Lindsay; Gillam-Krakauer, Maria; Slaughter, James C; Pruthi, Sumit; Engelhardt, Barbara",Early human development,568,5

Plain gauze wetted with normal saline is commonly used for a pin site dressing owing to the simplicity and low cost. Evidence to support adding an antimicrobial agent in the dressing material is lacking. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We compared the rate of pin tract infection using plain gauze and gauze impregnated with polyhexamethylene biguanide in patients undergoing limb lengthening procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included 38 patients (40 limbs) undergoing limb lengthening or deformity correction using an external fixator between July 2009 and June 2010. There were 23 male patients and 15 female patients, with a mean age of 26.3 years (range, 5-68 years). The patients were randomized into two groups: a polyhexamethylene biguanide group (22 limbs) and a control group (18 limbs). The metal-skin interfaces were assessed by a researcher blinded to the type of gauze at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery for the pin site infection based on a predetermined grading system. There were a total of 483 metal-skin interfaces, with 1932 total observations. Infection rates were compared using the chi square test and relative risk with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS The infection rate was lower (χ(2) [1, n = 1932] = 23.00) and the risk for infection was lower (relative risk, 0.228; 95% confidence interval, 0.118, 0.443) for the polyhexamethylene biguanide group (n = 1068; 1.0%) than for the control group (n = 864; 4.5%). CONCLUSIONS Use of polyhexamethylene biguanide-impregnated gauze can reduce the risk of pin tract infection in external fixation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level I, therapeutic study.

We sought to demonstrate that maca root may be an effective treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD) in women. Method. We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maca root (3.0 g/day) in 45 female outpatients (mean age of 41.5 ± 12.5 years) with SSRI/SNRI-induced sexual dysfunction whose depression remitted. Endpoints were improvement in sexual functioning as per the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Function Questionnaire (MGH-SFQ). Results. 45 of 57 consented females were randomized, and 42 (30 premenopausal and 12 postmenopausal women) were eligible for a modified intent-to-treat analysis based on having had at least one postmedication visit. Remission rates by the end of treatment were higher for the maca than the placebo group, based on attainment of an ASEX total score ≤ 10 (9.5% for maca versus 4.8% for placebo), attaining an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 12 (30.0% for maca versus 20.0% for placebo) and reaching an MGH-SFQ score ≤ 8 (9.5% for maca versus 5.0% for placebo). Higher remission rates for the maca versus placebo group were associated with postmenopausal status. Maca was well tolerated. Conclusion. Maca root may alleviate SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women.

From February 2007 to September 2017, we performed 264 CT-guided ablation sessions on 264 lesions in 174 patients (112 M and 62 F; mean age, 68 years; range 36-83 years) affected by primary and metastatic lung lesions. The 45% of patients was affected by primary lung cancer, with size range lesion of 10-50 mm, and the 55% by metastatic lung lesions with size range of 5-49 mm. All patients had no more than three metastases in the lung and pulmonary relapses were treated up to three times. Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Local Progression-Free Survival (LPFS) and Cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 1, 3 and 5 years were calculated both in primary lung tumors and in metastatic patients. Immediate and late RFA-related complications were reported. Pulmonary function tests were evaluated after the procedures. The effectiveness of RFA treatment was evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT. In patients affected by primary lung lesions, the OS rates were 66.73% at 1 year, 23.13% at 3 years and 16.19% at 5 years. In patients affected by metastatic lung lesions, the OS rates were 85.11%, 48.86% and 43.33%, respectively, at 1, 3 and 5 years. PFS at 1, 3 and 5 years were 79.8%, 60.42%, 15.4% in primary lung tumors and 78.59%, 51.8% and 6.07% in metastatic patients. LPFS at 1, 3 and 5 years were 79.8%, 64.69%, 18.87% in primary lung tumors and 86.29%, 69.15% and 44.45% in metastatic patients. CSS at 1, 3 and 5 years was 95.56%, 71.84%, 56.72% in primary lung tumors and 94.07%, 71% and 71% in metastatic patients. Immediate RFA-related complications (pneumothorax, pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema) were observed, respectively, in 42, 53 and 13 of 264 procedures (15.9%, 20% and 5%). There also occurred one major complication (lung abscess, 0.36%). No significant worsening of pulmonary function was noted. Our retrospective evaluation showed long-term effectiveness, safety and imaging features of CT-guided RFA in patients affected by primary and metastatic lung cancer as an alternative therapy in non-surgical candidates.","Picchi, Stefano Giusto; Lassandro, Giulia; Bianco, Andrea; Coppola, Andrea; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Rossi, Umberto G; Lassandro, Francesco",Medical oncology,568,26

A retrospective study from a northern Italian hospital.,16.542217,0.9373601,2020-11-02,"OBJECTIVES Punta Arenas is a Chilean city situated on ancestral Aönikenk territory. The city was founded by 19th- and 20th-century colonists from Chile (Chiloé) and Europe (Croatia). This work uses uniparental and ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to explore the effects of historic migratory and admixture patterns on the current genetic composition of Punta Arenas. METHODS We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 141 AIMs obtained from 129 DNA samples from male residents with regional ancestry. After characterizing uniparental lineages and ancestry proportions, multivariate analysis was used to explore relationships among the various types of data. RESULTS Punta Arenas has an admixed population with three main genetic components: European (56.5%), northern Native (11.3%), and south-central Native (28.6%). The Native component is preponderant in the mtDNA (83.76%), while the foreign component predominates in the Y-chromosome (92.25%). Non-Native mtDNA lineages are associated with European genetic ancestry, and Native mtDNA lineages originated mainly in the southern and southernmost regions of Chile. Most non-Native Y-chromosome SNPs originated in Spain, and secondly, in Croatia. CONCLUSIONS The population of Punta Arenas is mainly of Chilote origin with south-central Native and Spanish ancestral components, as well as some Croatian components. The persistence of local Native lineages is notable, suggesting continuity with the ancestral populations of the region such as the Kawésqar, Aönikenk, Yámana, or Selknam peoples. This study contributes to our knowledge of local history and its links to national and global developments in genetic ancestry.","Flores-Alvarado, Sandra; Orellana-Soto, Michael; Moraga, Mauricio",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,568,1

One such intervention is computerised cognitive training (CCT), which has shown efficacious for cognition across older adult populations. This systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy of CCT across cognitive, psychosocial and functional domains for people with PD and examine study and intervention design factors that could moderate CCT effects on cognition. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of CCT in patients with PD without dementia, on cognitive, psychosocial or functional outcomes, will be included. The primary outcome is overall cognitive function. Secondary outcomes are domain-specific cognitive function, psychosocial functioning and functional abilities. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO through 14 May 2020 to identify relevant literature. Risk of bias will be assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes will be calculated as standardised mean difference of baseline to postintervention change (Hedges' g) with 95% CI for each eligible outcome measure. Pooling of outcomes across studies will be conducted using random-effects models, accounting for dependency structure of effect sizes within studies. Heterogeneity will be assessed using τ2 and I2 statistic. Potential moderators, based on key study and intervention design factors, will be investigated using mixed-effects meta-regression models.

Hence, improving QOL, seizure severity (SS) and fatigue are important areas of therapeutic interventions for people living with epilepsy (PLWE). Therefore, there is need to ascertain the levels and interrelationships among these constructs in PLWE. OBJECTIVE This study compared fatigue and QOL of PLWE with those of apparently healthy individuals (AHIs) and also determined the interrelationships between fatigue, QOL and SS in PLWE. METHOD This cross-sectional survey involved 91 PLWE and 101 AHIs consecutively recruited from purposively selected hospitals and hosting communities. The Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the Seizure Severity Questionnaire were used to evaluate QOL, fatigue severity (FS), fatigue impact (FI) and SS respectively. Data was analyzed using frequency count, proportions, mean and standard deviation, range, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman-rank order correlation. Alpha level was set at 0.05. RESULTS PLWE had significantly lower QOL compared to AHIs (U = 3057.00;p < 0.01). The two groups however experienced similar fatigue severity, but PWE suffered greater fatigue impact (U = 2798.00;p < 0.01). Significant relationships existed among FI, FS, SS and QOL in PLWE (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Compared with AHIs, PLWE had poorer QOL, similar FS, and higher FI. QOL of PLWE was negatively associated with SS, FI and FS. Clinical interventions geared towards minimizing seizure, severity and impact of fatigue may improve the QOL of PLWE.","Akosile, Christopher Olusanjo; Anomneze, John Uche; Okoye, Emmanuel Chiebuka; Adegoke, Babatunde Olusola Adeleke; Uwakwe, Richard; Okeke, Emeka",Seizure,568,33

METHODS National surveillance data on adults (aged ≥ 15 years) with diagnosed HIV resident in England were linked to national COVID-19 mortality surveillance data (2 March 2020-16 June 2020); HIV clinicians verified linked cases and provided information on the circumstances of death. We present COVID-19 mortality rates by HIV status, using negative binomial regression to assess the association between HIV and mortality, adjusting for gender, age and ethnicity. RESULTS Overall, 99 people with HIV, including 61 of black ethnicity, died of/with COVID-19 (107/100 000) compared with 49 483 people without HIV (109/100 000). Compared to people without HIV, higher COVID-19 mortality rates were observed in people with HIV of black (188 vs. 122/100 000) and Asian (131 vs. 77.0/100 000) ethnicity, and in both younger (15-59 years: 58.3 vs. 10.2/100 000) and older (≥ 60 years: 434 vs. 355/100 000) people. After adjustment for demographic factors, people with HIV had a higher COVID-19 mortality risk than those without (2.18; 95% CI: 1.76-2.70). Most people with HIV who died of/with COVID-19 had suppressed HIV viraemia (91%) and at least one comorbidity reported to be associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (87%). CONCLUSIONS In the first wave of the pandemic in England, COVID-19 mortality among people with HIV was low, but was higher than in those without HIV, after controlling for demographic factors. This supports the strategy of prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination for people with HIV and strongly encouraging its uptake, especially in those of black and Asian ethnicity.","Brown, Alison E; Croxford, Sara E; Nash, Sophie; Khawam, Jameel; Kirwan, Peter; Kall, Meaghan; Bradshaw, Daniel; Sabin, Caroline; Miller, Robert F; Post, Frank A; Harding, Richard; Collins, Simon; Waters, Laura; Asboe, David; Chadwick, David R; Delpech, Valerie; Sullivan, Ann K",HIV medicine,568,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data of 125 patients who underwent open or laparoscopic partial nephrectomy due to renal mass between January 2006 and January 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic data, habits, additional diseases, clinical and laboratory findings, operational data, the morphology of the tumor in computerized tomography or magnetic-resonance imaging and follow-up data were scanned and acquired via our hospital's system and archive. RESULTS Average age was 54.4, male-female ratio was 1.55 and average tumor size was 3.31 cm. One hundred and four patients had malignant pathology and 21 were benign. Positive surgical margin rate was 5.6% and recurrence rate was 3.2%. Average follow-up was 47.4 months. Pathological size of the tumor was larger (p=0.006), warm-ischemia period was lower (p=0.003), and PADUA score was higher (p=0.015) in open technique. Tumor size and tumor stage were statistically higher in patients with recurrence (p=0.009, p<0.001 respectively).

No statistically significant difference was observed between surgical margin positivity and tumor size, Fuhrman grades, PADUA scores, R.E.N.A.L. scores, and C-index. (p>0.05) CONCLUSION: Surgical margin positivity after partial nephrectomy is not significantly associated with tumor characteristics and anatomical scoring systems. Surgical indication for partial nephrectomy has a direct influence on PSM rates.

These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises. OBJECTIVE Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media. METHODOLOGY We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis. RESULTS Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases.

This induction is completely dependent on virus replication, since infection with UV light-inactivated virus could no longer induce IFN-alpha/beta. We show that MHV infection activated both transcription factors, the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), as evidenced by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and an increased promoter binding activity for IRF-3 and NF-kappaB. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) was induced by MHV infection. Knockdown of RIG-I by small interfering RNAs blocked the activation of IRF-3 and subsequent IFN-alpha/beta production induced by MHV infection. Knockdown of another cytoplasmic receptor, the melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), by small interfering RNAs also blocked IFN-beta induction. These results demonstrate that MHV is recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 and induces IFN-alpha/beta through the activation of the IRF-3 signaling pathway. However, knockdown of RIG-I only partially blocked NF-kappaB activity induced by MHV infection and inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by a decoy peptide inhibitor had little effect on IFN-alpha/beta production. These data suggest that activation of the NF-kappaB pathway might not play a critical role in IFN-alpha/beta induction by MHV infection in oligodendrocytes.","Li, Jianfeng; Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,568,24

Key occupations predicted to be in shortage included not only pilots, but also flight instructors. Undoubtedly, Covid-19 is currently having a huge impact on the industry. Nevertheless, the current environment further strengthens the need for pilots to maintain their training. Consequently, there is pressure to deliver high-quality training outcomes for an increasing number of pilots and trainees with limited resources available. Current simulator-based training schemes are limited by placing a significant reliance on the personal experience of flight instructors to assess pilot performance. Finding ways to increase the quality and efficiency of simulator-based training is therefore of high importance. With recent advances in artificial intelligence, it is possible to use machine learning techniques to extract latent patterns from massive datasets, to analyze pilot trainees’ activities, and to provide feedback on their performance by processing hundreds of different parameters available on flight simulators. An ML-aided pilot training and education framework is needed that exploits the power of the ML techniques for more objective performance evaluation. In this paper, we describe a conceptual framework for such a system and outline steps toward the development of a full digital instructor system with the potential to overcome current limitations and enabling comprehensive and meaningful feedback that is tailored to the individual need of the trainee. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Yang, S.; Yu, K.; Lammers, T.; Chen, F.","23rd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2021",568,1

We investigate the probability of recovering the true topology of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) under the coalescent with recombination and gene conversion. We explore how sample size and mutation rate affect the inherent uncertainty in reconstructed ARGs; this sheds light on the theoretical limitations of ARG reconstruction methods. We illustrate our results using estimates of evolutionary rates for several biological organisms; in particular, we find that for parameter values that are realistic for SARS-CoV-2, the probability of reconstructing genealogies that are close to the truth is low.","Hayman, Elizabeth; Ignatieva, Anastasia; Hein, Jotun",bioRxiv,568,13

Predicting the hydrogen bonding network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of base pairs while simultaneously maximizing the average length of the stems. An Adiabatic Quantum Computer (AQC) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the AQC being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) hampered hearing, speaking and phone use. Staff were unable to hold face-to-face family meetings and families were unable to be at the bedside which would, in normal times, enable them to be part of the patient’s hospital journey. Inevitably, this all led to an increased volume of phone calls.To try to solve some of these issues, it was decided that a dedicated team was needed to establish open lines of communication between patient, family and staff. A group of senior nurses from across the hospital were brought together to form the Critical Care Family Liaison Team (FLT).FLT now give coordinated information and are the first point of contact for families. Interventions include using technology such as FaceTime and Zoom to allow ‘virtual visiting’, conference calling for family updates, bedside photographs, voice recordings sent in by families and music playlists.The role for the FLT has evolved;the team was set up rapidly at the start of lockdown and members were in their new roles within a week.

Biodistribution was examined in BALB/c nude mice with a subcutaneous AR42J tumor. In vivo PET imaging was performed using a preclinical PET-computed tomographic scanner. DOTA-MG0 showed high receptor affinity in vitro. Biodistribution studies revealed high tumor uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-MG0: 4.4 ± 1.3 %ID/g at 1 hour postinjection. Coadministration of an excess unlabeled peptide blocked the tumor uptake (0.7 ± 0.1 %ID/g), indicating CCK2/gastrin receptor-mediated uptake (p = .0005). The biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-MG0 was similar to that of 111In-DOTA-MG0. Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal tumors were clearly visualized by small-animal PET imaging with 5 MBq 68Ga-DOTA-MG0. 111In- and 68Ga-labeled DOTA-MG0 specifically accumulate in CCK2/gastrin receptor-positive AR42J tumors with similar biodistribution apart from the kidneys. AR42J tumors were clearly visualized by microPET. Therefore, 68Ga-DOTA-MG0 is a promising tracer for PET imaging of CCK2/gastrin receptor-positive tumors in humans.","Brom, Maarten; Joosten, Lieke; Laverman, Peter; Oyen, Wim J G; Béhé, Martin; Gotthardt, Martin; Boerman, Otto C",Molecular imaging,568,1

Recently, based on a genotype 2a isolate, tissue culture systems supporting complete replication and infectious virus production have been developed. In this study, we used cell culture-produced infectious HCV to analyze the viral entry pathway into Huh-7.5 cells. Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, inhibitors of vacuolar ATPases, prevented HCV entry when they were present prior to infection and had minimal effect on downstream replication events. HCV entry therefore appears to be pH dependent, requiring an acidified intracellular compartment. For many other enveloped viruses, acidic pH triggers an irreversible conformational change, which promotes virion-endosomal membrane fusion. Such viruses are often inactivated by low pH. In the case of HCV, exposure of virions to acidic pH followed by return to neutral pH did not affect their infectivity. This parallels the observation made for the related pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus. Low pH could activate the entry of cell surface-bound HCV but only after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. This suggests that there are rate-limiting, postbinding events that are needed to render HCV competent for low-pH-triggered entry. Such events may involve interaction with a cellular coreceptor or other factors but do not require cathepsins B and L, late endosomal proteases that activate Ebola virus and reovirus for entry.","Tscherne, Donna M; Jones, Christopher T; Evans, Matthew J; Lindenbach, Brett D; McKeating, Jane A; Rice, Charles M",Journal of virology,568,27

In this report, two specific epitopes recognized by these CNS-derived cells were identified, using a panel of peptides chosen because they conformed to the allele-specific binding motif for MHC class I H-2Kb and H-2Db. The active peptides encompassed residues 510 to 518 (CSLWNGPHL, H-2Db) and 598 to 605 (RCQIFANI, H-2Kb). Both epitopes are located within the region of the S protein previously shown to be prone to deletion after passage in animals. These deleted strains are generally less neurovirulent than the wild-type virus but still are able to cause demyelination. Since C57BL/6 mice become persistently infected more commonly than many other strains of mice, these data are consistent with a role for CD8+ T-cell escape mutants in the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease. This is the first report of CD8+ T-cell epitope localization within the S protein, the protein most strongly implicated thus far in pathogenesis in the host.","Castro, R F; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,568,1

Predictors of influenza virus infection during the influenza season have previously been evaluated in adult studies of the antiviral agent zanamivir; cough and temperature > or =37.8 degrees C predicted influenza virus positivity in 79% of those evaluated. METHODS Fever and other respiratory symptoms were examined to determine their value in predicting influenza virus-positive status in children. Data analyzed were from a clinical trial of zanamivir in children 5-12 years of age and from a trial of oseltamivir in children 1-12 years of age. RESULTS In the pediatric study of zanamivir, as in the adult zanamivir study, cough and fever were the best predictors of influenza virus infection; a temperature > or =38.2 degrees C plus cough predicted 83% (95% CI, 79%-88%) of illnesses that were determined to be influenza virus positive. Cough (positive predictive value, 70%; 95% CI, 64%-75%), but not fever, was the best predictor of influenza virus-positive status in children aged 5-12 years in the oseltamivir trials, but neither cough nor fever were successful predictors in young children 1-4 years of age. The latter findings appeared to be the result of less symptomatic diversity among patients recruited for this trial, such that subjects who were determined to be influenza virus positive and subjects who were influenza virus negative had similar symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The results of these studies suggest that, during the influenza season, symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection are applicable to identification of cases in children, although confirmation of predictive values in subjects 1-4 years of age may require further study of additional signs/symptoms.","Ohmit, Suzanne E; Monto, Arnold S",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,568,0

When expressed in mammalian cells, this novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. UBC6 lacks a lumenal domain and contains no known endoplasmic reticulum retention signals. Analysis of chimeric proteins in which the cytosolic domain of UBC is linked to a heterologous transmembrane domain, or in which the UBC6 transmembrane domain is appended to an unrelated soluble protein, led to the determination that the transmembrane domain of UBC6 plays a dominant role in its compartmental localization. The basis for the transmembrane domain-mediated subcellular targeting of UBC6 was evaluated by lengthening the wild type UBC6 hydrophobic segment from 17 to 21 amino acids, which resulted in re-targeting to the Golgi complex. A further increase in length to 26 amino acids allowed this modified protein to traverse the secretory pathway and gain expression at the plasma membrane. These findings are consistent with models in which, in the absence of dominant cytosolic or lumenal targeting determinants, proteins may be sorted within the secretory pathway based on interactions between their transmembrane domains and the surrounding lipid bilayer.","Yang, M; Ellenberg, J; Bonifacino, J S; Weissman, A M",The Journal of biological chemistry,568,1

We investigated the causative agent. METHODS Cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocyte co-cultures were used to isolate the causative agent from clinical samples. Identity of the agent was established by electron microscopy and serological and molecular assays. FINDINGS Clinical samples tested negative for IgM antibodies to Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, dengue, and measles viruses, and for RNA of coronavirus, paramyxovirus, enterovirus, and influenza viruses. Virus was isolated from six patients with encephalitis and was identified as Chandipura virus by electron microscopy, complement fixation, and neutralisation tests. Chandipura virus RNA was detected in clinical samples from nine patients. Sequencing of five of these RNA samples showed 96.7-97.5% identity with the reference strain of 1965. Chandipura viral antigen and RNA were detected in brain tissue of a deceased child by immunofluorescent antibody test and PCR. Neutralising, IgG, and IgM antibodies to Chandipura virus were present in some patients' serum samples. Serum samples obtained after 4 days of illness were more frequently positive for IgM to Chandipura virus than were those obtained earlier (p<0.001). A similar trend was noted for neutralising antibodies. INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that this outbreak of acute encephalitis in Andhra Pradesh was associated with Chandipura virus, adding to the evidence suggesting that this virus should be considered as an important emerging pathogen.","Rao, B L; Basu, Atanu; Wairagkar, Niteen S; Gore, Milind M; Arankalle, Vidya A; Thakare, Jyotsna P; Jadi, Ramesh S; Rao, K A; Mishra, A C",Lancet,568,16

The aim of this investigation was to determine whether exposure during the first week of life to antigens from a known diabetes-promoting diet (NIH-07) could modify diabetes incidence and, if so, to what extent this occurs via alterations in systemic T-cell reactivity, gut cytokines, or islet infiltration. Diabetes-prone BB (BBdp) rats were hand-fed twice daily between age 4 and 7 days with vehicle, a hydrolyzed casein (HC)-based infant formula, Pregestimil (PG), PG + cereal-based NIH-07 diet, PG + lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or PG + LPS + silica. After weaning, they were fed either an NIH-07 diet or a semipurified HC (diabetes-retardant) diet until 150 days. In separate studies, 5-day-old BBdp rat pups were administered the aforementioned treatments, and expression of intestinal mRNA for gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was quantified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The effect of early oral treatment with NIH-07 or PG on systemic T-cell reactivity was evaluated using footpad swelling delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and the popliteal lymph node assay. Oral exposure of neonates to a complex mixture of antigens from the diabetes-promoting diet delayed onset of diabetes (79 vs. 88 days) and prevented disease in approximately one-third of animals. A similar protective effect was seen for neonatal exposure to wheat gluten in animals subsequently weaned onto a semipurified wheat gluten diet. By contrast, LPS-treated neonates displayed more severe insulitis and developed diabetes at an increased rate, which was significantly suppressed by co-administration of silica particles. The protective effect of early exposure to diabetogenic diets was not associated with significant reduction of islet infiltration, and there was no impact on the DTH response to food antigens. However, whereas diabetes-resistant BBc rats developed systemic tolerance to NIH-07 antigens fed chronically, BBdp rats did not. The lack of effect of the early oral antigen regimen on the DTH reaction in the footpad, a classic Th1-mediated reaction, suggests little effect on systemic T-cell reactivity. However, local effects were observed in the small intestine. Oral exposure to diabetes-promoting food antigens or LPS downregulated the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma and decreased the IFN-gamma/TGF-beta ratio. Thus, oral exposure to diabetes-promoting food antigens and immune modulators in neonates can modify diabetes expression in association with changes in local cytokine balance in the gut.","Scott, Fraser W; Rowsell, Paul; Wang, Gen-Sheng; Burghardt, Karolina; Kolb, Hubert; Flohé, Stefanie",Diabetes,568,1

C57BL/6 mice mount a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the immunodominant virus peptide VP2121-130 and clear TMEV infection. Interferon-g (IFN-g)R-/- mice also mount a strong CTL response against the VP2121-130 epitope, but because of genetic deficiencies in critical IFN-g signaling pathways, they do not clear TMEV infection and develop prominent neurological deficits within 6 wk. This pronounced disease process, coupled with a defined CTL response, provides an ideal model for evaluating the importance of antiviral CTL activity in the development of severe demyelination and loss of motor neuron function. By administering the VP2121-130 peptide before and during TMEV infection, 99% of the VP2121-130-specific CD8+ T cell response was inhibited. No decrease in virus infection was observed. Peptide treatment did result in significantly less motor dysfunction, even when no differences in levels of demyelination were observed.

METHODS A house-wide replacement of the plain postoperative gauze dressing with a sterile dressing impregnated with 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide directly on the incision after closure in the operation room was performed. From May 2005 to March 2007, 1658 patients were enrolled in this study. Surgical site infections were identified using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard criteria. RESULTS Of the 1658 patients enrolled, 1399 patients were included in the analysis, 692 with the plain dressing and 707 with antimicrobial dressing. The overall and leg site infection rate was significantly higher in the plain dressing group compared to the antimicrobial group but similar in the sternal site. Overall, the antimicrobial dressings significantly reduced infection (OR 0.58 [0.38-0.89]). Obesity was also a strong independent predictor of SSI regardless of the site of surgery. Increasing age at surgery and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%-49% were also independent predictors of infection. CONCLUSION The antimicrobial dressing had a positive effect by reducing the infection rate, especially for leg incisions using conventional open techniques, and could be a worthwhile addition in conjunction with a strategic program. ﻿﻿﻿.","Gaspard, Frédérica; Brassard, Paul; Alam, Tarik; Robineau, Catherine; Page, Christine; Dell'Aniello, Sophie; de Varennes, Benoit",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,568,32

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to the accumulation of bradykinin. Methods: In this case control study, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant, and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Results: Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in changes in time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds were safe and promoted the significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which are indicators of disease recovery.

When stratified by CVD, both groups had abnormal GLS, but presence of CVD was associated with worse median GLS (-11.6% [-13.4%, -7.2%] vs -13.9% [-15.0%, -11.3%], p=0.03). There was no difference in EF or GLS when stratified by symptoms or need for intensive care. Compared to pre-COVID-19 echocardiograms, EF was unchanged, but median GLS was significantly worse (-15% [-16%, -14%] vs -12% [-14%, -10%], p=0.003). Serial echocardiograms showed no significant changes in GLS or EF overall, however patients who died had stable or worsening GLS, while those who survived to discharge home showed improved GLS. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 had evidence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction manifested by reduced GLS despite preserved EF. These findings were observed regardless of history of CVD, presence of COVID-19 symptoms, or severity of illness.

METHODS: Two samples were recruited for an on-line survey; one sample a representative sample of Canadians living with overweight and obesity (N = 1089), the second a convenience sample of individuals recruited from obesity clinical services or patient organizations (N = 980). Respondents completed ratings of their comfort receiving a COVID-19 vaccination along with the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of respondents, regardless of sample or weight category, were not comfortable receiving a vaccination and one-half expressed moderate or greater perceived risks of vaccination. Confidence in vaccinations was extremely low, especially for those in the clinical sample. Fear of COVID-19 was substantial and predicted attitudes toward vaccination. Females were less comfortable receiving the vaccine and perceived more risks than males. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest those living with obesity are highly ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. Despite being at high risk confidence in vaccines is very low.

In parallel, by screening the immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived epitopes provided in the literature, we chose a set of epitopes that we believed would induce immunogenic response. Next, provided with the epitopes selected by using both approaches, we performed immunoinformatic analysis that mapped identically to the antigen regions and antigenic properties. Finally, after selecting a screened set of epitopes, we designed a novel virus-like particle vaccine optimized to be produced in plants by using molecular farming biotechnology techniques.

Due to its high contagious nature, it spreads from one human to another very quickly. Now it becomes a global public health threat with no approved treatments. In silico techniques can accelerate the drug development process. Our research aimed to identify the novel drugs for inhibition of Main protease (Mpro) enzyme of COVID-19 by performing in silico approach. In this context, a library consisting of 3180 FDA-approved drugs from 'the ZINC database' was used to identify novel drug candidates against 'the Mpro' of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, the top 10 drugs out of 3180 drugs were selected by molecular docking according to their binding score. Among 10 selected drugs; seven drugs that showed binding with Mpro enzyme residue Glu166 were subjected to100 ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Out of seven compounds, four namely, ZINC03831201, ZINC08101052, ZINC01482077, and ZINC03830817 were found significant based on MD simulation results. Furthermore, RMSD, RMSF, RG, SASA, PCA, MMPBSA (for last 40 ns) were calculated for the 100 ns trajectory period.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 disease as a pandemic, affecting the human respiratory and other body systems, which urgently demands for better understanding of COVID-19 histopathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Data on pathological changes in different organs are still scarce, thus we aim to review and summarise the latest histopathological changes in different organs observed after autopsy of COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over the period of 3 months, authors performed vast review of the articles. The search engines included were PubMed, Medline (EBSCO & Ovid), Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and Bio-Medical. Search terms used were 'Histopathology in COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Pathological changes in different organs in COVID-19' or 'SARS-CoV-2'. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines were used for review writing. RESULT: We identified various articles related to the histopathology of various organs in COVID-19 positive patients. Overall, 45 articles were identified as full articles to be included in our study. Histopathological findings observed are summarised according to the systems involved. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 mainly affects respiratory and immune systems, but other systems like cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, nervous system and integumentary system are not spared, especially in elderly cases and those with comorbidity. This review would help clinicians and researchers to understand the tissue pathology, which can help in better planning of the management and avoiding future risks.","Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Motwani, Rohini; Kumar, Ashutosh; Kumari, Chiman; Raza, Khursheed",J. clin. pathol,568,19

Their compositional space is immense even after considering cost and recyclability restrictions, providing abundant design opportunities. However, refractory high-entropy alloys often exhibit apparent brittleness and oxidation susceptibility, which remain important challenges for their processing and application. Here, utilizing natural-mixing characteristics among refractory elements, we designed a Ti38V15Nb23Hf24 refractory high-entropy alloy that exhibits >20% tensile ductility in the as-cast state, and physicochemical stability at high temperatures. Exploring the underlying deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales, we observe that a rare ß'-phase plays an intriguing role in the mechanical response of this alloy.

METHODS: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum collection for SARS-CoV-2 IgG examination. We divided participants according to working status, into rotating-night shift workers (r-NSW) and day-workers. RESULTS: We found 30 cases of COVID-19 infection in a total of 1180 HCWs (2.5%). Most COVID-19-positive hospital employees were r-NSWs with significantly higher BMI than that of individuals who tested negative.

This study evaluated long-term outcomes of osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee. DESIGN: This retrospective case series included patients who underwent OAT for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee from 1998 to 2008. The survivorship and need for secondary surgery were evaluated, and the clinical outcome was evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Preoperative and final Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of the femorotibial and patellofemoral joints were individually evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen knees of 10 patients whose mean age was 32.5 (95%CI 26.4-38.6) years were included and followed for 14.0 (12.4-15.7) years. The mean lesion size of 6.9 (5.3-8.5) cm2 was repaired using 4 median (minimum 2, maximum 5) osteochondral plugs. No revision surgeries were performed for transplanted osteochondral plugs. The IKDC subjective score improved from 32.9 (24.5-41.3) to 74.2 (61.9-88.5) (P < 0.001). Knee flexion was improved at the final follow-up, and Seiza sitting was finally possible in 9 knees in 7 patients. Although the osteoarthritic change did not progress in femorotibial joint, patellofemoral joint showed early osteoarthritic changes at the final follow-up (mean KL grade: 0.8 [0.5-1.1]). CONCLUSIONS: Prosthetic joint replacement was successfully avoided for at least the first decade by OAT in young patients with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee.

Methods: 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively compared to 50 patients with AH1N1 pneumonia diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic. Two radiologists reviewed chest CT scans independently and blindly, with discordance resolved by consensus. Dilated or tortuous vessels within hyperdense lesions were recorded. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with bilateral (96%), peripheral areas of GGO (22%), consolidation (4%) or combined GGO-consolidation (74%). The vascular enlargement sign in COVID-19 pneumonia was much more commonly present in COVID-19 (45/50, 90%) versus AH1N1 pneumonia (12/50, 24%) (p<0.001). Vascular enlargement was more often present in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution. Conclusions: Vascular enlargement in consolidative / GGO areas may represent a reasonably common early CT marker in COVID-19 patients and is of uncertain etiology.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has made the health care professionals realise its challenges even more ardently than in the normal times. In a country like India with its huge population burden and a significant number of people having T1D, the risk of COVID-19 in people having T1DM is considerably high. Methods: In this article, we are sharing our practical experiences of problems faced by children and adolescents having T1DM during the past 2 months of lockdown. Results: We have classified the challenges into 3 broad categories based on diabetes self-management, healthcare system and psychosocial aspects. We have tried to provide precise, comprehensive and region specific solutions to these challenges. Solutions briefly include maintaining the supply chain of essentials like insulin, syringes and glucose meter strips to psychological support, financial aid and support for hospitalization in case of COVID-19 itself or diabetes complications including diabetic ketoacidosis. Conclusions: Children and adolescents having T1DM require special care and attention during this period of COVID-19 pandemic because of various challenges as discussed. Our proposed solutions may help them overcome these problems and help them in better diabetes management during such emergency situations.","Jethwani, Pratap; Saboo, B; Jethwani, L; Kesavadev, J; Kalra, S; Sahay, R; Agarwal, S; Hasnani, D",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,568,20

The effects of protracted social isolation, and media related misinformation's about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting in increased fear/stress related to the insufficiently known illness. The aim was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 health crisis on patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 29 adult CIDP patients was performed. The Medical Research Council scale was used to evaluate muscle strength. The degree of functional disability was measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale. The overall quality of life (QoL) was self-estimated on a 0-100 numeric rating scale. We also used a specifically designed 22-question-survey about COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% of CIDP patients were concerned. The daily activities of 55% of patients were negatively influenced by the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 21% of patients reported their CIDP got worse. In 39% of CIDP patients, the influence of the pandemic on CIDP therapy was reported (reducing the dose or time interval or even discontinuation). The mean value of the self-estimated QoL was 64 ± 19. Independent predictors of worse QoL were age of patients (beta = -0.35, p < 0.05) and fear of the COVID-19 (beta = -0.34, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on CIDP patients. Besides the direct influence of the virus and fear of the virus, restrictive measures can indirectly harm the patients with CIDP.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Bozovic, Ivo; Stojanov, Jelena; Palibrk, Aleksa; Djordjevic, Gordana; Basta, Ivana; Malobabic, Marina; Arsic, Ana Azanjac; Peric, Stojan",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,568,1

At equilibrium, affinity is zero, and the reaction quotient equals the constant of equilibrium. Thermodynamics predicts the timescale of chemical reactions but not rate laws that are purely phenomenological relations. Here, we derive an affinity relaxation theory (ART) that predicts chemical rate laws. Strikingly, the simplest chemical reaction in the ART model has a close resemblance with epidemic models instead of the mass-action rate law, revealing that epidemic models are actually more accurate chemical rate laws than the mass-action law. However, epidemic models appear in turn as an approximation of the ART model, where conceptual incoherencies of epidemic models are exposed and resolved. Furthermore, the mathematical Gompertz solution of the model links chemical rate laws with empirical biological and cancer growth laws. The ART model provides an entirely new framework to describe dynamic phenomena in chemical reactions, epidemics and biology.","Vanel, L.",,568,16

Political conservatism in the United States was strongly associated with engaging in weaker mitigation behaviors, lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, greater misperceptions, and stronger vaccination hesitancy. Although there was some evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization in the United States in December (but not March), cognitive sophistication was nonetheless consistently negatively correlated with misperceptions and vaccination hesitancy across time, countries, and party lines. Furthermore, COVID-19 skepticism in the United States was strongly correlated with distrust in liberal-leaning mainstream news outlets and trust in conservative-leaning news outlets, suggesting that polarization may be driven by differences in information environments.","Pennycook, Gordon; McPhetres, Jonathon; Bago, Bence; Rand, David G",Pers Soc Psychol Bull,568,6

The majority of these trials are designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of candidate therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 to prevent death among populations of hospitalized patients with advanced disease. Yet, emerging epidemiological evidence now indicates that the majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2, while still infectious, experience minimal or mild disease symptomology.

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the only diagnostic test currently available in acutely or recently infected individuals. In contrast, serological testing is typically performed once viral RNA has been cleared and symptoms have resolved. This leads to some confusion among clinicians as to which test to order and when each is appropriate. While SARS-CoV-2 assays can suffer from poor sensitivity, all FDA authorized assays to date are intended to be qualitative. Serological tests have multiple assay formats, detect various classes of immunoglobulins, and have a distinct role in seroprevalence studies; however, the association with long-term protection remains unclear. Both molecular and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 have complementary roles in patient management, and we highlight the challenges faced by clinicians and laboratorians alike in the evaluation and interpretation of the currently available laboratory assays.","Parikh, Bijal A; Farnsworth, Christopher W",Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,568,20

Removal of these cytokines by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) prior to end-organ damage may improve clinical outcomes. This manuscript is intended to serve as a preliminary guidance document for application of TPE in patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The available literature pertaining to the role of TPE for treatment of COVID-19 patients was reviewed to guide optimal management. It included indication, contraindication, optimal timing of initiation and termination of TPE, vascular access and anticoagulants, numbers and mode of procedures, outcome measures and adverse events. RESULTS: Out of a total of 78 articles, only 65 were directly related to the topic. From these 65, only 32 were acceptable as primary source, while 33 were used as supporting references. TPE in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be classified under ASFA category III grade 2B. The early initiation of TPE for 1-1·5 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response. CONCLUSION: TPE in COVID-19 patients may help by removing toxic cytokines, viral particles and/or by correcting coagulopathy or restoring endothelial membrane. Severity score (SOFA & APACHE II) and cytokine levels (IL-6, C-reactive protein) can be used to execute TPE therapy and to monitor response in COVID-19 patients.","Patidar, Gopal K; Land, Kevin J; Vrielink, Hans; Rahimi-Levene, Naomi; Dann, Eldad J; Al-Humaidan, Hind; Spitalnik, Steven L; Dhiman, Yashaswi; So-Osman, Cynthia; Hindawi, Salwa I",Vox sang,568,24

The main route of transmission is considered to be the inhalation of large respiratory drops, by deposition in the mucosa and hands or contaminated fomites. The objective is to identify the interventions to be performed during hospitalization for the correct and safe handling of clothing and hygiene of patients and health professionals. METHOD: Scoping review carried out without chronological or language delimitation in the PUBMED and Cochrane databases. Tracking standards and recommendations of national and international government entities to answer the research question on the safe handling of clothing and skin hygiene in patients and in health professionals to avoid Covid-19 infection. The data analysis was carried out in 2stages: in the first, identification and categorization of the studies, and in the second, content analysis as an informative and classifying criterion. RESULTS: 14 documents have been selected, mainly from government entities. The recommendations are structured in 5 sections on the management of clothing and skin hygiene of infected patients and health professionals in the hospital setting. CONCLUSION: The clothing of patients and healthcare personnel are transmitting vehicles of the disease. Its correct treatment helps to improve the control of the same and the correct use of the resources available at the moment. Proper skin hygiene, especially hand cleansing, is one of the basic pillars for infection prevention and control. We highlight the similarity of some of the guidelines collected and provided by the different agencies consulted.","Martín-Vaquero, Yolanda; González-Sanz, Azucena; Muñoz-Martín, Beatriz",Enferm. clin.

PURPOSE: In this study, the network pharmacology, molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR) were used to explore the potential compounds and interaction mechanism in the Toujie Quwen Granules (TQG) for the treatment of coronavirus pneumonia 2019. STUDY DESIGN: The chemical constituents and compound targets of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Pseudostellariae Radix, Artemisia Annua L, Peucedani Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Scutellariae Radix, Hedysarum Multijugum Maxim, Isatidis Folium, Radix Bupleuri, Fritiliariae Irrhosae Bulbus, Cicadae Periostracum, Poria Cocos Wolf, Pseudobulbus Cremastrae Seu Pleiones, Mume Fructus, Figwort Root and Fritillariae Thunbrgii Bulbus in TQG were searched. The target name was translated to gene name using the UniProt database and then the Chinese medicine-compound-target network was constructed. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI), Gene ontology (GO) function enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the core targets were performed in the Metascape to predict its mechanism. The top 34 compounds in the Chinese medicine-compound-target network were docked with SARS-CoV-2 3CL enzyme and SARS--CoV--2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and then the 13 compounds with lowest affinity score were docked with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and interleukin 6 to explore its interaction mechanism. Lastly, SPR experiments were done using the quercetin, astragaloside IV, rutin and isoquercitrin, which were screened from the Chinese medicine-compound-target network and molecular docking. RESULTS: The Chinese medicine-compound-target network includes 16 medicinal materials, 111 compounds and 298 targets, in which the degree of PTGS2, TNF and IL-6 is higher compared with other targets and which are the disease target exactly. The result of GO function enrichment analysis included the response to the molecule of bacterial origin, positive regulation of cell death, apoptotic signaling pathway, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, cytokine receptor binding and so on. KEGG pathway analysis enrichment revealed two pathways: signaling pathway- IL-17 and signaling pathway- TNF. The result of molecular docking showed that the affinity score of compounds including quercetin, isoquercitrin, astragaloside IV and rutin is higher than other compounds. In addition, the SPR experiments revealed that the quercetin and isoquercitrin were combined with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein rather than Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, while astragaloside IV and rutin were combined with ACE2 rather than SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. CONCLUSION: TQG may have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 by regulating viral infection, immune and inflammation related targets and pathways, in the way of multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway.","Ye, Miaobo; Luo, Guiwen; Ye, Dexiao; She, Mengting; Sun, Ning; Lu, Yu-Jing; Zheng, Jie",Phytomedicine,568,1

Design, Setting and ParticipantsUsing the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), this retrospective epidemiological assessment reviewed reports filed between January 1, 2021, and June 18, 2021, among adolescents ages 12-17 who received mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. Symptom search criteria included the words chest pain, myocarditis, pericarditis and myopericarditis to identify children with evidence of cardiac injury. The word troponin was a required element in the laboratory findings. Inclusion criteria were aligned with the CDC working case definition for probable myocarditis. Stratified cardiac adverse event (CAE) rates were reported for age, sex and vaccination dose number. A harm-benefit analysis was conducted using existing literature on COVID-19-related hospitalization risks in this demographic. Main outcome measures1) Stratified rates of mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis in adolescents age 12-15 and 16-17; and 2) harm-benefit analysis of vaccine-related CAEs in relation to COVID-19 hospitalization risk. ResultsA total of 257 CAEs were identified. Rates per million following dose 2 among males were 162.2 (ages 12-15) and 94.0 (ages 16-17); among females, rates were 13.0 and 13.4 per million, respectively. For boys 12-15 without medical comorbidities receiving their second mRNA vaccination dose, the rate of CAE is 3.7 to 6.1 times higher than their 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization risk as of August 21, 2021 (7-day hospitalizations 1.5/100k population) and 2.6-4.3-fold higher at times of high weekly hospitalization risk (7-day hospitalizations 2.1/100k), such as during January 2021. For boys 16-17 without medical comorbidities, the rate of CAE is currently 2.1 to 3.5 times higher than their 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization risk, and 1.5 to 2.5 times higher at times of high weekly COVID-19 hospitalization. ConclusionsPost-vaccination CAE rate was highest in young boys aged 12-15 following dose two. For boys 12-17 without medical comorbidities, the likelihood of post vaccination dose two CAE is 162.2 and 94.0/million respectively. This incidence exceeds their expected 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization rate at both moderate (August 21, 2021 rates) and high COVID-19 hospitalization incidence. Further research into the severity and long-term sequelae of post-vaccination CAE is warranted. Quantification of the benefits of the second vaccination dose and vaccination in addition to natural immunity in this demographic may be indicated to minimize harm.","Hoeg, Tracy Beth; Krug, Allison; Stevenson, Josh; Mandrola, John",,568,26

We report a patient with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who presented late due to fears of contracting COVID-19. Case summary A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented late to the emergency department (ED) with AMI. He gave a 2-month history of exertional angina but avoided seeking medical consult due to fears of contracting COVID-19. On the day of admission, he had 4 h of severe chest pain before presenting to the ED. He was hypotensive and tachycardic on arrival. Electrocardiogram showed inferolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Chest radiograph revealed widened superior mediastinum and bedside echocardiogram revealed inferoseptal and inferolateral hypokinesia with features of cardiac tamponade. An urgent computed tomography aortogram showed possible left ventricular (LV) wall perforation with resulting haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed 100% occlusion of mid left circumflex artery and a contained LV wall rupture was confirmed with LV ventriculogram. He was transferred to a tertiary centre and underwent successful emergency surgical repair. Discussion Our index case demonstrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health seeking behaviour due to fears of contracting COVID-19 and the ensuing impact of delayed medical intervention. Cardiologists worldwide are seeing an alarming rate of rare complications of AMI in patients who present late.

Articles eligible for inclusion contained the topic of education in surgery in the context of COVID-19. Specific questions we aimed to answer were: Is there any difference in surgical education from pre-COVID-19 to now? How does technology assist us in teaching? Can we better harness technology to augment resident training? Two-hundred and twenty-six articles were identified, 21 relevant for our aim: 14 case studies, three survey analyses, three reviews and one commentary. The collapse of the traditional educational system due to social distancing caused a fragmentation of knowledge, a reduced acquisition of skills and a decreased employment of surgical trainees. These problems can be partially overcome by using new technologies and arranging 2-weeks rotation shifts, alternating clinical activities with learning. While medical care will remain largely based on the interaction with patients, students' adaptability to innovation will be a characteristic of post-COVID classes.","Arezzo, Alberto; Vignali, Andrea; Ammirati, Carlo Alberto; Brodie, Ronit; Mintz, Yoav",Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol,568,7

Dutch professionals are concerned about the mental consequences, and in particular that during and after hospitalization little attention is paid to psychological problems. AIM: To monitor the short-term course and severity of (neuro)psychiatric symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19. To make a recommendation regarding whether or not to follow-up these patients psychiatrically to optimize care. METHOD: In an observational cohort-study screening questions and additional questionnaires were used during two follow-up contacts to monitor cognition (MoCA), affective symptoms (HADS and IES) and overall functioning. RESULTS: More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. CONCLUSION: (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common. The natural course for affective complaints is more favorable than for cognitive functions. Specialist follow-up of patients with post-COVID psychological problems is recommended.","van Helvoort, M.

Studying how people react and reflect on the information provided and how it affects their trust in health systems is essential for effective risk communication. This study was undertaken to explore and analyse newspaper readers’ reactions to the unfolding news of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and how this affected and shaped their compliance with the mitigation measures advised by the Government. Methods We collected readers’ comments on relevant news and features on the COVID-19 outbreak (n=1,055) which were posted in the online versions of the four top circulating Bangla newspapers and one online news portal published during Jan.-Apr. 2020. A search protocol was developed and a team of three researchers searched and extracted data for content analysis according to some pre-determined study themes. Results Data analysis revealed several characteristics with implications for risk-communication: a faith-based and fatalistic attitude to the unfolding pandemic, a “denial” syndrome in the initial stage, a returning expatriate-bashing for specific countries, and a concern about the safety of the frontline health workers. The readers were resentful of the all-pervasive corruption in the health sector even in times of a pandemic and the Government’s poorly coordinated, fragmented, and delayed COVID-19 response. The pandemic severely shook their trust in the already weak health system and perceived it to be incompetent, corrupt, and non-responsive. They had deplorable personal and family experiences while seeking treatment for COVID-19 patients. Expert committees were formed to advise the Government, but few recommendations were implemented on the ground. This helpless scenario made people sharply critical of the political leadership, especially for the failure of providing stewardship at the moment of crisis. Conclusions The COVID-19 related information reaching the people, including misinformation, disinformation, and rumours was equivocal in the early months of the pandemic and failed to build the trust and transparency that is necessary for an inclusive response across constituencies. The Government should pay attention and weightage to people’s perceptions about its COVID-19 response and take appropriate measures to re-build trust for implementing pandemic control measures.

The aim of this observational study was to characterize the myocardial effects during SARS-CoV-2 infections by echocardiography. RESULTS AND METHODS: An extended echocardiographic image acquisition protocol was performed in 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessing LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation including rotation, twist, and untwisting. Furthermore, LV deformation was analyzed in an age-matched control group of healthy individuals (n = 20). The most prevalent finding was a reduced longitudinal strain observed predominantly in more than one basal LV segment (n = 10/14 patients, 71%). This pattern reminded of a ""reverse tako-tsubo"" morphology that is not typical for other viral myocarditis. Additional findings included a biphasic pattern with maximum post-systolic or negative regional radial strain predominantly basal (n = 5/14 patients, 36%); the absence or dispersion of basal LV rotation (n = 6/14 patients, 43%); a reduced or positive regional circumferential strain in more than one segment (n = 7/14 patients, 50%); a net rotation showing late post-systolic twist or biphasic pattern (n = 8/14 patients, 57%); a net rotation showing polyphasic pattern and/or higher maximum net values during diastole (n = 8/14 patients, 57%). CONCLUSION: Myocardial involvement due to SARS-CoV-2-infection was highly prevalent in the present cohort-even in patients with mild symptoms. It appears to be characterized by specific speckle tracking deformation abnormalities in the basal LV segments. These data set the stage to prospectively test whether these parameters are helpful for risk stratification and for the long-term follow-up of these patients.","Stöbe, Stephan; Richter, Sarah; Seige, Markus; Stehr, Sebastian; Laufs, Ulrich; Hagendorff, Andreas",Clin Res Cardiol,568,22

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.","Dixon, Dalia Cicily Kattiparambil; Ratan, Chameli; Nair, Bhagyalakshmi; Mangalath, Sabitha; Abraham, Rachy; Nath, Lekshmi R",Current protein and peptide science,568,15

A considerable amount of shared news embeds misleading information which affects negatively the cognitive and psychological health of its readers. The present case study focuses on fake news being tweeted during the coronavirus pandemic for the purpose to mislead the targeted population. In this context, this paper exhibits a new approach to detect fake news on Twitter during the Covid-19 period. The proposed method consists of a classification approach that uses new tweets’ features and it is based on natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. The method is implemented in parallel with apache spark. Experimental results show that our approach yields very valuable results once it is used with the random forest algorithm with an accuracy equal to 79%. We also demonstrate that the sentiment of tweets plays an important role in the detection of fake news. Indeed, the model we present outperforms those models lacking consideration of new tweets’ features.","Madani, Youness Erritali Mohammed Bouikhalene Belaid",Results in Physics,568,1

Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most widespread infectious agents. In the current study, we performed a survey on the attitude and behavior of Polish healthcare workers (HCW), which comprise physicians (MD) and administrative healthcare assistants (HA) towards the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Our study involved 2300 subjects (42.17% female; 10.96% MD; 5.87% HA). The evaluation was conducted using a Google Forms survey based on original questions and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items questionnaire. HCW significantly more often demonstrated their willingness to get vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the control group (82.95% vs. 54.31%, respectively). The main concern, as regards all groups, was the development of long-term side effects after getting COVID-19 vaccine. The study revealed that depression significantly affects the willingness to get vaccinated. The readiness was significantly strengthened by positive medical history of recommended vaccinations, fear of catching COVID-19, as well as fear of passing on the disease to the relatives. Overall, the percentage of HCW, who want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains unsatisfactory. Further works exploring this subject are needed to take a step closer to achieving the herd immunity in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szmyd, Bartosz; Karuga, Filip Franciszek; Bartoszek, Adrian; Staniecka, Katarzyna; Siwecka, Natalia; Bartoszek, Agnieszka; Blaszczyk, Maciej; Radek, Maciej",,568,1

Consequently, amygdala lesions cause a heterogeneous array of social and non-social deficits. Social behaviours are not localized to subdivisions of the amygdala even though the inputs and outputs that carry social signals are anatomically restricted to distinct subnuclear regions. This observation may be explained by the multidimensional response properties of the component neurons. Indeed, the multitudes of circuits that converge in the amygdala enlist the same subset of neurons into different ensembles that combine social and non-social elements into high-dimensional representations. These representations may enable flexible, context-dependent social decisions. As such, multidimensional processing may operate in parallel with subcircuits of genetically identical neurons that serve specialized and functionally dissociable functions. When combined, the activity of specialized circuits may grant specificity to social behaviours, whereas multidimensional processing facilitates the flexibility and nuance needed for complex social behaviour.","Gothard, Katalin M",Nat. rev. neurosci,568,16

In this study we reported the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study. The patients who have admitted to ED between March 11 and May 31, 2020 and diagnosed COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: 130 (73 male and 57 female) patients with COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test were included in the study. The average age of the study group was calculated as 52.63 ± 17.95 year. While 15.4% of the patients were asymptomatic, the most common symptom was identified as cough (46.2%), followed by dyspnea (23.1%), fever (17.7%). The computed tomography (CT) severity scores proved significantly higher in the patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) than in those without these diseases (p = 0.010 and p = 0.042, respectively). The moderate positive correlation between serum ferritin level and CT severity score is another finding worth noting (rho = 0.530 and p = 0.0001). In a similar vein, the high level of D-dimer in the CT-positive group and its positive moderate correlation with CT severity (rho = 0.375 and p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In our study, serum ferritin and D-dimer levels were observed to be high in the CT-positive group and have moderate positive correlation with CT severity. We thus argue that D-dimer and ferritin levels measured at the time of admission to the ED can be taken into consideration to predict radiological severity.","Yilmaz, Atakan; Sabirli, Ramazan; Seyit, Murat; Ozen, Mert; Oskay, Alten; Cakmak, Vefa; Goren, Tarik; Turkcuer, Ibrahim",Am J Emerg Med,568,31

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that cause a largely viral mediated immune-related syndrome similar to the SARS epidemic. Following metagenomic sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 closely resembles SARS-CoV (79% similarity) and MERS-CoV virus (50% similarity). Despite this, clinical observations have found varying degrees of infectivity and pathogenesis amongst these viruses. Phylogenetic origins of SARS-CoV-2 have found connections to bats and pangolins as possible zoonotic reservoirs. It enters the host cells via the receptor binding site of the ACE-2 receptor. Upon entering the host cells, cytopathic effects and interruption of respiratory cilia occur with a resultant cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Common clinical features of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. COVID-19 infected patients also present with various gastrointestinal, gustatory, dermatologic, ocular, cardiovascular, neurologic and coagulopathic manifestations. Dyspnea, sore throat, nasal congestion, musculoskeletal pain, headaches and chills were also observed. Emerging data supports that COVID 19 has disproportionately affected specific ethnic groups, particularly racial minorities for various health and institutional reasons. It is estimated around 5% of all cases are severe, presenting with respiratory failure, shock, acute respiratory syndrome and arrhythmias. Co-infection with other pathogens was also seen with various other viruses such as rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other coronaviruses. COVID-19 is able to spread asymptomatically and causes slightly different manifestations in pregnant ladies and the pediatric populations. ARDS in COVID-19 patients is suspected to be a unique clinical entity as lung function testing found high driving pressures with abnormally low lung compliance and low lung recruitability. This requires a unique approach to ventilating COVID-19 ARDS patients. In conclusion, new emerging data will require healthcare professionals to adapt and more studies are required to overcome this critical pandemic.","Shajahan, R.; Pillai, N.

As a result, large numbers of unemployed workers returned to their hometowns during April 2020, increasing the risk of spreading the virus across the entire country. Approach: In anticipation of the large-scale movement of unemployed workers, the Thai government trained existing village health volunteers to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and educate members of their communities. Provincial health offices assembled COVID-19 surveillance teams of these volunteers to identify returnees from high-risk areas, encourage self-quarantine for 14 days, and monitor and report the development of any relevant symptoms. Local setting: Despite a significant and recent expansion of the health-care workforce to meet sustainable development goal targets, there still exists a shortage of professional health personnel in rural areas of Thailand. To compensate for this, the primary health-care system includes trained village health volunteers who provide basic health care to their communities. Relevant changes: Village health volunteers visited more than 14 million households during March and April 2020. Volunteers identified and monitored 809 911 returnees, and referred a total of 3346 symptomatic patients to hospitals by 13 July 2020. Lessons learnt: The timely mobilization of Thailand's trusted village health volunteers, educated and experienced in infectious disease surveillance, enabled the robust response of the country to the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus was initially contained without the use of a costly country-wide lockdown or widespread testing.","Kaweenuttayanon, Nayawadee; Pattanarattanamolee, Ratrawee; Sorncha, Nithikorn; Nakahara, Shinji",Bull World Health Organ,568,24

Simply reviving the existing 'brown' economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008-2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5-10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities. Pricing carbon and pollution, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies, can accelerate the transition, raise revenues for the necessary public investments, and lower the overall cost of the green transition.","Barbier, Edward B",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),568,20

I had plenty of time to refect on this from March to July after I ended feldwork in Guam and unexpectedly spent four months in Taiwan. Because of Taiwan's proximity to China, where the pandemic began, it initially seemed as if it would be among the most serious cases. Instead, Taiwan's public health measures allowed it to become one of the few places in the world relatively untouched by the virus. The experience of Taiwan with COVID-19 was shaped most of all by tense relations with China and the non-recognition of the country by the World Health Organization (WHO). There are also intriguing diferences within Taiwan where historically Chinese settler groups and Indigenous peoples related to other Pacific Islanders fnd their place in the world through a broad spectrum of non-Western ontologies. In travelogue genre, I refect upon their different stories and practices of worlding as fears of the pandemic contributed to a heightened sense of crisis, ethnic tensions, and a rise in nationalism.

During this time, policy reforms have ultimately landed care, and the business of providing it, within a market model. Following recent evidence produced by the Royal Commission into Aged Care and Safety and the COVID-19 Senate Committee, this model and the sector's incapacity to consistently deliver appropriate care has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and debate. The many COVID-19-related deaths of aged care residents have added to demands for urgent action to redress the sector's weaknesses, particularly those relating to workforce adequacy. This paper presents findings from a recent mixed methods study of community aged care provision by five providers who operate across a large rural part of regional Victoria. It utilises data to illustrate the impact of rural location on care provision, and significantly, on local capacity to maintain an appropriately skilled workforce. Demographic factors and funding shortfalls for consumers with multiple, complex care needs underscore the need for strategic planning to ensure workforce adequacy into the future. Encouragingly, our data showcase the many capacities of community aged services in this rural area and the opportunity to develop effective strategies relative to the recruitment and retention of direct care workers and the design of best practice models for meeting complex care needs. © 2021 Institute of Public Administration Australia","Savy, P.; Hodgkin, S.",Australian Journal of Public Administration,568,9

Now, mobile X-ray examinations are also used outside the hospital. The literature describes that fragile patients may benefit from mobile X-ray, but we need to provide insights into the breadth, depth and gaps in a body of literature. METHODS: The scoping review was performed by searching PubMed, Cinahl, Embase, EconLit and Health Technology Assessment. English-, Danish-, Norwegian-, German-, Italian-, French- and Swedish-language studies, published 1.1.2009-1.5.2020 about mobile X-ray outside the hospital were included. Participants were patients examined using mobile X-ray as the intervention. PRISMA was used when eligible to build up the review. To extract data from the selected articles, we used a structured summary table. RESULTS: We included 12 studies in this scoping review. The results were divided into four topics:1. Target population 2. Population health 3. Experience of care and 4. Cost effectiveness. The main findings are that target population could be larger for instance including hospice patients for palliative care, group dwelling for people with intellectual disabilities, or psychiatric patients, population health may be improved, image quality seems to be good and mobile X-ray may be cost effective. Limitations of language, databases and grey literature may have resulted in studies being missed. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile X-ray may be used outside hospital. There seems to be potential benefits to both patients and health care staff. Based on the published studies it is not possible to draw a final conclusion if mobile X-ray examination is a relevant diagnostic offer and for whom. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility of use in fragile patients, also regarding staff, relatives and societal consequences and therefore the topic mobile X-ray needs more research.","Toppenberg, Maria Dietz; Christiansen, Thomas Erik Møller; Rasmussen, Finn; Nielsen, Camilla Palmhøj; Damsgaard, Else Marie",BMC Health Serv Res,568,7

Here, we present a review of the in silico methods that have been used for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. These methods employ a diverse set of technical approaches, often rooted in machine learning. A performance comparison is provided based on the ability to identify a specific set of immunogenic epitopes that have been determined experimentally to be targeted by T cells in convalescent COVID-19 patients, shedding light on the relative performance merits of the different approaches adopted by the in silico studies.

BACKGROUND: Disease disclosure is a critical component of prevention and control of a virus outbreak, and this is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding COVID patients' experiences and perspectives on disclosure could play a vital role in COVID management. DESIGN: A qualitative study. METHODS: A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct qualitative in-depth interviews from April to June 2020. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and then, a thematic analysis was conducted. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) were applied to this study. RESULTS: A total of 26 COVID-confirmed patients were recruited for the in-depth interviews. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis on disclosure: persons disclosed to, reasons for disclosure, reasons for nondisclosure and impact of disclosure. The participants disclosed their COVID diagnosis to different groups, including family, close friends, community members and workplace contacts. The main reasons for disclosure included the following: government policy, social responsibility, gaining support and fear of being blamed for nondisclosure. However, some participants decided not to disclose to some groups for fear of facing stigma and discrimination or to protect family members from discrimination. Despite the potential benefits of obtaining support after disclosure, many participants did experience stigma and discrimination, privacy exposure, psychological distress and social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: An individual's decision as to whether to disclose their COVID-positive status is affected by many factors. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the potential risks of disclosure, such as discrimination and privacy exposure, a balanced intervention should be designed to protect COVID patients and to secure any contact tracing. Therefore, the chances of discrimination could be decreased and patients' confidentiality could be protected. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the number of COVID patients increases, disclosure of an individual's infectious status is encouraged by health departments. Despite the potential benefits of disclosure, discrimination and privacy exposure should not be ignored. A disclosure protocol is necessary to ensure patients' privacy regarding their COVID status.","Sun, Wenxiu; Zhou, Ying; Chen, Wei-Ti; Huang, Feifei; Sun, Meiyan; Shen, Lei; Gao, Yan; Zhang, Qing; Ma, Siyue; Shiu, Chengshi; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Hongzhou",J. clin. nurs,568,1

For virtual screening, energy minimization of a crystal structure of the modeled protein was carried out using the Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrodinger LLC 2020-1). Following active site selection based on data mining and COACH predictions, we performed a high-throughput virtual screen of drugs and investigational molecules (n=5903). The screening was performed against viral targets using three sequential docking modes (i.e., HTVS, SP, and XP). Virtual screening identified â¼290 potential inhibitors based on the criteria of energy, docking parameters, ligand, and binding site strain and score. Drugs specific to each target protein were further analyzed for binding free energy perturbation by molecular mechanics (prime MM-GBSA) and pruning the hits to the top 32 candidates. The top lead from each target pool was further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation using the Desmond module. The resulting top eight hits were tested for their SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral activity in-vitro.

We then studied this issue in male rats exposed to 2â¯h immobilization on boards (IMO), a severe stressor. Thirty-six rats were blood sampled under resting conditions four times a day on three non-consecutive days. Then, they were assigned to control (nâ¯=â¯14) or IMO (nâ¯=â¯22) to study the HPA response to IMO, the stressor-induced alterations in the circadian pattern of corticosterone (CPCORT), and the behavioral and HPA responsiveness to an open-field. Individual differences in pre-IMO resting corticosterone were inconsistent, but averaging data markedly improved consistency. The CPCORT was markedly altered on day 1 post-IMO (higher trough and lower peak levels), less altered on day 3 and apparently normal on day 7. Importantly, when rats were classified in low and high resting corticosterone groups (LCORT and HCORT, respectively), on the basis of the area under the curve (AUC) of the averaged pre-IMO data, AUC differences between LCORT and HCORT groups were maintained in controls but disappeared in IMO rats during the post-IMO week. Open-field hypo-activity and corticosterone sensitization were similar in LCORT and HCORT groups nine days after IMO. A single IMO exposure causes long-lasting HPA alterations, some of them dependent on pre-stress resting corticosterone levels, with no evidence for post-IMO resting corticosterone hypo-activity.","Belda, Xavier; Fuentes, Silvia; Labad, Javier; Nadal, Roser; Armario, Antonio",Horm Behav,568,16

In this work, we evaluate whether disruptions related to Covid-19 have affected new and existing patients' access to pharmacological therapies without interruption. We do so by performing a retrospective analysis on a dataset of 9.4 billion US prescription drug claims from 252 million patients from May, 2019 through August, 2020 (about 93% of prescriptions dispensed within those months). Using fixed effect (conditional likelihood) linear models, we evaluate continuity of care, how many days of supply patients received, and the likelihood of discontinuing therapy for drugs from classes with significant population health impacts. Findings indicate that more prescriptions were filled in March 2020 than in any prior month, followed by a significant drop in monthly dispensing. Compared to the pre-Covid era, a patient's likelihood of discontinuing some medications increased after the spread of Covid: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (hormonal contraceptive) discontinuation increased 0.62% (95% CI: 0.59% to 0.65%, p<0.001); dexmethylphenidate HCL (ADHD stimulant treatment) discontinuation increased 2.84% (95% CI: 2.79% to 2.89%, p<0.001); escitalopram oxalate (SSRI antidepressant) discontinuation increased 0.57% (95% CI: 0.561% to 0.578%, p<0.001); and haloperidol (antipsychotic) discontinuation increased 1.49% (95% CI: 1.41% to 1.57%, p<0.001). In contrast, the likelihood of discontinuing tacrolimus (immunosuppressant) decreased 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12% to 0.19%, p<0.001). The likelihood of discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone (opioid addiction therapy) decreased 0.59% (95% CI: 0.55% to 0.62% decrease, p<0.001). We also observe a notable decline in new patients accessing these latter two therapies. Most US patients were able to access chronic medications during the early months of Covid-19, but still were more likely to discontinue their therapies than in previous months. Further, fewer than normal new patients started taking medications that may be vital to their care. Providers would do well to inquire about adherence and provide prompt, nonjudgmental, re-initiation of medications. From a policy perspective, opioid management programs seem to demonstrate a robust ability to manage existing patients in spite of disruption.","Clement, Jeffrey; Jacobi, Maura; Greenwood, Brad N",PLoS One,568,16

Interferons have direct antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral effects may include inhibition of viral replication, protein synthesis, virus maturation, or virus release from infected cells. Previous studies have shown that some coronaviruses are susceptible to interferons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of IFN-ß-1a administration in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective non-controlled trial, 20 patients included. They received IFN-ß-1a at a dose of 44 µg subcutaneously every other day up to 10 days. All patients received conventional therapy including Hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, virological clearance, and imaging findings recorded during the study. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58.55 ± 13.43 years. Fever resolved in all patients during first seven days. Although other symptoms decreased gradually. Virological clearance results showed a significant decrease within 10 days. Imaging studies showed significant recovery after 14-day period in all patients. The mean time of hospitalization was 16.8 ± 3.4 days. There were no deaths or significant adverse drug reactions in the 14-day period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the use of IFN-ß-1a in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19.

Not all excess deaths have been directly related to COVID-19 infection. We investigated geographical and socioeconomic patterns in excess deaths for major groups of underlying causes during the pandemic. Methods: Weekly mortality data from 27/12/2014 to 2/10/2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends for deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (and other respiratory causes) and those caused indirectly by it (cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cancers, and all other indirect causes) over the first 30 weeks of the pandemic (7/3/2020–2/10/2020). Findings: There were 62,321 (95% CI: 58,849 to 65,793) excess deaths in England and Wales in the first 30 weeks of the pandemic. Of these, 46,221 (95% CI: 45,439 to 47,003) were attributable to respiratory causes, including COVID-19, and 16,100 (95% CI: 13,410 to 18,790) to other causes. Rates of all-cause excess mortality ranged from 78 per 100,000 in the South West of England and in Wales to 130 per 100,000 in the West Midlands;and from 93 per 100,000 in the most affluent fifth of areas to 124 per 100,000 in the most deprived. The most deprived areas had the highest rates of death attributable to COVID-19 and other indirect deaths, but there was no socioeconomic gradient for excess deaths from cardiovascular disease/diabetes and cancer. Interpretation: During the first 30 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant geographic and socioeconomic variation in excess deaths for respiratory causes, but not for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.

While the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other co-receptors has elucidated the molecular and structural basis for viral entry, the pathobiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues are less understood. Recent advances in bioengineering have opened opportunities for the use of organotypic human tissue models to investigate host-virus interactions and test antiviral drug candidates in a physiological context. Although it is too early to accurately quantify the added value of these systems compared with conventional cell systems, it can be assumed that these advanced three-dimensional (3D) models contribute toward improved result translation.

As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.","Felsenstein, Susanna; Herbert, Jenny A; McNamara, Paul S; Hedrich, Christian M",Clin Immunol,568,16

A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5°C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5°C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85).

The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2.

Pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting viral infections including COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the clinical course and risk factors of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID 19 in Hamadan Province, west of Iran. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The convenience sampling was performed using 50 papers and electronic files of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the WHO's temporary guidelines. They were hospitalized in health centers and clinics of Hamadan Province. The data-collecting tool employed was a researcher-made questionnaire. The data were analyzed via SPSS software version 19. RESULTS: The mean age of pregnant women with COVID 19 was estimated to be 29.20 ± 5.8 yr and their average gestational age estimated to be 28.8 ± 8.20 weeks. About 32% of them had an underlying disease, 32% a history of influenza, and 40% recently traveled to infected areas. The most common findings were CT scans and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity chest radiology. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. About 8% of the women required ICU hospitalization and the average length of hospital stay was 4.04 ± 2.38 and 29% had premature births. Moreover, 28% of infected mothers had a normal delivery and 20% had a cesarean section. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease is essential in pregnant women.

Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank), we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large regional population and small inter-city transportation. The proposed index, dynamic and applicable to different epidemic settings, could be a useful indicator for the risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China; the model framework is modularized and can be adapted for other nations without much difficulty.","Li, Tianyi; Luo, Jiawen; Huang, Cunrui",,568,29

A well-accepted strategy is to definitively reduce and fix one part of the fracture (commonly the posterior articular surface in a pilon or tibial plateau fracture) with the patient in one position, and then reposition the patient to access the other side of the fracture. The change of position prolongs the anaesthetic and surgical time. In the context of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it also causes concern with donning and doffing. We describe a mobile floppy lateral position that enables dual approaches to the ankle, distal tibia, tibial plateau, and the acetabulum without having to change the patient positioning. The patient is positioned lateral on a radiolucent table, usually with the affected side on top. No supports are placed around the pelvis, allowing the patient's pelvis to flop forwards or backwards. Two supports are placed around the chest and a strap is placed to secure the patient to the table if deemed necessary. The initial surgical procedure can be performed by flopping the patient's pelvis forwards, allowing access to the posterior leg, knee or hip. Once satisfactory fixation is achieved, the pelvis is rolled backwards to allow access to the anterior aspect of the fracture.","Garala, Kanai; Patil, Sunit",Orthop Trauma,568,21

Despite rigorous efforts worldwide to control the spread and human to human transmission of this virus, incidence and death due to COVID-19 continue to rise. Several drugs have been tested for treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. While a number of studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can prolong QT interval, potentially increasing risk of ventricular arrhythmias and Torsade de Pointes, its effects on immune cell function have not been extensively examined. In the current review, an overview of coronaviruses, viral entry and pathogenicity, immunity upon coronavirus infection, and current therapy options for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. Further based on preclinical studies, we provide evidences that i) hydroxychloroquine impairs autophagy, which leads to accumulation of damaged/oxidized cytoplasmic constituents and interferes with cellular homeostasis, ii) this impaired autophagy in part reduces antigen processing and presentation to immune cells and iii) inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification by hydroxychloroquine not only impairs the phagocytosis process, but also potentially alters pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. Therefore, it is likely that hydroxychloroquine treatment may in fact impair host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities. Further, this review provides a rationale for developing and selecting antiviral drugs and includes a brief review of traditional strategies combined with new drugs to combat COVID-19.","Devarajan, Asokan; Vaseghi, Marmar",Redox Biol,568,16

Most countries have rapidly stopped almost all activities including industry, services and transportation of goods and people, thus decreasing air pollution in an unprecedented way, and providing a unique opportunity to study air pollutants. While satellite data have provided visual evidence for the global reduction in air pollution such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) worldwide, precise and quantitative information is missing at the local scale. Here we studied changes in particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), NO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) at 10 urban sites in Hangzhou, a city of 7.03 million inhabitants, and at 1 rural site, before city lockdown, January 1-23, during city lockdown, January 24-February 15, and during resumption, February 16-28, in 2020. Results show that city lockdown induced a sharp decrease in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 concentrations at both urban and rural sites. The NO2 decrease is explained by reduction in traffic emissions in the urban areas, and by lower regional transport in rural areas during lockdown, as expected. SO2 concentrations decreased from 6.3 to 5.3 µg m-3 in the city, but increased surprisingly from 4.7 to 5.8 µg m-3 at the rural site: this increase is attributed both to higher coal consumption for heating and emissions from traditional fireworks of the Spring Eve and Lantern Festivals during lockdown. Unexpectedly, O3 concentrations increased by 145% from 24.6 to 60.6 µg m-3 in the urban area, and from 42.0 to 62.9 µg m-3 in the rural area during the lockdown. This finding is explained by the weakening of chemical titration of O3 by NO due to reductions of NOx fresh emissions during the non-photochemical reaction period from 20:00 PM to 9:00 AM (local time). During the lockdown, compared to the same period in 2019, the daily average concentrations in the city decreased by 42.7% for PM2.5, 47.9% for PM10, 28.6% for SO2, 22.3% for CO and 58.4% for NO2, which is obviously explained by the absence of city activities. Overall, we observed not only the expected reduction in some atmospheric pollutants (PM, SO2, CO, NO2), but also unexpected increases in SO2 in the rural areas and of ozone (O3) in both urban and rural areas, the latter being paradoxically due to the reduction in nitrogen oxide levels. In other words, the city lockdown has improved air quality by reducing PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, but has also decreased air quality by augmenting O3 and SO2.","Wang, Liqiang; Li, Mengying; Yu, Shaocai; Chen, Xue; Li, Zhen; Zhang, Yibo; Jiang, Linhui; Xia, Yan; Li, Jiali; Liu, Weiping; Li, Pengfei; Lichtfouse, Eric; Rosenfeld, Daniel; Seinfeld, John H",Environ Chem Lett,568,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from 14 Cuban universities of medical sciences (n=200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as the cut-off point the centre of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale. RESULTS: The average age of the sample was 23.30± 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25±5.404). When applying the cut-off point &#8805;25, only two students had high rates of perceived stress. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument (&#945;=0.755). The cut-off point &#8805;20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress. CONCLUSIONS: In Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and healthcare support, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point &#8805;20 as a reference of high stress perceived.","Hernández-García, Frank; Góngora Gómez, Onelis; González-Velázquez, Victor Ernesto; Pedraza-Rodríguez, Elys María; Zamora-Fung, Rolando; Lazo Herrera, Luis Alberto",,568,1

Pooling is a testing method wherein samples from specimens (e.g., swabs) from multiple subjects are combined into a pool and screened with a single test. If the pool tests positive, then new samples from the collected specimens are individually tested, while if the pool tests negative, the subjects are classified as negative for the disease. Pooling can substantially expand COVID-19 testing capacity and throughput, without requiring additional resources. We develop a mathematical model to determine the best pool size for different risk groups, based on each group's estimated COVID-19 prevalence. Our approach takes into consideration the sensitivity and specificity of the test, and a dynamic and uncertain prevalence, and provides a robust pool size for each group. For practical relevance, we also develop a companion COVID-19 pooling design tool (through a spread sheet). To demonstrate the potential value of pooling, we study COVID-19 screening using testing data from Iceland for the period, February-28-2020 to June-14-2020, for subjects stratified into high- and low-risk groups. We implement the robust pooling strategy within a sequential framework, which updates pool sizes each week, for each risk group, based on prior week's testing data. Robust pooling reduces the number of tests, over individual testing, by 88.5% to 90.2%, and 54.2% to 61.9%, respectively, for the low-risk and high-risk groups (based on test sensitivity values in the range [0.71, 0.98] as reported in the literature). This results in much shorter times, on average, to get the test results compared to individual testing (due to the higher testing throughput), and also allows for expanded screening to cover more individuals. Thus, robust pooling can potentially be a valuable strategy for COVID-19 screening.","Bish, Douglas R; Bish, Ebru K; El-Hajj, Hussein; Aprahamian, Hrayer",PLoS One,568,3

However, the function of PLP1 remains unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of PLP1 significantly promoted PEDV replication and inhibited production of interferon-ß. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify cellular interaction partners of PLP1. Host cell poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was determined to bind and interact with PLP1. Both endogenous and overexpressed PCBP2 co-localized with PLP1 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PLP1 upregulated expression of PCBP2. Furthermore, overexpression of PCBP2 promoted PEDV replication. Silencing of endogenous PCBP2 using small interfering RNAs attenuated PEDV replication. Taken together, these data demonstrated that PLP1 negatively regulated the production of type 1 interferon by interacting with PCBP2 and promoted PEDV replication.","Zhang, Pengfei; Yu, Linyang; Dong, Jianguo; Liu, Yanling; Zhang, Leyi; Liang, Pengshuai; Wang, Lei; Chen, Bin; Huang, Li; Song, Changxu",Vet Microbiol,568,1

As of April 10, 2020, half of Canada's COVID-19 deaths had occurred in LTC facilities. Objective: To better understand trends and risk factors associated with COVID-19 death in LTC facilities in Ontario, Canada. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 627 LTC facilities included 269 total individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario to April 11, 2020, and 83 individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario LTC facilities to April 7, 2020. Because population denominators were not available for LTC residents, they were approximated as the total number of LTC facility beds in Ontario (79â¯498), assuming complete occupancy. Exposures: Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 outbreaks; confirmed COVID-19 infection among residents and staff, diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19-specific mortality incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for LTC residents were calculated with community-living Ontarians older than 69 years as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and to identify associations of infection risk among staff and residents with subsequent LTC resident death. Model-derived IRRs for COVID-19-specific mortality were generated through bootstrap resampling (1000 replicates) to generate median and 95% credible intervals for IRR over time. Results: Of 627 LTC facilities, 272 (43.4%) reported COVID-19 infection in residents or staff. Of 1â¯731â¯315 total individuals older than 69 years living in Ontario during the study period, 229 (<0.1%) died; of 79â¯498 potential residents in LTC facilities, 83 (0.1%) died. The IRR for COVID-19-related death in LTC residents was 13.1 (95% CI, 9.9-17.3) compared with community-living adults older than 69 years. The IRR increased sharply over time and was 87.3 (95% credible interval, 6.4-769.8) by April 11, 2020. Infection among LTC staff was associated with death among residents with a 6-day lag (eg, adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of COVID-19-related deaths during the pandemic in Ontario, Canada, mortality risk was concentrated in LTC residents and increased during a short period. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing, providing personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent the movement of COVID-19 between facilities.","Fisman, David N; Bogoch, Isaac; Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; McCready, Janine; Tuite, Ashleigh R",JAMA Netw Open,568,1

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A; Bernabeu-Wittel, J; Linares-Barrios, M; Russo-de la Torre, F; García-Doval, I; Del Río-de la Torre, E",Actas dermo-sifiliogr.

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that one important reason for this drop in stroke admissions, may be an actual reduction in stroke incidence brought about by an improvement in air quality.","Hameed, Sajid; Khan, Maria; Fatmi, Zafar; Wasay, Mohammad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,568,21

The resulting imbalance between inflammatory and resolving transcriptional programs can cause an overabundance of pro-inflammatory, classically activated macrophage type 1 (M1) and/or helper T cell type 1 (Th1) products, such as IFNÎ³, TNF&#945;, IL1-ß, and IL12, that prevent immune switching to resolution and healing. The low molecular weight fraction of human serum albumin (LMWF5A) is a novel biologic drug that is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of osteoarthritis and the hyper-inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms of action involved with the ability of LMWF5A to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine release. METHODS: ELISA arrays were used to identify cytokines and chemokines influenced by LMWF5A treatment of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The resulting profiles were analyzed by gene enrichment to gain mechanistic insight into the biologic processes and transcription factors (TFs) underlying the identified differentially expressed cytokines. DNA-binding ELISAs, luciferase reporter assays, and TNF&#945; or IL-1ß relative potency were then employed to confirm the involvement of enriched pathways and TFs. RESULTS: LMWF5A was found to significantly inhibit a distinct set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-12, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) associated with pro-inflammatory M1/Th1 immune profiles. Gene enrichment analysis also suggests these cytokines are, in part, regulated by NF-&#954;B and STAT transcription factors. Data from DNA-binding and reporter assays support this with LMWF5A inhibition of STAT1&#945; DNA-binding activity as well as a reduction in overall NF-&#954;B-driven luciferase expression. Experiments using antagonists specific for the immunomodulatory and NF-&#954;B/STAT-repressing transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)Î³ and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), indicate these pathways are involved in the LMWF5A mechanisms of action by reducing LMWF5A drug potency as measured by TNF&#945; and IL-1ß release. CONCLUSION: In this report, we provide evidence that LMWF5A reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine release by activating the immunoregulatory transcription factors PPARÎ³ and AhR. In addition, our data indicate that LMWF5A suppresses NF-&#954;B and STAT1&#945; pro-inflammatory pathways. This suggests that LMWF5A acts through these mechanisms to decrease pro-inflammatory transcription factor activity and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production.","Thomas, Gregory; Frederick, Elizabeth; Thompson, Lisa; Bar-Or, Raphael; Mulugeta, Yetti; Hausburg, Melissa; Roshon, Michael; Mains, Charles; Bar-Or, David",J Transl Med,568,22

Students in two classes received 8 weeks of face-to-face instruction with five low-tech active learning techniques and then received 6 weeks of emergency remote, online instruction. Learning was measured using pre-test and post-test administrations of the biomechanics concept inventory (BCI). A survey of engagement in active learning with additional questions on active learning and online instruction were collected with the post-test. No student perceptions of engagement in active learning or online instruction were correlated with learning measured by normalised gain. Student's perception of the 'value of group activity' factor from survey was significantly correlated (r 2 = 12%) with the number of students typically in active learning groups. There was a significant correlation (r 2 = 46%) between student perception of reading the textbook before online video lessons and perception of value of the video lessons in the online portion of the course. Most students (59%) preferred face-to-face instruction in biomechanics.

Benefits of briefinterventions are well established, but GPs and pharmacistsreport challenges implementing them in practice includinglimited training, time, and poor fit with existing practices [2].Aim: This government-funded Sláintecare project aimedto develop a novel method for brief interventions in pharmacy/GP settings using human-centred design.Methods: User research was carried out with twelve users,including patients (3), GPs (4), and pharmacists (5) to identify their needs and priorities. Participants were recruited viaemail using a purposive sampling approach and completedsemi-structured interviews with a design researcher. All participants invited agreed to participate. Next, a series of design sprints were completed with the research team. Designsprints allowed the team to integrate insights from user research with findings from a literature review/secondary research to understand pain points, identify stakeholder anduser goals, and develop a list of initial design specifications.This list was used to develop and iterate a series of prototype solutions. Prototype service blueprints and wireframes(simple, two-dimensional schematic illustrations of thedigital interface) were developed and tested with users before final versions were agreed.Results: Findings from the interviews and literature review indicated (1) the main barrier to adoption was time, (2)patients and pharmacists were very positive about brief interventions with GPs more hesitant, (3) an approach blendingtechnology with a consultation was preferred, and (4) havinga specific list of local supports was important. Prototyping and evaluation processes identified that a simple interfacewith a clear indication of progress were preferred.A blended intervention combining a tablet-based digitaltool and structured interaction was developed. The interface was designed to maximise use of patient and healthcareprofessional time, and mapped to the 5As approach (whichis underpinned by principles of motivational interviewing,shared-decision making, and readiness to change frameworks). The HealthEir digital tool enables patients to selfcomplete the Ask, Advise, and Assess phases of a briefintervention using a tablet device while waiting to see theirpharmacist/GP. The pharmacist or GP then review thepatient's responses, risk level, and importance confidenceand readiness scores. They complete the Assist and Arrangeelements during the consultation, supported by a directoryof local/national patient support services before printinginformation tickets for the patient to keep. The HealthEirintervention has been successfully rolled out at eight pilotpharmacy sites nationally, with a mix of urban/rural sites,and independent/chain pharmacies.Conclusions: Adopting an interdisciplinary approachbased on human-centred design principles led to the development of a blended brief intervention that has been successfully introduced in pilot sites across Ireland. While theimplementation has been smooth despite COVID-19 challenges, and initial feedback has been very positive, the impactcannot yet be fully evaluated as research is ongoing. Futurework will involve extending the intervention to include otherhealthcare professionals.","Flood, M.; Ennis, M.; Ludlow, A.; Sweeney, F.; Mellon, L.; Boland, F.; De Brún, A.; Hanratty, M.; Moriarty, F.",International Journal of Pharmacy Practice,568,14

However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases typically spread through interactions between individuals and therefore cause infections to be correlated. Inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and similar diseases, we consider an infection model over networks which generalizes the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this infection model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. We prove that when the network and infection parameters are conducive to""strong community structure,""our proposed adaptive, graph-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm, and is even order-optimal in certain parameter regimes.

Therefore, this study has been attempted to examine the linkage between climatic variables and COVID-19 particularly in National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT of Delhi), India. For this, daily data of COVID-19 has been used for the period March 14 to June 11, 2020, (90 days). Eight climatic variables such as maximum, minimum and mean temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), bright sunshine hours, wind speed (km/h), evaporation (mm), and rainfall (mm) have been analyzed in relation to COVID-19. To study the relationship among different climatic variables and COVID-19 spread, Karl Pearson's correlation analysis has been performed. The Mann-Kendall method and Sen's slope estimator have been used to detect the direction and magnitude of COVID-19 trends, respectively. The results have shown that out of eight selected climatic variables, six variables, viz. maximum temperature, minimum temperature, mean temperature, relative humidity, evaporation, and wind speed are positively associated with coronavirus disease cases (statistically significant at 95 and 99% confidence levels). No association of coronavirus disease has been found with bright sunshine hours and rainfall. Besides, COVID-19 cases and deaths have shown increasing trends, significant at 99% confidence level. The results of this study suggest that climatic conditions in NCT of Delhi are favorable for COVID-19 and the disease may spread further with the increasing temperature, relative humidity, evaporation and wind speed. This is the only study which has presented the analysis of COVID-19 spread in relation to several climatic variables for the most densely populated and rapidly growing city of India. Thus, considering the results obtained, effective policies and actions are necessary especially by identifying the areas where the spread rate is increasing rapidly in this megacity.

The novel coronavirus [10] is just the latest example. A new viral outbreak can be unpredictable, and development of specific defense tools and countermeasures against the new virus remains time-consuming even in today's era of modern medical science and technology. In the lack of effective and specific medication or vaccination, it would be desirable to have a nonspecific protocol or substance to render the virus inactive, a substance/protocol, which could be applied whenever a new viral outbreak occurs. This is especially important in cases when the emerging new virus is as infectious as SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Aims and structure of the present communication: In this editorial, we propose to consider the possibility of developing and implementing antiviral protocols by applying high purity aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solutions. The aim of this proposal is to initiate research that could lead to the introduction of practical and effective antiviral protocols. To this end, we first discuss some important properties of the ClO2 molecule, which make it an advantageous antiviral agent, then some earlier results of ClO2 gas application against viruses will be reviewed. Finally, we hypothesize on methods to control the spread of viral infections using aqueous ClO2 solutions.","Kály-Kullai, K; Wittmann, M; Noszticzius, Z; Rosivall, László",Physiol Int,568,16

It is associated with inflammation and microvascular thrombosis-anticoagulation in widely used in these patients especially in patients with elevated d-Dimers. The significance of anticoagulation in these patients is not yet established. We aim to define the anticoagulation pattern and its impact on outcomes (28-day survival, LOSICU, DVT, and PE and bleeding complications. We also observe if levels of d-Dimers affect the anticoagulation prescription. METHODS: We analyzed data of all consecutive patients with Covid-19 ARDS admitted to ICU retrospectively. The primary variable of interest was anticoagulation. The daily dose of anticoagulant medication for each patient was recorded. Survival (28-day survival), Length of stay in ICU (LOSICU), the occurrence of DVT, PE, or bleeding were primary outcome variables. We also recorded confounding factors with potential impact on clinical outcomes. We assign Patients to one of the four groups based on anticoagulant dosing during the ICU (increasing dose, decreasing dose, increase followed by a decrease, multiple changes). We analyze the effect of different anticoagulation dosing strategies on 28-day survival, LOSICU, the occurrence of DVT, PE, and bleeding. We also observe if levels of d-Dimers affect the anticoagulation prescription. RESULTS: The sample includes 149 patients. The most frequently used medication was subcutaneous Enoxaparin (85.2%). The Enoxaparin mean dose per day for the whole sample was 49.5 mg + 15.7 (mean + SD). There was no significant difference in doses of anticoagulants between survivors and nonsurvivors (62.8 mg + 21.7 mg vs. 61.2 mg + 25.7 mg, p 0.3). Multinomial regression showed no difference in 28-day survival among four-dose modification (increasing dose, decreasing dose, increase followed by a decrease, multiple changes). Logistic regression showed that BMI, d-Dimers, platelets, and the use of mechanical ventilation predict 28-day survival. Kaplan-Meier Survival plots for 4 anticoagulant groups showed no survival advantage for any anticoagulant strategy. Secondary outcome analysis showed that d-dimer levels significantly affect anticoagulants doses. CONCLUSION: Prescription of anticoagulation is quite variable in patients admitted to ICU for Covid-19 associated ARDS. Anticoagulation dosing strategy has no significant effect on 28-day survival, LOSICU, the occurrence of DVT, PE, or bleeding.","Nadeem, Rashid; Thomas, Stelvie John; Fathima, Zoubia; Palathinkal, Anju Subin; Alkilani, Yazan Emad; Dejan, Efaf Ahmad; Darwish, Ismail Mohammad Ismail; Alsubousi, Aisha Ali; Backour, Allaa Marouf; Kandeel, Hussein; Omar, Mohamad; Kewan, Hesham Fawzy Yehia Taha; Makhlof, Mahmod Elshahat; Kotgire, Anand Bhaskarrao",Heart Lung,568,24

Here, we performed a detailed characterization of age-related pathophysiological changes in the mouse neuromuscular system. METHODS: Young, adult, middle-aged, and old (1, 4, 14, and 24-30 months old, respectively) C57BL/6J mice were used. Motor behavioural and electrophysiological tests and histological and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out to simultaneously analyse structural, molecular, and functional age-related changes in distinct cellular components of the neuromuscular system. RESULTS: Ageing was not accompanied by a significant loss of spinal motoneurons (MNs), although a proportion (~15%) of them in old mice exhibited an abnormally dark appearance. Dark MNs were also observed in adult (~9%) and young (~4%) animals, suggesting that during ageing, some MNs undergo early deleterious changes, which may not lead to MN death. Old MNs were depleted of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs (~40% and ~45%, respectively, P < 0.01), suggestive of age-associated alterations in MN excitability. Prominent microgliosis and astrogliosis [~93% (P < 0.001) and ~100% (P < 0.0001) increase vs. adults, respectively] were found in old spinal cords, with increased density of pro-inflammatory M1 microglia and A1 astroglia (25-fold and 4-fold increase, respectively, P < 0.0001). Ageing resulted in significant reductions in the nerve conduction velocity and the compound muscle action potential amplitude (~30%, P < 0.05, vs. adults) in old distal plantar muscles. Compared with adult muscles, old muscles exhibited significantly higher numbers of both denervated and polyinnervated neuromuscular junctions, changes in fibre type composition, higher proportion of fibres showing central nuclei and lipofuscin aggregates, depletion of satellite cells, and augmented expression of different molecules related to development, plasticity, and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions, including calcitonin gene-related peptide, growth associated protein 43, agrin, fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, and transforming growth factor-ß1. Overall, these alterations occurred at varying degrees in all the muscles analysed, with no correlation between the age-related changes observed and myofiber type composition or muscle topography. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a global view of age-associated neuromuscular changes in a mouse model of ageing and help to advance understanding of contributing pathways leading to development of sarcopenia.","Blasco, Alba; Gras, Sílvia; Mòdol-Caballero, Guillem; Tarabal, Olga; Casanovas, Anna; Piedrafita, Lídia; Barranco, Alejandro; Das, Tapas; Pereira, Suzette L; Navarro, Xavier; Rueda, Ricardo; Esquerda, Josep E; Calderó, Jordi",J. cachexia sarcopenia muscle (Internet),568,16

The problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this paper, we propose two strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on estimation of the confounder. This paper extends and generalizes existing work on unmeasured confounding with a single treatment and models commonly used in bioinformatics.","Miao, Wang; Hu, Wenjie; Ogburn, Elizabeth L.; Zhou, Xiaohua",,568,24

Compared to those with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated virus-neutralizing titers and antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Age and sex played lesser roles. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks after PCR confirmation. Spike RBD and S2 and neutralizing antibodies remained detectable through 5-7 months after onset, whereas &#945;-N titers diminished. Testing 5,882 members of the local community revealed only 1 sample with seroreactivity to both RBD and S2 that lacked neutralizing antibodies. This fidelity could not be achieved with either RBD or S2 alone. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low-seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ripperger, Tyler J; Uhrlaub, Jennifer L; Watanabe, Makiko; Wong, Rachel; Castaneda, Yvonne; Pizzato, Hannah A; Thompson, Mallory R; Bradshaw, Christine; Weinkauf, Craig C; Bime, Christian; Erickson, Heidi L; Knox, Kenneth; Bixby, Billie; Parthasarathy, Sairam; Chaudhary, Sachin; Natt, Bhupinder; Cristan, Elaine; El Aini, Tammer; Rischard, Franz; Campion, Janet; Chopra, Madhav; Insel, Michael; Sam, Afshin; Knepler, James L; Capaldi, Andrew P; Spier, Catherine M; Dake, Michael D; Edwards, Taylor; Kaplan, Matthew E; Scott, Serena Jain; Hypes, Cameron; Mosier, Jarrod; Harris, David T; LaFleur, Bonnie J; Sprissler, Ryan; Nikolich-Zugich, Janko; Bhattacharya, Deepta",Immunity,568,24

This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review with meta-analysis and a sub-group comparison between severe and non-severe cases has been published. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of neurological manifestations and complications, identify the neurodiagnostic findings, and compare these aspects between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 and 22nd of April 2020. In addition, we scanned the bibliography of included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. The criteria for eligibility included studies published in English language (or translated to English), those involving patients with COVID-19 of all age groups, and reporting neurological findings. Data were extracted from eligible studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled percentages and means with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of individual studies on the summary estimate. A subgroup analysis was conducted according to severity. The main outcomes of the study were to identify the frequency and nature of neurological manifestations and complications, and the neuro-diagnostic findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 44 articles were included with a pooled sample size of 13,480 patients. The mean age was 50.3 years and 53% were males. The most common neurological manifestations were: Myalgia (22.2, 95% CI, 17.2 to 28.1%), taste impairment (19.6, 95% CI, 3.8 to 60.1%), smell impairment (18.3, 95% CI, 15.4 to 76.2%), headache (12.1, 95% CI, 9.1 to 15.8%), dizziness (11.3, 95% CI, 8.5 to 15.0%), and encephalopathy (9.4, 95% CI, 2.8 to 26.6%). Nearly 2.5% (95% CI, 1 to 6.1%) of patients had acute cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). Myalgia, elevated CK and LDH, and acute CVD were significantly more common in severe cases. Moreover, 20 case reports were assessed qualitatively, and their data presented separately. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological involvement is common in COVID-19 patients. Early recognition and vigilance of such involvement might impact their overall outcomes.","Yassin, Ahmed; Nawaiseh, Mohammed; Shaban, Ala; Alsherbini, Khalid; El-Salem, Khalid; Soudah, Ola; Abu-Rub, Mohammad",BMC Neurol,568,24

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. RESULTS: Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary. Participants who refused telematic support had a significantly shorter time interval from the last ear, nose, and throat visit than patients who accepted (57.95 vs 96.14 days, P = .03). Video-called patients showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety and depression (mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score pre- vs post-video call: 13.97 vs. 10.23, P < .0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction about the service.

Therefore and in response to a short-term shortage of PCR reagents, we evaluated DiaSorin's LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in comparison to RT-qPCR, and concerning the application of screening non-COVID-19 patients on hospital admission. Applying the manufacturer-recommended cut-off of 200 arbitrary units (AU/mL) the specificity of the LIAISON Test was 100%, the overall analytical sensitivity 40.2%. Lowering the cut-off to 100 AU/mL increased the sensitivity to 49.7% and decreased the specificity to 98.3%. Confining the analysis to samples with an RT-qPCR result < 25 Ct resulted in a sensitivity of 91.2%. The quality of the LIAISON test is very similar to that of good RATs described in the literature with the advantage of high throughput and the disadvantage of relatively long analysis time. It passes the WHO quality criteria for rapid antigen tests and is characterized by particularly high specificity. The LIAISON test can therefore be used for the same applications as recommended for RATs by the WHO.

This work discovered computational star-shaped-similar molecules exhibiting lower binding-scores (higher-affinities) to S-SLSF with probable cross-binding properties of their targeted α-helices but with lower hydrophobicities and smaller molecular sizes. Most star-shaped-similar leads contained Trihydroxyl-Triphenyls arms branching from each of the three carbons of a central Triazine core (TTT). Deconstruction of TTTs by core-replacement (X), fragment extension (F), and 2D deep-screening among millions of molecular possibilities, found additional leads that by combining structural features (F+TTX) reduced their binding-scores to S-SLSF. Such leads maximize their possibilities to stabilize wild-type S-SLSF α-helices, with the aim to reduce host-coronavirus membrane fusion using drug-like ligands rather than mutations.","julio, coll",,568,16

Materials and Methods: Monthly interventional radiology (IR) case volume was evaluated during the COVID pandemic through July 30, 2020, and was compared to monthly IR case volume during the same time period in 2019. A retrospective review of 40 patients who received percutaneous cholecystostomy tubes between March 2020 and July 2020 (first COVID pandemic peak in Boston, MA) was compared in a propensity matched controlled study. 14 COVID-positive patients were matched to 26 control patients who received a cholecystostomy tube. Outcomes such as positive cholecystostomy tube microbiology, pre-procedural ICU status, and death were evaluated. Results: During March to July 30, 2020, cholecystostomy tube placement constituted 0.43%, average 6 (range 2-10) cases/month of 1389 (range 672-1777) cases/month, whereas in the year prior for the same period it constituted 0.28%, 5.8 (range 4-8) cases/month of 2103 (range 1998-2146) cases/month. We find the average age was 66.5 ± 17.7 (SD) for COVID-negative and 66.0 ± 17.7 (SD) years for COVID-positive patients. Pre-procedure 19% (5/26) of COVID-negative patients and 50% (7/14) of COVID-positive patients were intubated at the time of placement, P = 0.04. Post-procedure, 54% (14/26) of COVID-negative patients and 50% (7/14) of COVID-positive patients had positive cholecystostomy tube fluid microbiology cultures, P = 0.82. 38% (10/26) of COVID-negative patients and 57% (8/14) of COVID-positive patients were in the ICU at the time of placement, P = 0.26. 23% (6/26) of the COVID-negative patients and 36% (5/14) of COVID-positive patients died post-procedure, P = 0.41. 15.4% (4/26) COVID-negative and 14.3% (2/14) of COVID-positive patients had any complications reported, P = 0.93. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a relative increase in the number of cholecystostomy tube referrals despite a drop in total IR case volume. There were no significant differences in post-procedure long-term outcomes and the microbial culture results in our matched control review. Our study suggests that this perceived increase in cholecystostomy tube placements is not secondary to unique COVID pathophysiology, but rather a persistent incidence of acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of chronic ICU stays seen during the COVID pandemic. With the continuation of the pandemic, cholecystostomy tube placement incidence may increase with continued COVID patient care and chronic ICU stays for these patients.","Som, A.; Reid, N.; Yeung, T.; Salamone, S.; Snyder, A.; Salazar, G.; Succi, M.; Daye, D.; Uppot, R.

Whether hospitalization rates and in-hospital mortality were affected by the pandemic in patients with acute symptomatic heart failure (HF) was investigated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Administrative data provided by 67 German Helios hospitals were examined for patients with a main discharge diagnosis of HF using ICD codes. Urgent hospital admissions per day were compared for a study period (13 March-21 May 2020) with control intervals in 2020 (1 January-12 March) and 2019 (13 March-21 May), resulting in a total of 13 484 patients excluding all patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression. Generalized linear mixed models were used for univariable and multivariable analysis to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. The number of admissions per day was lower in the study period compared to the same year [IRR 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.73, P < 0.01] and the previous year control group (IRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.76, P < 0.01). Age was similar throughout the intervals, but case severity increased in terms of distribution within New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and comorbidities. Within the study period, 30-day rates for urgent hospital readmissions were higher compared to the same year but not the previous year control group. In-hospital mortality was 7.3% in the study period, 6.1% in the same year (P = 0.03) and 6.0% in the previous year control group (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, age, NYHA class and other predictors of fatal outcome were identified but hospitalization during the study period was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a significant reduction of urgent hospital admissions for HF with increased case severity and concomitant in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Identifying causes of reduced inpatient treatment rates is essential for the understanding and valuation with regard to future optimal management of patients with HF.","König, Sebastian; Hohenstein, Sven; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",Eur. j. heart fail,568,1

The acceptance of digital tools is high, and the need is growing. OBJECTIVE: Young adults (18-40 years) confronted with a cancer diagnosis present unique needs and require special care. They often have a strong affinity and are familiar with modern technology. On that account, we implemented a web-based symptom and quality of life (QoL) assessment to address patients' attitudes and willingness to use mHealth tools. The study also aims to evaluate sociodemographic parameters that could influence patients' opinions. METHODS: A total of 380 young patients aged 18-40 treated with radiotherapy between 2002 and 2017 were included in the trial. We assessed QoL via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core 30 (EORTC C30) questionnaire and added general questions about mHealth technology. The added questions inquired patients' opinions regarding general aspects, including technical advances in medicine, mobile and app assistance during cancer treatment, data transfer, and app-specific features. The survey was conducted for 12 months. Participation was voluntary and pseudonymized; prior written consent was obtained. RESULTS: We achieved a participation rate of 57.6% (219/380) and a completion rate of 50.2% (110/219). The median age was 33 years (range 18-40). Of all participants, 89.1% (98/110) considered new technologies in medicine as positive; 10.9% (12/110) answered with neutral. Nearly all patients (96.4%, 106/110) stated that they would send further data via a web-based platform. Of all, 96.4% (106/110) considered the provided pseudonymization of their data as safe. We further asked the patients if they would use a mobile app for symptom and QoL assessment similar to the present web-based system: 74.5% (82/110) answered with yes and 25.5% (28/110) said they would not use a mobile app in the future. We tested the willingness to use an app on several sociodemographic parameters, such as age, gender, education, health insurance status, and cancer-related parameters: tumor stage, time since radiation treatment, and treatment intention. None of these parameters correlated with app use in this group of young adults. Patients who were generally positive regarding using an app rated several possible functions of a future app. The 3 most requested features were appointment reminders (89.0%, 73/82), contact overview of all involved clinics and physicians (87%, 71/82), and making an appointment via app (78%, 64/82). CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth tools should be available as an integrated part of a comprehensive cancer care approach. It provides automated, thorough documentation of health parameters during therapy and follow-up for doctors, medical staff, and tumor patients to optimize treatment. With this study, we could show that young adults are the ideal patient population to use eHealth/mHealth tools. Such tools offer further digital support and improve the patients' need for constant QoL during cancer care.","Vogel, Marco M E; Eitz, Kerstin A; Combs, Stephanie E",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,568,32

METHODS: A prospective, open-label, interventional study in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Patients in the interventional arm received subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 100 mg daily for 7 days) in addition to standard treatment. Main outcomes were need for mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included successful weaning from supplemental oxygen and change in inflammatory biomarkers. Outcomes were compared with those of historical controls who received standard treatment and supportive care. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included; 45 anakinra-treated and 24 historical controls. Need for mechanical ventilation occurred in 14 (31%) in the anakinra-treated group and 18 (75%) in the historical cohort (p < 0.001). In-hospital death occurred in 13 (29%) in the anakinra-treated group and 11 (46%) in the historical cohort (p = 0.082). Successful weaning from supplemental oxygen to ambient air was attained in 25 (63%) in the anakinra-treated compared with 6 (27%) in the historical cohort (p = 0.008). Patients who received anakinra showed significant reduction in inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and high oxygen requirement, anakinra could represent an effective treatment option and may confer clinical benefit.

Public opinion and the public's compliance with these technologies come into play here. The objective of the present study was to examine attitudes expressed in the public discourse toward the use of digital technologies to control people's behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected in the media. METHODS: Qualitative analysis was performed on posts and comments submitted in response to 12 articles that appeared on the four leading Israeli news sites, on three significant occasions: first, upon the announcement of the use of surveillance technologies by the Israeli security agency (ISA); second, upon the announcement of the launch of the Health Ministry's app that tracks contacts with COVID-19 patients; and third, following reports of petitions lodged with Israel's supreme court challenging the use of surveillance technologies. The analysis was performed using ATLAS-Ti software for systematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2551 posts and comments referring to these 12 articles were found, 714 of which were relevant to the purpose of the study. The analysis revealed disagreement between those who supported the measures taken and opponents. Supporters regarded contact tracing by means of digital technologies as essential to the effort to protect people during the pandemic, and believed that employing the ISA's capabilities was the correct way to combat the epidemic. Opponents of the measures rejected the use of tracking technologies, regarding this step as a move toward dictatorship and a violation of fundamental civil rights. Some proposed alternative measures that would obviate the use of such tracking. CONCLUSIONS: The primary task of medical practice is to heal illness and alleviate suffering. The debate surrounding the employment of digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the complexity of the close connection between social control and care in times of pandemic. The context of this pandemic has highlighted the interrelatedness of advanced digital surveillance technologies, medical care, and social control exercised by authorities and medical regulators and experts, which raises issues of transparency, trust and mistrust among the public. These issues become all the more relevant when the number of patients grows rapidly, the authorities need to deal with the extended ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country has entered a second lockdown, and the public must be persuaded to comply with highly restrictive regulations. Recommendations to policy makers, practical implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed.","Keshet, Yael",Isr J Health Policy Res,568,20

This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. METHOD: Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. RESULTS: Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores;anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","Önen Sertöz, Ö Kuman Tunçel Ö Sertöz N.; Hepdurgun, C.; Iacute,; şman Haznedaroğlu, D.; Bor, C.",Turk Psikiyatri Derg,568,1

Multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is a frailty assessment tool widely used for stratifying prognosis in older people, but data regarding inpatients, affected by COVID-19, are not available. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether MPI can predict in-hospital mortality and the admission to intensive care unit (ICU) in older inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this longitudinal, Italian, multi-center study, older patients with COVID-19 were included. MPI was calculated using eight different domains typical of comprehensive geriatric assessment and categorized in three groups (MPI 1 &#8804; 0.33, MPI 2 0.34-0.66, MPI 3 > 0.66). A multivariable Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: 227 older patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (mean age: 80.5 years, 59% females). Inpatients in the MPI 3 were subjected less frequently than those in the MPI 1 to non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In the multivariable analysis, people in MPI 3 experienced a higher risk of in hospital mortality (HR = 6.30, 95%CI: 1.44-27.61), compared to MPI 1. The accuracy of MPI in predicting in hospital mortality was good (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68-0.83). People in MPI 3 experienced a significant longer length of stay (LOS) in hospital compared to other participants. No association between MPI and ICU admission was found. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty- as assessed by high MPI score - was associated with a significant higher risk of in-hospital mortality, longer LOS, and lower use NIV, whilst the association with ICU admission was not significant. These findings suggest that prognostic stratification by using the MPI could be useful in clinical decision making in older inpatients affected by COVID-19.","Pilotto, Alberto; Azzini, Margherita; Cella, Alberto; Cenderello, Giovanni; Castagna, Alberto; Pilotto, Andrea; Custureri, Romina; Dini, Simone; Farinella, Sara Tita; Ruotolo, Giovanni; Padovani, Alessandro; Custodero, Carlo; Veronese, Nicola",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,568,26

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (nâ =â 16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (nâ =â 130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity were associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.386; Pâ <â .001) than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.211; Pâ =â .026).

There is an urgent need to develop new and safer drugs for these diseases. Protein kinases are a potential class of targets for developing new drugs against NTDs, since they play crucial role in many biological processes, such as signaling pathways, regulating cellular communication, division, metabolism and death. Bioinformatics is a field that aims to organize large amounts of biological data as well as develop and use tools for understanding and analyze them in order to produce meaningful information in a biological manner. In combination with chemogenomics, which analyzes chemical-biological interactions to screen ligands against selected targets families, these approaches can be used to stablish a rational strategy for prioritizing new drug targets for NTDs. Here, we describe how bioinformatics and chemogenomics tools can help to identify protein kinases and their potential inhibitors for the development of new drugs for NTDs. We present a review of bioinformatics tools and techniques that can be used to define an organisms kinome for drug prioritization, drug and target repurposing, multi-quinase inhibition approachs and selectivity profiling.

Early diagnosis of the virus is of great significance for both of infected patients and doctors providing treatments. Chest Computerized tomography (CT) screening is one of the most straightforward techniques to detect pneumonia which was caused by the virus and thus to make the diagnosis. To facilitate the process of diagnosing COVID-19, we therefore developed a graph convolutional neural network ResGNet-C under ResGNet framework to automatically classify lung CT images into normal and confirmed pneumonia caused by COVID-19. In ResGNet-C, two by-products named NNet-C, ResNet101-C that showed high performance on detection of COVID-19 are simultaneously generated as well. Our best model ResGNet-C achieved an averaged accuracy at 0.9662 with an averaged sensitivity at 0.9733 and an averaged specificity at 0.9591 using five cross-validations on the dataset, which is comprised of 296 CT images. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating graph knowledge into the COVID-19 classification task. Graphs are constructed according to the Euclidean distance between features extracted by our proposed ResNet101-C and then are encoded with the features to give the prediction results of CT images. Besides the high-performance system, which surpassed all state-of-the-art methods, our proposed graph construction method is simple, transferrable yet quite helpful for improving the performance of classifiers, as can be justified by the experimental results.","Yu, Xiang; Lu, Siyuan; Guo, Lili; Wang, Shui-Hua; Zhang, Yu-Dong",,568,6

The majority of COVID-19 patients either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Yet, about 15% of the cases experience severe complications and require intensive care. Factors determining disease severity are not yet fully characterized. Aim: Here, we investigated the within-host virus diversity in COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. Methods: We compared SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity in 19 mild and 27 severe cases. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal samples and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This was followed by deep-sequencing analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at both consensus and sub-consensus sequence levels. Results: Consensus sequences of all viruses were very similar, showing more than 99.8% sequence identity regardless of the disease severity. However, the sub-consensus analysis revealed significant differences in within-host diversity between mild and severe cases. Patients with severe symptoms exhibited a significantly (p-value 0.001) higher number of variants in coding and non-coding regions compared to mild cases. Analysis also revealed higher prevalence of some variants among severe cases. Most importantly, severe cases exhibited significantly higher within-host diversity (mean = 13) compared to mild cases (mean = 6). Further, higher within-host diversity was observed in patients above the age of 60 compared to the younger age group. Conclusion: These observations provided evidence that within-host diversity might play a role in the development of severe disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients; however, further investigations are required to elucidate this association.","Al Khatib, Hebah A; Benslimane, Fatiha M; Elbashir, Israa E; Coyle, Peter V; Al Maslamani, Muna A; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Yassine, Hadi M",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,568,33

They have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths; Covid patients eighty years or older on ventilators had fatality rates higher than 90 percent. How could we have better protected older adults? Both the popular press and government entities blamed nursing homes, labeling them ""snake pits"" and imposing harsh fines and arduous new regulations. We argue that this approach is unlikely to improve protections for older adults. Rather than focusing exclusively on acute and critical resources, including ventilators, a plan that respected the best interests of older adults would have also supported nursing homes, a critical part of the health care system. Better access to protective equipment for staff members, early testing of staff members and patients, and enhanced means of communication with families were what was needed. These preventive measures would have offered greater benefit to the oldest members of our population than the exclusive focus on acute care.","Powell, Tia; Bellin, Eran; Ehrlich, Amy R",Hastings Cent Rep,568,1

Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In any case, AIT is likely to be beneficial for the patient with allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as controlling allergic diseases leads to a reduced need for contact with healthcare professionals. The authors remind the reader that everything in this article is still theoretical, since at the moment, there are no published clinical trials on the outcome of COVID-19 in allergic patients under AIT.","Larenas-Linnemann, Désirée E; Ortega-Martell, José A; Blandón-Vijil, María V; Rodríguez-Pérez, Noel; Luna-Pech, Jorge A; Estrada-Cardona, Alan; Arias-Cruz, Alfredo; Del Rio-Navarro, Blanca E; Rodríguez, Elsy M Navarrete; Pozo-Beltrán, Cesar F; Takane, Ernesto Onuma; Rojo-Gutiérrez, María I; Espinosa-Rosales, Francisco J; Martínez-Infante, Eric A",Allergy Asthma Proc,568,1

Therefore, understanding the dynamics of transmission is very important. In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model has been formulated, analyzed, and validated using incident data from West Java Province, Indonesia. The model made considers the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments and decreased immunity. The model is formulated in the form of a system of differential equations, where the population is divided into seven compartments, namely Susceptible Population (S0), Exposed Population (E), Asymptomatic Infection Population (IA), Symptomatic Infection Population (YS), Recovered Population (Z), Susceptible Populations previously infected (Z0), and Quarantine population (Q). The results show that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 in West Java Province, Indonesia. This can be seen from the basic reproduction number of this model, which is 3.180126127 (R0&gt;1). Also, the numerical simulation results show that waning immunity can increase the occurrence of outbreaks;and a period of isolation can slow down the process of spreading COVID-19. So if a strict social distancing policy is enforced like a quarantine, the outbreak will lessen.","Anggriani, Nursanti Ndii Meksianis Z.; Amelia, Rika Suryaningrat Wahyu Aji Pratama Mochammad Andhika",Alexandria Engineering Journal,568,1

A descriptive epidemiological study was conducted using data on the number of deaths by suicide published by the National Police Agency. The suicide rate ratio during the crisis-the monthly suicide mortality rate in the year of the crisis divided by the average suicide mortality rate in the three years before the crisis-was used as the indicator. After the earthquake, in March 2011 the suicide rate was 18% lower than the average mortality rate for the previous three years. However, it increased by 18% in May and 8% in June; increased mortality was observed among women. The suicide rate began to decline after October 2011. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the suicide rate decreased from February to June 2020. The declines in April and May were significant at 20% and 18%, respectively. From July onwards, the suicide rate of women began to rise, and from October, the overall suicide also began to increase. The rise in female suicide rates was significant, especially in October, with an increase of 70%. Thus, during these crises, suicide rates fell temporarily but then rose, especially among women. The period of increase in suicide rates was longer during the COVID-19 pandemic than after the earthquake. Therefore, there is an urgent need to promote measures for suicide prevention currently, and during a future crisis.","Osaki, Yoneatsu; Otsuki, Hitoshi; Imamoto, Aya; Kinjo, Aya; Fujii, Maya; Kuwabara, Yuki; Kondo, Yoko; Suyama, Yoshiko",J Psychiatr Res,568,1

METHODS: We updated our systematic dataset, collected individual case characteristics, and conducted stratified analyses of SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) across COVID-19 severity, sex, and age groups (aged 0–17 years, 18–59 years, and 60 years or older). RESULTS: The systematic dataset included 1266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19. Our analyses indicated that high, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in adults. Severe cases tended to show slightly higher URT shedding post-symptom onset, but similar rates of viral clearance, when compared to nonsevere infections. After stratifying for disease severity, sex and age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of respiratory shedding. The estimated accuracy for using LRT shedding as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 severity was up to 81%, whereas it was up to 65% for URT shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Virological factors, especially in the LRT, facilitate the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Disease severity, rather than sex or age, predicts SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. LRT viral load may prognosticate COVID-19 severity in patients before the timing of deterioration and should do so more accurately than URT viral load.

Mosquito control programs are the first line of defense against mosquito-borne pathogens. The purpose of this study was to examine the capabilities of Florida mosquito programs to implement key mosquito measures during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: Using a self-administered online survey, we examined the capabilities of all Florida mosquito control programs (both state-approved mosquito districts, N = 63; and open programs, N = 27) at a time when the state of Florida was still under heightened awareness of, stay-at-home orders and planning a phase 1 reopening over the COVID-19 pandemic (June to July 2020). The final sample included mosquito control programs structured as the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) (n = 42), independent tax district (n = 16), municipal (n = 10), and health or emergency department (n = 5). We used descriptive statistics to summarize information about the characteristics of responding programs, their implemented mosquito control and surveillance activities. wWe used bivariate analysis to compare the characteristics of responding programs and the self-reported mosquito measures. RESULTS: Of the recruited mosquito control programs, 73 completed the survey (81.1% response rate; 73/90). Of these, 57.5% (n = 42) were Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) mosquito control programs, 21.9% (n = 16) were independent tax district programs, 13.7% (n = 10) were municipal mosquito control programs, and only 6.8% (n = 5) were either health or emergency department mosquito control programs. Except for arbovirus surveillance, most programs either fully or partially performed larval (61.8%) and adult (78.9%) surveillance; most programs conducted species-specific control for Aedes aegypti (85.2%, n = 54), Aedes albopictus (87.3%, n = 55), Culex quinquefasciatus (92.1%, n = 58), and Culex nigripalpus (91.9%, n = 57). CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance of ongoing mosquito control activities, and suggest that Florida mosquito control programs are vigilant and have significant capability to handle potential mosquito-borne disease threats, but arbovirus surveillance systems (laboratory testing of mosquito pools and testing of human and nonhuman specimens for arboviruses) are needed during pandemics as well.","Moise, Imelda K.; Ortiz-Whittingham, Lola R.; Omachonu, Vincent; Clark, Marah; Xue, Rui-De",BMC Public Health,568,16

Evidence-based hypertension management guidelines advocate self-measured BP (SMBP), but widespread implementation of SMBP is lacking. The purpose of this study was to describe the perspective of primary care physicians (PCPs) on SMBP to identify the barriers and facilitators for implementing SMBP. METHODS: We collected data from PCPs from a large health system using semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Responses were recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed into three overarching TDF domains based on the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW): 1) Motivation 2) Opportunity and 3) Capabilities. The sample size was based on theme saturation. RESULTS: All 17 participating PCPs believed that SMBP is a useful, but underutilized tool. Although individual practices varied, most physicians felt that the increased data points from SMBP allowed for better hypertension management. Most felt that overcoming existing barriers would be difficult, but identified several facilitators: physician support of SMBP, the possibility of having other trained health professionals to assist with SMBP and patient education; improving patient engagement and empowerment with SMBP, and the interest of the health system in using technology to improve hypertension management. CONCLUSION: PCPs believe that SMBP can improve hypertension management. There are numerous barriers and facilitators for implementing SMBP. Successful implementation in clinical practice will require implementation strategies targeted at increasing patient acceptability and reducing physician workload. This may need a radical change in the current methods of managing hypertension.","Gondi, Saahith; Ellis, Shellie; Gupta, Mallika; Ellerbeck, Edward; Richter, Kimber; Burns, Jeffrey; Gupta, Aditi",PLoS One,568,1

We evaluated the sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in samples from a diverse cross-section of patients across multiple sites and compared results against commercially available comparators. Methods: Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual single and sequential serum and plasma samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and method comparisons performed versus the following comparator assays: Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens ADVIA Centaur SARS-CoV-2 Total, and YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Results: Overall sensitivity for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 219 samples drawn [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation was 93.6% (95% CI 89.5-96.5). Across the three study sites, sensitivity in samples drawn [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation ranged from 85.7-98.9%. Sensitivity was significantly higher for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay compared with the YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay for samples drawn [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation (86.3% [95% CI 76.7-92.9] versus 33.8% [95% CI 23.6-45.2]). Both Siemens ADVIA Centaur SARS-CoV-2 Total and YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays had a significantly higher sensitivity compared with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay for samples drawn [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation (95.1% [95% CI 87.8-98.6] versus 85.2% [95% CI 75.6-92.1]; 93.8% [95% CI 86.0-97.9] versus 86.3% [95% CI 76.7-92.9]). Differences in sensitivity between the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay and the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (90.3% [95% CI 83.7-94.9] versus 95.2% [95% CI 89.8-98.2]) and Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG (84.8% [95% CI 75.0-91.9] versus 87.3% [95% CI 78.0-93.8]) assays for samples drawn [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation were not significant. Conclusions: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated high sensitivity in samples collected [≥]14 days post-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and comparable sensitivity to several commercially available comparator assays across multiple sites, supporting the use of this assay as a tool to aid in determination of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Hegel, J.

The rise and decline of civilizations in history is well documented, yet oddly ignored in today’s dialogue. Contemporary civilization is assumed to be immune from forces that shaped cycles of past civilizations—that our age is somehow an exception. For the first time in human history planetary systems that seemed invisible until recently are sending us the message that our civilization is not exceptional, that there are finite limits to the thrust of humanity’s present trajectory.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A single sentinel practice serving 22 829 people in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein. PARTICIPANTS: All 73 patients presenting with mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. INTERVENTION: Nasopharyngeal sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared RT-qPCR at presentation with confirmed antibody status. We split the outbreak in two parts, by halving the period from the first to the last case, to characterise three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: early acute (RT-qPCR reactive) in the first half; and late acute (reactive) and late convalescent (non-reactive) in the second half. For each cohort, we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-qPCR, the duration and variety of symptoms, and the number of viral clades present. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (eight early acute, seven late acute and seven late convalescent), 44 patients tested SARS-CoV-2 negative and 7 were excluded. The sensitivity of RT-qPCR was 100% among all acute cases, dropping to 68.1% when including convalescent. Test specificity was 100%. Mean duration of symptoms for each group were 2 days (range 1–4) among early acute, 4.4 days (1–7) among late acute and 8 days (2–12) among late convalescent. Confirmed infection was associated with loss of taste. Acute infection was associated with loss of taste, nausea/vomiting, breathlessness, sore throat and myalgia; but not anosmia, fever or cough. Transmission clusters of three viral clades (G, GR and L) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: RT-qPCR testing in primary care can rapidly and accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 among people with flu-like illness in a heterogeneous viral outbreak. Targeted testing in primary care can support national sentinel surveillance of COVID-19.","Leber, Werner; Lammel, Oliver; Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Mustafa-Korninger, Maria Elisabeth; Glehr, Reingard Christina; Camp, Jeremy; Agerer, Benedikt; Lercher, Alexander; Popa, Alexandra; Genger, Jakob-Wendelin; Penz, Thomas; Aberle, Stephan; Bock, Christoph; Bergthaler, Andreas; Stiasny, Karin; Hochstrasser, Eva-Maria; Hoellinger, Christian; Siebenhofer, Andrea; Griffiths, Chris; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina",BMJ Open,568,21

Currently, there is some information on the consequences of COVID-19 infection in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as it is a newly discovered coronavirus, but its far-reaching effects on participation in neurodegenerative diseases seem to be significant. Recent cases reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for initiating the demyelination process in people who previously had no symptoms associated with any nervous system disorders. It is presently known that infection of SARS-CoV-2 evokes cytokine storm syndrome, which may be one of the factors leading to the acute cerebrovascular disease. One of the substantial problems is the coexistence of cerebrovascular disease and MS in an individual’s life span. Epidemiological studies showed an enhanced risk of death rate from vascular disabilities in MS patients of approximately 30%. It has been demonstrated that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection usually show increased levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and overactivation of blood platelets, which are essential elements of prothrombotic events.

We aimed to evaluate risk factors associated with AKI beyond COVID-19 severity. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between risk factors and AKI (based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). Dominance analysis was performed to evaluate the relative importance of individual factors. RESULTS: Seven hundred seven patients were included. Median age was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 29–57) and 57% were male with few comorbidities (93%, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] <1). AKI occurred in 57 patients (8.1%); 39 were in AKI stage 1 (68%), 9 in stage 2 (16%), and 9 in stage 3 (16%). Older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.07), baseline use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (aOR 2.86; 95% CI: 1.20–6.83), exposure to vancomycin (aOR 5.84; 95% CI: 2.10–16.19), use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aOR 3.04; 95% CI: 1.15–8.05), and severe COVID-19 with hypoxia (aOR 13.94; 95% CI: 6.07–31.98) were associated with AKI in the multivariable logistic regression model. The 3 highest ranked predictors were severe COVID-19 with hypoxia, vancomycin exposure, and age, accounting for 79.6% of the predicted variance (41.6, 23.1, and 14.9%, respectively) on dominance analysis. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 is independently associated with increased risk of AKI beyond premorbid conditions and age. Appropriate avoidance of vancomycin and NSAIDs are potentially modifiable means to prevent AKI in patients with COVID-19.","See, Yong Pey; Young, Barnaby Edward; Ang, Li Wei; Ooi, Xi Yan; Chan, Chi Peng; Looi, Wan Limm; Yeo, See Cheng; Lye, David Chien",Nephron Clin Pract,568,1

Evidence of the effects of reconfiguration is important for local communities and commissioners and providers of health services. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the evidence regarding effects of service reconfigurations that increase the time/distance for some patients to reach an urgent and emergency care (UEC) facility. We searched seven bibliographic databases from 2000 to February 2019 and used citation tracking and reference lists to identify additional studies. We included studies of any design that compared outcomes for people with conditions requiring emergency treatment before and after service reconfiguration with an associated change in travel time/distance to access UEC. Studies had to be conducted in the UK or other developed countries. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for quasi-experimental studies) were undertaken by a single reviewer with a sample checked for accuracy and consistency. We performed a narrative synthesis of the included studies. Overall strength of evidence was assessed using a previously published method that considers volume, quality and consistency. RESULTS: We included 12 studies, of which six were conducted in the USA, two in the UK and four in other European countries. The studies used a variety of observational designs, with before–after and cohort designs being most common. Only two studies included an independent control site/sites where no reconfiguration had taken place. The reconfigurations evaluated in these studies reported relatively small effects on average travel times/distance. DISCUSSION: For studies of general UEC populations, there was no convincing evidence as to whether reconfiguration affected mortality risk. However, evidence of increased risk was identified from studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly 1 to 4 years after reconfiguration. Evidence for other conditions was inconsistent or very limited. CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence to determine whether increased distance to UEC increases mortality risk for the general population of people requiring UEC, although this conclusion may not extend to people with specific conditions.","Chambers, Duncan; Cantrell, Anna; Baxter, Susan; Turner, Janette; Booth, Andrew",BMC Med,568,24

Inflammation and cardiac injury are commonly observed in these cases. However, the association between the hyper-inflammatory response and cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: The study was designed based on severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19. Information on demographics and baseline clinical characteristics as well as laboratory examinations were collected from the electronic medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 32.4% (n = 107) of patients presenting with cardiac injury. The median age was 67 years, and 48.8% (n = 161) of patients were men. Hypertension was the most common in 161 (48.8%) patients, followed by diabetes (16.7%, n = 55) and coronary heart disease (13.3%, n = 44). Moreover, compared to cases without cardiac injury, those with cardiac injury were older, had higher proportions of coronary heart disease, had significantly elevated leukocyte counts and concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, and IL-8, but lower lymphocyte counts. A significant positive correlation was observed between high-sensitivity troponin I and hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-2R, IL-6 and IL-8. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 were independent risk factors for cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory cytokines were associated with cardiac injury among severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19, suggesting that hyper-inflammatory response may involve in cardiac injury.","Xia, Guozhi; Fan, Di; Ma, Chaoran; He, Yanru; Wang, Ming; Zhu, Yaowu; Zheng, Qiangsun",Am J Med Sci,568,26

We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. METHODS: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. RESULTS: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 164 (16.0%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed to definitive disposition. 70/164 patients (42.7%) had died and 94/164 (57.3%) were still alive. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001) and had a higher initial d-dimer (2.22 vs. 1.31, p = 0.005) and peak ferritin levels (2998 vs. 2077, p = 0.016) compared to survivors. 84.3% of patients over 70 years old died in the hospital. Conversely, 67.4% of patients age 70 or younger survived to hospital discharge. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. CONCLUSION: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","King, Christopher S.; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Brown, A.

METHODS: All presentations to University Hospital Galway with self-harm were assessed during the peak period of the coronavirus crisis in Ireland, over the 3 months from 1 March to 31 May 2020. These data were compared with presentations in the same months in the 3 years preceding (2017–2019). Data were obtained from the anonymised service database. RESULTS: This study found that in 2020, the rate of presentation with self-harm dropped by 35% from March to April and rose by 104% from April to May, peaking from mid-May. When trends over a 4-year period were examined, there was a significantly higher lethality of attempt (p < 0.001), and significant differences in diagnosis (p = 0.031) in 2020 in comparison with the three previous years. The increased lethality of presentations remained significant after age and gender were controlled for (p = 0.036). There were also significant differences in the underlying psychiatric diagnoses (p = 0.018), notably with a significant increase in substance misuse disorders presenting during the 2020 study period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed a reduction in self-harm presentations initially, followed by a sharp increase in May 2020. If a period of economic instability follows as predicted, it is likely that this will further impact the mental health of the population, along with rates of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. There is a need for research into the longer-term effect of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions, especially with respect to self-harm.","McIntyre, A.; Tong, K.; McMahon, E.; Doherty, A.

The enriched-Leishmune(®) vaccine was injected on month 6, 7 and 8 after infection, when animals were seropositive and symptomatic. The control group were injected with a saline solution. Leishmune(®)-treated dogs showed significantly higher levels of anti-FML IgG antibodies (ANOVA; p < 0.0001), a higher and stable IgG2 and a decreasing IgG1 response, pointing to a TH1 T cell mediated response. The vaccine had the following effects: it led to more positive delayed type hypersensitivity reactions against Leishmania lysate in vaccinated dogs (75%) than in controls (50%), to a decreased average of CD4+ Leishmania-specific lymphocytes in saline controls (32.13%) that fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the vaccinees (41.62%, CI95% 43.93–49.80) and an increased average of the clinical scores from the saline controls (17.83) that falls outside the 95% confidence interval for the Leishmune(®) immunotherapy-treated dogs (15.75, CI95% 13.97–17.53). All dogs that received the vaccine were clustered, and showed lower clinical scores and normal CD4+ counts, whereas 42% of the untreated dogs showed very diminished CD4+ and higher clinical score. The increase in clinical signs of the saline treated group was correlated with an increase in anti-FML antibodies (p < 0.0001), the parasitological evidence (p = 0.038) and a decrease in Leishmania-specific CD4+ lymphocyte proportions (p = 0.035). These results confirm the immunotherapeutic potential of the enriched-Leishmune(®) vaccine. The vaccine reduced the clinical symptoms and evidence of parasite, modulating the outcome of the infection and the dog's potential infectiosity to phlebotomines. The enriched-Leishmune(®) vaccine was subjected to a safety analysis and found to be well tolerated and safe.","Santos, F.N.; Borja-Cabrera, G.P.; Miyashiro, L.M.; Grechi, J.; Reis, A.B.; Moreira, M.A.B.; Martins Filho, O.A.; Luvizotto, M.C.R.; Menz, I.; Pessôa, L.M.; Gonçalves, P.R.; Palatnik, M.; Palatnik-de-Sousa, C.B.",Vaccine,568,24

METHODS: A thorough search on major online databases was done for studies describing the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We used random-effects model to compute pooled estimates for critical or fatal disease. RESULTS: A total of 20,475 patients from 33 eligible studies were included. Maximum risk of development of critical or fatal COVID-19 disease was seen in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease [OR: 3.44, 95% CI: 2.65–4.48] followed by chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Of the total cases, 64% had one of the four comorbidities with the most prevalent being hypertension with a pooled prevalence of 27%. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus led to a higher risk of development of critical or fatal COVID-19 disease, with maximum risk seen with underlying cardiovascular disease.","Sahni, Shubham; Gupta, Gaurav; Sarda, Radhika; Pandey, Shivam; Pandey, R.M.; Sinha, Sanjeev",Diabetes Metab Syndr,568,20

RESULTS: A total of 148 MS patients with an average age of 35.73 years completed the questionnaire. The most important concern of the participants was “a high prevalence of COVID-19” following by the “MS symptoms worsening”. Many participants (35%) believed that, if they catch COVID-19 they will be cured. However, the treatment will take more time for them in comparison with the general population. About 39.8% of the patients stated that COVID-19 infection does not affect the MS symptom, but others noted that, it can cause relapse (30.8%) or worsen MS symptoms (29.3%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that MS patients are more anxious about the effects of COVID-19 on their underlying disease rather than the infection itself.","Rezaeimanesh, Nasim; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Naser Moghadasi, Abdorreza",Basic Clin Neurosci,568,1

PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins do not exist in viral proteins. Molecular-docking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein that was validated using NMR spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic α-helix that also functions in RNA binding. Broad PIP-binding activity was observed in solution using a fluorescence polarization assay or in the context of a lipid bilayer using an on-chip, fluorescence assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 3C protein-membrane interface revealed PIP clustering and perhaps PIP-dependent conformations. PIP clustering was mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses.","Shengjuler, Djoshkun; Chan, Yan Mei; Sun, Simou; Moustafa, Ibrahim M.; Li, Zhen-Lu; Gohara, David W.; Buck, Matthias; Cremer, Paul S.; Boehr, David D.; Cameron, Craig E.",Structure,568,1

LOCAL PROBLEM In response to critical needs of patients with COVID-19 and the threat of nurse burnout, a special operations team comprising physical and occupational therapists was convened to (1) provide help to intensive care unit nurses, (2) help therapists be productive, and (3) use therapists' specialties for critical patients. METHODS Two therapists teamed up each shift to work with every critical patient with COVID-19, performing numerous nursing and therapy activities. Activity frequency was documented by the therapists daily, and duration was estimated and data were summarized by nursing leadership. RESULTS During the 9-week program, 35 critical patients with COVID-19 were included in the special operations program. During the program, the teams performed 10 activities, including prone positioning, turning, and mobilization, 1937 times with the patients with COVID-19. The partnership saved between 5 and 40 minutes of intensive care nurse time per activity, which resulted in a total of 677.2 hours of nursing time saved. DISCUSSION Implementation of the special operations program had a positive impact on patients, nurses, and therapists. Patients benefited both clinically and socially from additional time with special operations teams. Nurses benefited from having help caring for critical patients, and therapists benefited from increased productivity during redeployment. CONCLUSION Deployment of nonnursing clinical staff could be an effective strategy to leverage available resources while maintaining clinical standards of care and reducing nursing burden during a pandemic or crisis surge.","Reese, Sara M; Johnson, Jennifer; Edwards, Jennifer; Oliveti, Michelle; Buszkiewic, Susan",Critical care nurse,568,24

The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature and compare the performance of prototype and commercial test strips with a meta-analysis. A systematic literature search of electronic databases PubMed (MEDLINE) and Cochrane Library was performed. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using the Chi-squared test and the I (2) index. A random effects model was used to pool data to compare the performance of prototype and commercial test strips. Using PRISMA reporting guidelines, four of 1,081 publications were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis: three reporting on prototype (DXI n = 658, DTI n = 586) and one on commercial test strips (DXI n = 451, DTI n = 429). Sensitivity and specificity of DXI and DTI detection did not differ significantly between the prototype and commercial test strips. Odds ratios were 0.718 and 0.365 for sensitivity and 1.211 and 1.072 for specificity of DXI and DTI (p-values between 0.3334 and 1.000), respectively.

Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (>14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW >14.5% vs ≤14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.","Foy, Brody H.; Carlson, Jonathan C.

For college students, web-based physical education is a challenge, as these course are normally offered outdoors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use data from a web-based survey to evaluate the relationship between the mental health status of college students and their sports-related lifestyles. Problems related to web-based physical education were also examined. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8 to 11, 2020. Demographic data, mental health status, and sports-related lifestyles of college students in Wuhan as well as issues related to web-based physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of the DASS-21 subscales (2.46 for depression, 1.48 for anxiety, and 2.59 for stress) were significantly lower in our study than in a previous study (P<.05). Lower DASS-21 scores were significantly correlated with regular exercise, maintaining exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration >1 hour, and >2000 pedometer steps (all P<.05). None of the three forms of web-based physical education was preferred by more than 50% of respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087/1607 students (67.6%). Shape-up exercises (846/1607, 52.6%), a designed combination of exercises (710/1607, 44.2%), and Chinese kung fu (559/1607, 34.8%) were suggested sports for web-based physical education. CONCLUSIONS: Mental status was significantly correlated with regular exercise and sufficient exercise duration. Professional physical guidance is needed for college students in selected sports. Exercises not meeting students’ preferences, frequent technical problems, and the distant interaction involved in web-based physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future.","Deng, Cheng-Hu; Wang, Jing-Qiang; Zhu, Li-Ming; Liu, He-Wang; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xue-Hua; Shao, Jian-Bo; Xia, Wei",J Med Internet Res,568,1

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these restricted conditions on the activity of the Poison Control Center (PCC) of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital-Sapienza University of Rome. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of calls received by the PCC during the lockdown period March 9, 2020 through May 31, 2020 compared to the same time period in year 2019 (reference). RESULTS: We observed a reduction in calls from hospitals and emergency departments and an increase in calls from private citizens about exposures to products or intoxications during the lockdown. There were increases in unintentional exposures and exposures to hand and surface sanitizers among household and cleaning products. There was a decrease in calls concerning medications, which were mostly from hospitals and emergency departments. We observed increases in exposures requiring clinical observations among adults and referral to the emergency department among pre-school children. CONCLUSIONS: Public health protection measures against COVID-19 to improve hygiene and maintain clean environments can increase exposures to hazardous products in the domestic environment. We observed an increase in unintentional exposures to household and cleaning products during the lockdown and an increase in ED referrals for pre-school children compared to the previous year. Our data suggest the need for improvements in public campaigns that promote safer handling of household products and prevent unnecessary exposures during a lockdown. The public health promotion activity can benefit the community after the pandemic and prepare the community for lockdowns in the future.","Milella, Michele Stanislaw; Boldrini, Paolo; Vivino, Gabriella; Grassi, Maria Caterina",J Med Toxicol,568,3

As some AgPOCTs have become available, interest is growing in their utility and performance. Here we aimed to compare the analytical sensitivity and specificity of seven commercially available AgPOCT devices. METHODS: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we compared AgPOCT products from seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab), the Coris BioConcept COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the nal von minden NADAL COVID-19 Ag Test, and the Roche-SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results. FINDINGS: In 138 clinical samples with quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, the 95% limit of detection (concentration at which 95% of test results were positive) in six of seven AgPOCT products ranged between 2·07 × 10(6) and 2·86 × 10(7) copies per swab, with an outlier (RapiGEN) at 1·57 × 10(10) copies per swab. The assays showed no cross-reactivity towards cell culture or tissue culture supernatants containing any of the four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV‑229E, HCoV‑NL63, HCoV‑OC43, or HCoV‑HKU1) or MERS-CoV, with the exception of the Healgen assay in one repeat test on HCoV-HKU1 supernatant. SARS-CoV was cross-detected by all assays. Cumulative specificities among stored clinical samples with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=100) and self-samples from healthy volunteers (n=35; cumulative sample n=135) ranged between 98·5% (95% CI 94·2–99·7) and 100·0% (97·2–100·0) in five products, with two outliers at 94·8% (89·2–97·7; R-Biopharm) and 88·9% (82·1–93·4; Healgen). False-positive results did not appear to be associated with any specific respiratory pathogen. INTERPRETATION: The sensitivity range of most AgPOCTs overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads typically observed in the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in most patients. The AgPOCTs with limit of detections that approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious might enable shortcuts in decision making in various areas of health care and public health.

The participants included 325 native and 325 non-native Chinese-speaking pre-service CSL/CFL teachers registered in the Masters in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (MTCSOL) programs; the teachers were asked to complete a 24-item questionnaire. Two major findings emerged. First, a similar six-factor teacher motivation was observed for both the native and non-native teachers. Second, the two groups showed non-significant differences in their ratings of the importance of cross-cultural value, intrinsic value, altruistic value, and fallback career choice as types of motivation but differed significantly in their ratings of extrinsic value and social influence. These results highlight the differences and similarities in the motivation of the second language teacher and offer insights into the variables at different levels that might influence the motivation of the second language teacher.

A total of 1413 people (729 students, aged between 11 and 17 years old, and one of their parents) participated in this study. Youths who engaged in ECAs spent significantly less time per week on EM and perceived that the use of EM devices had less of a negative impact. When parents and their children presented a congruent notion of how much time youth spent on EM, parents perceived EM to have less of a negative impact on their children compared to dyads with discrepant assessments. The hierarchical regression results indicated that regardless of time spent per week on EM, engaging in ECAs was a significant predictor of perceiving a less negative impact, playing a role as a protective factor regarding the use of EM. The ubiquity of EM reinforces the importance of the focus of this study, and its results contribute to creating specific guidelines for parental education and educational policies.","Campos, Luísa; Veríssimo, Lurdes; Nobre, Bárbara; Morais, Catarina; Dias, Pedro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,568,24

RESULTS: Five studies have been included documenting the experience of 125 adult individuals. A total of 16 codes emerged: in the meta‐summary, the most and least frequent codes were “Thinking about quarantine” (80%) and “Emotional roller coaster,” “Being alert for any symptom,” “Trusting or not?,” “Knowing who brought the infection,” and “Living in a surreal world” (20%). The codes which emerged were categorized into three main themes which summarized the whole experience of being placed in quarantine: (a) “Being swamped with a thousand emotions”; (b) “Being restrained”; and (c) “Needing to be considered.” CONCLUSIONS: The experience of quarantine for people is a long journey which can feel chaotic due to uncertainty about the consequences on health, work, and the future. The findings of this study can help nurses in caring for quarantined individuals by enabling them to understand people's need for educational and emotional support. Ensuring the supply of consistent information is also important to increase people's compliance.","Basso, Martina; Visintini, Erica; Achil, Illarj; Fabris, Stefano; Mattiussi, Elisa; Danielis, Matteo; Palese, Alvisa",Public Health Nurs,568,20
680158,680158,680158,The Disappearing Pre-FOMC Announcement Drift(),16.67594,1.0031114,2020-09-30,"AIMS: Current guidelines consider analyses of joint aspirates, including leucocyte cell count (LC) and polymorphonuclear percentage (PMN%) as a diagnostic mainstay of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). It is unclear if these parameters are subject to a certain degree of variability over time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the variation of LC and PMN% in patients with aseptic revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-centre study of 40 patients with 40 knee joints. Patients underwent joint aspiration at two different time points with a maximum period of 120 days in between these interventions and without any events such as other joint aspirations or surgeries. The main indications for TKA revision surgery were aseptic implant loosening (n = 24) and joint instability (n = 11). RESULTS: Overall, 80 synovial fluid samples of 40 patients were analyzed. The average time period between the joint aspirations was 50 days (SD 32). There was a significantly higher percentage change in LC when compared to PMN% (44.1% (SD 28.6%) vs 27.3% (SD 23.7%); p = 0.003). When applying standard definition criteria, LC counts were found to skip back and forth between the two time points with exceeding the thresholds in up to 20% of cases, which was significantly more compared to PMN% for the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) criteria (p = 0.001), as well as for Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: LC and PMN% are subject to considerable variation. According to its higher interindividual variance, LC evaluation might contribute to false-positive or false-negative results in PJI assessment. Single LC testing prior to TKA revision surgery seems to be insufficient to exclude PJI. On the basis of the obtained results, PMN% analyses overrule LC measurements with regard to a conclusive diagnostic algorithm.

Triazavirin, an antiviral drug developed in Russia for per-oral administration, is involved in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. This virus has affinity to epithelial cells in respiratory tract, so drug delivery directly in lungs may enhance therapeutic effect and reduce side effects for stomach, liver, kidneys. We elaborated ultrasonic method of triazavirin aerosol generation and investigated the inhalation delivery of this drug in mice. Mean particle size and number concentration of aerosol used in inhalation experiments are 560 nm and 4 × 10(5) cm(−3), respectively. Aerosol mass concentration is 1.6 × 10(−4) mg/cm(3). Inhalation for 20 min in a nose-only chamber resulted in 2 mg/kg body delivered dose and 2.6 μg/mL triazavirin concentration in blood plasma. Elimination rate constant determined in aerosol administration experiments was k(e) = 0.077 min(−1), which agrees with the value measured after intravenous delivery, but per-oral administration resulted in considerably lower apparent elimination rate constant of pseudo-first order, probably due to non-linear dependence of absorption rate on triazavirin concentration in gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability of triazavirin aerosol is found to be 85%, which is about four times higher than for per-oral administration.","Valiulin, Sergey V.; Onischuk, Andrey A.; Dubtsov, Sergey N.; Baklanov, Anatoly M.; An'kov, Sergey V.; Plokhotnichenko, Maria E.; Tolstikova, Tatyana G.; Dultseva, Galina G.; Rusinov, Vladimir L.; Charushin, Valery N.; Fomin, Vasily M.",J Pharm Sci,568,26

Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018–2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents’ negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents’ negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents’ and parents’ negative affect and adolescents’ positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents’ negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed.","Janssen, Loes H. C.; Kullberg, Marie-Louise J.; Verkuil, Bart; van Zwieten, Noa; Wever, Mirjam C.
