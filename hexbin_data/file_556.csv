One possible way to overcome partly these issues is to realize the whole UV structure on AlGaN pyramids by selective area growth in order to benefit from the advantages of such structures, i.e. the dislocation filtering and the semi polar planes. We present here a detailed study about the epitaxy of AlGaN nano-sized pyramids by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on patterned templates presenting different holes apertures and pitches as 1.5 µm and 4 µm or 100 nm and 250 nm respectively. While increasing the Al content, their height decreases while the thickness of the deposition on the mask increases whatever the design of the mask. Those changes of the pyramid shapes and deposition are directly linked to the properties of Al adatoms, i.e. low Al diffusion length. Using the conventional growth mode for the epitaxy of those pyramids did not permit the incorporation of Al from the base of the pyramids to their truncated apex. Its presence was concentrated on the edges and top of the pyramids. On the contrary, a pulsed growth mode, coupled with a strongly reduced pitch, allowed an incorporation of Al since the base of the nanopyramid, and a decrease of the deposition height on the mask. These results can be explained by the desorption of Ga species, due to the presence of H2 in the reactor chamber during the step without the metal precursors, leading to a higher Al/Ga ratio. It is even enhanced inside the holes by the reduced pitch.","Boughaleb, Sofia; Martin, Brigitte; Matei, Constantin; Templier, Roselyne; Borowik, Lukasz; Rochat, Névine; Gil, Bernard; Dussaigne, Amélie",Nanotechnology,556,24

Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light is effective against RNA and DNA viruses and could be useful for decontamination of high-touch fomites that are shared by multiple users. Methods: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of UV-C light for rapid decontamination of plastic airport security bins inoculated at 3 sites with methicillin-re-sistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, and Phi6, an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Reductions of 3 log10on inoculated plastic bins were considered effective for decontamination. Results: UV-C light administered as 10-, 20-, or 30-second cycles in proximity to a plastic bin reduced contamination on each of the test sites, including vertical and horizontal surfaces. The 30-second cycle met criteria for decontamination of all 3 test sites for all the test organisms except bacteriophage MS2 which was reduced by greater than 2 log10PFU at each site. Conclusions: UV-C light is an attractive technology for rapid decontamination of airport security bins. Further work is needed to evaluate the utility of UV-C light in real-world settings and to develop methods to provide automated movement of bins through a UV-C decontamination process.","Cadnum, Jennifer L.; Li, Daniel F.; Jones, Lucas D.; Redmond, Sarah N.; Pearlmutter, Basya; Wilson, Brig-Id M.; Donskey, Curtis J.",Pathog.

A model that learns about dengue fever incidence in a population uses historical data from that corresponding location. Poor performance in prediction can result in places with inadequate data. This work aims to enhance temporally limited dengue case data by methodological addition of epidemically relevant data from nearby locations as predictors (features). A novel framework is presented for windowing incidence data and computing time-shifted correlation-based metrics to quantify feature relevance. The framework ranks incidence data of adjacent locations around a target location by combining the correlation metric with two other metrics: spatial distance and local prevalence. Recurrent neural network-based prediction models achieve up to 33.6% accuracy improvement on average using the proposed method compared to using training data from the target location only. These models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) values as low as 0.128 on [0,1] normalized incidence data for a municipality with the highest dengue prevalence in Brazil's Espirito Santo. When predicting cases aggregated over geographical ecoregions, the models achieved accuracy improvements up to 16.5%, using only 6.5% of incidence data from ranked feature sets. The paper also includes two techniques for windowing time series data: fixed-sized windows and outbreak detection windows. Both of these techniques perform comparably, while the window detection method uses less data for computations. The framework presented in this paper is application-independent, and it could improve the performances of prediction models where data from spatially adjacent locations are available.","Ferdousi, Tanvir; Cohnstaedt, Lee W.; Scoglio, Caterina M.",,556,20

Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 594 patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed RSV, hMPV, or influenza infections over three consecutive influenza seasons at a tertiary hospital in China. Results: While certain clinical features were of value as predictors of infection type, none exhibited good predictive performance as a means of discriminating between these three infections (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve < 0.70). After controlling for potential confounding variables, RSV infections in pneumonia patients were found to be associated with a 30-day mortality risk comparable to that of influenza patients [odds ratio (OR) 1.016, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.267-3.856, p = 0.982], whereas hMPV infection was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.144, 95% CI 0.027-0.780, p = 0.025). Among those without pneumonia, the 30-day mortality risk in patients with influenza was comparable to that in patients infected with RSV (OR 1.268, 95% CI 0.172-9.355, p = 0.816) or hMPV (OR 1.128, 95% CI 0.122-10.419, p = 0.916).

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the effectiveness of “high-dose” oral erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in decreasing the incidence of PNAC. Two secondary end points, including the time to achieve full enteral feeding and the duration of parenteral nutrition, were also evaluated. Methods: Infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit were randomized to receive erythromycin (12.5 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours for 14 days) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo) if they attained less than half the total daily fluid intake (<75 mL/kg/day) as milk feeds on day 14 of life. Results: Of 182 VLBW infants enrolled, 91 received erythromycin. The incidence of PNAC was significantly lower in erythromycin-treated infants (18/91) compared with placebo infants (37/91; P = .003). Treated infants achieved full enteral nutrition significantly earlier (mean, 10.1; SE, 1.7 days; P < .001), and the duration of parenteral nutrition was also significantly decreased by 10 days (P < .001). Importantly, fewer infants receiving erythromycin had 2 or more episodes of septicemia (n = 4) compared with placebo patients (n = 13, P = .03). No serious adverse effect was associated with erythromycin treatment. Conclusions: High-dose oral erythromycin can be considered as a rescue measure for VLBW infants who fail to establish adequate enteral nutrition and in whom anatomically obstructive pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract have been excluded.","Ng, Pak C.; Lee, Cheuk H.; Wong, Samuel P.S.; Lam, Hugh S.; Liu, Flora Y.B.; So, King W.; Lee, Cheuk Y.; Fok, Tai F.",Gastroenterology,556,24

The purpose of this study was to compare in-person versus video-based teaching methods of a comprehensive assessment of the pelvic floor musculature on a pelvic model. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 46 participants was conducted. The participants were randomized into two groups. Both groups were taught by the same pelvic floor physiotherapist using two different teaching methods on a pelvic model. Group 1 watched an instructional video, whereas group 2 had in-person training. Both groups underwent pre- and post-training assessments consisting of a written examination and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Primary outcome measure was the change in participants’ pre- and post-training assessment scores. Secondary outcome measures were perceived changes in both participants’ comfort level in performing pelvic floor examination and applicability of the training program to clinical practice. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the teaching methods in the degree of improvement of the participants’ mean written assessment scores (p = 0.58), OSCE scores (p = 0.15), and perceived comfort level (p = 0.19). Participants’ mean pre- and post-assessment scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). Participants reported the training program to be applicable towards their clinical practice.

The most common causes are perforation of a gastroduodenal ulcer, peritonitis, intestinal obstructions, and perforation of an appendix or fallopian tube. Fever and pain can be caused by an appendicitis or sigmoiditis. Appendiceal lymphoma is a rare disease that is usually found incidentally during appendectomy. Most of the cases are non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with a poorer prognosis than other B-cell lymphomas; thus, a definitive diagnosis is essential. Case Summary: A 60-year-old man presented with right lower quadrant pain. He denied any nausea, vomiting or anorexia and was afebrile. The physical examination revealed right lower quadrant abdomen tenderness. The computed tomography scan revealed periappendiceal fatty stranding with a swollen appendix, approximately 2 cm in diameter and prominent paraaortic, portacaval and mesenteric lymph nodes. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made, and laparoscopic appendectomy was performed immediately. The subsequent pathological examination revealed severe congestion with lymphoid hyperplasia. The immunohistochemistry stains revealed positive staining for cluster of differentiation (CD) CD20, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), cyclin D1, SRY-box transcription factor-11 (SOX-11), immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) but negative staining for CD3, CD5, CD10 and CD23. 18F-FDG positron emission tomography showed peripheral lymph node involvement, while the bone marrow biopsy showed negative findings. Therefore, a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, Ann Arbor stage IVA, was made. The patient received postoperative combination chemotherapy and remained in a stable condition over a 1-year follow-up period. Conclusion: We report an uncommon case that initially presented as acute appendicitis, for which a final diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma was made.

The Complement System is activated during viral infection, being a central protagonist of innate and acquired immunity. Here, we report some interactions between these three coronaviruses and the Complement System, highlighting the central role of C3 with the severity of these infections. Although it can be protective, its role during coronavirus infections seems to be contradictory. For example, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, Complement System can control the viral infection in asymptomatic or mild cases; however, it can also intensify local and systemic damage in some of severe COVID-19 patients, due to its potent proinflammatory effect. In this last condition, the activation of the Complement System also amplifies the cytokine storm and the pathogenicity of coronavirus infection. Experimental treatment with Complement inhibitors has been an enthusiastic field of intense investigation in search of a promising additional therapy in severe COVID-19 patients.","Santiesteban-Lores, Lazara Elena; Amamura, Thais Akemi; da Silva, Tiago Francisco; Midon, Leonardo Moura; Carneiro, Milena Carvalho; Isaac, Lourdes; Bavia, Lorena",Life Sci,556,10

The mechanisms through which frailty increases the severity of COVID-19 are several, including immunosenescense and dysregulated inflammation. Whether individuals affected by frailty exhibit a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an open question. Here we report the case series of 40 older persons that in February 2020, before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Italy, went together on a winter holiday. Back home, 7 of them developed influenza-like symptoms and one was hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Between May and July, the seniors were offered the possibility to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. Twenty-seven of them accepted: 13 had a positive serological test whereas no active infection was found. Comparing the characteristics of those who tested positive and the others, we found that the former group was frailer, exhibiting higher Clinical Frailty Scale scores.","Zucchelli, A.; Bologna, E.; Marengoni, A.",Aging Clin Exp Res,556,26

We construct dynamic total, net total and net pairwise return and volatility connectedness measures to better understand systemic risk and the transmission of shocks across REIT markets. Our findings show that that REIT market interdependence is dynamic and increases significantly during times of heightened uncertainty, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We also find that the US REIT market along with major European REITs are generally sources of shocks to Asian-Pacific REIT markets. Furthermore, US REITs appear to dominate European REITs. These findings highlight that portfolio diversification opportunities decline during times of market uncertainty.","Lesame, Keagile; Bouri, Elie; Gabauer, David; Gupta, Rangan",Entropy (Basel),556,16

METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies were measured at three time points during the 30-week follow-up. COVID-19-specific symptoms were assessed with standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: 95% of the participants mounted an IgG response with only modest decline after week 12. IgG-type antibodies were still detectable in almost 90% of the subjects at 30 weeks. IgA and IgM responses were less robust and antibody titers decreased more rapidly. At 30 weeks, only 25% still had detectable IgA-type and none had IgM-type antibodies. Higher age and higher disease severity were independently associated with higher IgG antibody levels, albeit with wide variations. CONCLUSION: Serological immune responses after COVID-19 show considerable inter-individual variability, but show an association with increasing age and higher severity of disease. IgG-type anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain positive in 90% of the individuals 30 weeks after onset of symptoms.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact on triage, diagnosis and prognosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 when clinical decisions are derived from reconstructed CXR or from CT. METHODS: we reconstructed CXR (r-CXR) from high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan. Five clinical observers independently reviewed clinical charts of 300 subjects with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, integrated with either r-CXR or HRCT report in two consecutive blinded and randomised sessions: clinical decisions were recorded for each session. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and prognostic value were compared between r-CXR and HRCT. The best radiological integration was also examined to develop an optimised respiratory triage algorithm. RESULTS: interobserver agreement was fair (Kendall's W=0.365; p<0.001) by r-CXR-based protocol and good (Kendall's W=0.654; p<0.001) by CT-based protocol. NPV assisted by r-CXR (31.4%) was lower than that of HRCT (77.9%). In case of indeterminate or typical radiological appearence for COVID-19 pneumonia, extent of disease on r-CXR or HRCT were the only two imaging variables that were similarly linked to mortality by adjusted multivariable models CONCLUSIONS: the present findings suggest that clinical triage is safely assisted by CXR. An integrated algorithm using first-line CXR and contingent use of HRCT can help optimise management and prognostication of COVID-19.","Sverzellati, Nicola; Ryerson, Christopher J; Milanese, Gianluca; Renzoni, Elisabetta A; Volpi, Annalisa; Spagnolo, Paolo; Bonella, Francesco; Comelli, Ivan; Affanni, Paola; Veronesi, Licia; Manna, Carmelinda; Ciuni, Andrea; Sartorio, Carlotta; Tringali, Giulia; Silva, Mario; Michieletti, Emanuele; Colombi, Davide; Wells, U Athol",Eur Respir J,556,20

Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.","Castro, Andrea; Ozturk, Kivilcim; Zanetti, Maurizio; Carter, Hannah",PLoS One,556,0
