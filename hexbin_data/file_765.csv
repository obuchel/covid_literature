Populations with serious mental illness (SMI) rely on psychosocial treatment, care coordination, and pharmacotherapy to achieve recovery goals and increase community engagement. This program evaluation of a group-based RS used mixed methods to better understand the multiple factors that contributed to successful telehealth conversion. Clients' service utilization over an 18-week period was collected to determine acceptance and the client characteristics associated with utilization (n = 72). Clients completed a treatment satisfaction questionnaire that was distributed ten weeks following telehealth conversion. Qualitative interviews explored staff perspectives on factors that impacted conversion, acceptance, and utilization. Initial staff skepticism gave way to acceptance, while the demands of resourcefulness, flexibility, and competency were emphasized. Clients' treatment utilization remained stable, while the number of missed/cancelled sessions were less frequent over time, especially for clients with a history of psychosis. Clients reported high overall satisfaction, but a preference for in-person treatment. Within this clinic serving middle to high socioeconomic status (SES) clients, clinicians and clients alike found the virtual group-based RS to be feasible and acceptable while in-person treatment was not an option.","Lynch, David A; Stefancic, Ana; Cabassa, Leopoldo J; Medalia, Alice",Psychiatry research,765,31

These patients are at risk to receive prophylactic plasma prior to invasive procedures. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Samples from patients with an INR of 1.5 or greater were frozen and subsequently thawed and assayed for procoagulant and anticoagulant clotting factors and anti-Xa to determine the likely cause of the INR. Samples showing a low FVII, FX, PC, and PS were categorized as a vitamin K deficiency pattern. Samples showing a low FV, low or normal fibrinogen, and high FVIII were categorized as a liver disease pattern. Samples showing an anti-Xa >0.01 IU/ml were assayed for anti-Xa DOACs. Samples which could not be categorized were grouped as equivocal. RESULTS A total of 48 samples were obtained over a 6-month period. Nineteen showed a Vitamin K deficiency pattern, 17 a liver disease pattern, 7 showed an anti-Xa DOAC and 5 were equivocal. High FVIII and D-dimers and reduced levels of the anticoagulant proteins were present in the majority of the samples. FVII levels correlated inversely with the INR (r = -0. 81), as did FX (r = -0.67) but not FV (r = -0.04) nor fibrinogen (r = -0.15). CONCLUSION Transfusion of plasma to reverse an elevated INR in the ICU should be discouraged since such a practice is either avoidable by the use of vitamin K or inappropriate in the case of liver disease or an anti-Xa DOAC.","Cheves, Jared W; DeMarinis, Sandra; Sorin, Claudia; Carino, Gerardo; Sweeney, Joseph D",Transfusion,765,20

BACKGROUND When compared to TFA, TRA has been shown to lower bleeding and vascular complications during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, use of TRA is still low. There are limited data regarding the characteristics of TRA learning curve, especially in an era with designated TRA equipment. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing PCI in a single US center were divided into two cohorts according to vascular access approach: the last 250 TFA patients prior to the establishment of a TRA program and the initial 239 TRA patients following the establishment of a TRA program. Subgroup analysis of the TRA group, which was divided into five sequential case groups of 50 cases per group, was performed in order to assess TRA learning curve. RESULTS Overall, the baseline characteristics of TFA vs. TRA groups were comparable. Fluoroscopy time was significantly longer during TRA procedures (18±11 vs. 15±8min, respectively, p=0.002); however, contrast use was lower during TRA procedures (161±72 vs. 180±63ml, respectively, p=0.002). In-hospital outcomes were similar between the two groups, with low frequencies of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. Subanalysis of TRA group for learning curve assessment showed no major differences in patient demographics among the five subgroups. In the initial cases, more PCI was performed among non-acute cases (62% in patients 1-50 vs. 8-27% in patients 51-239, p<0.001). Despite these differences, characteristics of the treated vessels were similar between groups. There was no significant change in fluoroscopy time or in the amount of iodinated contrast volume delivered. Similarly, no differences in procedural, in-hospital, and long-term outcomes were documented. CONCLUSIONS Adopting TRA as a default is feasible for high-volume operators without significant learning curve effects.","Barbash, Israel M; Minha, Sa'ar; Gallino, Robert; Lager, Robert; Badr, Salem; Loh, Joshua P; Kitabata, Hironori; Pendyala, Lakshmana K; Torguson, Rebecca; Satler, Lowell F; Pichard, Augusto D; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,765,8

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the positive predictive values (PPVs) of coded indicators in EHRs for identifying intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment (CM), including prenatal neglect. METHODS We searched 18 electronic databases between January 1980 and May 2020 for studies comparing any coded indicator of IPV or CM including prenatal neglect defined as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), against an independent reference standard. We pooled PPVs for each indicator using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS We included 88 studies (3 875 183 individuals) involving 15 indicators for identifying CM in the prenatal period and childhood (0-18 years) and five indicators for IPV among women of reproductive age (12-50 years). Based on the International Classification of Disease system, the pooled PPV was over 80% for NAS (16 studies) but lower for FAS (<40%; seven studies). For young children, primary diagnoses of CM, specific injury presentations (eg, rib fractures and retinal haemorrhages) and assaults showed a high PPV for CM (pooled PPVs: 55.9%-87.8%). Indicators of IPV in women had a high PPV, with primary diagnoses correctly identifying IPV in >85% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Coded indicators in EHRs have a high likelihood of correctly classifying types of CM and IPV across the life course, providing a useful tool for assessment, support and monitoring of high-risk groups in health services and research.","Syed, Shabeer; Ashwick, Rachel; Schlosser, Marco; Gonzalez-Izquierdo, Arturo; Li, Leah; Gilbert, Ruth",Archives of disease in childhood,765,2

In addition, outbreaks of avian influenza caused by an H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus A and the recent pandemic caused by an H1N1 influenza virus have heightened concern about occupational infectious illnesses among workers in healthcare and agriculture. RECENT FINDINGS The last decade has witnessed extensive research into the modes, patterns, determinants and extent of transmission of these illnesses. The most important findings regarding risk, determinants and preventive measures of these occupational infections and recent guidelines are reviewed in this article. SUMMARY Administrative, personal and engineering measures to control respiratory infection are effective and should be implemented in healthcare facilities. The use of N95 personal respirators by healthcare workers who are caring for pulmonary TB and viral respiratory infections patients is strongly recommended. Vaccination against influenza (including H1N1) is effective and strongly recommended for healthcare workers. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is underused at present, despite good evidence of safety and efficacy in elimination of airborne respiratory infectious agents including TB.","Trajman, Anete; Menzies, Dick",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,765,1

Some preferences drift quite abruptly (short-term preferences), while others change over a longer period of time (long-term preferences). Although the existing news recommender systems consider the reader's full history, they often ignore the dynamics in the reader's behavior. Thus, they cannot meet the demand of the news readers for their time-varying preferences. In addition, the state-of-the-art news recommendation models are often focused on providing accurate predictions, which can work well in traditional recommendation scenarios. However, in a news recommender system, diversity is essential, not only to keep news readers engaged, but also to play a key role in a democratic society. In this PhD dissertation, our goal is to build a news recommender system to address these two challenges. Our system should be able to: (i) accommodate the dynamics in reader behavior; and (ii) consider both accuracy and diversity in the design of the recommendation model. Our news recommender system can also work for unprofiled, anonymous and short-term readers, by leveraging the rich side information of the news items and by including the implicit feedback in our model. We evaluate our model with multiple evaluation measures (both accuracy and diversity-oriented metrics) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.","Raza, Shaina",,765,15

Countries where both undernutrition and overweight and obesity coexist are said to be experiencing a double burden of malnutrition. India is one example of a country experiencing this double burden. Women have been found to experience the negative impacts of food insecurity and obesity, however, the reasons that women experience the impact of malnutrition more so than men are complex and are under-researched. This current research employed a mixed methods approach to begin to fill this gap by exploring the dietary intake, anthropometric characteristics, and food security status of rural Indian women. In total, 78 household were surveyed. The average waist measurement, waist to hip ratio, and BMI were all above WHO recommendations, with two thirds of participants categorized as obese. Contributing to these findings was a very limited diet, high in energy, and low in protein and iron.

No proven treatment for SARS-CoV-2 was available at that time, especially for severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. We determined whether the infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would help to improve pulmonary function and overall outcome in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. We offered MSC infusion as an extended indication to all critically ill COVID-19 patients with a Horovitz index <100. We treated 5 out of 23 patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS with an infusion of MSCs. One million MSCs/kg body weight was infused over 30 minutes, and the process was repeated in 3 patients twice and in 2 patients 3 times. RESULT: Four out of 5 MSC-treated patients compared to 50% of control patients (9 out of 18) received ECMO support (80%). The MSC group showed a higher Murray score on admission than control patients, reflecting more severe pulmonary compromise (3.5 ± 0.2 versus 2.8 ± 0.3). MSC infusion was safe and well tolerated. The MSC group had a significantly higher Horovitz score on discharge than the control group. Compared to controls, patients with MSC treatment showed a significantly lower Murray score upon discharge than controls. In the MSC group, 4 out of 5 patients (80%) survived to discharge and exhibited good pulmonary function, whereas only 8 out of 18 patients (45%) in the control group survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: MSC infusion is a safe treatment for COVID-19 ARDS that improves pulmonary function and overall outcome in this patient population.","Häberle, Helene; Magunia, Harry; Lang, Peter; Gloeckner, Henning; Körner, Andreas; Koeppen, Michael; Backchoul, Tamam; Malek, Nisar; Handgretinger, Rupert; Rosenberger, Peter; Mirakaj, Valbona",J Intensive Care Med,765,15

Concerning medicine, however, it refers to the connection of things resulting from one another, or contact tracing. The core idea behind filiation as a measure of precaution against outbreaks is to prevent the disease by interrupting the chain of transmission with a systematical tracing and isolation of susceptible individuals having contact with any confirmed cases. Filiation became a widely used medical term in the first quarter of the 19thcentury, primarily in French medical literature, soon adapted to English and some other languages. In the Ottoman Empire, it appeared in medical journals in the 1850s, used primarily by some European physicians practicing in the country. As part of various measures that have been taken to tackle the current pandemic of COVID-19, the method of filiation was also recalled by the medical community. Soon after the observance of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey on March 11, 2020, the index case and its contacts were identified and the Turkish Ministry of Health launched the procedures of filiation at a national level with ad-hoc medical teams established around the country.
