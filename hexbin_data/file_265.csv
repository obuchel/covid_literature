1120,1120,1120,"In memory of Patrick Manson, founding father of tropical medicine and the discovery of vector-borne infections",9.393035,8.517061,2012-10-24,"Patrick Manson, a clinician-scientist serving in China (1866–1889), discovered that many tropical infectious diseases require a vector peculiar to warm climate for person to person transmission. He demonstrated the nocturnal periodicity of microfilariae in the blood of patients with elephantiasis. These microfilariae undergo metamorphosis when ingested by the mosquito acting as the vector for the completion of their life cycle. Furthermore, he demonstrated the linkage between the lung fluke and endemic haemoptysis by finding operculated eggs in patients' sputa. He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes. His vector hypothesis leads to vector control which is now the cornerstone for the World Health Organization's programme for the elimination/control of lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis and malaria. Before leaving China, he established the Alice Memorial Hospital, the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong), and the Hong Kong Medical Society for medical service and education. He also incepted the Hong Kong Dairy Farm for supplying hygienic milk affordable by pregnant women, children and patients.","To, Kelvin KW; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,265,19

LASV and the non-pathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) are both rodent-borne African arenaviruses. A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways. These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes. The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease.","Zapata, Juan Carlos; Carrion, Ricardo; Patterson, Jean L.; Crasta, Oswald; Zhang, Yan; Mani, Sachin; Jett, Marti; Poonia, Bhawna; Djavani, Mahmoud; White, David M.; Lukashevich, Igor S.; Salvato, Maria S.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,265,11

2413,2413,2413,A Field-Deployable Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for Rapid Detection of the Chikungunya Virus,9.25341,8.522722,2016-09-29,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus currently transmitted in about 60 countries. CHIKV causes acute flu-like symptoms and in many cases prolonged musculoskeletal and joint pain. Detection of the infection is mostly done using RT-RCR or ELISA, which are not suitable for point-of-care diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of the CHIKV was developed. The assay sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity were tested. CHIKV RT-RPA assay detected down to 80 genome copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 minutes. It successfully identified 18 isolates representing the three CHIKV genotypes. No cross-reactivity was detected to other alphaviruses and arboviruses except O'nyong'nyong virus, which could be differentiated by a modified RPA primer pair. Seventy-eight samples were screened both by RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CHIKV RT-RPA assay were determined at 100%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The developed RT-RPA assay represents a promising method for the molecular detection of CHIKV at point of need.","Patel, Pranav; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Faye, Oumar; Prüger, Pauline; Kaiser, Marco; Thaloengsok, Sasikanya; Ubol, Sukathida; Sakuntabhai, Anavaj; Leparc-Goffart, Isabelle; Hufert, Frank T.; Sall, Amadou A.; Weidmann, Manfred; Niedrig, Matthias",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,265,28

Compared with a conventional real-time PCR (rPCR) assay, the fLAMP assay achieved 87.3% (62/71) sensitivity and 100% (29/29) specificity. The rPCR assay took 65 min, while the fLAMP assay took 8 min to 30 min from the beginning of DNA amplification to final judgement with a comparable limit of detection. The fLAMP is a potential tool for the rapid and simple diagnosis of BLV infection to supplement ELISA testing and can be used by local laboratories and slaughterhouses without special equipment.","NAGAO, Konomu; MAKINO, Ryohei; APEGO, Francis Victor; MEKATA, Hirohisa; YAMAZAKI, Wataru",J Vet Med Sci,265,28

By the application of reverse genetic manipulation of an infectious PRRSV clone, the current study is the first to demonstrate that Nsp12 is a key component of PRRSV replication. In addition, the biochemical properties of Nsp12 were evaluated, revealing that Nsp12 forms dimers when exposed to oxidative conditions. Furthermore, we systemically analyzed the function of Nsp12 in PRRSV RNA synthesis using a strand-specific PCR method. To our surprise, Nsp12 was not found to be involved in minus-strand genomic RNA (-gRNA) synthesis; importantly, our results indicate that Nsp12 is involved in the synthesis of both plus- and minus-strand subgenomic mRNAs (+sgmRNA and -sgmRNA). Finally, we found that the combination of cysteine 35 and cysteine 79 in Nsp12 is required for sgmRNA synthesis. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the biological role of Nsp12 in the PRRSV lifecycle, and we conclude that Nsp12 is involved in the synthesis of both + sgRNA and -sgRNA.","Wang, Tong-Yun; Fang, Qiong-Qiong; Cong, Feng; Liu, Yong-Gang; Wang, Hai-Ming; Zhang, Hong-Liang; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Tang, Yan-Dong; Cai, Xue-Hui",Emerg Microbes Infect,265,1

In addition, diarrheal illnesses account for an estimated 12,600 deaths each day in children in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The causes of diarrhea include a wide array of viruses, bacteria, and parasites, many of which have been recognized only in the last decade or two. While enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and rotaviruses predominate in developing areas, Norwalk-like viruses, Campylobacter jejuni, and cytotoxigenic Clostridium difficile are seen with increasing frequency in developed areas; and Shigella, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium species, and Giardia lamblia are found throughout the world. The rational management of infectious diarrhea requires the highly selective use of laboratory tests for these varied etiologic agents, depending on the clinical and epidemiologic setting.

RESULTS: Of 336 neonates with NEC, 35 (10%) who developed fulminant NEC were born with higher birth weights and more frequently developed radiologically evident pneumoperitoneumand/or portal venous gas. Following the diagnosis of NEC, these infants were more likely to rapidly develop thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and lower total white blood cell counts compared to medical/surgical non-fulminant type. They were also more likely to have received a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (76.7% vs. 53.1%, p = 0.001) within 48 h after disease onset and platelet transfusion (24.2% vs. 11.7%; p = 0.03) before the onset of NEC.

Anaphylactic reactions that present solely with hypotension without pulmonary or mucocutaneous signs have yet to be described during renal transplant surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of a 33-year-old female with end-stage renal disease who underwent cadaveric renal transplant. She developed anaphylaxis following the administration of cefazolin. Despite this reaction, the surgery was ultimately completed after patient stabilization, and the patient had excellent graft function postoperatively. The patient had an elevated tryptase at the time of the reaction and postoperative allergy testing revealed a positive intradermal test to cefazolin. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for all procedures, studies, and publication of this case report. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of a successful zero-mismatch cadaveric renal transplant following an anaphylactic reaction to cefazolin. Although anaphylaxis during transplant surgery typically warrants cancellation due to the hemodynamic effects that may lead to graft dysfunction, here we describe a case where surgery was continued following patient stabilization. The decision to proceed with surgery despite an intraoperative emergency along with the management and workup of intraoperative anaphylaxis are described, which can be beneficial for others who are presented with similar scenarios in the future.","Hemati, Kaveh; Gierat, Shelley; Roll, Garrett R.; Barreto Chang, Odmara L.",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,265,1

Vitamin E deficiency has also been found to predispose pigs to different diseases, E. coli infection is one among them. After weaning, the vitamin E status of pigs often decreases to a critical low level. In this experiment, we studied whether vitamin C supplementation would be a possible feeding strategy to optimize the immune status of weaners. The interaction between vitamin E and C is interesting due to the reported sparing action on vitamin E or synergism between these to vitamins. Piglets were weaned at day 28 of age from sows fed increasing dietary vitamin E during lactation, and piglets were during the following 3 weeks fed either a control diet or this diet supplemented with 500 mg STAY‐C per kg. Blood sampling was obtained weekly from day 28 and until day 49 of age. On the same days, one piglet per dietary treatment was killed and alveolar macrophages (AM) were harvested. Vitamin C supplementation increased the concentration of IgM in serum of piglets throughout the weaning period. Although the vitamin E concentration in AM decreased with increasing age of the piglets, the concentration was numerically higher in piglets of sows fed the high dietary level of vitamin E. However, vitamin C supplementation tended to increase the total AM concentration of vitamin E after weaning and increased the proportion of the biologically most active isomer of vitamin E [RRR‐(α‐tocopherol)] in the AM. The eicosanoid synthesis by AM was not influenced by the vitamin C supplementation, but the synthesis of leukotriene B4 was decreased 2 weeks after weaning compared to other days of AM harvesting. In conclusion, dietary vitamin C supplementation improved the immune responses of piglets after weaning.","Lauridsen, C.; Jensen, S. K.",Scand J Immunol,265,1

In the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, more severe forms of infection are observed in elderly individuals and patients having co-morbidities like CKD. The repeated blood tests for the monitoring of electrolyte balance predispose them not only to COVID-19 but also other to hospital-acquired infections (HAI). Therefore, a non-invasive method for easy detection of essential electrolyte (K(+) and Na(+)) levels is urgently needed. In this study, we developed an optical emission spectroscopy-based non-invasive device for simultaneous monitoring of salivary Na(+) and K(+) levels in a fast and reliable way. The device consisted of a closed spark chamber, micro-spectrometer, high voltage spark generator, electronic circuits, optical fiber, and an indigenously developed software based on the LabVIEW platform. The optical emission originating from the biological sample (i.e., saliva) due to recombination of ions energized by impingement of electrons returning from high voltage spark provides necessary information about the concentration of electrolytes. A small-scale clinical trial on 30 healthy human subjects shows the potential of the indigenously developed device in determining salivary Na( +) and K(+) concentration. The low-cost, portable, point-of-care device requires only 2 mL of sample, and can simultaneously measure 1.0–190.0 mM Na(+), and 1.0–270.9 mM K(+) . To our understanding, the present work will find its relevance in combating COVID-19 morbidities, along with regular CKD patient-care.","Bhattacharyya, Neha; Singh, Soumendra; Halder, Animesh; Adhikari, Aniruddha; Ghosh, Ria; Shikha, Deep; Tripathi, Santanu Kumar; Mallick, Asim Kumar; Mondal, Pulak; Pal, Samir Kumar",Trans Indian Natl,265,16

The only possible way to stop transmission of SARS-COV-2 is to take safety precautions including use of facemask. With the ever-increasing concern on the disease, it is necessary to choose facemask components to achieve the performance as good as commercially available N95 masks in a cost-effective way. This investigation compares the effectiveness of five different 3-layered masks with N95 mask in terms of pressure drop and aerosol filtration capabilities. Different combinations of cotton, polypropylene fabric, tissue and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) were used as mask materials. In comparison to N95 mask, the result shows that the 3-layered cotton mask has much lesser pressure drop but least droplet filtration efficiency, while polypropylene-HEPA-polypropylene mask is seen as the best cost-effective alternative to N95 in terms of droplets filtration efficiency and breathability. These findings are crucial to make the right non-medical facemask to combat COVID-19 and other airborne diseases.

Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. MAIN RESULTS We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","Burns, Jacob; Movsisyan, Ani; Stratil, Jan M; Coenen, Michaela; Emmert-Fees, Karl Mf; Geffert, Karin; Hoffmann, Sabine; Horstick, Olaf; Laxy, Michael; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Voss, Stephan; Rehfuess, Eva",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,265,24

METHODS We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of transplantation in HIV positive patients and highlight some of the important issues reported in the literature. We pooled clinical data form different cohorts in order to show some of the common issues encountered in HIV positive transplantation. Furthermore we searched MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL to create a comprehensive table for current evidence for different issues currently encountered when transplanting HIV positive patients. RESULTS We included data from 19 cohort studies and reported on outcomes of the current HIV positive transplant programs. We made recommendations based on personal experience as well as the experience reported in the literature regarding rejection, opportunistic infection and HIV associated nephropathy. Opportunistic infections and malignancies are not a major problem for this population group. CONCLUSIONS HIV positive patients encounter very specific issues after transplantation, specifically related to drug interactions and higher rejection rates. When utilizing HIV positive donors, the recurrence of HIV Associated nephropathy in the graft kidney is an issue which can be important. Despite some issues with high rejection rates, HIV positive patients have similar results to HIV negative patients post transplantation.","Muller, Elmi; Botha, Francois C J; Barday, Zunaid A; Manning, Kathryn; Chin-Hong, Peter; Stock, Peter",Transplantation,265,31

Therefore, guidelines for CRC are considered to be crucial for establishing standard medical treatment not only in Japan but also around the world. In this article, we explain the features of the representative guidelines in Japan (Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum [JSCCR]), the USA (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) and Europe (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO]) and review the differences among these guidelines for CRC. We focus, in particular, on the descriptions of local treatments, including endoscopic treatment for CRC and transanal excision for lower rectal cancer; surgical treatments with lymph node dissection, including management of lower rectal cancer with lateral lymph node metastasis and laparoscopic surgery; and chemotherapy. Although the guidelines share basic principles, some details are different. Consulting the guidelines of various regions from around the world may aid in more precise and effective examination of the details and backgrounds of our own native guidelines.","Shinagawa, Takahide; Tanaka, Toshiaki; Nozawa, Hiroaki; Emoto, Shigenobu; Murono, Koji; Kaneko, Manabu; Sasaki, Kazuhito; Otani, Kensuke; Nishikawa, Takeshi; Hata, Keisuke; Kawai, Kazushige; Watanabe, Toshiaki",Annals of gastroenterological surgery,265,1

While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the body mass index (BMI) and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor f qor respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Research Design and Methods A retrospective cohort study of 482 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportion Hazard models including demographic characteristics and comorbidities were carried out to predict the endpoints within 30 days from the onset of symptoms. Results Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, p=0.004), and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, p<0.001). A significantly higher risk of death was observed in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (OR: 12.1; 95% CI: 3.25-45.1, p<0.001). Conclusions Obesity is a strong, independent risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the ICU and death among COVID-19 patients. Whereas a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 identifies a population of patients at high risk for severe illness, a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 dramatically increases the risk of death.","Rottoli, Matteo; Bernante, Paolo; Belvedere, Angela; Balsamo, Francesca; Garelli, Silvia; Giannella, Maddalena; Cascavilla, Alessandra; Tedeschi, Sara; Ianniruberto, Stefano; Rosselli Del Turco, Elena; Tonetti, Tommaso; Ranieri, Vito Marco; Poggioli, Gilberto; Manzoli, Lamberto; Pagotto, Uberto; Viale, Pierluigi; Bartoletti, Michele",European journal of endocrinology,265,1

METHODS This was a prospective cohort study. Patients with a sufficient TCD window undergoing CEA from February 2009 to June 2011 were included. All patients were continuously monitored with NIRS and EEG. An intraluminal shunt was placed, selectively determined by predefined EEG changes in alpha, beta, theta, or delta activity. Relative changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the frontal lobe and mean blood flow velocity (Vmean) 30 seconds before carotid cross-clamping versus 2 minutes after carotid cross-clamping were related to shunt placement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal thresholds. Diagnostic values were reported as positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV). RESULTS Of a cohort of 151 patients, 17(11%) showed EEG changes requiring shunt placement. The rSO2 and Vmean decreased more in the shunt group than in the non-shunt group (mean ± standard error of the mean) 21 ± 4% versus 7 ± 5% and 76 ± 6% versus 12 ± 3%, respectively (p < .005), Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a threshold of 16% decrease in rSO2 (PPV 76% and NPV 99%) and 48% decrease in Vmean (PPV 53% and NPV 99%) as the optimal cut-off value to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Compared with EEG, we found moderate PPV but high NPV for NIRS and TCD to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia, meaning that both techniques independently may be suitable to exclude patients for unnecessary shunt use and to direct the use of selective shunting. However, the optimal thresholds for NIRS remain to be determined.","Pennekamp, C W A; Immink, R V; den Ruijter, H M; Kappelle, L J; Bots, M L; Buhre, W F; Moll, F L; de Borst, G J",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,265,16

To date, 108 human cases have been reported, including cases of human-to-human transmission. The availability of an animal disease model is essential for understanding pathogenesis and developing effective countermeasures. Upon a combination of intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal inoculation with 7 × 10(6) 50% tissue culture infectious dose of the MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012, rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs, virus shedding, virus replication in respiratory tissues, gene expression, and cytokine and chemokine profiles peaked early in infection and decreased over time. MERS-CoV caused a multifocal, mild to marked interstitial pneumonia, with virus replication occurring mainly in alveolar pneumocytes. This tropism of MERS-CoV for the lower respiratory tract may explain the severity of the disease observed in humans and the, up to now, limited human-to-human transmission.","de Wit, Emmie; Rasmussen, Angela L; Falzarano, Darryl; Bushmaker, Trenton; Feldmann, Friederike; Brining, Douglas L; Fischer, Elizabeth R; Martellaro, Cynthia; Okumura, Atsushi; Chang, Jean; Scott, Dana; Benecke, Arndt G; Katze, Michael G; Feldmann, Heinz; Munster, Vincent J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,265,20

METHODS Consecutive cases of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery carried out between February 2009 and December 2012 at nine academic institutions were included. We examined the surgical outcomes, including conversion and complications rates. RESULTS Four hundred and sixty-nine cases were included in the analysis. The most common procedure was adrenalectomy (n = 177) and the second most common procedure was radical nephrectomy (n = 143). The procedures also included nephroureterectomy (n = 40), living donor nephrectomy (n = 40), pyeloplasty (n = 30), urachal remnant excision (n = 9), simple nephrectomy (n = 7), radical prostatectomy (n = 6) and others (n = 17). The access sites included umbilicus (n = 248, 53%) and other sites (n = 221, 47%). A transperitoneal approach was used in 385 cases (82%), and retroperitoneal approach in 84 cases (18%). The median operation time of all procedures was 198 min. Conversion to reduced port surgery, conventional laparoscopy, or open surgery was noted in 27 cases (5.8%), 12 cases (2.6%), and two cases (0.4%), respectively, with an overall conversion rate of 8.7%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 10 cases (2.1%). Post-operative complications were noted in 29 cases (6.2%), including five major complications (1.1%). No mortality was recorded in this series. CONCLUSIONS Non-robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is technically feasible and safe for various urologic diseases in Japan. Furthermore, urological laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is a promising minimally invasive surgical option that is feasible for experienced urological surgeons in intermediate-volume centers as well as high-volume centers.","Sato, Fuminori; Nakagawa, Ken; Kawauchi, Akihiro; Matsubara, Akio; Okegawa, Takatsugu; Habuchi, Tomonori; Yoshimura, Koji; Hoshi, Akio; Kinoshita, Hidefumi; Miyajima, Akira; Naitoh, Yasuyuki; Inoue, Shogo; Itaya, Naoshi; Narita, Shintaro; Hanai, Kazuya; Okubo, Kazutoshi; Yanishi, Masaaki; Matsuda, Tadashi; Terachi, Toshiro; Mimata, Hiromitsu",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,265,28

All positive-sense RNA viruses studied to date modify host membranes to help facilitate the sequestration of dsRNA from host defenses and concentrate replication factors to enhance RNA production. Flock House virus (FHV) is an attractive model for the study of these processes since it is well characterized and infects Drosophila cells, which are known to have a highly effective RNA silencing system. During infection, FHV modifies the outer membrane of host mitochondria to form numerous membrane invaginations, called spherules, that are ∼50 nm in diameter and known to be the site of viral RNA replication. While previous studies have outlined basic structural features of these invaginations, very little is known about the mechanism underlying their formation. Here we describe the optimization of an experimental system for the analysis of FHV host membrane modifications using crude mitochondrial preparations from infected Drosophila cells. These preparations can be programmed to synthesize both single- and double-stranded FHV RNA. The system was used to demonstrate that dsRNA is protected from nuclease digestion by virus-induced membrane invaginations and that spherules play an important role in stimulating RNA replication. Finally, we show that spherules generated during FHV infection appear to be dynamic as evidenced by their ability to form or disperse based on the presence or absence of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is well established that positive-sense RNA viruses induce significant membrane rearrangements in infected cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these rearrangements, particularly membrane invagination and spherule formation, remain essentially unknown. How the formation of spherules enhances viral RNA synthesis is also not understood, although it is assumed to be partly a result of evading host defense pathways. To help interrogate some of these issues, we optimized a cell-free replication system consisting of mitochondria isolated from Flock House virus-infected Drosophila cells for use in biochemical and structural studies. Our data suggest that spherules generated during Flock House virus replication are dynamic, protect double-stranded RNA, and enhance RNA replication in general. Cryo-electron microscopy suggests that the samples are amenable to detailed structural analyses of spherules engaged in RNA synthesis. This system thus provides a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying spherule formation, maintenance, and function during positive-sense viral RNA replication.","Short, James R; Speir, Jeffrey A; Gopal, Radhika; Pankratz, Logan M; Lanman, Jason; Schneemann, Anette",Journal of virology,265,19

Using a dosing regimen to simulate the exposure seen in patients with severe renal impairment, we investigated the effect of excess ligand on Gd-deposition and the depletion of endogenous ions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gadodiamide and gadoversetamide were formulated with 0%, 5%, and 10% excess ligand. Forty-two, healthy, male Hannover Wistar rats received daily intravenous injections of each formulation over a period of 20 days. At the end of the study, histopathological analysis of the skin was performed and the concentrations of Gd, Zn, and Cu were measured in several tissues. The levels of Zn in the urine were also measured. RESULTS The most severe skin lesions were observed after injection of formulations containing 0% free ligand and in those animals with the highest Gd concentrations in the skin. There were no significant reductions in the levels of Zn or Cu observed in the skin; however, the levels of Zn in the urine were elevated following administration of formulations with the highest amount of excess ligand. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that there is an inverse correlation between the amount of excess ligand present in Gd-containing contrast agents and the amount of Gd in the tissue, and further underline the importance of the inherent stability of these agents in the development of NSF.","Sieber, Martin A; Lengsfeld, Philipp; Walter, Jakob; Schirmer, Heiko; Frenzel, Thomas; Siegmund, Fred; Weinmann, Hanns-Joachim; Pietsch, Hubertus",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,265,29

Edible polymer coatings for GCBs can help preserve flavors and improve shelf life of GCBs. This study aimed to incorporate α-tocopherol, a powerful antioxidant, in thermoplastic starch [TPS] and chitosan [TPC] and determined the best cavitation energy (960-3840 J·mL-1) using an ultrasonic probe. Then, we evaluated the incorporation of bentonite (0% and 2% m/m) and α-tocopherol (0% and 10% m/m) in the best energy cavitation/biopolymer combination. The TPS and TPC coatings demonstrated good adherence to the GCBs, measured by surface energy. The dispersion of α-tocopherol in TPC, with cavitation energy 960 J·mL-1, promoted greater stability (greater zeta potential), thereby increasing antioxidant activity by 28% compared to TPS, therefore, was selected for a second stage. Incorporation of 2% bentonite into the TPC, with 10% α-tocopherol, resulted in a 3.7 × 10-10 g·m-1·s-1·Pa-1 water vapor permeability, which is satisfactory for prevented of moisture gain during storage. The compressive load showed values of 375 N to the non-coated GCB and around 475 N with the insertion of coatings to the GCB.

Tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments are often large and locally invasive, and resection is associated with a higher risk of insufficient surgical margins, massive intraoperative bleeding, and breaching of the tumor. Laparoscopic surgery for such tumors often involves major hepatectomy, including resection of a large volume of normal liver tissue. We developed a novel method of laparoscopic resection of tumors in these segments with the patient in the semiprone position, using a dual-handling technique with an intercostal transthoracic port. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and usefulness of our technique. METHODS Of 160 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection at our center from June 2008 to May 2013, we retrospectively reviewed those with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments. Patients were placed supine or semilateral during surgery until January 2010 and semiprone from February 2010. RESULTS Before the introduction of the semiprone position in February 2010, a total of 7 of 40 patients (17.5%) with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments underwent laparoscopic liver resection, and after introduction of the semiprone position, 69 of 120 patients (57.5%) with tumors in the anterosuperior and posterior segments underwent laparoscopic liver resection (P < 0.001). There were no conversions to open surgery, reoperations, or deaths. The semiprone group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who underwent partial resection or segmentectomy of S7 or S8, lower intraoperative blood loss, and shorter hospital stay than the supine group (all P < 0.05). Postoperative complication rates were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection in the semiprone position is safe and increases the number of patients who can be treated by laparoscopic surgery without increasing the frequency of major hepatectomy.","Ikeda, Tetsuo; Toshima, Takao; Harimoto, Norifumi; Yamashita, Youichi; Ikegami, Toru; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Soejima, Yuji; Shirabe, Ken; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Surgical endoscopy,265,19

METHODS This study-level meta-analysis was presented in accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the inverse variance heterogeneity model and displayed as summary Odds Ratio (sOR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Sensitivity analysis was performed by distinguishing between studies including dMTE patients eligible for IVT (IVT-E) or ineligible for IVT (IVT-IN). Primary outcome measures were functional independence (modified Rankin Scale≤2) and mortality at day 90, successful reperfusion, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS Twenty studies, incorporating 5279 patients, were included. There was no evidence that rates of successful reperfusion differed in dMTE and IVT+MTE patients (sOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28). In studies including IVT-IN dMTE patients, patients undergoing dMTE tended to have lower rates of functional independence and had higher odds for a fatal outcome as compared with IVT+MTE patients (sOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01 and sOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73). However, no such treatment group effect was found when analyses were confined to cohorts with a lower risk of selection bias (including IVT-E dMTE patients). CONCLUSION The quality of evidence regarding the relative merits of IVT+MTE versus dMTE is low. When considering studies with lower selection bias, the data suggest that dMTE may offer comparable safety and efficacy as compared with IVT+MTE. The conduct of randomized-controlled clinical trials seems justified.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Mordasini, Pasquale; Arnold, Marcel; López-Cancio, Elena; Cerdá, Neus; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias; Kleine, Justus F; Goyal, Mayank; Hill, Michael D; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Saver, Jeffrey L; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,265,17

Less theorized or examined is how combinations or intersections of these underpin differential health effects. Nevertheless, and often without naming it as such, an intersectional framework aligns with studies of social determinants of health, life-course epidemiology and eco-epidemiology. In this systematic review we examined and aimed to identify research methods used to operationalize, whether intentionally or inadvertently, interconnected effects of sex and social locations on health outcomes for 45+ year olds. Methods Using broad search terms, numerous databases, and following Prisma guidelines, 732 of 9214 papers initially identified, met inclusion criteria for full review. Results Of the 501 papers included after full review, methods used in considering intersections of sex and social circumstances/location(s) included regression (112 of 365 papers), growth curves (7 of 22), multilevel (15 of 25), decomposition (6 of 9), mediation (10 of 17), structural equation modelling (23 of 25), and other (2 of 3). Most (n = 157) approximated intersectional analyses by including interaction terms or sex-stratifying results. Discussion Few authors used the inherent strength of some study methods to examine intersecting traits. As even fewer began with an intersectionality framework their subsequent failure to deliver cannot be faulted, despite many studies including data and methodologies that would support intersectional analyses. There appeared to be a gap, not in analytic potential but rather in theorizing that differential distributions of social locations describe heterogeneity within the categories 'men' and 'women' that can underlie differential, gendered effects on older adults' health. While SEM, mediation and decomposition analyses emerged as particularly robust methods, the unexpected outcome was finding how few researchers consider intersectionality as a potential predictor of health.","Phillips, S P; A, Vafaei; S, Yu; R, Rodrigues; S, Ilinca; E, Zolyomi; S, Fors",SSM - population health,265,11

This technique is thought to decrease surgical trauma and improve cosmesis although there are reports pointing out that classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy is also feasible in terms of cosmesis. OBJECTIVES In this study we tried to determine if there are certain advantages in quality of life after single port surgery which would justify its utilization instead of classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective randomized study which enrolled 30 patients randomized either into classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy or single port surgery. The primary endpoint was patient satisfaction after surgery. This was assessed with short form 36 and gastrointestinal quality of life index (first preoperatively and then 3 months postoperatively) and a visual analogue scale on the first and seventh days. RESULTS There was not a statistically significant difference between groups in the emotional role, social functions, mental health, vitality and general health subscales of short form 36. At the end of 12 weeks, both groups demonstrated increases in the gastrointestinal and social subscales of the gastrointestinal quality of life index. There was not a statistically significant difference between groups when the visual analogue scale scores on first and seventh days were compared. CONCLUSIONS The equal length of hospitalization, patient quality of life and pain perception and the longer operative times, high likelihood of incisional hernia and surgical site infection call into question the utilization of single port surgery, as it does not seem to confer an advantage over classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Sulu, Barlas; Yildiz, Baris D; Ilingi, Elif D; Gunerhan, Yusuf; Cakmur, Hulya; Anuk, Turgut; Yildiz, Bektas; Koksal, Neset",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,265,11

Our working hypothesis was that atorvastatin preconditioning could improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats associated with inflammation. We investigated that two doses of atorvastatin preconditioning (20 and 5 mg/kg/day) could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function in rats with inflammation detected by echocardiography and haemodynamics. This benefit was obtained from the effect of atorvastatin preconditioning on improving forward blood flow and preserving the infarct cardiomyocytes, which was estimated by Thioflavin S and TTC staining in rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Subsequently, the improving of forward blood flow was ascribed to reduction of microthrombus in microvascular and myocardial fibrosis observed by MSB and Masson's trichrome staining with atorvastatin preconditioning. Ultimately, we found that atorvastatin preconditioning could reduce inflammation factor, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and fibrinogen-like protein 2, both in myocardial and in mononuclear cells, which probably attribute to microcirculation dysfunction in no-reflow rats detected by immunohistochemistry staining, western blot, and ELISA detection, respectively. In conclusion, atorvastatin preconditioning could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function and improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats attributing to reduction of TNF-α and fgl-2 expression.","Shao, Liang; Zhang, Yong; Ma, Aiqun; Zhang, Ping; Wu, Dayin; Li, Wenzhu; Wang, Jue; Liu, Kun; Wang, Zhaohui",Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,265,27

Choice of ETT size may be of particular relevance to thyroid surgery because of the increased risk of laryngeal trauma and concerns regarding postoperative vocal outcomes. OBJECTIVE To test our hypothesis that intubation with a smaller ETT would lead to reduced postoperative vocal impairment and associated reduced laryngoscopic evidence of laryngeal trauma compared with intubation with a standard-size ETT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This double-blind randomized clinical trial studied patients 18 years and older undergoing elective thyroidectomy at an academic teaching hospital from October 15, 2012, through June 13, 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to group 1 (standard-size ETT, 8.0 mm for men and 7.5 mm for women; n = 24) or group 2 (small ETT, 7.0 mm for men and 6.5 mm for women; n = 25). Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 24 hours and 3 weeks postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fiberoptic videolaryngoscopy with modified scoring system, voice assessment using the GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) rating scale, vocal self-assessment using the 30-item Voice Handicap Index, and subjective pain score. RESULTS At 24 hours, no significant differences were found between patients in groups 1 and 2 in change in GRBAS scores, change in laryngoscopic score (1.71 vs 1.76, P = .90), or postoperative pain score (3.3 vs 3.2, P = .91). At 3 weeks, no significant differences were found in changes in the 30-item Voice Handicap Index score (-2.2 vs -1.3, P = .74), GRBAS scores, or laryngoscopic score (0.25 vs 0.16, P = .67). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We did not find evidence that smaller ETT size for thyroidectomy has any significant effect on postoperative vocal outcomes, incidence of laryngeal trauma as assessed by laryngoscopy, or pain scores. However, because of the small sample size, our study may have been underpowered to detect small differences.

Current strategies are broadly classified into single -objective optimization (SOO) and multi-objective optimization (MOO). AREAS COVERED : Starting with SOO and the ways used to incorporate multiple criteria into it, the present review focuses on MOO techniques, their comparison, advantages and restrictions. Pareto analysis and the concept of dominance stand in the core of MOO. The Pareto front, Pareto ranking, and limitations of Pareto-based methods, due to high dimensions and data uncertainty, are outlined. Desirability functions and the weighted sum approaches are described as stand-alone techniques to transform the MOO problem to SOO or in combination with pareto analysis and evolutionary algorithms. Representative applications in different drug research areas are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION Despite their limitations, the use of combined MOO techniques, as well as being complementary to SOO or in conjunction with artificial intelligence, contributes dramatically in efficient drug design, assisting decisions and increasing success probabilities. For multi- target drug design, optimization is supported by network approaches, while applicability of MOO to other fields like drug technology or biological complexity opens new perspectives in the interrelated fields of medicinal chemistry and molecular biology.","Lambrinidis, George; Tsantili-Kakoulidou, Anna",Expert opinion on drug discovery,265,19

We tested whether risk communication messages that specify risks involved are associated with increased intentions to comply with public health advice during a pandemic. We conducted an anonymous online survey of the U.K. and U.S. public between April 24 and May 12, 2020. Participants (N = 2087) rated 14 COVID-related symptoms in terms of perceived severity and induced worry. They were then asked about their intention to practise social distancing in response to three public health messages: the standard U.K. government message: ""Most people will experience only mild symptoms""; the standard message ""unpacked"" by listing six of those symptoms as examples; and ""Most people will not require hospitalisation."" The unpacked message resulted in the highest intention to comply with social distancing (b = .22 [.04, .40], p = .02) and there was no interaction with country. Worry about symptoms was an independent predictor of intention to comply (b = .02 [.01, .03], p < .001). In the days before lockdown amidst a raging pandemic, the U.K. and U.S. governments sought to reassure the public. Had their messaging been more detailed, it might have been less reassuring but more effective in promoting social distancing.

The aim of this study is to provide a safe laparoendoscopic technique for hiatal hernia repair in the presence of an ALHA. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent LARS or LHHR between March 2016 and March 2018. We reviewed clinical and laboratory data and operative reports and images. Follow-up data included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) questionnaire results and the results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and upper gastrointestinal studies. Results One hundred thirty-one LARS and LHHR procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Eight (6.1%) patients had an ALHA. There were 6 female and 2 male patients. The average age was 54.5 (±10.4) years, and the average body mass index was 28.1 (±5.5) kg/m2. The duration of their GERD symptoms was 16.6 (±6.9) years. Patients underwent LHHR followed by transoral incisionless fundoplication. Hiatoplasty was performed with extracorporeal sliding arthroscopic knots. The ALHA was preserved in all cases. There was no intraoperative bleeding, mortality or postoperative complications. All antireflux medications were discontinued with significant improvement of GERD questionnaires. All patients had EGD at 3 months postoperatively with no recurrence of hiatal hernia. Five patients who had the surgery longer than 1 year ago had an upper gastrointestinal study without evidence of hiatal hernia recurrence. Conclusion The laparoendoscopic technique of hiatal hernia repair, using extracorporeal arthroscopic sliding knots and concomitant transoral incisionless fundoplication, is safe, preserves an ALHA, and allows proper surgical techniques in a confined operative field.","Fanous, Medhat Y",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,265,27

In 2007, our group proposed a theoretical model highlighting the interplay between neurobiological deficits and cognitive and emotional functioning as mediators of the link between genetic influences and early social adversity, on the one hand, and antisocial behavioral problems in childhood, on the other. In this article, we review the post-2007 evidence relevant to this model. We discuss research on genetics/epigenetics, stress/arousal regulation, and emotion and executive functioning in support of the argument that antisocial children, especially those who persist in engaging in antisocial behavior as they grow older, have a range of neuropsychological characteristics that are important in explaining individual differences in the severity and persistence of antisocial behavior. Current clinical practice tends not to acknowledge these individual neuropsychological risks factors or to target them for intervention. We argue that aggressive and disruptive behavior in childhood should be regarded as a neurodevelopmental problem and that intervening at the level of mediating neuropsychological processes represents a promising way forward in tackling these serious behavioral problems.

AIM We examined the clinical feasibility and overall outcomes of SLNB in acral melanoma (AM) of Korean in Kyungpook National University Hospital (KNUH) over the past 13 years. METHODS SLNB in AM patients during 2006-2018 were analyzed retrospectively for sentinel lymph node (SLN) harvesting rate, positivity rate, positivity-relevant overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and its side effects. RESULTS A total of 109 AM patients who underwent SLNB were enrolled. Harvested nodes were identified from 107 patients and SLN harvesting rate was 98.2%. The mean Breslow thickness (±standard deviation) was 3.38 ± 3.03 mm, and the proportion of ulcerated melanomas was 64%. Twenty-two (20.6%) had a tumor-positive SLN and, among them, 82% (18/22) underwent immediate complete lymph node dissection (CLND). The metastasis-positive nodal basin after CLND was detected in 16.7% of cases (3/18). Tumor-negative SLN cohorts showed significantly better OS and DFS than tumor-positive ones (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001 for each). Two side effects, one seroma and one lymphocele, were observed without major sequelae. CONCLUSION SLNB, crucial management of melanoma, proved its efficacy to predict patients' prognosis and could be performed successfully and safely in Korean AM patients by interdisciplinary cooperation between dermatology and other surgical departments. SLN(-) showed significantly better OS and DFS than SLN(+). Significant risk factors for DFS were Breslow thickness, the presence of ulceration and the presence of SLN metastasis. SLNB should be encouraged in order to stage melanoma accurately and direct the proper management in Korean AM.","Sohng, Chihyeon; Sim, Hyun Bo; Kim, Jun Young; Lim, Yangsoo; Han, Man Hoon; Lee, Hoseok; Ahn, Byeong-Cheol; Huh, Seung; Lee, Seok-Jong",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,265,16

Methods and Results: We searched MEDLINE/Embase (from 01.01.2000 to 24.04.2021) for studies including CMR to assess prespecified sources of embolism. Comparison included transthoracic and/or transesophageal echocardiography. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. Estimates of diagnostic yield were reported and pooled. Twenty-seven studies with 2,525 patients were included in a study-level analysis. Most studies had moderate to high risk of bias. Persistent foramen ovale, complex aortic plaques, left ventricular and left atrial thrombus were the most common pathologies. There was no difference in the yield of left ventricular thrombus detection between both modalities for stroke populations (4 studies), but an increased yield of CMR in non-stroke populations (28.1 vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001, 10 studies). The diagnostic yield in stroke patients for detection of persistent foramen ovale was lower in CMR compared to transoesophageal echocardiography (29.3 vs. 53.7%, P < 0.001, 5 studies). For both echocardiography and CMR the clinical impact of the management consequences derived from many of the diagnostic findings remained undetermined in the identified studies. Conclusions: Echocardiography and CMR seem to have similar diagnostic yield for most cardioaortic sources of embolism except persistent foramen ovale and left ventricular thrombus. Randomized controlled diagnostic trials are necessary to understand the impact on the management and potential clinical benefits of the assessment of structural cardioaortic stroke sources.

Monocytes are heterogeneous and characterized by three distinct subsets in humans. Classical and non-classical monocytes represent the most abundant subsets, each carrying out distinct biological functions. Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, more recently, COVID-19. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and, consequently, poor reproducibility. Public transcriptomes provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in the levels of specific cell types. Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (AUC = 0.87~0.88, p<2.2e-16). This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets (r = 0.69, p = 6.7e-4). Consequently, we show that these monocyte subset-specific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets. Our results demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and utility of our computational approach and provide a framework for the discovery of new cellular markers.","Vallania, Francesco; Zisman, Liron; Macaubas, Claudia; Hung, Shu-Chen; Rajasekaran, Narendiran; Mason, Sonia; Graf, Jonathan; Nakamura, Mary; Mellins, Elizabeth D; Khatri, Purvesh",bioRxiv,265,1

Objective: We assess the accuracy of a scale, with the ability to capture ballistocardiography, electrocardiography, and impedance plethysmography signals from a patient's feet while standing on the scale, in measuring stroke volume and cardiac output compared to the gold-standard direct Fick method. Methods: Thirty-two patients with unexplained dyspnea undergoing level 3 invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test at a tertiary medical center were included in the final analysis. We obtained scale and direct Fick measurements of stroke volume and cardiac output before and immediately after invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test. Results: Stroke volume and cardiac output from a cardiac scale and the direct Fick method correlated with r = 0.81 and r = 0.85, respectively (P < 0.001 each). The mean absolute error of the scale estimated stroke volume was -1.58 mL, with a 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of -21.97 mL to 18.81 mL.

Methods: Essential workers were selected from a seroprevalence survey cohort in Geneva, Switzerland and were linked to a state centralized registry compiling SARS-CoV-2 infections. Primary outcome was the number of virologically-confirmed infections from serological assessment (between May and September 2020) to January 25, 2021, according to baseline antibody status and stratified by three pre-defined occupational groups (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity, involving brief regular contact or others). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of infection. Results: 10457 essential workers were included (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity accounted for 3057 individuals, those involving regular brief contact, 3645, and 3755 workers were classified under ''Other essential occupations''). After a follow-up period of over 27 weeks, 5 (0.6%) seropositive and 830 (8.5%) seronegative individuals had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with an incidence rate of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.9 to 3.4) cases per person-week, respectively. Incidences were similar across occupational groups. Seropositive essential workers had a 93% reduction in the hazard (HR of 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) of having a positive test during follow-up with no significant between-occupational group difference. Conclusions: A ten-fold reduction in the hazard of being virologically tested positive was observed among anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive essential workers regardless of their sector of occupation, confirming the seroprotective effect of a previous SARS-CoV2 exposure at least six months after infection.

Therefore, the objective of this research was to find answers to the following questions: can the quality of backyard compost be considered safe in terms of toxicity and nutrient content? Can weed seed dispersion affect the usability of backyard compost? In general, can the circulation of organic matter be increased with the spread of home composting? In this study, 16 different house composts were analysed for stability, weed seed contamination, toxic elements, and nutrient content using analysis of variance. The results of the research showed that the quality properties of the composts (including their weed seed dispersion effect) were greatly influenced by the different techniques and raw materials used. The toxicity levels, as well as the content of macro and microelements, were within the parameters of safe-quality compost. The specific macronutrient (Ca, Mg) and micronutrient (Fe, Mn) contents of the tested composts have a similar and, in some cases, more favorable nutrient supply capacity in crop production than the frequently-used cow manure-based composts. With a plan of basic education on composting, there is potential to encourage farmyard composting.","Ujj, A.; Percsi, K.; Beres, A.; Aleksza, L.; Diaz, F.

Both the continuous accumulation of point mutations, owed to the naturally imposed genomic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary processes, as well as viral spread over time, allow this RNA virus to gain new genetic identities, spawn novel variants and enhance its potential for immune evasion. Here, through an in-depth phylogenetic clustering analysis of upwards of 200,000 whole-genome sequences, we reveal the presence of not previously reported and hitherto unidentified mutations and recombination breakpoints in Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI) from Brazil, India (Beta, Eta and Kappa) and the USA (Beta, Eta and Lambda). Additionally, we identify sites with shared mutations under directional evolution in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-encoding protein of VOC and VOI, tracing a heretofore-undescribed correlation with viral spread in South America, India and the USA. Our evidence-based analysis provides well-supported evidence of similar pathways of evolution for such mutations in all SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages. This raises two pivotal points: the co-circulation of variants and sub-lineages in close evolutionary environments, which sheds light onto their trajectories into convergent and directional evolution (i), and a linear perspective into the prospective vaccine efficacy against different SARS-CoV-2 strains (ii).","Nunes, D.

Aside from the low price, the improved air quality in the suburban area is always a reason for home buyers, but the consistent monitoring of air quality and knowledge about how to plan housing estates are lacking. This paper investigates the relationship between the housing morphology and the air quality in three housing estates in Shenzhen. This research utilizes on-site monitoring equipment to examine negative air ions (NAIs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation to examine the air flow. This study reveals the effect of the urban form on the concentration of NAIs and PM2.5 in spatial variation. A correlation study between the configuration variables of the urban form and the CFD air flow pattern helps to identify the key variables influencing the air quality. This study concludes that in housing estates with good air quality of surroundings, the building density has no remarkable effect. However, the footprint of buildings, the layout of podiums, the roughness length of the building, the distance between buildings, the open space aspect ratio and the mean building height may have a remarkable impact on the air flow and quality. These findings may encourage high-density housing development and provide planning guidance for the configuration of housing forms in Southern China and subtropical climate regions around the world.","Ng, Michelle",Sustainability,265,23

Troubleshooting failed PCRs can be costly in both time and money. Using a crowdsourced data set spanning 290 real PCRs from six active research laboratories, we investigate the degree to which PCR success rates can be improved by machine learning. While human designed PCRs succeed at a rate of 55–63%, we find that a machine learning model can accurately predict reaction outcome 81% of the time. We validate this level of improvement by then using the model to guide the design and predict the outcome of 39 new PCR experiments. In addition to improving outcomes, the model identifies 15 features of PCRs that researchers did not optimize well compared to the learned model. These results suggest that PCR success rates can easily be improved by 17–26%, potentially saving millions of dollars and thousands of hours of researcher time each year across the scientific community. Other common laboratory methods may benefit from similar data-driven optimization effort.","Cordaro, Nicholas J.; Kavran, Andrew J.; Smallegan, Michael; Palacio, Megan; Lammer, Nickolaus; Brant, Tyler S.; DuMont, Vanessa; Garcia, Naiara Doherty; Miller, Suzannah; Jourabchi, Tara; Sawyer, Sara L.; Clauset, Aaron",bioRxiv,265,11

As physical spaces become harder to access, there is a growing shift towards the use of virtual spaces for remote work, education and entertainment. In 2020, brick-and-mortar spaces like museums, art exhibits and galleries were especially affected by a lack of visitors. Shifting to a virtual medium would allow these entities to reach out and retain visitors more effectively. However, the use of virtual spaces to support these kinds of services is still quite under-explored. Presence, engagement and a real connection are difficult to establish through virtual exhibits. To explore these challenges, we partnered with the Liberation War Museum in Bangladesh and created a web-based 3D virtual museum to represent three of their historical galleries. Each virtual gallery has a different presentation modality - “self-guided”, “avatar-guided” and “game-based”. We sought to explain which of these artifact presentation modes led to the best performance in learnability, usability and engagement by conducting a user study. Our findings and user feedback are presented in this paper. We hope that these findings will be useful for designing virtual experiences that can allow users to learn and engage with virtual artifacts as effectively as they would with real-world ones. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dasgupta, A.; Williams, S.; Nelson, G.; Manuel, M.; Dasgupta, S.; Gračanin, D.","9th International Conference on Culture and Computing, C and C 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021",265,26

These range from minor disruptions, such as power outages, to significant operational changes, including system reconfiguration to handle unique earthquake sequences and the need to handle distributed work during a pandemic. Our ability to overcome crises is built on the development and implementation of a continuity of operations plan, well-designed infrastructure, adaptive software systems, experienced staff, and extensive collaboration. The NEIC does not operate in a vacuum but benefits from contributions of United States and international seismic networks. Similarly, the overall resilience of earthquake monitoring in the United States and around the globe benefits from the NEIC's role as the national center for the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). Here, we highlight significant adaptations the NEIC has made in the face of crises. We discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents the most significant operational crisis to impact the NEIC. The NEIC has maintained continuous operations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by shifting from a fully onsite operations center to a distributed hybrid of onsite and telework staffing. We then discuss cases in which the NEIC has supported regional monitoring in the face of significant crises. In 2018, the NEIC assisted the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory with the Kilauea volcano eruption by responding to large events, implementing contingency monitoring procedures, and calculating moment magnitudes for the low-frequency caldera collapses. Impacts of a crisis extend beyond the immediate response and often require a significant postevent assessment and a rebuilding phase. After the 2017 Hurricane Maria, the NEIC, the USGS National Strong-Motion Program, and the USGS Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory worked with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network and the Puerto Rico Strong-Motion program to assess, plan, and implement upgrades at sites that experienced storm damage.","Earle, P.

To gain further insight into pathways that regulate translation in reovirus-infected cells, we performed a comparative microarray analysis of cellular gene expression following infection with two strains of reovirus that inhibit host translation (clone 8 and clone 87) and one strain that does not (Dearing). Infection with clone 8 and clone 87 significantly increased the expression of cellular genes characteristic of stress responses, including the integrated stress response. Infection with these same strains decreased transcript and protein levels of P58(IPK), the cellular inhibitor of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) kinases PKR and PERK. Since infection with host shutoff-inducing strains of reovirus impacted cellular pathways that control eIF2alpha phosphorylation and unphosphorylated eIF2alpha is required for translation initiation, we examined reovirus replication in a variety of cell lines with mutations that impact eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Our results revealed that reovirus replication is more efficient in the presence of eIF2alpha kinases and phosphorylatable eIF2alpha. When eIF2alpha is phosphorylated, it promotes the synthesis of ATF4, a transcription factor that controls cellular recovery from stress. We found that the presence of this transcription factor increased reovirus yields 10- to 100-fold. eIF2alpha phosphorylation also led to the formation of stress granules in reovirus-infected cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that eIF2alpha phosphorylation facilitates reovirus replication in two ways-first, by inducing ATF4 synthesis, and second, by creating an environment that places abundant reovirus transcripts at a competitive advantage for limited translational components.","Smith, Jennifer A; Schmechel, Stephen C; Raghavan, Arvind; Abelson, Michelle; Reilly, Cavan; Katze, Michael G; Kaufman, Randal J; Bohjanen, Paul R; Schiff, Leslie A",Journal of virology,265,33

Previous studies have suggested that the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) acts as a key target in regulating the neuroinflammatory response. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, and effective DRD2 agonists are lacking. In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of sinomenine (Sino), a monomeric compound with potential immunoregulatory properties in nervous system. METHODS TTC staining, apoptosis assay, evaluation of brain edema, and neurological assessment were performed in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model. Primary astrocytes exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were used in the in vitro experiments. Quantitative PCR was applied to assess the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Multi-labeling immunofluorescence, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were also used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the Sino-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS Sino remarkably attenuated the cerebral infarction and neuronal apoptosis, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and alleviated neurological deficiency in MCAO mice. Sino significantly inhibited astrocytic activation and STAT3 phosphorylation as well as increased DRD2 and αB-crystallin (CRYAB) expression after MCAO. In vitro, Sino blocked OGD-induced activation of STAT3 and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes, and these effects were significantly abolished by either DRD2 or CRYAB knockdown. Additionally, Sino induced up-regulation and nuclear translocation of CRYAB in astrocytes and enhanced the interaction between CRYAB and STAT3, which further inhibited the activation and DNA-binding activity of STAT3. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that Sino activates astrocytic DRD2 and thereby suppresses neuroinflammation via the CRYAB/STAT3 pathway, which sheds some light on a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.","Qiu, Jing; Yan, Zhongjun; Tao, Kai; Li, Yansong; Li, Yuqian; Li, Jingchen; Dong, Yushu; Feng, Dayun; Chen, Huisheng",Journal of neuroinflammation,265,1

In countries where authentic alcoholic beverages are expensive, restricted, or banned for religious or other reasons, some people resort to purchasing alcoholic drinks made illegally. These clandestine sources of ""booze"" often contain high concentrations of methanol, added by the perpetrators to enhance potency and increase profits. Although an effective medical treatment for methanol poisoning exists, because most such incidents occur in socially deprived parts of the world, the hospital emergency facilities are scarce and/or inadequate. Trace amounts of methanol (median ~1.0 mg/L) are produced endogenously via certain enzymatic processes, such as one-carbon metabolism. Methanol and methyl esters are also contained in fresh fruits and vegetables as well as in alcoholic beverages. During a period of heavy drinking the blood-methanol concentration (BMC) increases and might surpass 10 mg/L, which is considered a biomarker for alcohol abuse and alcoholism. Methanol itself has a low intrinsic toxicity, but is converted in the body into two highly toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid. This metabolism is delayed by co-ingestion of ethanol, which creates a latent period of 12-24 h before toxic symptoms develop. Accordingly, when patients are admitted to hospital for diagnosis and treatment, a life-threatening metabolic acidosis has already developed and is irreversible. Symptoms of methanol poisoning include blurred vision, breathlessness, nausea, gastric pains, and acid-base disturbances and deficiency of oxygen in arterial blood. The visual disturbances might even develop into permanent blindness, owing to an interaction of toxic metabolites with the optic nerve. The minimum lethal dose of ethanol in humans is not easy to specify, because most poisonings involve co-ingestion of ethanol, which to some extent protects the patient from toxic sequelae. Effective antidotes for treatment of methanol poisoning are administration of ethanol or the therapeutic drug fomepizole (Antizol®), which is 4-methyl pyrazole (4-MP). Both treatments work by blocking the metabolism of methanol by liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The metabolic acidosis caused by the accumulation of formic acid in the body is treated with sodium bicarbonate, which helps to normalize pH in the bloodstream. Thereafter, methanol and its metabolites in the blood are removed by hemodialysis. However, the long-term prognosis for survivors of methanol poisoning is not good, because many are elderly males who are in poor health and often suffer from an alcohol-use disorder.","Jones, A W",Forensic science review,265,28

Immunohistochemistry was used, with monoclonal antibodies, to detect the thyroglobulin (TG), calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the thyroid glands. RESULTS Deformation, enlargement, and dystrophy of follicular cells in thyroid glands were found in the SARS patients. The normal follicular epithelial cells were strongly TG positive, however, the number and intensity of TG positive follicular epithelial cells were significantly lower in the SARS patients. Calcitonin positive cells were found in the normal thyroid glands and not in the thyroid glands of the SARS patients. PTH positive cells were seen in the normal thyroid glands and those of the SARS patients with a slightly weaker intensity of reaction, however, with significant difference in IOD (P < 0.01) and without significant difference in mean slight absorption MOD (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION The thyroid tissue structure and morphology in SARS patients were significantly changed, involving both follicular epithelial cells and parafollicular cells; which may imply that the hormonal production of follicular epithelial cells and the parafollicular cells were affected.","Sun, Shen; Wei, Lan; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Yun; He, Feng-Jun; Gu, Jiang",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,265,1

Physical and chemical barriers to prevent microbial contamination of food are hurdles that block or reduce the transfer of pathogens to the food surface from the hands of a food worker, from other foods, or from the environment. In food service operations, direct contact of food by hands should be prevented by the use of barriers, especially when gloves are not worn. Although these barriers have been used for decades in food processing and food service operations, their effectiveness is sometimes questioned or their use may be ignored. Physical barriers include properly engineered building walls and doors to minimize the flow of outside particles and pests to food storage and food preparation areas; food shields to prevent aerosol contamination of displayed food by customers and workers; work clothing designated strictly for work (clothing worn outdoors can carry undesirable microorganisms, including pathogens from infected family members, into the work environment); and utensils such as spoons, tongs, and deli papers to prevent direct contact between hands and the food being prepared or served. Money and ready-to-eat foods should be handled as two separate operations, preferably by two workers. Chemical barriers include sanitizing solutions used to remove microorganisms (including pathogens) from objects or materials used during food production and preparation and to launder uniforms, work clothes, and soiled linens.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: Bibliographic, epidemiological, medico-statistical, sociological methods were used. Scientific literature, data from the Center of Medical Statistics of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine concerning population health and dermatovenerological establishments activity on 2000-2019, data of authors` own sociological researches on opinion of dermatovenerological profile experts about available problems and ways of their decision were analyzed. RESULTS Results: A long-term tendency towards a decrease in the incidence of skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases by 8,6% during 2000-2017 and the incidence of venereal diseases during 2000-2019 was revealed (for syphilis - by 15,5 times, gonorrhea - by 6,8 times). At the same time, during 2014-2019 there was an increase in the incidence of atopic dermatitis by 3,6%, of contact dermatitis - by 5,2%, of trichophytia and microsporia by 22,6%, as well as increase in the prevalence of psoriasis - by 6,0%. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases remains significant. Trends in recent years indicate a deterioration in dermatological health and an increasing need for medical services. During healthcare reforming over the course of nineteen years there was a reduction in the amount of dermatovenerologists and their number per population by 31,5%, the amount of dermatological institutions - by 2,6 times and beds - by 3,9 times. According to 18,6±3,1 per 100 surveyed respondents, the availability of dermatovenerological care to the population is low, and its deterioration in the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed by 80,1±4,0. Some factors that negatively affect the quality of medical services have been identified: insufficient amount and quality of medical equipment (57,1±4,0 per 100 respondents), insufficient opportunity for continuous professional development (34,0±3,8); lack of computers (30,8±3,7); lack of motivation to improve the quality of work (28,8±3,6).

The effects of persistence on the virus are difficult to study in vivo but may have a crucial influence on the course of infection. We therefore produced a persistent infection in vitro using the neurotropic coronavirus JHM, in order to investigate the events underlying the establishment of such an infection and the adaptation of the virus to persistence. The persistent infection was maintained for over 115 passages and continued to release high levels of infectious virus. During the 18 months of culture the number of cells expressing virus antigen detected by indirect immune fluorescence decreased to 40%. Analysis showed that the carried virus contained a significant proportion of heterogeneous temperature-sensitive mutants. All virus clones isolated possessed the capacity to induce a more productive growth cycle, a less pronounced cytopathic effect and showed a much reduced neurovirulence when inoculated into newborn and weanling rats. Evidence for structural changes involving the surface peplomer protein (E2) was obtained using hybridoma antibodies, which neutralized the parental JHM virus but not the JHM-Pi virus. Defective interfering particles and interferon activities have been excluded as possible agents instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of the chronic infection, and we suggest that the emergence of virus variants of lowered virulence is central to these processes.","Baybutt, H N; Wege, H; Carter, M J; ter Meulen, V",The Journal of general virology,265,16

Higher earnings volatility is frequently associated with greater risk. Consequently, firms could be inspired to engage in earnings management or derivative use as attempts to mitigate earnings volatility. Using a sample of 169 of the largest non-financial firms with 507 firm-years observations from an emerging market, the researchers examined the relationship among derivative use, earnings volatility, and earnings management. The results of a panel regression analysis showed that derivative use by Malaysian public listed companies was positively connected with earnings volatility, inferring that the use of derivatives did not mitigate earnings volatility as intended. This study also found that both earnings volatility and derivative use have a positive relationship with earnings management. This implies that firms engage in earnings management to curb earnings volatility under circumstances where derivative use is associated with higher earnings volatility. Evidence derived from this study contributes to extant literature on financial risk management involving financial instruments, an area that is very much understudied in the contexts of emerging markets.","Phua, Lian Kee Lok Char-Lee Chua Yong Xia Lim Tan-Chin",Malaysian Journal of Economic Studies,265,16

We prove that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such nontrivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the outbreak is a nonmonotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions. Far from herd immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be particularly challenging.","Radicchi, Filippo; Bianconi, Ginestra",Phys Rev E,265,24

Exploring the spatial pattern and influencing factors of the incidence of COVID-19(PRcovid) at the city level can provide insights into urban sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between the incidence of COVID-19 and population migration and socioeconomic factors in Chinese cities. Based on the geographically weighted regression(GWR) model,we analyzed the impact of the migration rate of all other cities across the country(MRall), migration rate of Wuhan(MRwuhan), GDP per capita(GDPPC), green area per capita(GApc), number of medical staff per capita(NMSpc) and public expenditure per capita(PEpc) on the PRcovidin 282 cities in China. The results show that:(1) The explanatory power of GWR model on PRcovid(overall R~2= 0.40) was significantly higher than that of ordinary least squares linear regression model(overall R~2= 0.02).(2) The impact of MRwuhandecreased with increasing distance from Wuhan, except for parts of Northeast and Southwest China.(3) GDPpcplayed a positive role in controlling the PRcovidin the more developed southeast region.(4) The indicators of GApcand NMSpconly effected positively in small parts of the country, excluding cities around Wuhan.In contrast, PEpcplayed a key role in controlling the PCcovidin the surrounding areas of Wuhan.In conclusion, the incidence of COVID-19 in Chinese cities and its relationship with migration/urban socioeconomic indicators showed clear spatial patterns.

In this study, the popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) will be used to forecast the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered cases, and the number of deaths in Pakistan from COVID-19 spanning June 25, 2020 to July 04, 2020 (10 days ahead forecast). METHODS: To meet the desire objectives, data for this study have been taken from the Ministry of National Health Service of Pakistan's website from February 27, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Two different ARIMA models will be used to obtain the next 10 days ahead point and 95% interval forecast of the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Statistical software, RStudio, with ""forecast"", ""ggplot2"", ""tseries"", and ""seasonal"" packages have been used for data analysis. RESULTS: The forecasted cumulative confirmed cases, recovered, and the number of deaths up to July 04, 2020 are 231239 with a 95% prediction interval of (219648, 242832), 111616 with a prediction interval of (101063, 122168), and 5043 with a 95% prediction interval of (4791, 5295) respectively. Statistical measures i.e. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for model accuracy. It is evident from the analysis results that the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA model is better than the other time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy and hence recommended to be used for forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from this study that the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA models in terms of RMSE, and MAE are better than the other time series models, and therefore could be considered a good forecasting tool in forecasting the spread, recoveries, and deaths from the current outbreak of COVID-19. Besides, this study can also help the decision-makers in developing short-term strategies with regards to the current number of disease occurrences until an appropriate medication is developed.","Ali, Muhammad; Khan, Dost Muhammad; Aamir, Muhammad; Khalil, Umair; Khan, Zardad",PLoS One,265,12

Moreover, exosomes has been reported to play an important role in COVID-19 recurrence, and thus may interact with the expression of circRNA and lncRNA. In this work, we sequenced circRNA, lncRNA and mRNA from recurrent COVID-19 patients and healthy people, and compared the differences. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis show that differentially expressed circRNA and lncRNA are mainly involved in the regulation of host cell cycle, apoptosis, immune inflammation, signaling pathway and other processes. The comparison to exosomes related databases shows that there are 114 differentially expressed circRNA, and 10 differentially expressed lncRNA related to exosomes. These studies provide reference for exploring circRNA and lncRNA to study the infection mechanism of COVID-19, their diagnostic and therapeutic values, as well as the possibility to employ them as biomarkers.","Wu, Yingping; Zhao, Tiejun; Deng, Riqiang; Xia, Xiaoping; Li, Bin; Wang, Xunzhang",Sci Rep,265,16

RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers an agnostic tool for the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA respiratory viruses in PUIs. Herein, we used RNA mNGS to assess the frequencies of alternative viral infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative PUIs (n=30) and viral co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs (n=45). mNGS identified all viruses detected by routine clinical testing (Influenza A (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=2), Human coronavirus OC43 (N=2) and Human coronavirus HKU1(N=1)). mNGS also identified both co-infections (1, 2.2%) and alternative viral infections (4, 13.3%) that were not detected by routine clinical workup (Respiratory syncytial virus (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=1), Human coronavirus NL63 (N=1)).

Since COVID-19 is a new phenomenon with limited information available, it may have adverse psychological effects on pregnant women. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the status of depression, stress, anxiety and their predictors in Iranian pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 205 pregnant women covered by Tabriz health centers in Iran. The sampling method used was cluster sampling. The data collection tool was the socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), which were completed online by pregnant women. The general linear model was used to determine the predictive factors of depression, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score of depression, stress, and anxiety were 3.91 (3.9), 6.22 (4.25), and 3.79 (3.39), respectively; the score range of 0 to 21. Depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms were observed in 32.7, 32.7, and 43.9% of the participants, respectively, with varying degrees from mild to very severe. Based on the adjusted general linear model, variables of education level, spouse's job and marital life satisfaction were the predictors of depressive symptoms. Variables of spouse's education level, spouse's support, marital life satisfaction and the number of pregnancies were the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and the variables of spouse's education level, household income sufficiency, spouse's support and marital life satisfaction were predictors of stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of marital life satisfaction, high level of spouse's education and income in reducing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women in critical situations such as the prevalence of COVID-19, it seems that using strategies to promote marital life satisfaction and socio-economic status can play an effective role in controlling anxiety and reducing stress and depression in pregnant women.","Effati-Daryani, Fatemeh; Zarei, Somayeh; Mohammadi, Azam; Hemmati, Elnaz; Ghasemi Yngyknd, Sakineh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",BMC Psychol,265,20

However, the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of dialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mental health of dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period preceding the pandemic. METHODS: Data originate from the ongoing multicentre observational Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes (DOMESTICO). Patients who filled in a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire during the pandemic and six to three months prior were included. The mean difference in Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) was analysed with multilevel linear regression. A McNemar test was used to compare presence of mental health-related symptoms during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients were included. The mean MCS score prior to COVID-19 was 48.08 ± 10.15, and 49.00 ± 10.04 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted mean MCS score was 0.93 point (95% CI - 0.57 to 2.42) higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the period prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, no difference in the presence of the following mental health-related symptoms was found during the COVID-19 pandemic: feeling anxious, feeling sad, worrying, feeling nervous, trouble falling asleep, and trouble staying asleep. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of dialysis patients appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Dialysis patients may be better able to cope with the pandemic, since they have high resilience and are less impacted by social distancing measures.

AIM: To explore the views and experiences of Twitter social media users who reported that a relative, friend or acquaintance died of COVID-19 without a family member/friend present. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis of English-language tweets. DATA SOURCES: Twitter data collected 7-20th April 2020. A bespoke software system harvested selected publicly-available tweets from the Twitter application programming interface. After filtering we hand-screened tweets to include only those referring to a relative, friend or acquaintance who died alone of COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: 9328 tweets were hand-screened; 196 were included. Twitter users expressed sadness, despair, hopelessness and anger about their experience and loss. Saying goodbye via video-conferencing technology was viewed ambivalently. Clinicians' presence during a death was little consolation. Anger, frustration and blame were directed at governments' inaction/policies or the public. The sadness of not being able to say goodbye as wished was compounded by lack of social support and disrupted after-death rituals. Users expressed a sense of political neglect/mistreatment alongside calls for action. They also used the platform to reinforce public health messages, express condolences and pay tribute. CONCLUSION: Twitter was used for collective mourning and support and to promote public health messaging. End-of-life care providers should facilitate and optimise contact with loved ones, even when strict visitation policies are necessary, and provide proactive bereavement support.","Selman, Lucy E; Chamberlain, Charlotte; Sowden, Ryann; Chao, Davina; Selman, Daniel; Taubert, Mark; Braude, Philip",Palliat Med,265,16

We consider ALPs produced by the intense gamma ray flux available from megawatt-scale nuclear reactors at neutrino experiments through Primakoff-like or Compton-like channels. Low-threshold detectors in close proximity to the core will have visibility to ALP decays and inverse Primakoff and Compton scattering, providing sensitivity to the ALP-photon and ALP-electron couplings. We find that the sensitivity to these couplings at the ongoing MINER neutrino experiment exceeds existing limits set by laboratory experiments and, for the ALP-electron coupling, we forecast the world's best laboratory-based constraints over a large portion of the sub-MeV ALP mass range.","Dent, James B.; Dutta, Bhaskar; Kim, Doojin; Liao, Shu; Mahapatra, Rupak; Sinha, Kuver; Thompson, Adrian",,265,19

Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of ß-arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different MOR active conformations from those stabilized by classical opioid drugs or G protein-biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of MOR and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes is unknown. Here, we report the results of sub-millisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a predicted methadone-bound MOR complex, and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classical opioid morphine and the G protein-biased ligand TRV130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov State Models (MSMs) and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of MOR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintainance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function, in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction. In particular, we present details of a methadone-specific active conformation of the µ-opioid receptor that has thus far eluded experimental structural characterization.","Kapoor, Abhijeet; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta",Mol. pharmacol,265,20

Diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) and hyperglycemia are among the major comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 leading to poor outcomes. Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular ""receptor"" and port of viral entry. The preexisting chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (""cytokine storm"") that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID-19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID-19 should these patients contract the viral infection. Once the infection occurs, then attention should be directed to proper glycemic control with use of insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.","Rajpal, Aman; Rahimi, Leili; Ismail-Beigi, Faramarz",J. diabetes (Online),265,1

Methods: Searches were conducted in May 2020 in PubMed, medRxiv, arXiv, Scopus, WHO COVID-19 database, Compendex & Inspec. We included studies reporting data on any indoor setting except schools, any indoor activities and any potential means of transmission. Articles were screened by a single reviewer, with rejections assessed by a second reviewer. We used Joanna Briggs Institute and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools for evaluating epidemiological studies and developed bespoke tools for the evaluation of study types not covered by these instruments. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by a single reviewer. We conducted a meta-analysis of secondary attack rates in household transmission. Otherwise, data were synthesised narratively. Results: We identified 1573 unique articles. After screening and quality assessment, fifty-eight articles were retained for analysis. Experimental evidence from fluid mechanics and microbiological studies demonstrates that aerosolised transmission is theoretically possible; however, we found no conclusive epidemiological evidence of this occurring. The evidence suggests that ventilation systems have the potential to decrease virus transmission near the source through dilution but to increase transmission further away from the source through dispersal. We found no evidence for faecal-oral transmission. Laboratory studies suggest that the virus survives for longer on smooth surfaces and at lower temperatures. Environmental sampling studies have recovered small amounts of viral RNA from a wide range of frequently touched objects and surfaces; however, epidemiological studies are inconclusive on the extent of fomite transmission. We found many examples of transmission in settings characterised by close and prolonged indoor contact. We estimate a pooled secondary attack rate within households of 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9, 13). There were insufficient data to evaluate the transmission risks associated with specific activities. Workplace challenges related to poverty warrant further investigation as potential risk factors for workplace transmission. Fluid mechanics evidence on the physical properties of droplets generated by coughing, speaking and breathing reinforce the importance of maintaining 2 m social distance to reduce droplet transmission. Conclusions: This review provides a snap-shot of evidence on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments from the early months of the pandemic. The overall quality of the evidence was low. As the quality and quantity of available evidence grows, it will be possible to reach firmer conclusions on the risk factors for and mechanisms of indoor transmission.","Goodwin, Lara; Hayward, Toneka; Krishan, Prerna; Nolan, Gemma; Nundy, Madhurima; Ostrishko, Kayla; Attili, Antonio; Cárceles, Salva Barranco; Epelle, Emmanuel I; Gabl, Roman; Pappa, Evanthia J; Stajuda, Mateusz; Zen, Simone; Dozier, Marshall; Anderson, Niall; Viola, Ignazio M; McQuillan, Ruth",J Glob Health,265,24

A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen was used for the diagnosis. Initial Ct values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests were recorded. 22.9 was the 50th percentile Ct value of the study population. The study population was divided into two groups based on their Ct values: (1) Cases with Higher Ct values (Ct > 22.9)(n = 50) and (2) Cases with lower Ct values (Ct &#8804; 22.9)(n = 55). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, disease progression, laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the performance of Ct values in predicting obstetric complications. RESULTS: Obstetric complication rate was significantly higher in cases with lower Ct values (p < .001). A significantly lower lymphocyte count together with higher ESR, procalcitonin and IL-6 values were observed in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). Additionally, a significantly higher NICU admission rate and longer hospital stays were present in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05).

Previously, he had experienced four times of malaria infection. He had a history of positive non-falciparum malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) two days before admission. Significant findings were epigastric tenderness, splenomegaly, and severe thrombocytopenia of 36×103 cells / µL. A naso-oropharyngeal swab examination revealed a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, he was hospitalized for 12 days, successfully treated, and discharged without sequelae. Thus, in light of a pandemic, physicians need to raise the suspicion of concurrent COVID-19 infection with other tropical diseases, especially at-risk patients, because malaria and COVID-19 may share similar manifestations.

The possible mechanism of protection through their immunoregulatory and paracrine action has been reviewed extensively. However, the importance of process control in achieving consistent cell quality, maximum safety and efficacy-for which the three key questions are which, when and how much-remains unaddressed. Any commonality, if it exists, in ongoing clinical trials has yet to be analyzed and reviewed. In this review, the authors have therefore compiled study design data from ongoing clinical trials to address the key questions of ""which"" with regard to tissue source, donor profile, isolation technique, culture conditions, long-term culture and cryopreservation of MSCs; ""when"" with regard to defining the transplantation window by identifying and staging patients based on their pro-inflammatory profile; and ""how much"" with regard to the number of cells in a single administration, number of doses and route of transplantation.

Oxidative stress and a resulting disturbance of mitochondrial function are likely to be common denominators for many forms of fatigue, and antioxidant treatments have been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of fatigue. In this study, we review the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in fatigue and the antioxidant effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen.

METHODS: Eligible women (N = 39,444) were aged &#8805;18 years and received a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, or breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, at 7 academic and community breast imaging facilities in North Carolina. Changes in the number of mammography or breast biopsy examinations after March 3, 2020 (the first COVID-19 diagnosis in North Carolina) were evaluated and compared with the expected numbers based on trends between January 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020. Changes in the predicted mean monthly number of examinations were estimated using interrupted time series models. Differences in patient characteristics were tested using least squares means regression. RESULTS: Fewer examinations than expected were received after the pandemic's onset. Maximum reductions occurred in March 2020 for screening mammography (-85.1%; 95% CI, -100.0%, -70.0%) and diagnostic mammography (-48.9%; 95% CI, -71.7%, -26.2%) and in May 2020 for biopsies (-40.9%; 95% CI, -57.6%, -24.3%). The deficit decreased gradually, with no significant difference between observed and expected numbers by July 2020 (diagnostic mammography) and August 2020 (screening mammography and biopsy). Several months after the pandemic's onset, women who were receiving care had higher predicted breast cancer risk (screening mammography, P < .001) and more commonly lacked insurance (diagnostic mammography, P < .001; biopsy, P < .001) compared with the prepandemic population. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-associated deficits in the number of breast examinations decreased over time. Utilization differed by breast cancer risk and insurance status, but not by age or race/ethnicity. Long-term studies are needed to clarify the contribution of these trends to breast cancer disparities.","Nyante, Sarah J; Benefield, Thad S; Kuzmiak, Cherie M; Earnhardt, Kathryn; Pritchard, Michael; Henderson, Louise M",Cancer,265,16

On the basis of available data about peripheral arterial chemoreception and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a potential involvement in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be hypothesized through different mechanisms. The CB could be a site of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, due to local expression of its receptor [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2] and an alternative route of nervous system invasion, through retrograde transport along the carotid sinus nerve. The CB function could be affected by COVID-19-induced inflammatory/immune reactions and/or ACE1/ACE2 imbalance, both at local or systemic level. Increased peripheral arterial chemosensitivity and reflex sympatho-activation may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic comorbidities.","Porzionato, Andrea; Emmi, Aron; Stocco, Elena; Barbon, Silvia; Boscolo-Berto, Rafael; Macchi, Veronica; De Caro, Raffaele",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,265,20

The authors conduct a systematic review on endovascular treatment methods of mycotic aneurysms. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies published between 1986 and 2020. All studies assessing outcomes related to endovascular Onyx embolization, NBCA embolization, or coiling were included. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies were ultimately selected, including 180 (67% male) patients comprising 243 aneurysms treated endovascularly. The mean age was 38.2 ± 17.6 years, and the most common symptom on presentation is headache (31%). Most aneurysms were located on the MCA (52.5%), and over half presented with rupture (53.8%). Coiling was the most commonly employed technique (50.4%), and obliteration rates were comparable across coiling, NBCA, and Onyx (99.1%, 100%, 100%, respectively). Complication rates were also comparable (4.3% vs 15.2% vs 8.1%). CONCLUSION: Embolization for infectious intracranial aneurysm (IIAs) appears to be an effective treatment option for mycotic aneurysms. Embolization rates were comparable between coiling, NBCA, and onyx embolization. Non-inferiority among these modalities cannot be demonstrated given the retrospective nature of this review, evolution of endovascular techniques over the years, and changes in treatment paradigms in the last two decades. Ideally, further prospective research will be needed to find which treatment method offers the lowest complication rates and the best outcomes for patients with mycotic aneurysms.","Desai, Bhargav; Soldozy, Sauson; Desai, Harshal; Kumar, Jeyan; Shah, Smit; Raper, Daniel M; Park, Min S",World neurosurgery (Online),265,27

This study sought to investigate the association between mental health (eg, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and sleep health among a sample of Jordanians living through a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown. METHODS: Using Facebook, participants (n=1240) in Jordan in March 2020 were recruited and direct to a web-based survey measuring anxiety (items from General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale instrument), depressive symptoms (items from Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), sleep health (items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and sociodemographic. A modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs were estimated to examine how anxiety and depressive symptoms may affect different dimensions of sleep health: (1) poor sleep quality, (2) short sleep duration, (3) encountering sleep problems. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported having experienced mild (33.8%), moderate (12.9%) or severe (6.3%) levels of anxiety during lockdown, and nearly half of respondents reported depressive symptoms during lockdown. Similarly, over 60% of participants reported having experienced at least one sleep problem in the last week, and nearly half reported having had short sleep duration. Importantly, anxiety was associated with poor sleep health outcomes. For example, corresponding to the dose-response relationship between anxiety and sleep health outcomes, those reporting severe anxiety were the most likely to experience poor sleep quality (aPRâ¯=8.95; 95% CI=6.12 to 13.08), short sleep duration (aPRâ¯=2.23; 95% CI=1.91 to 2.61) and at least one problem sleep problem (aPR=1.73; 95% CI=1.54 to 1.95). Moreover, depressive symptoms were also associated with poor sleep health outcomes. As compared with scoring in the first quartile, scoring fourth quartile was associated with poor sleep quality (aPR=11.82; 95% CI=6.64 to 21.04), short sleep duration (aPR=1.87; 95% CI=1.58 to 2.22), and experiencing at least one sleep problem (aPR=1.90; 95% CI=1.66 to 2.18). CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms can negatively influence sleep health among a sample of Jordanian adults living in a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown.","Al-Ajlouni, Yazan A; Park, Su Hyun; Alawa, Jude; Shamaileh, Ghaith; Bawab, Aziz; El-Sadr, Wafaa M; Duncan, Dustin T",BMJ Open,265,20

Their interaction indeed modifies the self-assembly propensity of the peptide that is at the origin of the deposition of insoluble peptide aggregates in the amyloid plaque, a hallmark found in AD brains. Another even more important fallout of the Cu binding to Aß peptide is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to the overall oxidative stress detected in the disease and is due to the redox ability of the Cu ions. Many therapeutic approaches are currently developed to aid fighting against AD, one of them targeting the redox-active Cu ions. Along this research line, we report in the present article the use of a phenanthroline-based peptide-like ligand (L), which is able to withdraw Cu from Aß and redox-silence it in a very stable 4N Cu(II) binding site even in the presence of Zn(II). In addition and in contrast to what is usually observed, the presence of excess of L lessens the searched effect of ROS production prevention, but it is counterbalanced by the co-presence of Zn(II). To explain such unprecedented trends, we proposed a mechanism that involves the redox reaction between Cu(II)L and Cu(I)L2. We thus illustrated (i) how speciation and redox chemistry can weaken the effect of a ligand that would have appeared perfectly suitable if only tested in a 1:1 ratio and on CuAß and (ii) how Zn overcomes the undesired lessening of ROS arrest due to excess of ligand. In brief, we have shown how working in biologically relevant conditions is important for the understanding of all of the reactions at play and this must be taken into consideration for the further rational design of ligands aiming to become drug candidates.","Esmieu, Charlène; Balderrama-Martínez-Sotomayor, Raúl; Conte-Daban, Amandine; Iranzo, Olga; Hureau, Christelle",Inorg Chem,265,32

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in adults aged 60 years and older. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy adults aged 60 years and older in Renqiu (Hebei, China). Vaccine or placebo was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (days 0 and 28). Phase 1 comprised a dose-escalation study, in which participants were allocated to two blocks: block 1 (3 µg inactivated virus in 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide solution per injection) and block 2 (6 µg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo (aluminium hydroxide solution only). In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) using block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 µg, 3 µg, or 6 µg per dose, or placebo. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was seroconversion rate at 28 days after the second injection (which was assessed in all participants who had received the two doses of vaccine according to their random assignment, had antibody results available, and did not violate the trial protocol). Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative at baseline to seropositive for neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 (positive cutoff titre 1/8), or a four-fold titre increase if the participant was seropositive at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04383574). FINDINGS: Between May 22 and June 1, 2020, 72 participants (24 in each intervention group and 24 in the placebo group; mean age 65·8 years [SD 4·8]) were enrolled in phase 1, and between June 12 and June 15, 2020, 350 participants were enrolled in phase 2 (100 in each intervention group and 50 in the placebo group; mean age 66·6 years [SD 4·7] in 349 participants). In the safety populations from both phases, any adverse reaction within 28 days after injection occurred in 20 (20%) of 100 participants in the 1·5 µg group, 25 (20%) of 125 in the 3 µg group, 27 (22%) of 123 in the 6 µg group, and 15 (21%) of 73 in the placebo group. All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity and injection site pain (39 [9%] of 421 participants) was the most frequently reported event. As of Aug 28, 2020, eight serious adverse events, considered unrelated to vaccination, have been reported by seven (2%) participants. In phase 1, seroconversion after the second dose was observed in 24 of 24 participants (100·0% [95% CI 85·8-100·0]) in the 3 µg group and 22 of 23 (95·7% [78·1-99·9]) in the 6 µg group. In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 88 of 97 participants in the 1·5 µg group (90·7% [83·1-95·7]), 96 of 98 in the 3 µg group (98·0% [92·8-99·8]), and 97 of 98 (99·0% [94·5-100·0]) in the 6 µg group. There were no detectable antibody responses in the placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: CoronaVac is safe and well tolerated in older adults. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3 µg dose were similar to those of the 6 µg dose, and higher than those of the 1·5 µg dose, supporting the use of the 3 µg dose CoronaVac in phase 3 trials to assess protection against COVID-19.

We hypothesized that preinjury use of marijuana would be associated with improved outcomes in severely injured trauma patients. METHODS: All adult (18+ y) level I and level II trauma activations who presented to two large regional trauma centers between 2014 and 2018 were reviewed. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)- indicated absence of drugs confirmed by testing and as THC + confirmed THC without another drug present. RESULTS: Of the 4849 patients included, 1373 (28.3%) were THC+. The THC + cohort was younger, had more males, and was more likely to be injured by penetrating mechanism (P < 0.001 for all) than THC-. THC + patients had shorter median length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (P < 0.001). Mortality rate was lower in the THC + group (4.3% versus 7.6%, P < 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis. THC + patients with traumatic brain injury had shorter hospital LOS (P = 0.025) and shorter ventilator days (P = 0.033) than THC- patients. In patients with Injury Severity Score &#8805;16, THC + patients had significantly lower intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.009) and mortality (19.3% versus 25.0% P = 0.038) than drug-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although preinjury use of marijuana does not improve survival in trauma patients, it may provide some improvement in outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury and those that are more severely injured (Injury Severity Score &#8805;16). The mechanism behind this finding needs further evaluation.","Taghavi, Sharven; Ramirez, Saul; Duchesne, Juan; Tatum, Danielle",J Surg Res,265,20

Methods: The herbal formulae recommended by official guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 are included in the present analysis. To describe the tendency of herbs to form a ""herb pair"", we computed the mutual information (MI) value and distance-based mutual information model (DMIM) score. We also performed modularity, degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality analysis. Network analyses were performed and visualized for each disease stage. Results: A total of 142 herbal formulae comprising 416 herbs were analyzed. All possible herbal pairs were examined, and the top frequently used herbal pairs were identified for each disease stage. The herb Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma is only identified in one herb pair, even though this herb is identified as one of the herbs with high frequency of use for every disease stage. This suggests that the DMIM score could be used to identify the optimal combination rule of herbal formulae by achieving a balance among the herbs' frequency and relative distance in herbal formulae. Conclusion: Our results presented the prescription patterns and herbal combinations of the herbal formulae recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study may provide new insights and ideas for clinical research in the future.","Ang, L.; Lee, H. W.; Kim, A.; Choi, J. Y.; Lee, M. S.",Infection &amp; Drug Resistance,265,17

It ameliorated inflammatory responses and protected against acute lung inflammation in animal models. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a kind of inflammatory disease in which alveolar cells are damaged. However, a network pharmacology study to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms preventing ALI has not been performed. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we examined the main active ingredients in LJF and the protective effects of LJF on LPS-induced ALI in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the main active ingredients of LJF were screened in the TCMSP database, and the ALI-associated targets were collected from the GeneCards database. Then, we used compound-target and target-pathway networks to uncover the preventive mechanisms of LJF. Furthermore, we assessed the preventive effects of LJF in an LPS-induced rat model with the RNA-Seq technique to validate the possible molecular mechanisms of the effects of LJF in the treatment of ALI. RESULTS: The network pharmacology results identified 28 main active compounds in LJF, and eight chemical components highly related to the potential targets, which were potential active compounds in LJF. In all, 94 potential targets were recognized, including IL6, TNF, PTGS2, APP, F2, and GRM5. The pathways revealed that the possible targets of LJF involved in the regulation of the IL-17 signalling pathway. Then, in vivo experiments indicated that LJF decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, decreased the levels of oxidative stress factors (MDA and MPO) and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in lung tissue. The RNA-Seq results revealed that 7811, 775 and 3654 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Ctrl (control group), ALI-LJF (Lonicerae japonicae flos group) and ALI-DXSM (dexamethasone group), respectively. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs associated with immune response and inflammation signalling pathways and the IL-17 signalling pathway were significantly enriched in LJF. Compared with those in ALI, the expression of CXCL2, CXCL1, CXCL6, NFKBIA, IFNG, IL6, IL17A, IL17F, IL17C, MMP9 and TNFAIP3, which are involved in the IL-17 signalling pathway, were significantly decreased in the LJF group according to the qRT-PCR analyses.

These services have become gradually popular over the years with the advent of necessary technological infrastructure. The benefits of telehealth have been even more apparent since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, as people have become less inclined to visit doctors in person during the pandemic. In this paper, we focus on facilitating the chat sessions between a doctor and a patient. We note that the quality and efficiency of the chat experience can be critical as the demand for telehealth services increases. Accordingly, we develop a smart auto-response generation mechanism for medical conversations that helps doctors respond to consultation requests efficiently, particularly during busy sessions. We explore over 900,000 anonymous, historical online messages between doctors and patients collected over nine months. We implement clustering algorithms to identify the most frequent responses by doctors and manually label the data accordingly. We then train machine learning algorithms using this preprocessed data to generate the responses. The considered algorithm has two steps: a filtering (i.e., triggering) model to filter out infeasible patient messages and a response generator to suggest the top-3 doctor responses for the ones that successfully pass the triggering phase. The method provides an accuracy of 83.28\% for precision@3 and shows robustness to its parameters.","Jahanshahi, Hadi; Kazmi, Syed; Cevik, Mucahit",,265,10

Aim of this study was to estimate the cost of illness of PBC in Lombardy, Italy. METHODS: Individuals with PBC were identified through ICD-9-CM code 571.6 and/or medical exemption code 008.571.6, from the Banca Dati Assistito of Lombardy. Only health services (outpatient, inpatient activities and drugs) related to PBC were considered to estimate direct medical costs in 2017. RESULTS: We identified 970 adult patients (83.5% females) with a mean age of 61 years. Global annual costs were equal to  913,763 ( 942 per patient), with  459,506 (50.3%,  474 per patient) deriving from hospitalizations (mostly due to liver transplantation, 30.5%, and cirrhosis complications, 20.6%).

Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions.","Alexandrou, Constantia; Harmandaris, Vangelis; Irakleous, Anastasios; Koutsou, Giannis; Savva, Nikos",PLoS One,265,1

When the mediator is a biomarker, values can be subject to an assay lower limit. The mediator is affected by the treatment and is a putative cause of the outcome, so the assay lower limit presents a compounded problem in mediation analysis. We propose three approaches to estimate indirect and direct effects with a mediator subject to an assay limit: 1. extrapolation 2. numerical optimization and integration of the observed likelihood and 3. the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Since the described methods solely rely on the so-called Mediation Formula, they apply to most approaches to causal mediation analysis: natural, separable, and organic indirect and direct effects. A simulation study compares the estimation approaches to imputing with half the assay limit.

Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. METHODS: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. RESULTS: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. CONCLUSIONS: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Q.; Coumoul, X.; Grandjean, P.; Barouki, R.; Audouze, K.",Environment International,265,11

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, â¼30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to predict regions of high base pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hotspots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of sgRNA from gRNA, is a unique advantage of our in-silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology, and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets.Importance The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, and yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. Here we show that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we develop a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we find that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","Tavares, Rafael de Cesaris Araujo; Mahadeshwar, Gandhar; Wan, Han; Huston, Nicholas C; Pyle, Anna Marie",J. virol,265,1

Such adaptive responses are regulated by a complex set of systemic signals, including hormones and neuropeptides. While much progress has been made in identifying pathways that regulate nutrient-excessive states, it is still incompletely understood how animals systemically signal their nutrient-deficient states. Here, we showed that the FMRFamide neuropeptide FLP-20 modulates a systemic starvation response in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that mutation of flp-20 rescued the starvation hypersensitivity of the G protein ß-subunit gpb-2 mutants by suppressing excessive autophagy. FLP-20 acted in AIB neurons, where the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-2 also functions to modulate a systemic starvation response. Furthermore, FLP-20 modulated starvation-induced fat degradation in a manner dependent on the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-28. Collectively, our results reveal a circuit that senses and signals nutrient-deficient states to modulate a systemic starvation response in multicellular organisms.","Kang, Chanhee; Avery, Leon",Mol. cells,265,1

However, CNOP is known to be a heterogeneous group of orofacial pain disorders, which can lead to different responses to iMCS. Therefore, this paper investigated (1) whether the effectiveness of iMCS is significantly different among different CNOP disorders and (2) whether other confounding factors can be impacting iMCS results in CNOP. A systematic review and meta-analysis using a linear mixed-model was performed. Twenty-three papers were included, totaling 140 CNOP patients. Heterogeneity of the studies showed to be 55.8%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) measured median pain relief of 66.5% (ranging from 0-100%) was found. Linear mixed-model analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia responded significantly more favorable to iMCS than patients suffering from dysfunctional pain syndromes (p = 0.030). Also, patients suffering from CNOP caused by (supra)nuclear lesions responded marginally significantly better to iMCS than patients suffering from CNOP due to trigeminal nerve lesions (p = 0.049). No other confounding factors were elucidated. This meta-analysis showed that patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia and patients suffering from (supra)nuclear lesions causing CNOP responded significantly more favorable than others on iMCS.

Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S. health care system. CDC* and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recommended that health care systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in health care settings. By May 2020, national syndromic surveillance data found that emergency department (ED) visits had declined 42% during the early months of the pandemic (1). This report describes trends in ED visits for three acute life-threatening health conditions (myocardial infarction [MI, also known as heart attack], stroke, and hyperglycemic crisis), immediately before and after declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. These conditions represent acute events that always necessitate immediate emergency care, even during a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 10 weeks following the emergency declaration (March 15-May 23, 2020), ED visits declined 23% for MI, 20% for stroke, and 10% for hyperglycemic crisis, compared with the preceding 10-week period (January 5-March 14, 2020). EDs play a critical role in diagnosing and treating life-threatening conditions that might result in serious disability or death. Persons experiencing signs or symptoms of serious illness, such as severe chest pain, sudden or partial loss of motor function, altered mental state, signs of extreme hyperglycemia, or other life-threatening issues, should seek immediate emergency care, regardless of the pandemic. Clear, frequent, highly visible communication from public health and health care professionals is needed to reinforce the importance of timely care for medical emergencies and to assure the public that EDs are implementing infection prevention and control guidelines that help ensure the safety of their patients and health care personnel.","Lange, Samantha J; Ritchey, Matthew D; Goodman, Alyson B; Dias, Taylor; Twentyman, Evelyn; Fuld, Jennifer; Schieve, Laura A; Imperatore, Giuseppina; Benoit, Stephen R; Kite-Powell, Aaron; Stein, Zachary; Peacock, Georgina; Dowling, Nicole F; Briss, Peter A; Hacker, Karen; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Yang, Quanhe",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,265,9

At the time when reliable information is vital for public health and safety, COVID-19 related fake news has been spreading even faster than the facts. During times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, fake news can not only cause intellectual confusion but can also place lives of people at risk. This calls for an immediate need to contain the spread of such misinformation on social media. We introduce CTF, the first COVID-19 Twitter fake news dataset with labeled genuine and fake tweets. Additionally, we propose Cross-SEAN, a cross-stitch based semi-supervised end-to-end neural attention model, which leverages the large amount of unlabelled data. Cross-SEAN partially generalises to emerging fake news as it learns from relevant external knowledge. We compare Cross-SEAN with seven state-of-the-art fake news detection methods. We observe that it achieves $0.95$ F1 Score on CTF, outperforming the best baseline by $9\%$. We also develop Chrome-SEAN, a Cross-SEAN based chrome extension for real-time detection of fake tweets.","Paka, William Scott; Bansal, Rachit; Kaushik, Abhay; Sengupta, Shubhashis; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,265,30

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16-26%, 29-47%, 27-46% and 37-57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%-61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 µg m-3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2-61.1%), mobile (3.9-8.1%), dust (2.6-7.7%), residential sources (2.1-28.5%) in YRD and 14.0-28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account.","Li, Li; Li, Qing; Huang, Ling; Wang, Qian; Zhu, Ansheng; Xu, Jian; Liu, Ziyi; Li, Hongli; Shi, Lishu; Li, Rui; Azari, Majid; Wang, Yangjun; Zhang, Xiaojuan; Liu, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Yonghui; Zhang, Kun; Xue, Shuhui; Ooi, Maggie Chel Gee; Zhang, Dongping; Chan, Andy",Sci Total Environ,265,21

Are there benefits of continuing: reduced COVID-19 risks to patient and psychiatrist, and flexibility of appointments? Will the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) telehealth items be retained? How does metropolitan telepsychiatry fit into the overall mix of public and private services? This is an important debate. CONCLUSIONS: Private psychiatrists may continue to offer the majority of care, where practical, via telepsychiatry to reduce COVID-19 exposure risks, as well as allow for the realities of practice management for pandemic public health measures. However, consideration has to be given to the potential drawbacks for patients with sight, hearing and illness-related disabilities or risks, when in-person consultation is required. There are also risks: some patients may not benefit from telepsychiatry due to the nature of their illness, and will patients feel rapport is lost? However, the retention of COVID-19 MBS telehealth items is needed for ongoing flexible and comprehensive private practice psychiatry.","Looi, Jeffrey Cl; Pring, William",Australas Psychiatry,265,33

METHODS: A stable animal model was established via an intratracheal injection of 5 mg bleomycin (BLM). One single transplantation of 2.5× 107 HUMSCs or initiation of daily oral nintedanib/pirfenidone administration was performed on day 21 following BLM damage. RESULTS: Pulmonary function examination revealed that BLM rats exhibited a significant decrease in blood oxygen saturation and an increase in respiratory rates. While no significant improvements were found in BLM rats receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, those who transplanted with HUMSCs showed a statistical amelioration in blood oxygen saturation and significant alleviation in respiratory rates. Quantification results revealed that a significant reduction in alveolar space and marked increases in substantial cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the left lungs of BLM rats. No significant alteration was observed in BLM rats administered nintedanib or pirfenidone. However, BLM rats transplanted with HUMSCs had a significant recovery in alveolar space and noticeable decreases in cell infiltration and collagen deposition. The inflammatory cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage was increased in the BLM group. While the rats treated with nintedanib or pirfenidone had a lower cell number than the BLM group, a higher cell number was found as compared with the Normal group. In rats transplanted with HUMSCs, the cell number did not differ from the Normal group. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of HUMSCs could effectively treat PF as opposed to the administration of anti-fibrotic drugs with nintedanib or pirfenidone with a significant better result in lung volume, pathological changes, lung function, and blood oxygen saturation.","Chu, Kuo-An; Yeh, Chang-Ching; Kuo, Fu-Hsien; Lin, Wen-Ren; Hsu, Chien-Wei; Chen, Tien-Hua; Fu, Yu-Show",Stem Cell Res Ther,265,20

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and the potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity, but the second cohort (n = 227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS, and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4°C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and, in some situations, reduced detectable virus levels.","Griesemer, Sara B; Van Slyke, Greta; Ehrbar, Dylan; Strle, Klemen; Yildirim, Tugba; Centurioni, Dominick A; Walsh, Anne C; Chang, Andrew K; Waxman, Michael J; St George, Kirsten",J. clin. microbiol,265,1

Patients with lung cancer have consistently been reported to suffer from an increased risk of death compared with other cancers. This is possibly due to the combination of specific pathophysiological aspects, including underlying pulmonary compromise due to smoking history and the increased specific pressures on respiratory healthcare services caused by the related pandemic. Rationally and safely treating patients with lung cancer during the pandemic has become a continuous challenge over the last year. Deciding whether to offer, modify, postpone or even cancel treatments for this particular patient's population has become the crucial recurrent dilemma for lung cancer professionals. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted agents represent distinct risks factors in the context of COVID-19 that should be balanced with the short-term and long-term consequences of delaying cancer care. Despite the rapid and persistent trend of the pandemic, declared by WHO on March 11, 2020, and still ongoing at the time of writing (January 2021), various efforts were made by oncologists worldwide to understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Adapted recommendations of our evidence-based practice guidelines have been developed for all stakeholders. Different small and large-scale registries, such as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration quickly collected data, supporting cancer care decisions under the challenging circumstance created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several recommendations were developed as guidance for prioritizing the various aspects of lung cancer care in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality of our patients from COVID-19 and from cancer. These recommendations helped inform decisions about treatment of established disease, continuation of clinical research and lung cancer screening. In this review, we summarize available evidence regarding the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and patients.","Passaro, Antonio; Bestvina, Christine; Velez Velez, Maria; Garassino, Marina Chiara; Garon, Edward; Peters, Solange",J. immunotherap. cancer,265,9

We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. RESULTS: Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.","Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Van Exan, Robert; Langley, Joanne M; Moghadas, Seyed M",Vaccine,265,12

METHODS: Volume of emergency stroke code activations, patient characteristics, stroke severity, reperfusion rates, treatment times, and outcomes from February 1 to April 30, 2020, were compared against the same time period in 2019. Demographic data were provided by each participating institution. RESULTS: There was a 17.3% decrease in stroke code activations across LAC in 2020 compared to 2019 (1,786 vs. 2,159, respectively, &#967;2 goodness of fit test p < 0.0001) across 9 participating comprehensive stroke centers. Patients who did not receive any reperfusion therapy decreased by 16.6% in 2020 (1,527) compared to 2019 (1,832). Patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic (IVT) therapy decreased by 31.8% (107 vs. 157). Patients who received only mechanical thrombectomy (MT) increased by 3% (102 vs. 99). Patients who received both IVT and MT decreased by 31.8% (45 vs. 66). Recanalization treatment times in 2020 were comparable to 2019. CSCs serving a higher proportion of Latinx populations in the eastern parts of LAC experienced a higher incidence of MT in 2020 compared to 2019. Mild increase in stroke severity was seen in 2020 compared to 2019 (8.95 vs. 8.23, p = 0.046). A higher percentage of patients were discharged home in 2020 compared to 2019 (59.5 vs. 56.1%, p = 0.034), a lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facility (16.1 vs. 20.7%, p = 0.0004), and a higher percentage of patients expired (8.6 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: LAC saw a decrease in overall stroke code activations in 2020 compared to 2019. Reperfusion treatment times remained comparable to prepandemic metrics. There has been an increase in severe stroke incidence and higher volume of thrombectomy treatments in Latinx communities within LAC during the pandemic of 2020.

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status. Universal anticoagulant prophylaxis in hospitalised children with SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations is not warranted, but may be offered to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk factors in the context of a multi-modal therapeutic approach.","Del Borrello, Giovanni; Giraudo, Isaac; Bondone, Claudia; Denina, Marco; Garazzino, Silvia; Linari, Claudia; Mignone, Federica; Pruccoli, Giulia; Scolfaro, Carlo; Spadea, Manuela; Pollio, Berardino; Saracco, Paola",J. thromb. haemost,265,21

Implications of which can impact their academic performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning can be used to predict which students are more susceptible to anxiety which can inform closer monitoring and early intervention. To date, there are no studies that have explored the efficacy of AI to predict anxiety among college students. Objective: to develop the best fit model to predict anxiety and to rank the most important factors affecting anxiety. Method: Data was collected using an online survey that included general information;Covid-19 stressors and (GAD-7). This scale categorizes level of anxiety to none, mild, moderate, and severe. We received 917 survey answers. Several machine learning classifiers were used to develop the best fit model to predict student level of anxiety. Results: the best performance based on AUC is AdaBoost (0.943) followed by neural network (0.936). Highest accuracy and F1 were for neural network (0.754) and (0.749) respectively, then neural network selected to be the best fit model. The three scoring methods revealed that the top three features that predicted anxiety to be gender;sufficient support from family and friends;and fixed family income. Conclusion: Neural network model can assist college counselors to predict which students are going through anxiety and revealed the top three features for heightened student anxiety to be gender, a support system, and family fixed income.

In a similar manner to an epidemic, it spreads between humans via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. OBJECTIVE: A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation on responding to the infodemic related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was held, entirely online, to crowdsource suggested actions for a framework for infodemic management. METHODS: A group of policy makers, public health professionals, researchers, students, and other concerned stakeholders was joined by representatives of the media, social media platforms, various private sector organizations, and civil society to suggest and discuss actions for all parts of society, and multiple related professional and scientific disciplines, methods, and technologies. A total of 594 ideas for actions were crowdsourced online during the discussions and consolidated into suggestions for an infodemic management framework. RESULTS: The analysis team distilled the suggestions into a set of 50 proposed actions for a framework for managing infodemics in health emergencies. The consultation revealed six policy implications to consider. First, interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence, and must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions on how to protect themselves and their communities in a health emergency. Second, knowledge should be translated into actionable behavior-change messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to all individuals in all parts of all societies. Third, governments should reach out to key communities to ensure their concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and messages to address the audiences they represent. Fourth, to strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact, strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors, including but not limited to the social media and technology sectors, academia, and civil society. Fifth, health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by reliable information that helps them understand the circulating narratives and changes in the flow of information, questions, and misinformation in communities. Sixth, following experiences to date in responding to the COVID-19 infodemic and the lessons from other disease outbreaks, infodemic management approaches should be further developed to support preparedness and response, and to inform risk mitigation, and be enhanced through data science and sociobehavioral and other research. CONCLUSIONS: The first version of this framework proposes five action areas in which WHO Member States and actors within society can apply, according to their mandate, an infodemic management approach adapted to national contexts and practices. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related infodemic require swift, regular, systematic, and coordinated action from multiple sectors of society and government. It remains crucial that we promote trusted information and fight misinformation, thereby helping save lives.","Tangcharoensathien, Viroj; Calleja, Neville; Nguyen, Tim; Purnat, Tina; D039,; Agostino, Marcelo; Garcia-Saiso, Sebastian; Landry, Mark; Rashidian, Arash; Hamilton, Clayton; AbdAllah, Abdelhalim; Ghiga, Ioana; Hill, Alexandra; Hougendobler, Daniel; van Andel, Judith; Nunn, Mark; Brooks, Ian; Sacco, Pier Luigi; De Domenico, Manlio; Mai, Philip; Gruzd, Anatoliy; Alaphilippe, Alexandre; Briand, Sylvie",J Med Internet Res,265,20

Even so, the availability of code, data and documentation, along with a range of techniques for validation, verification and uncertainty quantification, are essential for building trust in computer generated findings. When it comes to complex systems in domains of science that are less firmly grounded in theory, notably biology and medicine, to say nothing of the social sciences and humanities, computers can create the illusion of objectivity, not least because the rise of big data and machine learning pose new challenges to reproducibility, while lacking true explanatory power.

The most prominent is their ability to be used as the last line of therapy for bacterial and viral infections including recent COVID-19. The synthesis of quinoline is through a cyclization reaction and overall reaction yields are about 20%. The bulky ring and the associated crowding of functional groups limit the catalyst options. In this publication, the use of Fe3O4@SiO2 for enhancing yield improvements, especially for heterocyclics is reported. The use of the 40â¯nm sized silica functionalized magnetite nanoparticles seems to help in both condensation and cyclization steps of representative 2-methyl-6-nitroquinoline. Reaction time reduction due to surface enabled catalysis of nanoparticles is 110â¯min to 80â¯min. The reaction yield has doubled due to the presence of catalyst and the mechanism suggests this drastic result is due to stabilization of unstable intermediate on the acidic surface of the silica coating.

The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines, and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo. A remarkable feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells and, more frequently, formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.","Mykytyn, Anna Z; Breugem, Tim I; Riesebosch, Samra; Schipper, Debby; van den Doel, Petra B; Rottier, Robbert J; Lamers, Mart M; Haagmans, Bart L",eLife (Cambridge),265,2

The main objective of the current study is to provide additional data regarding the clinical characteristics of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and in particular to analyze the factors associated with disease severity, lack of improvement, and mortality. METHODS: 102 studies were included in the present meta-analysis, all of which were published before September 24, 2020. The studies were found by searching a number of databases, including Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase. We performed a thorough search from early February until September 24. The selected papers were evaluated and analyzed using Stata software application version 14. RESULTS: Ultimately, 102 papers were selected for this meta- analysis, covering 121,437 infected patients. The mean age of the patients was 58.42 years. The results indicate a prevalence of 79.26% for fever (95% CI: 74.98-83.26; I2 = 97.35%), 60.70% for cough (95% CI: 56.91-64.43; I2 = 94.98%), 33.21% for fatigue or myalgia (95% CI: 28.86-37.70; I2 = 96.12%), 31.30% for dyspnea (95% CI: 26.14-36.69; I2 = 97.67%), and 10.65% for diarrhea (95% CI: 8.26-13.27; I2 = 94.20%). The prevalence for the most common comorbidities was 28.30% for hypertension (95% CI: 23.66-33.18; I2 = 99.58%), 14.29% for diabetes (95% CI: 11.88-16.87; I2 = 99.10%), 12.30% for cardiovascular diseases (95% CI: 9.59-15.27; I2 = 99.33%), and 5.19% for chronic kidney disease (95% CI: 3.95-6.58; I2 = 96.42%). CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the prevalence of some of the most important comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, indicating that some underlying disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney disease, can be considered as risk factors for patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the results show that an elderly male with underlying diseases is more likely to have severe COVID-19.","Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Sayehmiri, Fatemeh; Mohamadkhani, Ashraf; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa; Eilami, Owrang",PLoS One,265,24

RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 34 children and 98 adults from 28 families were included. Fever, cough and ground-grass opacity change of chest computed tomography (CT) were the dominant features, whereas proportion of asymptomatic infections for children was higher than adults with statistical significance (32.4% and 13.3%, respectively, P < 0.05). Median time of longer incubation period (10 days) and shorter duration of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test positive period (11 days) were seen in children than adults (7 and 17 days, respectively) with statistical significance (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in lymphopenia, increased C-reactive protein and abnormal chest CT between children and adult patients (P < 0.05). Twenty-seven families reported adults as first case of COVID-19 in family clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The same virus strain can cause milder disease in children compared with their caregivers.

At each time, every susceptible individual chooses whether to wear a mask or not in the next time step, which depends on an evaluation of the potential costs and perceived risk of infection. When the cost of infection is high, the majority of the population choose to wear masks, where global awareness plays a significant role. However, if the mask source is limited, global awareness may give rise to a negative result. In this case, more mask source should be allocated to the individuals with high risk of infection.","Li, Weiqiang; Zhou, Jin; Lu, Jun-An",Nonlinear Dyn,265,20

Consequently, increasing the throughput for clinical laboratories for the purposes of conducting large-scale diagnostic testing is urgently needed.

We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of cost and time. The simulation data presented herein were used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations in which epidemiological and clinical data are used to create ""informed"" pools.

Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns.

Those with previous COVID-19 infection may have not been prioritized due to existing humoral immunity. ObjectiveWe aim to study the association between previous COVID-19 infection and antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA serological analysis to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies was performed on individuals who received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Kuwait. Generalized linear regression models adjusted for individual characteristics and comorbidities were fitted to study the average levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals based who had previous COVID-19 infection compared to those who had not. ResultsA total of 1025 individuals were recruited. The mean levels of IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies were higher in vaccinated subjects with previous COVID-19 infection when compared with those vaccinated without previous COVID-19 infection. Regression analysis showed a steeper slope of decline for IgG in vaccinated individuals without previous COVID-19 infection in comparison with vaccinated individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. ConclusionPrevious COVID-19 infection appears to elicit robust and sustained levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in vaccinated individuals. Given the inconsistent supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many countries due to the global inequity, our results point towards wider vaccination plans to especially cover individuals without previous COVID-19 infection.","Ali, Hamad; Alahmad, Barrak; Al-Shammari, Abdullah A; Al-Terki, Abdelmohsen i; Hammad, Maha; Cherian, Preethi; Alkhairi, Irina; Sindhu, Sardar; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse; Mohammad, Anwar; Alghanim, Ghazi; Devarajan, Sriraman; Ahmad, Rasheed; El-Shazly, Sherif; Dashti, Ali A.; Shehab, Mohammad; Al-Sabah, Salman; Alkandari, Abdullah; Abubaker, Jehad; Abu-farha, Mohamed; Al-Mulla, Fahd",,265,26

Here, we analyzed the distribution and character of emerging mutations in a data set comprising more than 95,000 virus genomes covering eight major SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the GISAID database, including genotypes arising during COVID-19 therapy. Globally, the C>U transitions and G>U transversions were the most represented mutations, accounting for the majority of single-nucleotide variations. Mutational spectra were not influenced by the time the virus had been circulating in its host or medical treatment. At the amino acid level, we observed about a 2-fold excess of substitutions in favor of hydrophobic amino acids over the reverse. However, most mutations constituting variants of interests of the S-protein (spike) lead to hydrophilic amino acids, counteracting the global trend. The C>U and G>U substitutions altered codons towards increased amino acid hydrophobicity values in more than 80% of cases. The bias is explained by the existing differences in the codon composition for amino acids bearing contrasting biochemical properties. Mutation asymmetries apparently influence the biochemical features of SARS CoV-2 proteins, which may impact protein-protein interactions, fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and virion assembly.","Matyásek, Roman; Rehurková, Katerina; Berta Marosiová, Kristýna; Kovarík, Ales",,265,1

By March 2020, Korea had reported the second largest number of Coronavirus patients in the world. On the anniversary date (2021), however, with a 51.3 M population, Korea has had 73.115 K patients with 1.283 K deaths, and this stands at 86th in the world. On average, Korea has 14.3 patients per 10,000 people. Air-parcel trajectory analysis and airflows show that in the general westerly region, air parcels and pollutants could flow out and in all directions. This suggests initially that Coronaviruses from source areas in China could transmit to many sink regions and sectors including 228 subdivided counties in Korea. However, there were only relatively small numbers of Coronavirus patients in western sea sides of the Korean Peninsula in comparison with large numbers of Coronavirus disease patients in cities and in eastern sides. In particular, three counties in Korea, including Ong-jin, Mooju and Chang-heung, have zero patients of Coronavirus diseases. This suggests that a long-distance transmission of Coronavirus from Wuhan and other infected cities in China to western Korea likely did not occur. Moreover, there was no evidence on the potential transmission of Coronavirus from neighboring large cities to the above-mentioned isolated counties in Korea which are only 10 ~ 50 km away. In the biosphere, during the transmission stage, the inactivation of Coronavirus by UV rays appeared to occur effectively in 30 ~ 120 min, in agreement with the result of satellite and modeling studies. In turn, the air transmission of Coronaviruses and pollution from China and neighboring cities in Korea apparently had no impact to cause Coronavirus diseases at the 228 counties in Korea. The infection and spreading of Coronavirus diseases to other people in Korea mainly appeared to occur in confined indoor air environments. With the absence and lack of UV rays in indoor environments, Coronaviruses would be active there for hours or days longer than in the outdoor environments.","Chung, Y S; Kim, H S",Air Qual Atmos Health,265,1

Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools' affiliated clinical sites, physicians, patients, and the community. APPROACH: At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students' ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. OUTCOMES: Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. NEXT STEPS: The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS's daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","Soled, Derek; Goel, Shivangi; Barry, Danika; Erfani, Parsa; Joseph, Nicholos; Kochis, Michael; Uppal, Nishant; Velasquez, David; Vora, Kruti; Scott, Kirstin Woody",Acad Med,265,16

In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. METHODS: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Mohamed, Ayman A; Alawna, Motaz",Diabetes Metab Syndr,265,16

We searched six major Chinese and English databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case-control studies (CCSs) of Integrated Medicine on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened, identified studies, and extracted data. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of included RCTs and CCSs, respectively. Stata (version 13.0; StataCorp) was used to perform meta-analyses with the random-effects model. Risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous data while the weighted mean difference (WMD) was adopted for continuous variables as effect size, both of which were demonstrated in effect size and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 11 studies were included. Four were RCTs and seven were CCSs. The sample size of including studies ranged from 42 to 200 (total 982).

This survey assessed the knowledge of COVID-19 among Nigerian parents and its effect on their monthly income. Methods: an online cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 9 - June 8, 2020, among parents/guardians with children/wards in the paediatric age-range during the lockdown stage of the outbreak in Nigeria. Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit 260 respondents. The questionnaire was administered on a Google doc form and distributed via the internet. Chi-square was used to test for differences, and statistical significance was set at p-value less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence level. Results: the mean age was 39.6 years (SD = 7.3), comprising 105 (40.4%) males, 239 (91.9%) married, and 167 (64.2%) with tertiary education. Only 29 (11.2%) had good knowledge of COVID-19. Interestingly, low-income earners were more likely to have good knowledge of COVID-19 than middle/high-income earners. The monthly incomes of 191 (73.5%) respondents were affected. Females, those with secondary education and below, and low-income earners were more likely to have their incomes affected. Conclusion: parents/guardians have poor knowledge of COVID-19. Also, the monthly income of parents/guardians have been affected by the lockdown measures; most affected were females, those with a secondary level of education and below and low-income earners. Their poor knowledge and the impact on their income may further impair their preparedness to combat the spread of COVID-19.","Briggs, Datonye Christopher; Kattey, Kattey Amos",Pan Afr Med J,265,1

To identify the novel risk genetic biomarker for COVID-19, we evaluated the correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the genetic polymorphisms of several potential COVID-19-related genes, including interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), interleukin 6 (IL6), leucine zipper transcription factor-like protein 1 (LZTFL1), and the ABO genes, in various ethnic groups. We obtained the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard and calculated the case fatality rate of each ethnic group. In addition, we obtained the allele distribution of the polymorphisms of the IFITM3, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL6, LZTFL1, and ABO genes from the 1000 Genomes Project and performed Log-linear regression analysis using SAS version 9.4. We found different COVID-19 case fatality rates in each ethnic group. Notably, we identified a strong correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the allele frequency of the rs6598045 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IFITM3 gene.

Analysis of 1,213 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from S-specific MBCs revealed a primarily de novo response that displayed increased somatic hypermutation, binding affinity, and neutralization potency over time, providing evidence for prolonged antibody affinity maturation. B cell immunodominance hierarchies were similar across donor repertoires and remained relatively stable as the immune response progressed. Cross-reactive B cell populations, likely re-called from prior endemic beta-coronavirus exposures, comprised a small but stable fraction of the repertoires and did not contribute to the neutralizing response.

Recent technological progress, especially industry 4.0, indicates promising possibilities to mitigate supply chain risks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of the link between industry 4.0 and supply chain resilience. To close this research gap, we present evidence from a systematic literature review, including 62 papers from high-quality journals. Based on a categorization of industry 4.0 enabler technologies and supply chain resilience antecedents, we introduce a holistic framework depicting the relationship between both areas while exploring the current state-of-the-art. To verify industry 4.0’s resilience opportunities in a severe supply chain disruption, we apply our framework to a use case, the COVID-19-affected automotive industry. Overall, our results reveal that big data analytics is particularly suitable for improving supply chain resilience, while other industry 4.0 enabler technologies, including additive manufacturing and cyber-physical systems, still lack proof of effectiveness. Moreover, we demonstrate that visibility and velocity are the resilience antecedents that benefit most from industry 4.0 implementation. We also establish that industry 4.0 holistically supports pre-disruption resilience measures, enabling more effective proactive risk management. Both research and practice can benefit from this study.

Moreover, based on our branching model, the efficacy of home quarantine and social distancing are explored, providing a reference for the effective prevention of COVID-19 worldwide. © 2021 Lin Zhang et al.","Zhang, L.; Wang, H.; Liu, Z.; Liu, X.

The main mode of transmission of such infectious organisms is primarily through bioaerosols generated during routine dental procedures which put both dental care providers and their patients at an increased risk of exposure. Other frequent modes of infection transmission often reported include cross contamination and inadequate adoption of infection control protocols. The main objective of this article is to highlight the findings of those studies that have reported on the routes and modes of transmission of infectious organisms in dental settings, to report possibilities of cross contamination in dental care settings, and also to report any breach in adherence to infection control protocols in dental care settings. We also intend to emphasize on standard infection control protocols and strategies that need to be considered in dental care settings during disease outbreaks like coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Khanagar, Sanjeev B; Al-Ehaideb, Ali; Vishwanathaiah, Satish; Maganur, Prabhadevi C; Naik, Sachin; Siddeeqh, Salman",HERD,265,1

This study sought to assess the usage of cloth face masks in grades pre-K-2 and identify associated characteristics and adverse events. It is the first data to assess mask wearing by young children in school. METHODS: This online, prospective, observational, survey in multiple schools within a single school district in a major metropolitan area measured adherence to face covering mandates by students in grades pre-K-2 as measured by percentage of day with appropriate face mask wearing per report via daily teacher surveys for the first 4 weeks of school. RESULTS: The primary outcome was percent of the day that the entire class was wearing their masks appropriately. Of the estimated almost 1000 students and 1048 classroom days reported, the mean percentage of the school day with appropriate mask usage was 76.9%. CONCLUSIONS: For a majority of the day while conducting in-person instruction, children in grades pre-K-2 are able to adhere to mask wearing as a key mitigation strategy for limiting SARS-CoV2 infection spread and possible future use.","Mickells, Geoffrey E; Figueroa, Janet; West, Kelly Withers; Wood, Anna; McElhanon, Barbara O",J Sch Health,265,16

The underlying pathomechanisms of COVID-19 chilblains are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, pathological, and laboratory findings of a series of patients who developed chilblains during the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate the possible factors that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that included 54 patients who presented with chilblains during the highest peak in the incidence of COVID-19 in Cantabria (northern Spain). Skin biopsies were performed on 10 of these patients who presented with recent lesions. Laboratory investigations, including immunological analysis, serological studies, and the assessment of cryoproteins, were also performed. RESULTS: Most patients presented erythematous plaques located on the toes and/or purpuric macules located on the feet. Histopathological findings were compatible with those of idiopathic chilblains. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed C3d and C4d deposits in the vessel walls in seven cases. The autoimmunity panel was negative in most of our series. Cryoprotein testing showed positive cryofibrinogen in two-thirds (66.7%) of the patients assessed. On follow-up, most patients presented almost complete resolution, although six patients required prednisone and antiaggregant drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows, for the first time to our knowledge, a high prevalence of cryofibrinogenemia in patients with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cryofibrinogenemia could be implicated in the pathogenesis of chilblains related to COVID-19.","Gómez-Fernández, Cristina; López-Sundh, Ana E; González-Vela, Carmen; Ocejo-Vinyals, Javier Gonzalo; Mayor-Ibarguren, Ander; Salas-Venero, Carlos A; Gutiérrez-Larrañaga, María; Tejerina-Puente, Ana; Fariñas, María Carmen; Cabero-Pérez, María Jesús; López-Hoyos, Marcos; González-López, Marcos A",Int J Dermatol,265,24

TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period. METHODS: Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS: Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.","Unni, Zoya; Weinstein, Emily",J Adolesc Health,265,16

PURPOSE: To report our initial experience with acquiring portable chest radiographs through glass doors of isolation rooms. METHODS: Only 1 of 2 radiology technologist team members donned personal protective equipment and stayed inside the isolation room, while the second technologist and the radiography unit remained outside during the procedure. First hundred radiographs acquired through glass at the emergency department of our institute formed the ""through glass radiograph"" group. Hundred consecutive portable chest radiographs performed in a conventional manner formed the ""conventional radiograph"" group for comparison. Imaging database and feedback from operations leader were used to identify occurrences of a failed procedure. Suggestion of repeating the study and comments related to quality of the study were recorded from the reports of the staff radiologist. RESULTS: There was no instance of failed acquisition, nondiagnostic examination, or suggestion of repetition in both groups. No significant difference in the number of reports with quality related remarks (P > .05) was found between the 2 groups. Radiography through glass doors was associated with increased suboptimal positioning related remarks in radiology reports (P < .05). No significant association was identified among other comments about image quality. CONCLUSION: Our initial clinical experience suggests that the acquisition of portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms is technically feasible and results in diagnostic quality studies.","Rai, Archana; Ditkofsky, Noah; Hunt, Bryce; Dubrawski, Margaret; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Can Assoc Radiol J,265,23

We computed the expected mortality by taking into account the declining trend and the seasonality in mortality in the two countries over the past 20 years. From the excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess mortality. We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic year, July 2019 to July 2020, was 517 (95%CI = (12, 1074)) in Norway and 4329 [3331, 5325] in Sweden. There were 255 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Norway, and 5741 in Sweden, that year. During the epidemic period of 11 March-11 November, there were 6247 reported COVID-19 deaths and 5517 (4701, 6330) excess deaths in Sweden. We estimated that the number of YLL attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden was 45,850 [13,915, 80,276] without adjusting for mortality displacement and 43,073 (12,160, 85,451) after adjusting for the displacement accounted for by the auto-regressive model.

The IFN-inducible short isoform of human nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) inhibits endocytic virus entry, interacts with the vacuolar ATPase, and promotes endo-lysosomal vesicle acidification and lysosomal protease activity. Here, we used ectopic expression and gene knockout to demonstrate that NCOA7 inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as by lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike in lung epithelial cells. Infection with the highly pathogenic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, or seasonal, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped viruses was also inhibited by NCOA7. Importantly, either overexpression of TMPRSS2, which promotes plasma membrane fusion versus endosomal fusion of SARS-CoV-2, or removal of Spikes polybasic furin cleavage site rendered SARS-CoV-2 less sensitive to NCOA7 restriction. Collectively, our data indicate that furin cleavage sensitizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike to the antiviral consequences of endosomal acidification by NCOA7, and suggest that the acquisition of furin cleavage may have favoured the co-option of cell surface TMPRSS proteases as a strategy to evade the suppressive effects of IFN-induced endo-lysosomal dysregulation on virus infection.","Goujon, Caroline; Matthews, David; Davidson, Andrew; Rihn, Suzannah; Palmarini, Massimo",,265,1

The ability to accurately and efficiently predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward the performance-privacy frontier.","Liang, Paul Pu; Liu, Terrance; Cai, Anna; Muszynski, Michal; Ishii, Ryo; Allen, Nicholas; Auerbach, Randy; Brent, David; Salakhutdinov, Ruslan; Morency, Louis-Philippe",,265,1

TMPRSS2 and Neuropilin-1, the key components that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, are potential targets for treatment of COVID-19. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis on NRP1 and TMPRSS2 in lung to provide information for treating comorbidity of COVID-19 with lung cancer. NRP1 is widely expressed across all the human tissues while TMPRSS2 is expressed in a restricted pattern. High level of NRP1 associates with worse prognosis in multiple cancers, while high level of TMPRSS2 is associated with better survival of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Moreover, NRP1 positively correlates with the oncogenic Cancer Associated Fibroblast (CAF), macrophage and endothelial cells infiltration, negatively correlates with infiltration of CD8+ T cell, the tumor killer cell in Lung Squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). TMPRSS2 shows negative correlation with the oncogenic events in LUAD. RNA-seq data show that NRP1 level is slightly decreased in peripheral blood of ICU admitted COVID-19 patients, unaltered in lung, while TMPRSS2 level is significantly decreased in lung of COVID-19 patients. Our analysis suggests NRP1 as a potential therapeutic target, while sets an alert on targeting TMPRSS2 for treating comorbidity of COVID-19 and lung cancers.","Hu, Song; Hu, Zheyu; Qin, Jiajia; Lin, Chuwen; Jiang, Xuan",Aging (Albany NY),265,20

However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, São Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the São Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubatão, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.","Rudke, A P; Martins, J A; de Almeida, D S; Martins, L D; Beal, A; Hallak, R; Freitas, E D; Andrade, M F; Foroutan, H; Baek, B H; de A Albuquerque, T T",Environ Res,265,10

Methods.: PG trainees in general medicine were sent for a 2-week rotation to select SHs. A faculty coordinator from the teaching hospital facilitated the programme. The SH faculty used qualitative tools to assess the performance of the trainees. The trainees also evaluated the programme using open- and close-ended questionnaires. Results: Eighteen PG trainees in general medicine were posted to six rural SHs. Data analysis showed that the training exposure provided sensitization to the challenges of medical practice in such settings and the need to be multicompetent. Seventeen (94%) trainees felt that they gained insight into the issues that are specific for practice at an SH and >80% expressed confidence about the knowledge and skills gained during that exposure to enhance medical practice in a resource-limited setting. They were also sensitized to various issues of secondary care including skills of multi-competence, the ability to handle a wide variety of cases with limited investigations, a cost-effective approach, decision-making on referrals, procedural competence and flexibility to adapt to new situations.

We aimed to study the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in SLE women and detect its association with depression, functional disability and quality of life. METHODS: This study included 94 SLE females. Ninety-eight control females agreed to participate. Patients and controls answered a written form of the Arabic version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Disease activity and damage were assessed using the SLE Disease Activity Index and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. RESULTS: The frequency of sexual dysfunction was similar in the patients and control groups (77.7% versus 82.7%) while the BDI, HAQ-DI and SF-36 scores were significantly worse in SLE patients. SLE patients with and without sexual dysfunction differed in neither disease characteristics nor disease activity and damage indices. The FSFI showed a strong positive correlation with SF-36, and strong inverse correlations with BDI and HAQ-DI in the patients group while it had a weaker positive correlation with SF-36 and no correlations with the other two indices in the control group. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was found in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between SLE patients and controls. Sexual dysfunction in SLE patients is mostly related to depression, poor functional status, increased pain, poor health perception and bad quality of life. Neither disease activity nor damage contributes significantly to sexual dysfunction in lupus females.","Dorgham, Dalia; Haggag, Hisham M; Attia, Doaa Hs",Lupus,265,23

AIM: To understand the pandemic's impact on recently-arrived migrants and their access to primary health care, and implications for vaccine roll-out. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with primary care professionals (PCPs) and migrants in urban, suburban, and rural settings across England. METHOD: Sixty-four PCPs and administrative staff, and 17 recently-arrived migrants were recruited using purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: PCPs and migrants concurred that digitalisation and virtual consultations have amplified existing inequalities in access to health care for many migrants, due to a lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. PCPs were concerned that virtual consultations resulted in difficulties building trust and risked missing safeguarding cues. Both PCPs and migrants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing health care due to physical closure of surgeries, as well as indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and a lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. Migrants reported a range of specific beliefs, from acceptance to mistrust, around COVID-19 and potential COVID-19 vaccines, often influenced by misinformation. Innovative opportunities were suggested, including translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube; these merit further exploration. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related changes to primary care delivery may become permanent; some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. Solutions are needed to address vaccine hesitancy in marginalised groups to ensure equitable COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","Knights, Felicity; Carter, Jessica; Deal, Anna; Crawshaw, Alison F; Hayward, Sally E; Jones, Lucinda; Hargreaves, Sally",Br J Gen Pract,265,1

This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and computed tomography (CT) scan features and COVID-19 patient mortality. The clinical data of 596 COVID-19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020. The patients' serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored. The median age of the patients was 56.7 ± 16.4 years old. Lung involvement was more than 50% in 214 COVID-19 patients (35.9%). The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 20.35 ± 10.16 (normal range, 20%-50%). Although the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were high in more than 80% of COVID-19 patients; CRP, ESR, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may not indicate the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death (odds ratio, 9.24; 95% confidence interval, 4.32-19.78). These results indicated that lymphopenia < 20% along with pulmonary involvement >50% impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital (p = .00). Lymphocyte count less than 20% and chest CT scan findings with more than 50% involvement might be related to the patient's mortality.

We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for forecasting strawberry yields and prices in Santa Barbara county, California. Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM), are trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data of SantaBarbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which is an ensemble model of Convolutional NeuralNetwork LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation for five weeks ahead forecasts.Finally, the forecasts of these two models are ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance by 5% compared to its best performing component model but also outperforms the Deep Learning (DL) ensemble model found in literature by 33% for forecasting yields and 21% for forecasting prices","Chaudhary, Mohita; Gastli, Mohamed Sadok; Nassar, Lobna; Karray, Fakhri",,265,20

The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19-related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants' CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach &#945;=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized ß=-.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized ß=-.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized ß=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized ß=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized ß=-.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","An, Lawrence; Bacon, Elizabeth; Hawley, Sarah; Yang, Penny; Russell, Daniel; Huffman, Scott; Resnicow, Ken",J Med Internet Res,265,16

We aimed to quantify the effect (if any) of the presence as opposed to absence of cancer on important clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, medRxiv, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), and references of relevant articles up to April 27, 2020, to identify observational studies comparing patients with versus without cancer infected with COVID-19 and to report on mortality and/or need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181531). RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 46,499 patients (1,776 patients with cancer) with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe, and the United States were included. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with versus those without cancer (2,034 deaths; RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.07; P < .0001; 8 studies with 37,807 patients). The need for ICU admission was also more likely in patients with versus without cancer (3,220 events; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.87; P < .0001; 26 studies with 15,375 patients). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients > 65 years of age, all-cause mortality was comparable between those with versus without cancer (915 deaths; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.41; P = .71; 8 studies with 5,438 patients). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer is associated with worse clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. However, elderly patients with cancer may not be at increased risk of death when infected with COVID-19. These findings may inform discussions of clinicians with patients about prognosis and may guide health policies.","Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Papoutsi, Eleni; Siempos, Ilias I",JCO Glob Oncol,265,16

METHODS: Upon admission to the emergency room, the inflammation-based risk scoring system was applied and patients were classified as having mild, moderate, or severe inflammation. In-hospital occurrence of thrombosis, need for mechanical ventilation, and death were recorded. RESULTS: One-hundred patients (55 ± 13 years; 71% men) were included and classified as having mild (29%), moderate (12%), or severe (59%) inflammation. The need for mechanical ventilation differed among patients in each group (16%, 50%, and 71%, respectively; P < 0.0001), yielding a 4.1-fold increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate inflammation and 5.4 for those with severe inflammation. On the contrary, there were no differences for the occurrence of thrombosis (10%, 8%, and 22%, respectively; P = 0.142) or death (21%, 42%, and 39%, respectively; P = 0.106). In the multivariate analysis, only severe inflammation (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.1), D-dimer > 574 ng/mL (HR = 3.0), and troponin I &#8805; 6.7 ng/mL (HR = 2.4) at hospital admission were independent predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The inflammation-based risk scoring system predicts the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.","Amezcua-Guerra, Luis M; Audelo, Karen; Guzmán, Juan; Santiago, Diana; González-Flores, Julieta; García-Ávila, Carlos; Torres, Zaira; Baranda-Tovar, Francisco; Tavera-Alonso, Claudia; Sandoval, Julio; González-Pacheco, Héctor",Inflamm Res,265,12

Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease. Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment; local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible because of many unknown and complex factors.

It has been reported that COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function. However, the association between thyroid function and prognosis of COVID-19 is still unclear.Methods: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Patients without history of thyroid disease who had a thyroid function test at admission were enrolled in the final analysis. Risk factors of in-hospital death were explored using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Survival differences were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test.Results: A total of 127 patients were included in this study, with 116 survivors and 11 non-survivors. The serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [0.8 (0.5-1.7) vs. 1.9 (1.0-3.1) µIU/mL, P = .031] and free triiodothyronine (FT3) [2.9 (2.8-3.1) vs. 4.2 (3.5-4.7) pmol/L, P < .001] were lower in non-survivors than in survivors, and a low FT3 state (defined as FT3 < 3.1 pmol/L) at admission accounted for a higher proportion in non-survivors than in survivors (72.7% vs. 11.2%, P < .001). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that FT3 level (HR 0.213, 95% CI: 0.101-0.451, P < .001) and the low FT3 state (HR 14.607, 95% CI: 3.873-55.081, P < .001) were negatively and positively associated with the risk of in-hospital death, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a low FT3 state was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding factors (HR 13.288, 95% CI: 1.089-162.110, P = .043). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a lower survival probability in COVID-19 patients with a low FT3 status.Conclusion: Serum FT3 level is lower in non-survivors among moderate-to-critical patients with COVID-19, and the low FT3 state is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Lang, Shan; Liu, Ye; Qu, Xue; Lu, Ran; Fu, Wei; Zhang, Wenhui; Wang, Haining; Hong, Tianpei",Endocr Res,265,33

Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic (R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI 0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.","Poletto, Chiara; Pelat, Camille; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; Colizza, Vittoria",,265,20

By the beginning of March, WHO reported about 113,820,000 confirmed cases including more than 2,527,000 deaths all over the world. However, the true extent of virus circulation or its real infection/fatality ratio is not well-estimated due to the huge portion of asymptomatic infections. In this observational study, we have estimated the prevalence of specific immunoglobulin M and G directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a cohort of 1383 adult volunteers aged over 65 years old, living in the district of Benevento, in the South of Italy. Serological screening was carried out on capillary blood in September 2020, seven months after pandemic outbreak in Italy, to evaluate virus circulation and antibody response among elderly adults, in which severe symptoms due to viral infection are more common. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.70% (CI 3.70%-5.95%) with no statistically significant differences between sexes. Among these, 69.69% (CI 55.61%-77.80%) tested positive to IgM, 23.08% (CI 14.51%-34.64%) to IgG and 9.23% (CI 4.30%-18.71%) was positive for both. All patients that were positive to IgM underwent molecular testing through RT-qPCR on oral-rhino pharyngeal swabs and only one specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Instead, the presence of IgG from screened volunteers was confirmed by re-testing serum samples using both an ELISA assay validated for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD) and a recently published synthetic peptide-based ELISA assay. In conclusion, our report suggests that (1) early restrictions were successful in limiting COVID-19 diffusion in the district of Benevento; (2) rapid serological analysis is an ideal testing for both determining real seroprevalence and massive screening, whereas detection of viral RNA remains a gold standard for identification of infected patients; (3) even among people without COVID-19 related symptoms, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has individual features.","Polvere, Immacolata; Parrella, Alfredina; Casamassa, Giovanna; D039,; Andrea, Silvia; Tizzano, Annamaria; Cardinale, Gaetano; Voccola, Serena; Porcaro, Piercarmine; Stilo, Romania; Vito, Pasquale; Zotti, Tiziana",Diagnostics (Basel),265,16

However, the benefits of activity control from containing the pandemic has not been examined and assessed. Here we use daily carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in China estimated from statistical data of energy consumption and satellite data of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as an indicator for reduced activities consecutive to a lockdown. We perform a correlation analysis to show that a 1% day-1 decrease in the rate of COVID-19 cases is associated with a reduction in daily CO2 emissions of 0.22±0.02% using statistical data of energy consumption relative to emissions without COVID-19, or 0.20±0.02% using satellite data of atmospheric column NO2. We estimate that swift action in China is effective in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases <100,000 with a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 23% by the end of February 2020, whereas a one-week delay would have required greater containment and a doubling of the emission reduction to meet the same goal. By analyzing the costs of health care and fatalities, we find that the benefits on public-health due to reduced activities in China are ten-fold larger than the loss of gross domestic product. Our findings suggest an unprecedentedly high cost of maintaining activities and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and stress substantial benefits of containment in public health by taking early actions to reduce activities during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Wang, Rong; Xiong, Yuankang; Xing, Xiaofan; Yang, Ruipu; Li, Jiarong; Wang, Yijing; Cao, Junji; Balkanski, Yves; Peñuelas, Josep; Ciais, Philippe; Hauglustaine, Didier; Sardans, Jordi; Chen, Jianmin; Ma, Jianmin; Xu, Tang; Kan, Haidong; Zhang, Yan; Oda, Tomohiro; Morawska, Lidia; Zhang, Renhe; Tao, Shu",Innovation (N Y),265,24

METHODS: We searched for guidelines on diagnosis and/or treatment of COVID-19 through PubMed, CBM, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. In addition, we also searched official websites of the US CDC, European CDC and WHO, and some guideline collection databases. We included diagnosis and/or treatment guidelines for COVID-19, including rapid advice guidelines and interim guidelines. Two trained researchers independently extracted data and four trained researchers evaluated the quality of the guidelines using the AGREE II instruments. We extracted information on the basic characteristics of the guidelines, guideline development process, and the recommendations. We described the consistency of the direction of recommendations for treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 across the included guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 37 guidelines were included. Most included guidelines were assessed as low quality, with only one of the six domains of AGREE II (clarity of presentation) having a mean score above 50%. The mean scores of three domains (stakeholder involvement, the rigor of development and applicability) were all below 30%. The recommendations on diagnosis and treatment were to some extent consistent between the included guidelines. Computed tomography (CT), X-rays, lung ultrasound, RT-PCR, and routine blood tests were the most commonly recommended methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty guidelines were on the treatment of COVID-19. The recommended forms of treatment included supportive care, antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, antibiotics, immunoglobulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), convalescent plasma, and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of currently available diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 is low. The diagnosis and treatment recommendations between the included guidelines are highly consistent. The main diagnostic methods for COVID-19 are RT-PCR and CT, with ultrasound as a potential diagnostic tool. As there is no effective treatment against COVID-19 yet, supportive therapy is at the moment the most important treatment option.","Luo, Xufei; Liu, Yunlan; Ren, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Janne, Estill; Lv, Meng; Wang, Qi; Song, Yang; Mathew, Joseph L; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Chen, Yaolong",J Evid Based Med,265,17

In this study, we provide a coherent overview of the duration of viral detection and viral RNA load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity, and age. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1.11.2019 and 23.04.2020. We pooled the data of selected studies (22/7226 (650 patients) for meta-analysis) to estimate duration of viral detection and visualized viral load over time. FINDINGS: Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT in adult patients (5â¢7 days in mild; 5â¢9 days in moderate-severe patients). The differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection for moderate-severe patients was observed in feces (15 days in mild vs. 21 days in moderate-severe patients) and the URT (12 days in mild vs. 16 days in moderate-severe patients). Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in earlier stages of infection in the URT compared to LRT. INTERPRETATION: This review may aid mathematical modelling and help in defining appropriate endpoints for clinical trails with antivirals in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study highlights the urgent need for international coordination to promote mutual learning about epidemic characteristics and effective control measures as well as to trigger early and timely responses in individual countries. Early release of official guidelines and timely clarification of rumors led by governments are necessary to guide the public to take rational action.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Du, Fanxing; Zhou, Xinyu; Jiang, Hao; Martin, Sam; Larson, Heidi; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,265,30

Despite mild manifestations in most children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is well described in older children with cardiac manifestations. However, MIS-C-related cardiac manifestations are not as well described in younger children. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of MIS-C patients under the age of 5 years admitted between May and November 2020 to a single centre. Included cases fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C according to Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health criteria with laboratory, electrocardiogram, or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Collected data included patients' demographics, laboratory results, echocardiographic findings, management, and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 16 MIS-C cases under 5 years of age, 10 (62.5%) had cardiac manifestations with a median age of 12 months, 9 (90%) were previously healthy. Cardiac manifestations included coronary arterial aneurysms or ectasia in five (50%) cases, two (20%) with isolated myopericarditis, coronary ectasia with myocarditis in two (20%), and supraventricular tachycardia in one (10%). Intravenous immunoglobulins were given in all cases with coronary involvement or myocarditis. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 (6-14) days; two (20%) cases with cardiac disease were mechanically ventilated and mortality in MIS-C cases below 5 years was 12.5%. Normalisation of systolic function occurred in half of the affected cases within 1 week and reached 100% by 30 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 has a high possibility of serious associated cardiac manifestations in children under the age of 5 years with mortality and/or long-term morbidities such as coronary aneurysms even in previously healthy children.","Rakha, Shaimaa; Sobh, Ali; Hager, Amira H; Hafez, Mona; Alsawah, Gehan A; Abuelkheir, Mohamed Magdi; Zeid, Mayada Sabry; Nahas, Mohamed; Elmarsafawy, Hala",Cardiol Young,265,11

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 were categorized into two groups, i.e., older (&#8805;75 years) and younger adults (&#8804;74 years). We evaluated the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory test results, treatments and outcomes of the patients. RESULTS: The majority of the older patients had comorbidities, such as dementia, cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Comorbidities were significantly more frequent in older patients than younger patients. No association was found between age and body temperature or the incidence of respiratory failure. White blood cell count was significantly lower in older patients (P = 0.018) and the decrease in lymphocytes was greater in younger patients (P = 0.009). Computed tomography (CT) of all patients showed non-segmental, peripherally dominant ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. In older patients, antiviral drugs, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on a compassionate use basis. The difference in mortality between the older and the younger patients was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients, typical clinical symptoms and blood test changes were often absent; however, CT always contained typical findings of COVID-19, suggesting that CT may be a useful diagnostic tool.

Undergraduate pharmacy students in years one to three of two four-year entry-to-practice programs at a university in Canada were administered open-book examinations to complete their didactic winter-term courses in pharmaceutical sciences; behavioural, social, and administrative sciences; and pharmacotherapeutics. The impacts of the switch to open-book examinations on final exam characteristics are examined. METHODS: The ratios and correlations of final exam and midterm grades in 2020, where final exams were open-book, and in 2019, where finals were closed-book, were calculated and compared. RESULTS: In 2020, the ratio of final exam to midterm exam scores for five out of seven courses were significantly larger than they were in 2019. Alternatively, for all but one course, the correlations between midterm and final examination grades showed no significant difference from 2019 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2019 when finals were administered in a closed-book format, a sudden shift to an open-book format for final exams in 2020 appears to be associated with the final exams becoming easier relative to midterms. However, when considering how final and midterm exam grades correlate year over year, in all but one class, there was no significant difference. These findings suggest that changing exams to be open-book may change how they can be used to inform criterion-referenced or absolute grading decisions but not norm-referenced or rank-based decisions.","Cor, M Ken; Brocks, Dion R",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,265,15

The continuous ongoing research and clinical trials paved the way for vaccines. But, the vaccine efficacy in the long run is still questionable due to the mutating coronavirus, which makes drug re-positioning a reasonable alternative. COVID-19 has hence fast-paced drug re-positioning for the treatment of COVID-19 and its symptoms. This work builds computational models using matrix completion techniques to predict drug-virus association for drug re-positioning. The aim is to assist clinicians with a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right set of antivirals for the mutated isolate. The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide, which is a novel Tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to its original counterpart (older version) Tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail, the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also demonstrate how the drugs to be used against the virus would vary as SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time by predicting the drugs for the mutated strains, suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction. We believe this work would open up possibilities for applying machine learning models to clinical research for drug-virus association prediction and other similar biological problems.","Mongia, Aanchal; Saha, Sanjay Kr.; Chouzenoux, Emilie; Majumdar, Angshul",Sci Rep,265,26

We presented an age-structured Susceptible-Latent-Mild-Critical-Removed (SLMCR) compartmental model of COVID-19 disease transmission with nonlinear incidence during the pandemic period. We provided the model calibration to estimate parameters with day-wise COVID-19 data, i.e., reported cases by worldometer from 15(th) February to 30(th) March 2020 in six high-burden countries, including Australia, Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK, and Canada. We estimate transmission rates for each country and found that the country with the highest transmission rate is Spain, which may increase the new cases and deaths than the other countries. We found that saturation infection negatively impacted the dynamics of COVID-19 cases in all the six high-burden countries. The study used a sensitivity analysis to identify the most critical parameters through the partial rank correlation coefficient method. We found that the transmission rate of COVID-19 had the most significant influence on prevalence. The prediction of new cases in COVID-19 until 30(th) April 2020 using the developed model was also provided with recommendations to control strategies of COVID-19. We also found that adults are more susceptible to infection than both children and older people in all six countries. However, in Italy, Spain, the UK, and Canada, older people show more susceptibility to infection than children, opposite to the case in Australia and the USA. The information generated from this study would be helpful to the decision-makers of various organisations across the world, including the Ministry of Health in Australia, Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK, and Canada, to control COVID-19.","Rahman, Azizur; Kuddus, Md Abdul",Biomed Res Int,265,20

METHODS: This was a prospective European observational study (the COVIP study) in ICU patients aged 70 years and older admitted with COVID-19 disease from March to December 2020 to 159 ICUs in 14 European countries. An electronic database was used to register a number of parameters including: SOFA score, Clinical Frailty Scale, co-morbidities, usual ICU procedures and survival at 90 days. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04321265). RESULTS: In total, 2625 patients were included, 1327 from the first and 1298 from the second surge. Median age was 74 and 75 years in surge 1 and 2, respectively. SOFA score was higher in the first surge (median 6 versus 5, p < 0.0001). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at admission was higher during surge 1, and more patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (78% versus 68%, p < 0.0001). During the first 15 days of treatment, survival was similar during the first and the second surge. Survival was lower in the second surge after day 15 and differed after 30 days (57% vs 50%) as well as after 90 days (51% vs 40%). CONCLUSION: An unexpected, but significant, decrease in 30-day and 90-day survival was observed during the second surge in our cohort of elderly ICU patients. The reason for this is unclear. Our main concern is whether the widespread changes in practice and treatment of COVID-19 between the two surges have contributed to this increased mortality in elderly patients. Further studies are urgently warranted to provide more evidence for current practice in elderly patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04321265, registered March 19th, 2020.

Such information can be crucial to the improvement of communication efforts by public health officials and clinicians. The aim of this study was to identify awareness, attitudes, and practices related to influenza A (H1N1) among the Saudi public. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,548 adult subjects recruited from various shopping malls in Riyadh and Jeddah was conducted. All of the subjects were interviewed using a questionnaire that tested their knowledge, attitudes, and use of precautionary measures in relation to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: More than half (54.3%, 840/1548) of the participants showed high concern, 43.7%(677/1548) showed a low level of knowledge, and 60.8%(941/1548) had taken minimal or no precautionary measures. After adjusting for other variables, education level was the only significant predictor of the level of concern (p < 0.001), while greater precautionary measures were taken by participants who were male (p < 0.001), older (p = 0.047), better educated (p = 0.04), and more knowledgeable (p < 0.001). More than one-third (38.3%) of participants were not convinced that the MOH reports about the disease were true, and only 16.1% of the participants reported receiving information from health providers. CONCLUSIONS: High concern did not translate into a higher compliance with precautionary recommendations, possibly due to the low level of knowledge about the disease among the public. Frequent communication between physicians and the public is recommended to help dispel myths about the disease and to spread better information about the role that the public can play in limiting the spread of the disease.","Balkhy, Hanan H; Abolfotouh, Mostafa A; Al-Hathlool, Rawabi H; Al-Jumah, Mohammad A",BMC Infect Dis,265,14

Cela a été associé à des directives d’arrêt des dépistages du cancer du sein puis de reprise de l’activité mammographique selon des modalités précises hiérarchisant les priorités. L’objectif principal de ce travail, réalisé dans deux régions françaises, l’Île-de-France et les Hauts-de-France, était de mesurer l’impact de la crise sanitaire sur la participation au dépistage organisé du cancer du sein. Il s’agissait par ailleurs de disposer d’une vision globale des dépistages en recueillant les données du dépistage individuel. En tout, sur l’ensemble de l’année 2020, l’activité de dépistage organisé a représenté 92% de l’activité de 2019 en Île-de-France et 93% dans les Hauts-de-France, alors que pendant deux mois l’activité était tombée à moins de 10% de l’activité habituelle et que pendant deux autres mois l’activité était en-deçà de l’activité normale. Le bilan en fin d’année témoigne donc d’un fort rattrapage lors du second semestre 2020. Après la prise en compte de l’activité de dépistage individuel, une réduction globale mais modérée de 6 à 7% du dépistage du cancer du sein a été observée dans les deux régions en 2020. Il conviendra dans les suites de ce travail d’analyser les conséquences de ces observations sur le stade évolutif des cancers détectés, ainsi que sur les délais de prises en charge. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic, France declared a full lockdown from the 16th March 2020 to the 11th May 2020. This was coupled with directives to stop breast cancer screening. Mammographic activities were then resumed according to precise modalities establishing a hierarchy of priorities. The main objective of this study, carried out in two French regions, Île-de-France and Hauts-de-France, was to measure the impact of the health crisis on participation in organised breast cancer screening. The aim was also to obtain a global overview of screening by collecting data on individual screening. Altogether, over the whole of 2020, organized breast cancer screening activity was equivalent to 92% of 2019 activity in Île-de-France and 93% in Hauts-de-France. Activity was below the normal level for a total of 4 months, including two months where activity had fallen to less than 10% of the usual mammographic activity. The annual review therefore indicates a significant recovery of the mammographic activity in the second half of the year 2020. After taking into account individual screening activity, an overall but moderate reduction of 6 to 7% in breast cancer screening was observed in the two regions in 2020. As the follow-up of this work, it will be necessary to examine the consequences of these observations on the stage of the cancers detected, as well as on the time taken to start a treatment.","Vincelet, Catherine; Forzy, Marie-Laure; Bernoux, Agnès; Koivogui, Akoï",Imagerie de la Femme,265,1

We included cross-sectional studies that reported factors associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Random-effects models were used to pool odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42020186735). FINDINGS: We included 68 studies comprising 288,830 participants from 19 countries. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% CI: 28%-39%) and 30% (26%-36%).

These factors (except for residential area) were also associated with higher depression odds. Furthermore, higher COVID-19 infection risk (suspected/confirmed cases, living in hard-hit areas, having pre-existing physical or mental conditions) and longer media exposure were associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression.

An observational study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of specific procedures and of a serial testing approach adopted for the COVID-19 prevention in an Italian correctional facility (Bari, Apulia) for inmates affected by chronic diseases. Methods: Two SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing campaigns were carried out for all the prisoners and correctional workers, including correctional officers (CO), administrative staff (AS), correctional health care workers (HCW), and operators working with people completing their sentence outside the prison (OOP). Antigen testing was conducted on nasopharyngeal swab specimens, using a fluorescence immunoassay for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen. All subjects positive to the antigen test underwent confirmation by rRT-PCR test. Results: In total, 426 new and residential inmates were tested during the first campaign and 480 during the second campaign. Only two new inmates resulted positive at the first campaign, while no positive cases were observed at the second campaign or outside of the testing campaigns. In total, 367 correctional workers were tested at the first campaign and 325 at the second. At the first, 4 CO and 2 HCW showed positive test results, while no new positive cases were observed at the second.

Older patients present several comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure) and are exposed to multiple medical interventions such as the use of nephrotoxic contrasts media and medications, which can also trigger AKI. Considering the emerging relevance of this condition, prevention and treatment of AKI in the elderly should be crucial in the internist and emergency setting. This review article summarizes the incidence, the risk factors, the pathophysiology, the molecular mechanisms and the strategies of prevention and treatment of AKI in elderly patients.","Infante, Barbara; Franzin, Rossana; Madio, Desirèe; Calvaruso, Martina; Maiorano, Annamaria; Sangregorio, Fabio; Netti, Giuseppe Stefano; Ranieri, Elena; Gesualdo, Loreto; Castellano, Giuseppe; Stallone, Giovanni",J Clin Med,265,24

According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19. The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person’s vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis. The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms. There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.","Boccardi, Virginia; Ruggiero, Carmelinda; Mecocci, Patrizia",Geriatrics (Basel),265,23

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have not been well described. We describe the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary children’s hospital in South India. METHODS: To determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS. RESULTS: Of 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month–17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1–170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p = 0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIMS-TS (54.8 AU/mL). CONCLUSION: We describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary children’s hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS. Antibody levels may be helpful in the diagnosis and disease stratification of PIMS-TS. LAY SUMMARY: Children usually present with minimal or no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) or Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) has emerged as a distinctive paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being used increasingly as a diagnostic test for PIMS-TS. However, data on the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children are sparse. We, therefore, attempted to identify the seropositivity and describe the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection amongst infants and children getting hospitalised in a children’s hospital in south India. Nearly one-fifth of the hospitalised children tested serology positive over 4 months. Antibody levels in children with PIMS-TS were significantly higher in comparison to the other two groups (acute COVID-19 infection and children without PIMS-TS). Results from our study suggest that all children are at risk of COVID-19 infection though they may present with mild illness or no symptoms. We also observed that antibody testing may have a possible role in diagnosis of PIMS-TS.","Venkataraman, Aishwarya; Balasubramanian, S; Putilibai, Sulochana; Lakshan Raj, S; Amperayani, Sumanth; Senthilnathan, S; Manoharan, Anand; Sophi, Arokia; Amutha, R; Sadasivam, Kalaimaran; Goenka, Anu; Ramanan, A V",J Trop Pediatr,265,29

Such immunopathological features provide a rationale for the use of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma as a source of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies and of anti-inflammatory plasma components. While convalescent plasma therapy is now being evaluated in prospective clinical trials, we further consider the therapeutic potential of human hyper immune globulins, and of heterologous, engineered and monoclonal neutralizing antibodies as anti-viral agents to treat COVID-19.

Methods Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA∼E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75% ethanol inactivation; C:56 ℃ incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 ℃ incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-inactivation using RNA virus special preservation fluid added into the sampling tube to treated the nasopharyngeal swab sample separately, using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the N gene of COVID-19 and the ORF1ab gene simultaneously. All the groups are diluted in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 ratios. The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Results For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P＜0.001). The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency. Conclusion The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt pre-inactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons.","Yueying, Wang; Song, Wei; Zhao, Zuguo; Chen, Ping; Liu, Jian; Li, Chende",Virus Res,265,20

Molecular modeling and experimental approaches are being used to identify and develop inhibitors of human DNMTs. Most of the computational efforts conducted so far with DNMT1 employ homology models of the enzyme. Recently, a crystallographic structure of the methyltransferase domain of human DNMT1 bound to unmethylated DNA was published. Following on our previous computational and experimental studies with DNMTs, we herein present molecular dynamics of the crystal structure of human DNMT1. Docking studies of established DNMT1 inhibitors with the crystal structure gave rise to a structure-based pharmacophore model that suggests key interactions of the inhibitors with the catalytic binding site. Results had a good agreement with the docking and pharmacophore models previously developed using a homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1. The docking protocol was able to distinguish active DNMT1 inhibitors from, for example, experimentally known inactive DNMT1 inhibitors. As part of our efforts to identify novel inhibitors of DNMT1, we conducted the experimental characterization of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) that in preliminary docking studies showed promising activity. ATA had a sub-micromolar inhibition (IC(50) = 0.68 μM) against DNMT1. ATA was also evaluated for Dnmt3a inhibition showing an IC(50) = 1.4 μM. This chapter illustrates the synergy from integrating molecular modeling and experimental methods for further advance the discovery of novel candidates for epigenetic therapies.","Yoo, Jakyung; Kim, Joo Hee; Robertson, Keith D.; Medina-Franco, José L.",Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology,265,24

These eCoVs share extensive sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2, and immune responses to eCoVs can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Based on such cross-reactivity of antigens among eCoVs, the IgG antibodies against the spike protein (SP) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were isolated from pig serum using magnetic beads immobilized with SARS-CoV SP and a protein-A column. The selectivity of the isolated antibodies was tested using different types of antigens, such as SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP), influenza A virus (Beijing type), influenza B virus (Tokio and Florida types), human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and bovine serum albumin (BSA). From the selectivity test, the anti-SP antibodies isolated from pig serum had sufficient selectivity to other kinds of viral antigens, and the apparent binding constant of the isolated antibodies was approximately 1.5 × 10(–8) M from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. Finally, the isolated anti-SP antibodies were applied to the immunoassay of SP using competitive immunoassay configuration. The feasibility of the detection as well as the quantitative analysis of the SARS-CoV viral culture fluid was determined using four viral culture samples, namely, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and CoV-229E.","Jung, Jaeyong; Bong, Ji-Hong; Kim, Tae-Hun; Sung, Jeong Soo; Lee, Changkyu; Kang, Min-Jung; Kim, Hyun Ok; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Pyun, Jae-Chul",Biochip J,265,1

The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces under freezing conditions. One 15.24 X 15.24 X 2.54 cm aluminum coupon, contaminated with swine feces, and randomly matched to one pig was the experimental unit. Eight treatment groups representing two AHP concentrations (1:16 and 1:32) in a 10% propylene glycol solution, two contact times in a -10 °C freezer (40 min and 60 min), and two levels of fecal contamination (5 mL and 10 mL) in addition to negative and positive control groups were evaluated. Forty 3-week-old pigs, intragastrically inoculated with the contents of the coupons after treatment, were used as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of PEDV after treatment. Infectivity was determined by detection of virus with a nucleocapsid (N) gene-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days three and seven post-inoculation. RESULTS: All post-treatment swabs from the negative control coupons were negative for PEDV via RT-qPCR. All post-treatment swabs collected from coupons in the AHP disinfectant treatment groups and the positive control group were positive for PEDV via RT-qPCR. For the bioassay, no rectal swabs from pigs in the negative control (0 of 4) or the AHP disinfectant treatment groups (0 of 32) were positive for PEDV. Rectal swabs from all pigs within the positive control group (4 of 4) were positive for PEDV by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, 1:16 and 1:32 dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 °C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. This study also suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions, but does not necessarily indicate that an infectious dose of PEDV remains after disinfection.

This study aims to study D-dimer levels in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes among patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this observational study 98 moderate and severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection were included at a dedicated COVID hospital. The study group was divided into patients with diabetes and without diabetes. Peak D-dimer was measured in both the groups and compared using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: In our study peak D-dimer levels were 1509 ± 2420 ng/mL (Mean ± SD) in people with diabetes and 515 ± 624 ng/mL (Mean ± SD) in patients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes had higher D-dimer levels which were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows COVID-19 patients with diabetes had significantly higher D-dimer levels.

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation. Methods: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation. Results: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","Wang, Yixin; Zhang, Yao; Liu, Yang; Tian, Jiang; Zhong, Cheng; Shi, Zhongchao; Zhang, Yang; He, Zhiqiang",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,265,1

HBP and IL-6 were measured by immunoassays at admission and on day 7 in 178 patients with pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified into non-sepsis and sepsis as per the Sepsis-3 definitions and were followed up for the development of severe respiratory failure (SRF) and for outcome. Results were confirmed by multivariate analyses. HBP was significantly higher in patients classified as having sepsis and was negatively associated with the oxygenation ratio and positively associated with creatinine and lactate. Logistic regression analysis evidenced admission HBP more than 18 ng/ml and IL-6 more than 30 pg/ml as independent risk factors for the development of SRP. Their integration prognosticated SRF with respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 59.1%, 96.3%, 83.9%, and 87.8%. Cox regression analysis evidenced admission HBP more than 35 ng/ml and IL-6 more than 30 pg/ml as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality.

DESIGN: The Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology Section implemented a visiting clinical professor program to address the need for collaboration, idea-sharing, mentorship, and diffusion of innovation to clinicians in critical care practice. SETTING: Critical care pharmacy departments at 12 medical centers. SUBJECTS: Twelve visiting clinical professors and host institutions from 2007-2018. INTERVENTION: After an application is submitted to the section steering committee, an experienced clinician is paired with an institution, and a site visit is planned in collaboration with the visiting clinical professor program coordinators. The expert clinician visits the institution to share their insights and best practices based on visit goals and objectives. Reflective debriefing with both the host institution and the visiting clinical professor occurs after the visit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The program has demonstrated numerous benefits including shared best practices related to critical care clinical services, expansion and refinement of care delivery models, development and optimization of research programs, and advancement of new training programs including specialty pharmacy residencies. Both the site and visiting professor find these partnerships beneficial, which has resulted in sustained success of the program over an 11-year period. Key resultant deliverables after visits have included new pharmacist positions, advancement of pharmacy services, and expanded access to academic opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: A professional organization led visiting clinical professor program is viable, sustainable, and yields clear benefit for critical care pharmacy programs across the country. Application of this framework to other areas of pharmacy practice may be an avenue to share best practices and advance pharmacy services.","Louzon, Patricia R.; Willmon, Julie; Coles, Laura; Barreto, Erin F.",Crit Care Explor,265,26

For example, prior to the pandemic, per capita health expenditure and ratio of health care personnel to the general population were low (Institute of Health Matrix and Evaluation 2020); moreover, there is a poor political will to improve health care generally. To compound this in Nigeria is the fact that insurgence is common, especially in the Northeastern part of the country, and that has produced many internally displaced persons who live in various camps. In addition, there are many street children begging for alms partly due to religious and cultural reasons; these again are more common in Northern Nigeria. It therefore looks like the ground is fertile for a rapid spread of Covid-19.","Baiyewu, O.; Elugbadebo, O.; Oshodi, Y.",International psychogeriatrics,265,20

DESIGN: Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models—with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood—are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. RESULTS: An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands may have helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Policies that lead to an increase in household specific humidity to over 6g/Kg will help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Ravelli, Edsard; Gonzales Martinez, Rolando",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,265,1

To date, thousands of genetic variants have been identified across strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from worldwide patients. However, there is still little direct evidence linking viral variants and clinical features. Based on two tightly linked SNPs, we previously divided SARS-CoV-2 into two major lineages: the ancestral ‘S lineage’ (U8,782 and C28,144) and the derived ‘L lineage’ (C8,782 and U28,144). Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages from 271 COVID-19 patients during the early outbreak of this pandemic in Wuhan, including 73 S- and 198 L-lineage patients. The S-lineage patients exhibited significantly worse clinical severity than the L-lineage patients, even after excluding other risk factors. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 lineage may provide useful clinical information for the management of COVID-19 and support the argument that viral clades should be analyzed as a function of clinical severity.","Hu, Ben; Liu, Ran; Tang, Xiaolu; Pan, Yuchen; Wang, Ming; Tong, Yongqing; Ye, Guangming; Shen, Gaigai; Ying, Ruochen; Fu, Aisi; Li, Di; Zhao, Wanxu; Peng, Jing; Guo, Jie; Men, Dong; Yao, Xinmin; Wang, Yirong; Zhang, Hong; Feng, Zhihui; Yu, Junping; Chen, Liangjun; Deng, Zixin; Lu, Xuemei; Zhang, Ya-Ping; Li, Yirong; Liu, Bende; Yu, Lilei; Li, Yan; Lu, Jian; Liu, Tiangang",Natl Sci Rev,265,24

Our study’s purpose was to empirically examine how perceptions of childbearing deadline age vary in association with availability and prevalence of ART across different countries. The present study used data from the 2006 European Social Survey and the 2006 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology to examine selected EU countries. A total sample of 17,487 respondents was examined. Multilevel regression modeling was used. Results showed that first, younger generations were more generous with maternal childbearing ages but stricter with paternal deadline ages. Second, respondents residing in countries with higher percentage of reproductive clinics per population were more generous with maternal ages, however no significant association was observed with regard to paternal childbearing ages. Third, on the contrary, respondents residing in countries with higher utilization of ART treatments were stricter with maternal ages, which may be because they are more likely to be aware of the physiological and financial difficulties associated with ART treatments. The present study is meaningful in that it is the first study to empirically examine social perceptions of childbearing ages in relation with ART.","Kim, Eun Jung; Cho, Min Jung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,265,9

The transmission process and outbreak pattern of SARS is still not well understood. This study aims to find a simple model to describe the outbreak pattern of SARS cases by using SARS case data commonly released by governments. The outbreak pattern of cumulative SARS cases is expected to be a logistic type because the infection will be slowed down due to the increasing control effort by people and/or due to depletion of susceptible individuals. The increase rate of SARS cases is expected to decrease with the cumulative SARS cases, as described by the traditional logistical model, which is widely used in population dynamic studies. The instantaneous rate of increases were significantly and negatively correlated with the cumulative SARS cases in mainland of China (including Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia) and Singapore. The basic reproduction numberR (0) in Asia ranged from 2.0 to 5.6 (except for Taiwan, China). TheR (0) of Hebei and Tianjin were much higher than that of Singapore, Hongkong, Beijing, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, indicating SARS virus might have originated differently or new mutations occurred during transmission. We demonstrated that the outbreaks of SARS in many regions of Asia were well described by the logistic model, and the control measures implemented by governments are effective. The maximum instantaneous rate of increase, basic reproductive number, and maximum cumulative SARS cases were also calculated by using the logistic model.","Zhang, Zhibin; Sheng, Chengfa; Ma, Zufei; Li, Dianmo",Chin Sci Bull,265,1

For two months, Australians were asked to remain at home and only leave for essential activities. We investigate the impact this had on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Methods: Australians aged 18+ were eligible to participate in an online survey from 23 April-11 May 2020. Questions included contraceptive use, pregnancy intentions and access to SRH services. We report on the experiences of 518 female participants aged <50 years. Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use were analysed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate difficulty accessing SRH products and services. Qualitative data were analysed using descriptive thematic analysis. Results: Most participants (55.4%, 287/518) were aged 18-24 years. Most (76.1%, 379/498) indicated they were trying to avoid pregnancy. The oral contraceptive pill was the most common single method used (20.8%; 107/514). Nearly 20% (101/514) reported they were not using contraception. Older women (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.9 for 25-34 vs 18-24 years) and those employed (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7) had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. Women aged 25-34 (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7) or 35-49 years (OR=0.3; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.6) were less likely to experience difficulty accessing feminine hygiene products. Qualitative analysis suggested that COVID-19 affected pregnancy plans, with participants delaying childbearing, or deciding to remain childfree. Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown impacted the SRH of Australian women.

Using a largescale nationally representative longitudinal survey with children aged 10–15, we estimate comprehensive life satisfaction models that account for heterogeneity in exogenous circumstances in children’s lives, focussing on family income and material deprivation. We find empirical support for the hypothesis that children are more satisfied with their lives, the more income their family has and the less material deprivation they experience throughout their teens. There are, however, differences across age groups with children aged 12–15 experiencing greater life satisfaction losses on account of lower family material wellbeing than younger children. Overall, income effects for older children are small but statistically significant when accounting for unobserved individual differences.","Knies, Gundi",J Happiness Stud,265,1

We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic.

Whilst evidence suggests that children are not impacted by COVID-19 as severely as adults, little is still known about their transmission potential, and with a lot of asymptomatic cases they may be silent transmitters (i.e. infectious without showing clinical signs of disease), albeit at a lower level than adults. In relation to this, it is somewhat concerning that in many countries children are cared for, or are often in close contact with, older individuals such as grandparents ─ the age group most at risk of acquiring serious respiratory complications resulting in death. MAIN TEXT: We emphasise that in the absence of a vaccine or an effective therapeutic drug, preventive measures such as good hygiene practices ─ hand washing, cough etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social distancing represent the major (in fact only) weapons that we have against COVID-19. Accordingly, we stress that there is a pressing need to develop specific COVID-19 prevention messages for schoolchildren. CONCLUSION: An entertainment education intervention for schoolchildren systematically implemented in schools would be highly effective and fill this need. With such measures in place there would be greater confidence around the opening of schools.","Gray, Darren J.; Kurscheid, Johanna; Mationg, Mary Lorraine; Williams, Gail M.; Gordon, Catherine; Kelly, Matthew; Wangdi, Kinley; McManus, Donald P.",Infect Dis Poverty,265,22

This study aims to evaluate job stress level and suggest viable solutions. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on clinical pharmacists (CPs) in 128 hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Job stress questions were derived from the Healthcare Profession Stress Inventory (HPSI). Results: A total of 197 CPs participated, giving a response rate of 82.4%. Participants were found to have moderate job stress with an overall mean stress score of 1.5 (0.4) and stress rate of 52.8%. The sample size was statistically adequate and the HPSI was valid and reliable. Patient care responsibility was the main stressor, especially in public hospitals, followed by job conflicts. Lack of experience, low income, and inability to participate in clinical ward rounds caused significant stress to CPs regarding job recognition and job uncertainty. More practice-oriented training programs in bachelor curricula and clinical practice should be applied to help CPs gain more experience, self-confidence, and diminish job stress.

A vast amount of structural information is available for the ectodomain of S, a primary target by the host immune system, but much less is known regarding its transmembrane domain (TMD) and its membrane-proximal regions. Here, we determined the NMR structure of the S protein TMD in bicelles that closely mimic a lipid bilayer. The TMD structure is a transmembrane α-helix (TMH) trimer that assembles spontaneously in a membrane. The trimer structure shows an extensive hydrophobic core along the 3-fold axis that resembles that of a trimeric leucine/isoleucine zipper, but with tetrad, not heptad, repeats. The trimeric core is strong in bicelles, resisting hydrogen–deuterium exchange for weeks. Although highly stable, structural guided mutagenesis identified single mutations that can completely dissociate the TMD trimer. Multiple studies have shown that the membrane anchors of viral fusion proteins can form highly specific oligomers, but the exact function of these oligomers remains unclear.

The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is a peptide motif in the ACE2 protein. We studied interaction of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with an array of glycoconjugates, including various sialylated, sulfated, and other glycans, and found that the S protein binds some (but not all) glycans of the lactosamine family. We suggest that parallel influenza infection will promote SARS-CoV-2 adhesion to the respiratory epithelial cells due to the unmasking of lactosamine chains by the influenza virus neuraminidase.

In this article, I argue that digital technologies and data practices in the response to COVID-19 amplify social inequalities, which are already accentuated by the pandemic, thus leading to a “second-order disaster”—a human-made disaster which further traps disadvantaged people into precarity. Inequalities are reproduced both in the everyday uses of technology for distance learning and remote work as well as in the public health response. Applications such as contact tracing apps raise concerns about “function creep”—the reuse of data for different purposes than the one for which they were originally collected—while they normalize surveillance which has been traditionally used on marginalized communities. The outsourcing of the digital public health response consolidates the arrival of the privatized digital welfare state, which increases risks of potential discrimination.","Madianou, Mirca",Soc Media Soc,265,29

This study used the effort–reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULTS: The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the harmful effects of effort and over-commitment on mental health among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Such effects could be alleviated through an appropriate reward system, especially the development and job acceptance dimensions of such a system. These findings highlight the importance of establishing an emergency reward system, comprising reasonable work-allocation mechanism, bonuses and honorary titles, a continuous education system and better career-development opportunities.

Innovative solutions to facilitate remote therapeutic drug monitoring are therefore required. Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling can be undertaken by patients at home and samples returned by post to central laboratories. We sought to report the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on requests for therapeutic drug monitoring and the equivalence, acceptability and effectiveness of low volume Patient-led Remote IntraCapillary pharmacoKinetic Sampling (fingerPRICKS) compared to conventional venepuncture. METHODS We undertook a cross-sectional blood sampling methods comparison study and compared sample types using linear regression models. Drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured using standard ELISAs. Acceptability was assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire. RESULTS Therapeutic drug monitoring requests for adalimumab (96.5 [70.5 - 106] per week to 52 [33.5 - 57.0], p < 0.001) but not infliximab (184.5 [161.2 - 214.2] to 161 [135 - 197.5], p = 0.34) reduced during the first UK stay-at-home lockdown compared with the preceding six months.Fingerprick sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab drug, and anti-adalimumab and -infliximab antibody levels. The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195µL (130-210). More than 87% (90/103) patients agreed that intracapillary testing was easy and 69% (71/103) preferred it to conventional venepuncture.In routine care, 75.3% (58/77) patients returned two blood samples within 14 days to permit remote assessment of biologic therapeutic drug monitoring.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (“seroprevalence”) in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. Study design/Methods. Between ISO week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods. Results. The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% CI 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex, or geographical area. Conclusions. At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections, that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures, and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died. The first COVID-19 diagnosis in Scotland was notified on 1 March 2020. WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. On 23 March 2020, lockdown measures for Scotland and the rest of the UK were implemented. By the end of the first wave of the epidemic, Scotland was estimated to have the third highest rate of excess mortality in Europe after England and Spain [1]. Here, that sought to maximise the use of existing residual blood samples from primary care (general practice) settings to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (“seroprevalence”) in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time.

An average of 13.7% and 3.5% of plasmablast-derived MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. A subset of anti-spike (10 of 32) antibodies cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested and harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen of 32 anti-spike MAbs, including five anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD), three anti-non-RBD S1 and six anti-S2, neutralised wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays. Anti-RBD MAbs were further grouped into four cross-inhibiting clusters, of which six antibodies from three separate clusters blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 and five were neutralising. All ACE2-blocking anti-RBD antibodies were isolated from two recovered patients with prolonged fever, which is compatible with substantial ACE2-blocking response in their sera. Finally, the identification of non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies would offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Kuan-Ying A.; Tan, Tiong Kit; Chen, Ting-Hua; Huang, Chung-Guei; Harvey, Ruth; Hussain, Saira; Chen, Cheng-Pin; Harding, Adam; Gilbert-Jaramillo, Javier; Liu, Xu; Knight, Michael; Schimanski, Lisa; Shih, Shin-Ru; Lin, Yi-Chun; Cheng, Chien-Yu; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Ma, Che; James, William; Daniels, Rodney S.; McCauley, John W.; Rijal, Pramila; Townsend, Alain R.",PLoS Pathog,265,1

Methods: We analyzed retrospective data regarding general characteristics, epidemiologic history, underlying chronic diseases, clinical symptoms and complications, chest computed tomography findings, biochemical monitoring, disease severity, treatments, and outcomes among 37 adult patients with COVID-19. According to the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine, the patients were divided into the ≤20 and >20-day groups, and the similarities and differences between them were compared. Results: Among the 37 patients, five had mild disease, 30 had moderate disease, one had severe disease, and one was critically ill. All of the patients were released from quarantine, and no mortality was observed. The average duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine was 20.2 ± 6.6 days. The average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 4.1 ± 3.7 days, and the patients were hospitalized for an average of 16.1 ± 6.2 days. The average age was 44.3 ± 1.67 years, and 78.4% of cases were caused by exposure to a patient with confirmed disease or the workplace of a patient with confirmed disease. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever (62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat (21.6%), vomiting, and diarrhea (21.6%). White blood cell count was decreased in 27.0% of patients, and lymphocyte count was decreased in 62.2% of the patients, among whom 43.5% patients had counts of ≤0.6 × 10(9)/L. On admission, 86.5% of patients showed pneumonia in chest CT scans, including some asymptomatic patients, while 68.8% of patients showed bilateral infiltration. In the >20-day group, the average age was 49.9 ± 1.38 years, and the average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 ± 3.9 days. Compared with the ≤20-day group, patients in the >20-day group were older and the duration was longer (P < 0.05). All of the seven asymptomatic patients belonged to the ≤20-day group. When the 37 patients were released from quarantine, the white blood cell count of 16.2% of the patients was <4.0 × 10(9)/L, the lymphocyte count of 59.5% of the patients was <1.1 × 10(9)/L, and the absolute counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 5.02 ± 1.34 × 10(9)/L and 1.03 ± 0.34 × 10(9)/L, respectively, compared with those recorded on admission (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The majority of COVID-19 cases in the study area were mild and moderate, with good clinical outcomes. There were some special characteristics in the clinical course. The reasons for differences in the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine were complex. There was no significant change in the number of granulocytes at the time of release from quarantine compared to that at the time of admission.","Tian, Suochen; Chang, Zhenqin; Wang, Yunxia; Wu, Min; Zhang, Wenming; Zhou, Guijie; Zou, Xiuli; Tian, Hui; Xiao, Tingfang; Xing, Junmin; Chen, Juan; Han, Jian; Ning, Kang; Wu, Tiejun",Front Med (Lausanne),265,28

METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective observational study in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with 32 beds in Ankara City Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, from March 13, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Patients who needed positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from the patients’ electronic medical records. As outcomes, the hospitalization rate of all pediatric patients diagnosed as having with COVID-19 by PCR, PICU admission rate for COVID-19 pneumonia among all hospitalized patients, PPV support rate, intensive care hospitalization duration (days), total hospitalization duration (days), survival rate, and tracheotomy requirement were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, 7033 children tested positive for COVID-19 in PCR tests. Of these patients, 1219 were hospitalized for COVID-19. Seventeen patients needed PPV support because of COVD-19 pneumonia. High proportion (65%) of patients admitted to the PICU had co-morbid diseases. Noninvasive ventilation was applied in 15 patients (88%). The hospitalization rate among the children with COVID-19 was 17%, of whom 1.6% were admitted to the PICU. Mortality rates were 0.056% of all the cases and 0.32% of the hospitalized patients in our hospital. CONCLUSION: The presence of a co-morbid disease could be a sign of severe disease in children with higher lethality. Very few children required PPV support because of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ozcan, Serhan; Emeksiz, Serhat; Perk, Oktay; Uyar, Emel; Kanik Yüksek, Saliha",J Trop Pediatr,265,4

Although the genomes of a few of these viruses have been studied in-depth, the composition and processing of the polyproteins produced from their main ORFs have not. The Marafivirus polyprotein consists of essential proteins that form the viral replicase, as well as structural proteins for virus assembly. It has been proposed that Marafiviruses code for cysteine proteases within their polyproteins, which act as endopeptidases to autocatalytically cleave the polyprotein into functional domains. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that Marafivirus endopeptidases may have deubiquitinating activity, which has been shown to enhance viral replication by downregulating viral protein degradation by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasomal pathway as well as tampering with cell signaling associated with innate antiviral responses in other positive-sense ssRNA viruses. Here, we provide the first evidence of cysteine proteases from six different Marafiviruses that harbor deubiquitinating activity and reveal intragenus differences toward Ub linkage types. We also examine the structural basis of the endopeptidase/deubiquitinase from the Marafivirus type member, maize rayado fino virus. Structures of the enzyme alone and bound to Ub reveal marked structural rearrangements that occur upon binding of Ub and provide insights into substrate specificity and differences that set it apart from other viral cysteine proteases.","Patel, Ankoor; McBride, Jessica A.M.; Mark, Brian L.",J Biol Chem,265,21

Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a type I interferon induced ubiquitin-like modifier. In addition to conjugating to potentially hundreds of target proteins, ISG15 can be found in an unconjugated form both inside of the cell and released from interferon stimulated cells into the extracellular environment.

INTERVENTION: This project was undertaken in four phases. During phase 1, an informal discussion was held with the breastfeeding mothers, service providers, and community partner in identifying issues surrounding lactation counselling facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. During phase 2, recommendations from 23 organizations with regard to breastfeeding during COVID-19 were reviewed and analyzed. During phase 3, using evidence from reliable sources, a 5-minute animated e-resource on breastfeeding during COVID-19 was conceptualized and developed. During phase 4, the e-resource was disseminated to the breastfeeding mothers, general public, post-secondary institutions, and organizations providing services to breastfeeding mothers in Canada. OUTCOMES: This evidence-based e-resource facilitated addressing misconceptions around breastfeeding during COVID-19 and raising public awareness on safe infant feeding practices during this pandemic. Overall, the video was described as an informative, user-friendly, useful, and easily accessible resource by breastfeeding mothers who were in self-isolation with little access to healthcare services during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: This project highlighted the importance of patient engagement and collaboration with the community partner in protecting breastfeeding during the COVID-19pandemic. It further illustrated how informational e-resources can protect breastfeeding in situations where breastfeeding mothers access to healthcare services is compromised.","Hirani, Shela Akbar Ali; Pearce, Megan; Lanoway, Amanda",Can J Public Health,265,24

With the accumulation of data, there is an urgent need for comparisons and searches of microbiome samples among thousands of millions of samples in a fast and accurate manner. However, it is a very difficult computational challenge to identify similar samples, as well as identify their likely origins, among such a grand pool of samples from all around the world. Currently, several approaches have already been proposed for such a challenge, based on either distance calculation, unsupervised algorithms, or supervised algorithms. These methods have advantages and disadvantages for the different settings of comparisons and searches, and their results are also drastically different. In this review, we systematically compared distance-based, unsupervised, and supervised methods for microbiome sample comparison and search. Firstly, we assessed their accuracy and efficiency, both in theory and in practice. Then we described the scenarios in which one or multiple methods were applicable for sample searches. Thirdly, we provided several applications for microbiome sample comparisons and searches, and provided suggestions on the choice of methods. Finally, we provided several perspectives for the future development of microbiome sample comparison and search, including deep learning technologies for tracking the sources of microbiome samples.","Zha, Yuguo; Chong, Hui; Ning, Kang",Front Microbiol,265,21

The antiviral effects of CQ and HCQ have been demonstrated in vitro due to their ability to block viruses like coronavirus SARS in cell culture. CQ and HCQ have been proposed to reduce immune reactions to infectious agents, inhibit pneumonia exacerbation, and improve lung imaging investigations. CQ analogs have also revealed the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in treating viral infections and related ailments. There was, moreover, convincing evidence from early trials in China about the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in the anti-COVID-19 procedure. Since then, research and studies have been massive to ascertain these drugs’ efficacy and safety in treating the viral disease. In the present review, we construct a synopsis of the main properties and current data concerning the metabolism of CQ/HCQ, which were the basis of assessing their potential therapeutic roles against the new coronavirus infection. The effective role of QC and HCQ in the prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19 infection is discussed in light of the latest international medical-scientific research results. KEY POINTS: • Data concerning metabolism and properties of CQ/HCQ are discussed. • The efficacy of CQ/HCQ against COVID-19 has been the subject of contradictory results. • CQ/HCQ has little or no effect in reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2-affected patients.","Gasmi, Amin; Peana, Massimiliano; Noor, Sadaf; Lysiuk, Roman; Menzel, Alain; Gasmi Benahmed, Asma; Bjørklund, Geir",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,265,3

Several cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been previously described. QT prolongation has been reported in COVID-19 infection in association with medications such as azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine but has not previously been reported as a direct result of COVID-19 infection. Case summary. We report the case of a 65-year-old female who developed a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) during a hospital admission with COVID-19. This patient was not on any QT prolonging treatment, serum electrolytes were normal, and there was no identifiable reversible cause for the QTc lengthening. Daily serial ECGs during admission showed resolution of the ventricular repolarization abnormality in synchronization with resolution of her COVID-19 viral illness. Discussions. Although there have been reports of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients, previous reports of this are for patients receiving medication that causes QT prolongation. This case uniquely demonstrates the development and resolution of this temporary ventricular repolarization abnormality in a patient with a structurally normal heart with no evidence of myocardial fibrosis or edema on cardiac MRI, that is unexplained by other confounding factors, such as medication. This suggests there may be a direct association between COVID-19 and temporary QTc prolongation.","Coyle, Mark; Wilkinson, Mark; Sheehy, Mark",Case Rep Cardiol,265,20

The attitude towards flu vaccination in light of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far been studied in the literature mostly with the help of surveys and questionnaires. Whether a person chooses to be vaccinated or not during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, speaks louder than any declaration of intention. In our teaching hospital, we registered a statistically significant increase in flu vaccination coverage across all professional categories between the 2019/2020 and the 2020/2021 campaign (24.19% vs. 54.56%, p < 0.0001).

However, wearing face masks has not been well adopted by many citizens. While the reasons are complex, there is a general perception that the evidence to support face mask wearing is lacking, especially for the general public in a community setting. Face mask wearing can block or filter airborne virus-carrying particles through the working of colloid and interface science. This paper assesses current knowledge behind the design and functioning of face masks by reviewing the selection of materials, mask specifications, relevant laboratory tests, and respiratory virus transmission trials, with an overview of future development of reusable masks for the general public.

POC tests have the intrinsic advantage of being able to be performed near the patient or treatment facility, owing to their portable character. With rapid results often in minutes, these diagnostic platforms have a high positive impact on disease management. POC tests are, in addition, advantageous in situations of a shortage of skilled personnel and restricted availability of laboratory-based analytics. While POC testing programs are widely considered in addressing health care challenges in low-income health systems, the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections could largely benefit from fast, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective point-of-care testing (POCT) devices for limiting COVID-19 spreading. The unrestrained availability of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests is indeed one of the adequate means of better managing the COVID-19 outbreak. A large number of novel and innovative solutions to address this medical need have emerged over the last months.

Methods The study included 30 Covid-19 patients using L-Glutamine and 30 Covid-19 patients who did not use L-Glutamine with similar age, gender and clinical status. Diagnostic tests, laboratory examinations, clinical findings and computed thorax tomography imaging of the patients were evaluated. Results Hospitalization time was 10.4 ± 1.9 days in Covid-19 without L-Glutamine group and 8.9 ± 1.8 days in Covid-19 with L-Glutamine group (p = 0.005). In Covid-19 without the L-Glutamine group, the requirement of the intensive care unit was significantly higher (p = 0.038). Conclusions In Covid-19 cases, nutritional assessments of patients should not be overlooked in addition to the currently used treatments. Some nutritional supplements provide immune nutritional support by inhibition of inflammatory responses and regulation of immune functions in infectious diseases. Larger-scale studies are needed on L-Glutamine, which is added to normal nutrition in the early period of infection, may lead to shortened hospital stay and lead to less need for intensive care.","Cengiz, Mahir; Uysal, Betul Borku; Ikitimur, Hande; Ozcan, Erkan; Islamoğlu, Mehmet Sami; Aktepe, Emre; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",Clin Nutr Exp,265,20

The first three cases were reported on March 18 (Day 1) and the last locally transmitted case occurred on April 26 (Day 40). An island confinement was imposed on March 20 followed by a sanitary curfew on March 23. Supermarkets were closed as from March 25 (Day 8). There were a total of 332 cases including 10 deaths from Day 1 to Day 41. Control of the outbreak depended heavily on contact tracing, testing, quarantine measures and the adoption of personal protective measures (PPMs) such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene by Mauritius inhabitants. Our objectives were to model and understand the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak using mathematical analysis, a logistic growth model and an SEIR compartmental model with quarantine and a reverse sigmoid effective reproduction number and to relate the results to the public health control measures in Mauritius. Methods The daily reported cumulative number of cases in Mauritius were retrieved from the Worldometer website at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/mauritius/. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model was introduced and analytically integrated under the assumption that the daily incidence of infectious cases evolved as the derivative of the logistic growth function. The cumulative incidence data was fitted using a logistic growth model. The SEIQR model was integrated computationally with an effective reproduction number (R_e) varying in time according to a three-parameter reverse sigmoid model. Results were compared with the retrieved data and the parameters were optimised using the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) as a comparative statistic. Findings A closed-form analytical solution was obtained for the time-dependence of the cumulative number of cases. For a small final outbreak size, the solution tends to a logistic growth. The cumulative number of cases was well described by the logistic growth model (NRMSE = 0.0276, R^2=0.9945) and by the SEIQR model (NRMSE = 0.0270, R^2=0.9952) with the optimal parameter values. The value of R_e on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6. Interpretation A mathematical basis has been obtained for using the logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of outbreaks with a small final outbreak size. The evolution of the outbreak in Mauritius was consistent with one modulated by a time-varying effective reproduction number resulting from the epidemic control measures implemented by Mauritius authorities and the PPMs adopted by Mauritius inhabitants. The value of R_e{approx}1.6 on the reopening of supermarkets on Day 16 was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case the Mauritius population did not comply with the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.","Gehin, A.; Goorah, S.; Moheeput, K.; Ramchurn, S.",,265,1

Resources are being shifted and potentially jeopardize safety of non‐COVID‐19 patients with comorbidities. Our aim was to investigate the impact of national lockdown and SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic on percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease in Poland. METHODS: Data on patients who underwent percutaneous coronary procedures (angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) were extracted for March 13–May 13, 2020 from a national PCI database (ORPKI Registry) during the first month of national lockdown and compared with analogous time period in 2019. RESULTS: Of 163 cardiac catheterization centers in Poland, 15 (9.2%) were indefinitely or temporarily closed down due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. There were nine physicians (9 of 544; 1.7%) who were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. There were 13,750 interventional cardiology procedures performed in Poland in the analyzed time period. In 66% of cases an acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed, and in the remaining 34% it was an elective procedure for the chronic coronary syndrome in comparison to 50% in 2019 (p < .001). There were 362 patients (2.6% of all) with COVID‐19 confirmed/suspected who were treated in interventional cardiology centers and 145 with ST‐Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) diagnosis (6% of all STEMIs). CONCLUSIONS: Due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic there was an absolute reduction in the number of interventional procedures both acute and elective in comparison to 2019 and a significant shift into acute procedures. COVID‐19 confirmed/suspected patients do not differ in terms of procedural and baseline characteristics and reveal similar outcomes when treated with percutaneous coronary interventions.","Siudak, Zbigniew; Grygier, Marek; Wojakowski, Wojciech; Malinowski, Krzysztof P.; Witkowski, Adam; Gąsior, Mariusz; Dudek, Dariusz; Bartuś, Stanisław",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,265,16

Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to review the available scientific literature on these variables in order to suggest and comment on their eventual synergistic effects on mental health. The available literature report that climate change, air pollution and COVID-19 pandemic might influence mental health, with disturbances ranging form mild negative emotional responses to full-blown psychiatric conditions, specifically, anxiety and depression, stress/trauma-related disorders, and substance abuse. The most vulnerable groups include elderly, children, woman, people with pre-existing health problems especially mental illnesses, subjects taking some types of medications including psychotropic drugs, individuals with low socio-economic status, and immigrants.

A physician survey was performed to identify current practices, as well as perceptions around long-term BMA use, BMA de-escalation, and further BMA de-escalation after 2 years of use. METHODS: Canadian oncologists treating breast cancer or CRPC were surveyed via an anonymized online survey. The survey collected physician demographics, current practice patterns, perception on risk of symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) and BMA-associated toxicities, and attitudes towards further de-escalation of BMAs after 2 years of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 334 physicians in Canada were contacted, of which 295 were eligible on initial screening, and 65 completed the survey (response rate 22%): 35 treated breast cancer, 25 treated prostate cancer and 5 treated both. The most common BMA regimens in patients with no limitation in drug coverage were denosumab q4wks for 3–4 months followed by a de-escalation to q12wks (breast cancer) and denosumab q4wks (prostate cancer). In patients with provincial health coverage only the common choices were zoledronate q4wks for 3–4 months followed by de-escalation to q12wks (breast cancer) and denosumab q4wks (prostate cancer). There was equipoise regarding the benefit of continuing BMA beyond 2 years and interest in further trials of de-escalation of BMA in both breast and prostate cancer. The most favored alternative primary study endpoints to SSE were BMA toxicity (67.2%), pain (46.9%), and physical function (48.4%). CONCLUSION: Despite their extensive use and costs, questions around optimal use of BMAs still exist. Practice varies according to patient insurance coverage. However, most physicians are de-escalating BMAs. There is interest amongst clinicians in performing trials of de-escalation, especially after 2 years of treatment.","AlZahrani, Mashari; Clemons, Mark; Vandermeer, Lisa; Sienkiewicz, Marta; Awan, Arif Ali; Hutton, Brian; Pond, Gregory R.; Ng, Terry L.",J Bone Oncol,265,1

There is still no effective method to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by SARS coronavirus (CoV). In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of a fully human monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro in a Rhesus macaque model of SARS. Methods. The antibody 5H10 was obtained by vaccination of KM mice bearing human immunoglobulin genes with Escherichiacoli–producing recombinant peptide containing the dominant epitope of the viral spike protein found in convalescent serum samples from patients with SARS. Results. 5H10, which recognized the same epitope that is also a cleavage site critical for the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells, inhibited propagation of the virus and pathological changes found in Rhesus macaques infected with the virus through the nasal route. In addition, we analyzed the mode of action of 5H10, and the results suggested that 5H10 inhibited fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane. 5H10 has potential for use in prevention and treatment of SARS if it reemerges.

However, despite the global excitement around this historically valuable therapeutic approach, results from CCP trials have been mixed and highly debated. Unlike other therapeutic interventions, CCP represents a heterogeneous drug. Each CCP unit is unique and collected from an individual recovered COVID-19 patient, making the interpretation of therapeutic benefit more complicated. While the prevailing view in the field would suggest that it is administration of neutralizing antibodies via CCP that centrally provides therapeutic benefit to newly infected COVID-19 patients, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients already possess neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of antibodies can extend far beyond their simple ability to bind and block infection, especially related to their ability to interact with the innate immune system. In our work we deeply profiled the SARS-CoV-2-specific Fc-response in CCP donors, along with the recipients prior to and after CCP transfer, revealing striking SARS-CoV-2 specific Fc-heterogeneity across CCP units and their recipients. However, CCP units possessed more functional antibodies than acute COVID-19 patients, that shaped the evolution of COVID-19 patient humoral profiles via distinct immunomodulatory effects that varied by pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG titers in the patients. Our analysis identified surprising influence of both S and Nucleocapsid (N) specific antibody functions not only in direct antiviral activity but also in anti-inflammatory effects. These findings offer insights for more comprehensive interpretation of correlates of immunity in ongoing large scale CCP trials and for the design of next generation therapeutic design.","Herman, Jonathan D.; Wang, Chuangqi; Loos, Carolin; Yoon, Hyunah; Rivera, Johanna; Dieterle, M.

Here, 3 receptor binding domain (RBD) specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 58G6, 510A5 and 13G9, with high neutralizing potency blocking authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus displayed remarkable efficacy against authentic B.1.351 virus. Each of these 3 mAbs in combination with one neutralizing Ab recognizing non-competing epitope exhibited synergistic effect against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Surprisingly, structural analysis revealed that 58G6 and 13G9, encoded by the IGHV1-58 and the IGKV3-20 germline genes, both recognized the steric region S470-495 on the RBD, overlapping the E484K mutation presented in B.1.351. Also, 58G6 directly bound to another region S450-458 in the RBD. Significantly, 58G6 and 510A5 both demonstrated prophylactic efficacy against authentic SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses in the transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2), protecting weight loss and reducing virus loads.

In this study, we aimed to assess whether diabetes mellitus (DM) would increase the risk of severe infection and death in patients with COVID-19. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, MedRxiv and COVID-19 academic research communication platform for studies reporting clinical severity and/or overall mortality data on DM in patients with COVID-19 published up to July 10, 2020. The primary outcome was to compare the severe infection rate and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with and without DM, and to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of 77 studies involving 32,015 patients with COVID-19 were included in our meta-analysis. COVID-19 patients with DM had higher severe infection and case-mortality rates compared with those without DM (21.4 vs. 10.5% and 28.3 vs. 13.1%, respectively, all p <0.01). COVID-19 patients with DM were at significantly elevated risk of severe infection (OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 2.10-2.95, p <0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.80-2.47, p <0.001). Conclusion DM is associated with increased risk of severe infection and higher mortality in patients with COVID-19. Our study suggests that clinicians should pay more attention to the monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 patients with DM.","Shang, Luxiang; Shao, Mengjiao; Guo, Qilong; Shi, Jia; Zhao, Yang; Xiaokereti, Jiasuoer; Tang, Baopeng",Arch Med Res,265,20

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early results and feasibility of surgeries for bone sarcomas during the COVID‐19 lockdown. METHODS: Our prospectively collected orthopaedic oncological database was reviewed to include two groups of patients‐ those who underwent surgery in the immediate 4 weeks before lockdown (non‐lockdown group) and those operated in the first 4 weeks of lockdown (lockdown group). All patients were followed‐up clinically and telephonically to collect the outcome data. RESULTS: Out of the 91 patients who qualified for inclusion, fifty were classified into the non‐lockdown group while 41 patients formed the lockdown group. Both the groups were comparable with respect to baseline demographic parameters. However, during the lockdown period 37 patients (90%) had undergone a major surgical intervention as against 24 patients (48%) in the non‐lockdown group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in type of anaesthesia, median estimated blood loss and procedure duration. None of the patients/health care workers had evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 infection at 15 days follow‐up. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that appendicular bone tumours can be safely operated with adequate precautions during the lockdown period.","Kumar, Venkatesan Sampath; Banjara, Roshan; Thapa, Sushma; Majeed, Abdul; Kapoor, Love; Janardhanan, Ritvik; Bakhshi, Sameer; Kumar, Vijay; Malhotra, Rajesh; Khan, Shah Alam",J Surg Oncol,265,16

Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure and response prevention–inspired serious game to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be associated with increased brain activity within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract. METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT. CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the treatment of drug-naïve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract. Multisensory stimulation by education, quests, and games in OCfree increases the activity within the thalamus and insula in patients with OCD.","Hwang, Hyunchan; Bae, Sujin; Hong, Ji Sun; Han, Doug Hyun",JMIR Ment Health,265,10

Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry-relaxed cryo-EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHV’s dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs’ variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC-interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long-range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment. Structure-based mutageneses confirm that a triplex deep binding groove for CATCs is a hotspot that holds promise for antiviral development.","Gong, Danyang; Dai, Xinghong; Jih, Jonathan; Liu, Yun-Tao; Bi, Guo-Qiang; Sun, Ren; Zhou, Z.

Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the role of hypoxia–inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and its involvement in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, inflammation, we propose hypoxic preconditiong (HPC) as a novel prevention therapeutic approach on healthy contacts of COVID-19 patients. To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor. HPC appears as a trigger to mechanisms that improve and maintain tissue oxygenation and repair, a main goal in different pathologies, including COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions.","Hertzog, Radu Gabriel; Bicheru, Nicoleta Simona; Popescu, Diana Mihaela; Călborean, Octavian; Catrina, Ana-Maria",Int J Infect Dis,265,27

The disease has spread rapidly, and research shows that COVID‐19 can induce long‐lasting cardiac damage. COVID‐19 can result in elevated cardiac biomarkers indicative of acute cardiac injury, and research utilizing echocardiography has shown that there is mechanical dysfunction in these patients as well, especially when observing the isovolumic, systolic, and diastolic portions of the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study was to present two case studies on COVID‐19 positive patients who had their cardiac mechanical function assessed every day during the acute period to show that cardiac function in these patients was altered, and the damage occurring can change from day‐to‐day. Participant 1 showed compromised cardiac function in the systolic time, diastolic time, isovolumic time, and the calculated heart performance index (HPI), and these impairments were sustained even 23 days post‐symptom onset. Furthermore, Participant 1 showed prolonged systolic periods that lasted longer than the diastolic periods, indicative of elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Participant 2 showed decreases in systole and consequently, increases in HPI during the 3 days post‐symptom onset, and these changes returned to normal after day 4. These results showed that daily observation of cardiac function can provide detailed information about the overall mechanism by which cardiac dysfunction is occurring and that COVID‐19 can induce cardiac damage in unique patterns and thus can be studied on a case‐by‐case basis, day‐to‐day during infection.

The emergence or re-emergence of such diseases has revealed the deficiency in our pipeline for the discovery and development of antiviral drugs. One promising solution is the extensive library of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by all eukaryotic organisms. AMPs are widely known for their activity against bacteria, but many possess additional antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, or antiviral activities. AMPs could therefore be suitable as leads for the development of new peptide-based antiviral drugs. Sixty therapeutic peptides had been approved by the end of 2018, with at least another 150 in preclinical or clinical development. Peptides undergoing clinical trials include analogs, mimetics, and natural AMPs. The advantages of AMPs include novel mechanisms of action that hinder the evolution of resistance, low molecular weight, low toxicity toward human cells but high specificity and efficacy, the latter enhanced by the optimization of AMP sequences.

Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is often suggested that incidents of discriminatory behavior are the result of defense mechanisms aimed at avoiding pathogens. According to the behavioral immune system theory, people are motivated to distance themselves from individuals who show signs of infection, or who are only heuristically associated with a disease, primarily because of the disgust they evoke. In this paper we focus on negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians who are among social groups that have been persistently framed as “unclean.” In our correlational study (N = 500 heterosexual participants; Polish sample data collected during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, in March/April 2020) we tested moderation models derived from the behavioral immune system theory. Specifically, we investigated whether perceived vulnerability to disease and perceived threat of contracting COVID-19 moderate the relation between disgust and homonegativity. We found that sexual disgust (but not pathogen nor moral disgust) predicted homonegative attitudes. This effect was stronger for participants expressing higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease but was not dependent on the perception of the COVID-19 threat. The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating a pivotal role of disgust in disease-avoidance mechanisms. They also point to functional flexibility of the behavioral immune system by demonstrating the moderating role of perceived vulnerability to disease in shaping homonegative attitudes. Finally, they show that the threat of COVID-19 does not strengthen the relationship between disgust and homonegativity.","Szymkow, Aleksandra; Frankowska, Natalia; Galasinska, Katarzyna",Front Psychol,265,24

We demonstrate native-like post-translational processing and assembly, and reveal the expression of S proteins on the surface of cells adopting the trimeric prefusion conformation. The data presented here confirm the use of ChAdOx1 adenovirus vectors as a leading platform technology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Watanabe, Yasunori; Mendonça, Luiza; Allen, Elizabeth R.; Howe, Andrew; Lee, Mercede; Allen, Joel D.; Chawla, Himanshi; Pulido, David; Donnellan, Francesca; Davies, Hannah; Ulaszewska, Marta; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Morris, Susan; Krebs, Anna-Sophia; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Supasa, Piyada; Screaton, Gavin R.; Green, Catherine M.; Lambe, Teresa; Zhang, Peijun; Gilbert, Sarah C.; Crispin, Max",ACS Cent Sci,265,20

Ribavirin has activity against extensive RNA and DNA viruses. We plan to systematically review the use of ribavirin in patients with coronavirus-related pneumonia and meta-analyze the data with updated studies. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure will be searched from 2002 to June 2021 without language restriction to identify randomized controlled trials. Subjects consist of patients with coronavirus-related pneumonia. Ribavirin of any dose or route will be compared with the control group of other medication, placebo, or no medication. The primary outcome is the hospital mortality. The secondary outcome includes the hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days in 28 days, median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, and adverse events. The Mantel-Haenszel method will be used for analysis of dichotomous data and the risk ratios will be reported with 95% confidence interval; the inverse-variance method will be used for continuous data and the mean differences will be reported. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be further performed. The funnel plots or Egger test will be used for detection of publication bias. The GRADE methodology will be used for summarizing the quality of evidence. The trial sequential analysis will be conducted to test whether the current meta-analysis is conclusive. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of ribavirin for treatment of coronavirus-related pneumonia will be systematically reviewed and summarized. The forthcoming results of the ongoing studies focusing on ribavirin in patients with the 2019 noel coronavirus disease will also be included. CONCLUSION: The relevant studies will be summarized and advanced evidence will be provided.

We investigated how musicians dealt with this sudden restriction in mobility. Responses of 234 people were collected. The majority of respondents (95%) resided in Belgium or the Netherlands. Results indicated a decrease of 79% of live music making in social settings during lockdown compared with before lockdown. In contrast, an increase of 264% was demonstrated for online joint music making. However, results showed that most respondents were largely or even completely unaccustomed with specialized platforms for online joint music making (e.g., JamKazam, Jamulus). Respondents reported to mostly use well-known video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Skype when playing together virtually. However, when such video-conferencing platforms were used, they were often not employed for synchronized playing and were generally reported to insufficiently deal with latency issues. Furthermore, respondents depending on music making as their main source of income explored online real-time methods significantly more than those relying on other income sources. Results also demonstrated an increase of 93% in the use of alternative remote joint music-making methods (e.g., recording parts separately and subsequently circulating these digital recordings). All in all, results of this study provide a more in-depth view on joint music making during the first weeks of lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, and demonstrate users’ perceptions of performance and usability of online real-time platforms as well as alternative methods for musical interaction.","Onderdijk, Kelsey E.; Acar, Freya; Van Dyck, Edith",Front Psychol,265,16

Strategies that were detached from the boundaries of departments and responsibilities in the COVID-19 pandemic have proven themselves under extreme conditions and show a beneficial influence on patient flow and resource management as well as on the communication culture. The continuation of closer interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral co-operation in a ""new clinical routine"" could have a positive impact on personnel concepts, communication strategies, and the management of acute care capacities and patient pathways. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The aim of the paper is to critically discuss the knowledge gained in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from the various approaches in patient flow and capacity management as well as interdisciplinary co-operation. More recent research has evaluated patient pathway management, personnel planning and communication measures with regard to their effect and practicability for continuation in everyday clinical practice. FINDINGS: Patient flows and acute care capacities can be more efficiently managed by continuing a culture change towards closer interdisciplinary and intersectoral co-operation and technologies that support this with telemedicine functionalities and regional healthcare data interoperability. Together with a bi-directional, more frequent and open communication and feedback culture, it could form a ""new clinical routine"".

Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel “infodemic,” including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable “cures.” Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19–related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. METHODS: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19–related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. RESULTS: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19–related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the “infodemic” fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public.","Mackey, Tim Ken; Li, Jiawei; Purushothaman, Vidya; Nali, Matthew; Shah, Neal; Bardier, Cortni; Cai, Mingxiang; Liang, Bryan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,265,24

Whether working from home is the key or impediment to academics’ efficiency and work-life balance became a daunting question for both scientists and their employers. The recent pandemic brought into focus the merits and challenges of working from home on a level of personal experience. Using a convenient sampling, we surveyed 704 academics while working from home and found that the pandemic lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before. Based on the gathered personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that in the future they would be similarly or more efficient than before if they could spend more of their work-time at home. They indicated that in the office they are better at sharing thoughts with colleagues, keeping in touch with their team, and collecting data, whereas at home they are better at working on their manuscript, reading the literature, and analyzing their data. Taking well-being also into account, 66% of them would find it ideal to work more from home in the future than they did before the lockdown. These results draw attention to how working from home is becoming a major element of researchers’ life and that we have to learn more about its influencer factors and coping tactics in order to optimize its arrangements.","Aczel, Balazs; Kovacs, Marton; van der Lippe, Tanja; Szaszi, Barnabas",PLoS One,265,16

We reported in this work the study of sixteen functionalized 2-aryl and 2-pyridinylbenzothiazoles as antimicrobial agents and as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulators. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus and M. luteus) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, S. enterica and E. coli) pathogens yielded MIC ranging from 3.13 to 50 μg/mL and against the yeast C. albicans, the benzothiazoles displayed MIC from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. All compounds showed promising antibiofilm activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The arylbenzothiazole 12 displayed the greatest biofilm eradication in S. aureus (74%) subsequently verified by fluorescence microscopy. The ability of benzothiazoles to modulate AhR expression was evaluated in a cell-based reporter gene assay. Six benzothiazoles (7, 8-10, 12, 13) induced a significant AhR-mediated transcription and interestingly compound 12 was also the strongest AhR-agonist identified. Structure-activity relationships are suggested herein for the AhR-agonism and antibiofilm activities. Furthermore, in silico predictions revealed a good ADMET profile and druglikeness for the arylbenzothiazole 12 as well as binding similarities to AhR compared with the endogenous agonist FICZ.","Goya-Jorge, Elizabeth; Abdmouleh, Fatma; Carpio, Laureano E.; Giner, Rosa M.; Sylla-Iyarreta Veitía, Maité",Eur J Pharm Sci,265,20

In a mixed-methods study of U.S. adolescents, we examined (1) adolescents' perceptions of how their social and emotional lives had changed during COVID-19; and (2) associations between these perceived changes and indices of their mental health, above and beyond their prepandemic mental health status. METHODS: Four hundred seven U.S. adolescents (M(age) = 15.24, standard deviation = 1.69; 50% female; 52%, 20% African American, 17% Hispanic/Latinx) completed surveys before (October 2019) and during (April 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. They provided qualitative and quantitative responses on their experiences with COVID-19 and reports of their mental health. RESULTS: Adolescents perceived various changes in their relationships with family and friends (e.g., less perceived friend support) during COVID-19. They also perceived increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect. These perceived social and emotional changes were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in April 2020, controlling for mental health problems before the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect multiple organ systems, including the digestive tract. Little is known about the consequences of COVID-19 infection in emergency surgical patients. METHODS: Perioperative data for COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgery from March 1, 2020, to May 23, 2020 were collected prospectively (NCT04323644). RESULTS: During this period, 215 patients underwent surgery, including 127 patients in an emergency setting, of whom 13 (10.2%) had COVID-19. Two scenarios were identified: (a) patients who were admitted to a hospital for an acute surgical condition with a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19, and (b) patients with severe COVID-19 developing acute abdominal pathologies during their hospital stay. When compared with those in group B, patients in group A globally recovered better, with a lower mortality rate (14.3% vs. 33.3%), lower ARDS rate (28.5% vs. 50.0%), less rates of preoperative invasive ventilation (14.3% vs. 50.0%) and postoperative invasive ventilation (28.5% vs. 100.0%), and a shorter duration of invasive ventilation. No causality between SARS-CoV-2 infection and gastrointestinal affliction was found. CONCLUSION: Our observations underline that mild co-infection with COVID-19 did not result in more complications for emergency abdominal surgery.

Of all the potential drug targets, the helicase of CoVs is considered to be one of the most important. Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1-like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF(4)(−)) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the β19–β20 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly.

However, the longitudinal impact of PPTEs on PSP coping remains unclear. Coping can be operationalized as various strategies (i.e., behaviours, skills, thought and emotion regulation) for dealing with stressors, which are broadly categorized as either approach (adaptive, positive, social support) or avoidant coping strategies (maladaptive withdrawal, avoidance, substance use). This systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to evaluate longitudinal coping outcomes among PSP. Thirteen eligible repeated‐measures studies explicitly evaluated coping in 1854 police officers, firefighters, and rescue and recovery workers. Study designs included randomized‐control trials, within‐subject interventions and observational studies. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) at follow‐up were described in 11 studies. Separate meta‐analyses reveal small (d < 0.2) but non‐significant improvements in approach and avoidant coping. Studies were of moderate quality and low risk of publication bias. Heterogeneity in outcome measures, follow‐up durations, and study types precluded subgroup analyses. The current findings can inform the development and evaluation of organizational training programs that effectively promote sustained adaptive coping for PSP and mitigate PTSIs.","Di Nota, Paula M.; Kasurak, Emily; Bahji, Anees; Groll, Dianne; Anderson, Gregory S.",Stress Health,265,19

The resultant proliferation of online learning in traditional, hybrid, and distance higher education courses has enhanced the possibilities for technology-supported student-centered learning design. The prominence of feedback in student-centered teaching could be argued in two ways: (1) instructed learning is based on interaction and communication in which the teacher provides personalized information to students about their progress and (2) feedback is oriented towards students’ improvements, which in turn guides student engagement. Therefore, feedback addressing students’ personal needs integrates multiple dimensions and profoundly influences learning. In response to J. Borup, R. E. West, and R. Thomas (2015)’s article The Impact of Text Versus Video Communication on Instructor Feedback in Blended Courses we discusses the efforts to prepare higher education for online learning. During the pandemic, teachers rapidly faced requirements for providing feedback to students remotely and performing all teaching roles online. The authors in this section build a strong argument that feedback with a supportive function is essential in a time when students and teacher are working remotely. They argued for personalized learning requiring feedback at different points of the learning process that utilizes a range of feedback functions and forms and, most of all, employs contextualization and a situated approach.","Istenič, Andreja",Educ Technol Res Dev,265,3

Residents have faced significant changes in work schedules, deployment to COVID-19 units, and alterations to didactics. This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident perception of their own education within the Nuvance Health Network. Methods: We conducted an observational study assessing resident perception of changes in education and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was developed to assess the quality and quantity of resident education during this time and administered anonymously to all residents within the healthcare network. Results: Eighty-four (68%) residents responded to the survey from five different specialties, including general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and radiology. The average change in hours per week performing clinical work was -5.6 hours (SD=16.8), in time studying was +0.02 hours (SD=4.6), in weekly didactics was -1.7 hours (SD=3.1), and in attending involvement was -1.2 hours (SD=2.3). Additionally, 32% of residents expressed concern that the pandemic has diminished their preparedness to become an attending, 13% expressed concern about completing graduation requirements, and 3% felt they would need an additional year of training. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, residents perceived that time spent on organized didactics/conferences decreased and that attending physicians are less involved in education. Furthermore, the majority of residents felt that the quality of didactic education diminished as a result of the pandemic. Surprisingly, while many residents expressed concerns about being prepared to become an attending, few were concerned about completing graduation requirements or needing an extra year of education. In light of these findings, it is critical to devote attention to the effects of the pandemic on residents' professional trajectories and create innovative opportunities for improving education during this challenging time.","Ostapenko, A.; McPeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.",,265,16

This review article summarizes trends and strategies around adolescent pregnancy prevention, provides lessons learned and best practices, and presents ideas for future directions. Over the past decades, a wide variety of policy and programmatic interventions have been implemented – including educational efforts, clinical health services, and community-wide coalitions – accompanied by a growing consensus regarding viable solutions. While notable reductions in adolescent pregnancy and childbearing have occurred across all sociodemographic groups, racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities persist. Many adolescents who most need sexual health information and services are underserved by current programs and policies. A growing understanding of the role of social determinants of health, the impacts of structural racism, and the need for equity and inclusion must inform the next set of interventions and societal commitments to not only ameliorate the occurrence of unintended adolescent pregnancy but also foster healthy adolescent development. Recommendations for future efforts include improving the content, quality, and sustainability of education programs; actively engaging youth in the design of policies, programs, and clinical services; using technology thoughtfully to improve health literacy; expanding access to services through telehealth and other delivery options; and designing programs and policies that recognize and address structural racism, health equity, and inclusion.","Brindis, Claire D; Decker, Martha J; Gutmann-Gonzalez, Abigail; Berglas, Nancy F",Adolesc Health Med Ther,265,28

This is predicted to have a more negative impact on cochlear implant (CI) patients since this group of patients needs a unique type of psychological, medical, and technical care in addition to a daily rehabilitation program. METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on Arabic questionnaire that looked into the collateral consequences of COVID-19 on the pediatric CI patients. The questionnaire was designed to highlight different problems such as exposure to head trauma or ear infection, difficulties in device maintenance and getting spare parts, impacts of the delay of programing or switch on appointments, and the impacts of missing rehabilitation sessions. Different ways of management of these problems are presented and discussed. RESULTS: A total of 174 parents responded to the questionnaire. The main problem met by the patients was missing their device programing and rehabilitation sessions. Many children had device maintenance and spare parts problems. Virtual clinics were helpful in solving different problems. Additionally, children who needed device programing were scheduled for remote programing sessions. CONCLUSION: Although the inevitable consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are catastrophic, they are forcing the medical field to explore new opportunities by sitting up an infrastructure for future usage of telemedicine. Telemedicine is cost-effective and more convenient and enables health-care providers to be immune to future circumstances.","Telmesani, Laila M.; Said, Nithreen M.; Mahrous, Mahmoud M.; Alrusayyis, Danah F.",Audiol Neurootol,265,16

We therefore analysed outcome beyond 90 days in ICU patients with COVID-19, with special focus on differences between men and women. METHODS: We identified all patient ≥ 18 years with COVID-19 admitted between March 6 and June 30, 2020, in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. Patients were followed until death or study end-point October 22, 2020. Association with patient sex and mortality, in addition to clinical variables, was estimated using Cox regression. We also performed a logistic regression model estimating factors associated with 90-day mortality. RESULTS: In total, 2354 patients with COVID-19 were included. Four patients were still in the ICU at study end-point. Median follow-up time was 183 days. Mortality at 90-days was 26.9%, 23.4% in women and 28.2% in men. After 90 days until end of follow-up, only 11 deaths occurred. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, male sex (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06–1.54) remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustments. Additionally, age, COPD/asthma, immune deficiency, malignancy, SAPS3 and admission month were associated with mortality. The logistic regression model of 90-day mortality showed almost identical results. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study of ICU patients with COVID-19, men were at higher risk of poor long-term outcome compared to their female counterparts. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are not fully understood and warrant further studies.

This study aims to understand barriers and motivators behind older adult’s decision on influenza vaccination. METHODS: Face to face interviews with participants aged 65 and above were conducted and audio recorded in Geylang polyclinic in Singapore. Thematic content analysis was used to organise the data. RESULTS: 15 older adults were interviewed, aged between 66 and 85 years old. 6 were vaccine refusers, 3 defaulters and 6 acceptors. A perceived lack of vulnerability, fear of side effects, and trivialisation of influenza were common reasons for not taking the vaccine. Encouragement from family and friends, travel and previous positive vaccination experiences were motivators for getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers played a role in influencing many of the participants’ decision-making. Common misconceptions included vaccines considered as necessary only before travel and as a cure rather than prevention. Most participants exhibited ambivalence, giving reasons both for and against vaccine uptake. DISCUSSION: Most older adults do not perceive influenza as a potentially serious disease nor trust in influenza vaccines’ efficacy. Misconceptions played a significant role in vaccine decline. Novel findings include the importance of the family unit in decision making, prioritization of chronic health problems over vaccination and misconception that vaccines are only needed when travelling out of country. Healthcare workers and family members appear to be important influencers in the decision making of older adults and should be actively engaged in future health promotion initiatives.","Teo, L.M.; Smith, H.E.; Lwin, M.O.; Tang, W.E.",Vaccine,265,20

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines, and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here, we report the pK(a) calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using the recently developed graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with a new asynchronous replica-exchange scheme, which allows computation on a single GPU card. The calculated pK(a)’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys–His–Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 can open and close depending on the protonation state of C271/270, consistent with the most recent crystal structure evidence. Interestingly, despite the lack of an analogous cysteine, BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is also very flexible, challenging a current hypothesis. These findings are supported by the all-atom fixed-charge simulations and provide a starting point for more detailed studies to assist the structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.","Henderson, Jack A.; Verma, Neha; Harris, Robert C.; Liu, Ruibin; Shen, Jana",J Chem Phys,265,26

The S protein is a potent target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanism CoV pathogenesis in SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of S protein. RESULTS: First, different SARS-CoV sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the S protein based upon HLA-A*0201 binding and proteosomal cleavage. Four of eight candidate peptides were tested by HLA-A*0201 binding assays. Among the four candidate peptides, Sp8 (S(958-966), VLNDILSRL) induced specific CTLs both ex vivo in PBLs of healthy HLA-A2(+ )donors and in HLA-A2.1/K(b )transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length S protein. The immunized mice released IFN-γ and lysed target cells upon stimulation with Sp8 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Sp8 is a naturally processed epitope. We propose that Sp8 epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection.","Lv, Yanbo; Ruan, Zhihua; Wang, Li; Ni, Bing; Wu, Yuzhang",BMC Immunol,265,20

This effect has been attributed to innate immune responses induced by BCG vaccination. However, these studies ignore an important fact: according to World Health Organization estimates, about a quarter of the world's population may have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), a condition in which there is no evidence of clinically active tuberculosis but persistent immune responses are stimulated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Thus, both LTBI and BCG induce lifelong immunity and may provide immunological protection against COVID-19. In this study, the relationship between LTBI and reduced COVID-19 mortality was analyzed using the instrumental variable method. The results showed with robust statistical support that LTBI was also associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality.","Takahashi, Harutaka",Med Hypotheses,265,16

A scale has been recently designed to assess COVID-19-related phobic reactions named the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S). The present study aimed to evaluate factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Persian version of the C19P-S (Persian-C19P-S) in patients with anxiety disorders and to compare COVID-19-related phobia among these patients. Three hundred patients with anxiety disorders completed the Persian-C19P-S and other scales assessing anxiety traits (e.g., the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), the Health Concerns Questionnaire-54 (HCQ-54), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)) and COVID-19-related distress (e.g., the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19)). The results showed that the Persian-C19P-S replicated the four-factor structure of the original C19P-S. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients evidenced the reliability of the scale. The validity of the scale (convergent and discriminant validity) was confirmed. Patients who had generalized anxiety and panic disorders showed higher phobic reactions related to COVID-19 than those with social anxiety disorder and specific phobia. This study indicates that the Persian version of the C19P-S is a valid scale to be used in Iranian patients with anxiety disorders to evaluate COVID-19-related phobia.

It does so by showing how the outcome of meaning-making struggles had impacts on political legitimacy, public behaviour, and control over the spread of the virus. Ultimately, these impacts contributed to the avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of UK citizens. Dividing the crisis into phases within a secular ritual passage or ‘social drama’, it shows how each phase was defined by struggles between the government and other actors to code the unfolding events in an appropriate moral way, to cast actors in their proper roles, and to plot them together in a storied fashion under a suitable narrative genre. Taken together, these processes constituted a conflictual effort to define the meaning of what was occurring. The paper also offers more specific contributions to cultural sociology by showing why social performance theory needs to consider the effects of casting non-human actors in social dramas, how metaphor forms a powerful tool of political action through simplifying and shaping complex realities, and how casting can shift responsibility and redefine the meaning of emotionally charged events such as human death.","Morgan, Marcus",Am J Cult Sociol,265,16

Only 44.3% of the participants wanted to participate in a vaccine trial for COVID-19, with females intending to participate more than males (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI [1.22-2.72]). Participants who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (AOR = 6.48, 95% CI [4.12-10.4]) and who thought that being infected with the coronavirus would have a significant impact on their health (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI [1.57, 3.51]) were more likely to agree to take part in the COVID-19 vaccine trial. Confidence in the vaccine, health personnel, and the government in the fight against the pandemic are key factors in participants' willingness to participate in a vaccine trial in Senegal.","Ridde, V; Ba, M F; Gaye, I; Diallo, A I; Bonnet, E; Faye, A",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,265,1
