12973,A multi-omics supervised autoencoder for pan-cancer clinical outcome endpoints prediction,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: EQ-5D is generic measure of health-related quality of life. Studies using EQ-5D generate ordinal data that are interpreted as categories ordered by severity. New analytic approaches taking into account the ordinal nature of the health dimension severity and leading to a better interpretation of EQ-5D data are needed to better elucidate differences in health-related quality of life. We propose utilizing the Improved RIDIT statistical method to analyze EQ-5D outcomes. METHODS: 556 Moroccan participants aged over 18 years representing four chronic diseases: back pain (n = 158), renal insufficiency (n = 56), diabetes (n = 82) or hypertension (n = 80) and healthy subjects (n = 180). All participants received the two EQ-5D versions. Two other published data sets were included. The first was extracted from a diabetic Spain study and the second was extracted from a clinical trial study. The Improved RIDIT analyses were carried out using an R statistic program we developed. RESULTS: Applying the Improved RIDIT on the EQ-5D data allowed estimating for the first time the ordinal odds, the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) or the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) and the Number Needed to Treat. The ARI values estimated for Moroccan patients showed that (i) hypertension increased anxiety/depression by 66% and reduced mobility by 65%; (ii) back pain increased pain/discomfort by 69%; (iii) renal insufficiency impacts mobility (ARI = 57%, odds(ordinal) = 9.95) and usual activities (ARI = 44%, odds(ordinal) = 6.41) and (iv) diabetes acts only on anxiety/depression (ARI = 50%, odds(ordinal) = 4.8). Also, we demonstrated that the approach works well in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Improved RIDIT provides more intuitive and informative interpretation of the EQ-5D data by (1) taking into account the level severity; estimating (2) the odds ordinal, (3) the ARR/ARI and the NNT; (4) analyzing the five dimensions of the EQ-5D separately, which gives clinical teams more precision in understanding the treatment/pathology impacts on the health status and completes the EQ-5D data analysis based on score utilities.","Marfak, Abdelghafour; Youlyouz-Marfak, Ibtissam; El Achhab, Youness; Saad, Elmadani; Nejjari, Chakib; Hilali, Abderraouf; Turman Jr, Jack",Health Qual Life Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477837/,514
12979,A semi-supervised approach for extracting TCM clinical terms based on feature words,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: To employ the benchmark dose (BMD) method in toxicological risk assessment, it is critical to understand how the BMD lower bound for reference dose calculation is selected following statistical fitting procedures of multiple mathematical models. The purpose of this study was to compare the performances of various combinations of model exclusion and selection criteria for quantal response data. METHODS: Simulation-based evaluation of model exclusion and selection processes was conducted by comparing validity, reliability, and other model performance parameters. Three different empirical datasets for different chemical substances were analyzed for the assessment, each having different characteristics of the dose-response pattern (i.e. datasets with rich information in high or low response rates, or approximately linear dose-response patterns). RESULTS: The best performing criteria of model exclusion and selection were different across the different datasets. Model averaging over the three models with the lowest three AIC (Akaike information criteria) values (MA-3) did not produce the worst performance, and MA-3 without model exclusion produced the best results among the model averaging. Model exclusion including the use of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in advance of model selection did not necessarily improve the validity and reliability of the models. CONCLUSIONS: If a uniform methodological suggestion for the guideline is required to choose the best performing model for exclusion and selection, our results indicate that using MA-3 is the recommended option whenever applicable.","Yoshii, Keita; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Inoue, Kaoru; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Hirose, Akihiko",Theor Biol Med Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477879/,514
12982,The psychosis analysis in real-world on a cohort of large-scale patients with schizophrenia,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic susceptible variants for complex diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of such association remains largely unknown. Most disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to reside in noncoding regions, leading to the hypothesis that regulation of gene expression may be the primary biological mechanism. Current methods to characterize gene expression mediating the effect of genetic variant on diseases, often analyzed one gene at a time and ignored the network structure. The impact of genetic variant can propagate to other genes along the links in the network, then to the final disease. There could be multiple pathways from the genetic variant to the final disease, with each having the chain structure since the first node is one specific SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) variant and the end is disease outcome. One key but inadequately addressed question is how to measure the between-node connection strength and rank the effects of such chain-type pathways, which can provide statistical evidence to give the priority of some pathways for potential drug development in a cost-effective manner. RESULTS: We first introduce the maximal correlation coefficient (MCC) to represent the between-node connection, and then integrate MCC with K shortest paths algorithm to rank and identify the potential pathways from genetic variant to disease. The pathway importance score (PIS) was further provided to quantify the importance of each pathway. We termed this method as “MCC-SP”. Various simulations are conducted to illustrate MCC is a better measurement of the between-node connection strength than other quantities including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, distance correlation, mutual information, and maximal information coefficient. Finally, we applied MCC-SP to analyze one real dataset from the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project, and successfully detected 2 typical pathways from APOE genotype to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through gene expression enriched in Alzheimer’s disease pathway. CONCLUSIONS: MCC-SP has powerful and robust performance in identifying the pathway(s) from the genetic variant to the disease.

15144,Matching depression management to severity prognosis in primary care: results of the Target-D randomised controlled trial,2021-01-12,"Background: A tumor microenvironment is a complicated multicellular system comprised of tumor cells, immune cells and blood vessels. Blood vessels are the barriers for drug tissue penetration. Effectively treating a cancer requires drug delivery systems to overcome biological barriers present in tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Methods: We designed a drug delivery system made of bacterial (Escherichia coli) double layer membrane-derived nanovesicles (DMVs) with the expression of RGD peptides and endogenous targeting ligands of bacteria. The physical and biological characteristics of DMVs were assessed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded in DMVs via a pH gradient driven drug loading method. Therapeutical effects of DOX-loaded DMVs were studied in a melanoma xenograft mouse model. Results: In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that DMVs can target neutrophils and monocytes that mediated the transport of DMVs across blood vessel barriers and they can also directly target tumor vasculature and tumor cells, resulting in enhanced delivery of therapeutics to TMEs. Furthermore, we developed a remote drug loading approach to efficiently encapsulate DOX inside DMVs, and the drug loading was 12% (w/w). In the B16-F10 melanoma mouse model, we showed that DOX-RGD-DMVs significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared to several controls. Conclusion: Our studies reveal that DMVs are a powerful tool to simultaneously target multiple cells in TMEs, thus increasing drug delivery for improved cancer therapies.","Gao, Jin; Wang, Sihan; Dong, Xinyue; Wang, Zhenjia",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847689/,514
15188,The most used questionnaires for evaluating telemedicine services,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND: The display of recombinant proteins on cell surfaces has a plethora of applications including vaccine development, screening of peptide libraries, whole-cell biocatalysts and biosensor development for diagnostic, industrial or environmental purposes. In the last decades, a wide variety of surface display systems have been developed for the exposure of recombinant proteins on the surface of Escherichia coli, such as autotransporters and outer membrane proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we assess three approaches for the surface display of a panel of heterologous and homologous mature lipoproteins in E. coli: four from Neisseria meningitidis and four from the host strain that are known to be localised in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. Constructs were made carrying the sequences coding for eight mature lipoproteins, each fused to the delivery portion of three different systems: the autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence-I (AIDA-I) from enteropathogenic E. coli, the Lpp’OmpA chimaera and a truncated form of the ice nucleation protein (INP), InaK-NC (N-terminal domain fused with C-terminal one) from Pseudomonas syringae. In contrast to what was observed for the INP constructs, when fused to the AIDA-I or Lpp’OmpA, most of the mature lipoproteins were displayed on the bacterial surface both at 37 and 25 °C as demonstrated by FACS analysis, confocal and transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study that compares surface display systems using a number of passenger proteins. We have shown that the experimental conditions, including the choice of the carrier protein and the growth temperature, play an important role in the translocation of mature lipoproteins onto the bacterial surface. Despite all the optimization steps performed with the InaK-NC anchor motif, surface exposure of the passenger proteins used in this study was not achieved. For our experimental conditions, Lpp’OmpA chimaera has proved to be an efficient surface display system for the homologous passenger proteins although cell lysis and phenotype heterogeneity were observed. Finally, AIDA-I was found to be the best surface display system for mature lipoproteins (especially heterologous ones) in the E. coli host strain with no inhibition of growth and only limited phenotype heterogeneity.","Nicchi, Sonia; Giuliani, Maria; Giusti, Fabiola; Pancotto, Laura; Maione, Domenico; Delany, Isabel; Galeotti, Cesira L.; Brettoni, Cecilia",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7853708/,514
17908,"“Know your epidemic, know your response”: Epidemiological assessment of the substance use disorder crisis in the United States",2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults spend the majority of their waking hours sitting, which increases their risk of chronic diseases. Given the challenges that many older adults face when engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, understanding the health benefits of decreasing sitting time and increasing the number of sit-to-stand transitions is needed to address this growing public health concern. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to investigate how changes in sitting time and brief sit-to-stand transitions impact biomarkers of healthy aging and physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning compared with a healthy attention control arm. METHODS: Sedentary and postmenopausal women (N=405) will be recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 study conditions for 3 months: healthy living attention control (Healthy Living), reduce sitting time (Reduce Sitting), and increase sit-to-stand transitions (Increase Transitions). Assessments conducted at baseline and 3 months included fasting blood draw, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, physical functioning, cognitive testing, and 7 days of a thigh-worn accelerometer (activPAL) and a hip-worn accelerometer (ActiGraph). Blood-based biomarkers of healthy aging included those associated with glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma insulin and glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance). RESULTS: Recruitment began in May 2018. The intervention is ongoing, with data collection expected to continue through the end of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The Rise for Health study is designed to test whether 2 different approaches to interrupting sitting time can improve healthy aging in postmenopausal women. Results from this study may inform the development of sedentary behavior guidelines and interventions to reduce sitting time in older adults.

18080,Examining the effect of explanation on satisfaction and trust in AI diagnostic systems,2021-06-03,"OBJECTIVE: One of the main problems of lung transplantation is the shortage of organs as well as reduced survival rates. In the absence of an international standardized model for lung donor-recipient allocation, we set out to develop such a model based on the characteristics of past experiences with lung donors and recipients with the aim of improving the outcomes of the entire transplantation process. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 404 lung transplants carried out at the Reina Sofía University Hospital (Córdoba, Spain) over 23 years. We analyzed various clinical variables obtained via our experience of clinical practice in the donation and transplantation process. These were used to create various classification models, including classical statistical methods and also incorporating newer machine-learning approaches. RESULTS: The proposed model represents a powerful tool for donor-recipient matching, which in this current work, exceeded the capacity of classical statistical methods. The variables that predicted an increase in the probability of survival were: higher pre-transplant and post-transplant functional vital capacity (FVC), lower pre-transplant carbon dioxide (PCO2) pressure, lower donor mechanical ventilation, and shorter ischemia time. The variables that negatively influenced transplant survival were low forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) pre-transplant, lower arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, bilobar transplant, elderly recipient and donor, donor-recipient graft disproportion requiring a surgical reduction (Tailor), type of combined transplant, need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the surgery, death of the donor due to head trauma, hospitalization status before surgery, and female and male recipient donor sex. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the difficulty of the problem which required the introduction of other variables into the analysis. The combination of classical statistical methods and machine learning can support decision-making about the compatibility between donors and recipients. This helps to facilitate reliable prediction and to optimize the grafts for transplantation, thereby improving the transplanted patient survival rate.","Dueñas-Jurado, J. M.; Gutiérrez, P.

19627,CapsTM: capsule network for Chinese medical text matching,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to compare, for the first time in a large systematic study, women born in conflict-affected countries who immigrated to Australia with women born in Australia for attitudes towards gender roles and men’s use of IPV and the actual prevalence of IPV. The study also examined if any associations remained across the two timepoints of pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: Women were interviewed during their first visit to one of three Australian public hospital antenatal clinics and re-interviewed at home six months after giving birth. A total of 1111 women completed both interviews, 583 were born in conflict-affected countries and 528 born in Australia. Associations between attitudes towards gender roles and men’s use of IPV, socio-demographic characteristics and reported actual experiences of IPV were examined using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Attitudes toward inequitable gender roles including those that condone men’s use of IPV, and prevalence of IPV, were significantly higher (p<0.001) among women born in conflict-affected countries compared to Australia-born women. Women born in conflict-affected countries with the strongest held attitudes towards gender roles and men’s use of IPV had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 3.18 for IPV at baseline (95% CI 1.85–5.47) and an aOR of 1.83 for IPV at follow-up (95% CI 1.11–3.01). Women born in Australia with the strongest held attitudes towards gender roles and IPV had an aOR of 7.12 for IPV at baseline (95% CI 2.12–23.92) and an aOR of 10.59 for IPV at follow-up (95% CI 2.21–50.75). CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the need for IPV prevention strategies sensitively targeted to communities from conflict-affected countries, and for awareness among clinicians of gender role attitudes that may condone men’s use of IPV, and the associated risk of IPV. The study supports the need for culturally informed national strategies to promote gender equality and to challenge practices and attitudes that condone men’s violence in spousal relationships.","Hicks, Madelyn Hsiao-Rei; Mohsin, Mohammed; Silove, Derrick; Fisher, Jane; Moussa, Batool; Steel, Zachary; Nancarrow, Heather; Nadar, Nawal; Klein, Louis; Hasoun, Fatima; Yousif, Mariam; Khalil, Batoul; Krishna, Yalini; Rees, Susan J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323950/,514
19727,Evaluating the success of the tele-pathology system in governmental hospitals in Kuwait: an explanatory sequential mixed methods design,2021-08-02,"INTRODUCTION: Integrated care pathways (ICPs) are a pre-defined framework of evidence based, multidisciplinary practice for specific patients. They have the potential to enhance continuity of care, patient safety, patient satisfaction, efficiency gains, teamwork and staff education. In order to inform the development of neurosurgical ICPs in the future, we performed a systematic review to aggregate examples of neurosurgical ICP, to consider their impact and design features that may be associated with their success. METHODS: Electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for relevant literature published from date of inception to July 2020. Primary studies reporting details of neurosurgical ICPs, across all pathologies and age groups were eligible for inclusion. Patient outcomes in each case were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included in our final dataset, from the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, China, Korea, France, Netherlands and Switzerland, and a number of sub-specialties. 3 for cerebrospinal fluid diversion, 1 functional, 2 neurovascular, 1 neuro-oncology, 2 paediatric, 2 skull base, 10 spine, 1 for trauma, 2 miscellaneous (other craniotomies). All were single centre studies with no regional or national examples. Thirteen were cohort studies while 11 were case series which lacked a control group. Effectiveness was typically evaluated using hospital or professional performance metrics, such as length of stay (n = 11, 45.8%) or adverse events (n = 17, 70.8%) including readmission, surgical complications and mortality. Patient reported outcomes, including satisfaction, were evaluated infrequently (n = 3, 12.5%). All studies reported a positive impact. No study reported how the design of the ICP was informed by published literature or other methods CONCLUSIONS: ICPs have been successfully developed across numerous neurosurgical sub-specialities. However, there is often a lack of clarity over their design and weaknesses in their evaluation, including an underrepresentation of the patient’s perspective.","Lee, Keng Siang; Yordanov, Stefan; Stubbs, Daniel; Edlmann, Ellie; Joannides, Alexis; Davies, Benjamin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328336/,514

The result of this operation is a new KB where the relations in [Formula: see text] are removed from the KB in a principled manner resulting in a more efficient representation of the KB for different purposes. The forgetting operator is also reflected semantically in terms of the relation between the original models of the KB and the models for the revised KB after forgetting. In this paper, we first develop a rough reasoning framework where our KB’s consist of rough formulas with a semantics based on a generalization of Kleene algebras. Using intuitions from the classical case, we then define a forgetting operator that can be applied to rough KBs removing rough relations. A constructive basis for generating a new KB as the result of applying the forgetting operator to a rough KB is specified using second-order quantifier elimination techniques. We show the application of this technique with some practical examples.","Doherty, Patrick; Szałas, Andrzej",Rough Sets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338204/,514

59916,"Qualitative and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Western Cape Province, South Africa.",2021-01-28,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the position of the conus medullaris (CM) at the first trimester 3D ultrasound in a cohort of structurally normal fetuses. METHODS This was a multicenter prospective study involving a consecutive series of structurally normal fetuses between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation (CRL between 45 and 84 mm). All fetuses were submitted to 3D transvaginal ultrasound using a sagittal view of the spine as the starting plane of acquisition. At offline analysis, the position of the CM was evaluated by 2 independent operators with a quantitative and a qualitative method: (1) the distance between the most caudal part of the CM and the distal end of the coccyx (CMCd) was measured; (2) a line perpendicular to the fetal spine joining the tip of the CM to the anterior abdominal wall was traced to determine the level of this line in relation to the umbilical cord insertion (conus to abdomen line, CAL). Interobserver agreement for the CCMd was evaluated. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between the CMCd and CRL, and a normal range was computed based on the best-fit model. The absence of congenital anomalies was confirmed in all cases after birth. RESULTS In the study period between December 2019 and March 2020, 143 fetuses were recruited. In 130 fetuses (90.9%), the visualization of the CM was feasible. The mean value of the CMCd was 1.09 ± 0.16 cm. The 95% limits of agreement for the interobserver variability in measurement of the CMCd were 0.24 and 0.26 cm. The interobserver variability based on the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for the CCMd was good (ICC = 0.81). We found a positive linear relationship between the CCMd and CRL. In all these fetuses, the CAL encountered the abdominal wall at or above the level of the cord insertion. CONCLUSION In normal fetuses, the assessment of the CM position is feasible at the first trimester 3D ultrasound with a good interobserver agreement. The CM level was never found below the fetal umbilical cord insertion, while the CMCd was noted to increase according to the gestational age, confirming the ""ascension"" of the CM during fetal life.","Ramirez Zegarra, Ruben; Volpe, Nicola; Bertelli, Evelina; Amorelli, Greta Michela; Ferraro, Luigi; Schera, Giovanni Battista Luca; Cromi, Antonella; di Pasquo, Elvira; Dall'Asta, Andrea; Ghezzi, Fabio; Frusca, Tiziana; Ghi, Tullio",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107487/,514

Men were more infected by COVID-19 than women, and male subjects with underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases developed a severe form of the affection, with increased mortality rate. Many factors can contribute to the disparity in disease outcomes, such as hormone-specific reaction and activity of X-linked genes, which modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection. Until now, only the Remdesivir was approved by FDA (Food Drug Administration) for COVID-19 treatment, although several clinical trials are ongoing worldwide also on other drugs. In this review, we analyzed published studies on several drugs (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir in combination, tocilizumab, plasma, and immunoglobulins) with some efficacy to COVID-19 in humans, and evaluated if there were a gender analysis of the available data. In our opinion, it is essential to report data about COVID-19 disaggregated by sex, age, and race, because the knowledge of gender differences is fundamental to identify effective and customized treatments to reduce hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and mortality.","Ambrosino, Immacolata; Barbagelata, Elena; Corbi, Graziamaria; Ciarambino, Tiziana; Politi, Cecilia; Moretti, Anna Maria",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305554/,514

RECENT FINDINGS Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the firstly developed and most widely used diagnostic technique for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAT assays is always unsatisfactory, mainly due to insufficient viral RNA in samples, especially when upper respiratory samples were used. Compared with NAT assays, serological tests are more convenient and less dependent on the quality of sample collection. But the sensitivity of antibody assays varies largely to test samples collected at different time after onset of symptoms. The diagnostic sensitivity can be significantly improved by combination of RNA and antibody testing. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccines, population prevention results mainly from timely triage and quarantine of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Thus, extensive testing with NAT and antibody assays simultaneously is very important to constrain coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.

The primary aim was to assess the diagnostic yield and safety. The secondary aims were the malignancy predictors, and to create a predictive model of malignancy. METHODS This was a retrospective nationwide study involving all Spanish hospitals experienced in EUS-TA of AGs. Inclusion period was from April-2003 to April-2016. Inclusion criteria: all consecutive cases that underwent EUS-TA of AGs. EUS and cytopathology findings were evaluated.

RESULTS A total of 204 EUS-TA of AGs were evaluated. Primary tumor locations were lung70%, others19%, and unknown11%. AG samples were adequate for cytological diagnosis in 91%, and confirmed malignancy in 60%. Diagnostic accuracy of the endosonographer's suspicion was 68%. The most common technique was: a 22-G (65%) and cytological needle (75%) with suction-syringe (66%). No serious adverse events were described. The variables most associated with malignancy were size>30mm (OR2.27; 95%CI, 1.16-4.05), heterogeneous echo-pattern (OR2.11; 95%CI, 1.1-3.9), variegated AG shape (OR2.46; 95%CI, 1-6.24), and endosonographer suspicion (OR17.46; 95%CI, 6.2-58.5). The best variables for a predictive multivariate logistic model of malignancy were age, sex, echo-pattern, and AG-shape. CONCLUSIONS EUS-TA of the AGs is a safe, minimally invasive procedure, allowing an excellent diagnostic yield. These results suggest the possibility of developing a pre-EUS procedure predictive malignancy model.","Martin-Cardona, A; Fernandez-Esparrach, G; Subtil, J C; Iglesias-Garcia, J; Garcia-Guix, M; Barturen Barroso, A; Gimeno-Garcia, A Z; Esteban, J M; Pardo Balteiro, A; Velasco-Guardado, A; Vazquez-Sequeiros, E; Loras, C; Martinez-Moreno, B; Castellot, A; Huertas, C; Martinez-Lapiedra, M; Sanchez-Yague, A; Teran, A; Morales-Alvarado, V J; Betes, M; de la Iglesia, D; Sánchez-Montes, C; Lozano, M D; Lariño-Noia, J; Gines, A; Tebe, C; Gornals, J B",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170163/,514

In response, a series of strategic and intentional operational changes were implemented, varying by practice size, structure and model. In reviewing the many business lessons that we learned during the pandemic, it became clear that for a business to be successful, a host of additional supportive factors are necessary. In addition to timely expense reductions, optimizing revenue capture and close monitoring and management of cash and reserves available for use, we also consider effective leadership and communication strategies, maintenance of a healthy and adequately staffed team, support for a remote work environment and flexible staffing models. Other ingredients include effectively embracing digital media for communications, careful attention to current and new stakeholders and the service delivered to them, understanding federal and state regulatory changes issued in response to the pandemic, close collaboration with the Human Resources office, and an early focus on redesigning your future practice structure and function, including disaster and downtime planning.

Telemedicine patient visits were matched to data from their previous in-person visits, to evaluate any significant differences in total charge, insurance compensation, patient payment, percent reimbursement and zero reimbursement. Miles were measured between patient's home and the address of previous visit. We found statistically significant differences in mean charges of telemedicine versus in-person visits (2019US$) (172.95 vs 218.27, p=0.0046), patient payment for telemedicine visits versus in-person visits (2019US$) (11.13 vs 62.83, p≤0.001), insurance reimbursement (2019US$) (65.18 vs 110.85, p≤0.001) and insurance reimbursement rate (43% vs 61%, p=0.0029). Rate of zero reimbursement was not different. Mean distance from cardiology clinic was 35 miles. No adverse outcomes were detected.

62937,Viewpoint: The COVID-19 and climate crises.,2020-05-01,"Introduction Student-run free clinics (SRFCs) have become important primary care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. With students pulled from clinical sites, funding deficits, SRFCs' voluntary nature, and no best practices for telehealth SRFCs, many have been forced to close. This report shares a systematic approach for implementing a telehealth clinic along with initial outcomes from the Dedicated to Aurora's Wellness and Needs (DAWN) SRFC. Methods We utilized pilots with students, community volunteers, and patients to identify a telehealth platform. We implemented weekly plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to develop a feasible interprofessional telehealth model. Key PDSA cycle goals included seamless utilization of platform, identification of necessary team members, appropriate scheduling of patients and volunteers, integration of interprofessional learners, positive patient and volunteer experience, and process for identifying and addressing patient social needs. Measured outcomes included total visits, no-show rates, and chief complaints addressed. Results Outcomes from PDSA cycles included a resultant telehealth clinic team and model, workflow for outreach for social needs screening and navigation, and team training guides. Visit data and no-show rates from January 2020 through July 2020 demonstrated total visits returned to 60% of pre-COVID numbers while no-show rates decreased significantly below pre-COVID rates. A range of acute and chronic concerns were successfully managed via telehealth. Conclusion SRFCs are poised to continue serving an important role in caring for the country's most vulnerable populations. The DAWN telehealth implementation process, outcomes, and resultant protocols may help inform other SRFCs seeking to establish telehealth services.","Phan, Ryan Cao Vinh; Van Le, Dung; Nguyen, Alexander; Mader, Kari",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2020.241619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111050/,514
63413,Addressing the elephant in the room: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Black and Asian communities.,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION Metabolic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D) depends on many factors such as eating habits, exercise and lifestyle. The objective of this study was to investigate how these factors were affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and impacted metabolic control in children with T1D. MATERIALS AND METHOD One hundred children with T1D were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measurements, snack and meal frequency, carbohydrate consumption, HbA1c levels, and exercise patterns were recorded and compared before and after the lockdown. Subjects were divided into two subgroups-patients with decreased and patients with increased HbA1c levels after the lockdown-and comparisons of the same parameters were also made between these two subgroups. RESULTS In the overall group, the mean HbA1c level was significantly higher after the lockdown compared to before (p=0.035). Meal schedules changed due to delayed sleep and waking times, and total daily carbohydrate consumption increased in the subgroup with increased HbA1c while it decreased in the subgroup with decreased HbA1c (p<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION Our study supports the notion that blood sugar management in children with T1D worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is not possible to explain this with any one factor, some behavioral changes observed in our study, such as inactivity, irregular meal frequency and timing, and irregular sleep and waking patterns appeared to be associated with blood sugar management.","Turan, Hande; Güneş Kaya, Didem; Tarçın, Gürkan; Evliyaoğlu, Saadet Olcay","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endinu.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274306/,514

Herein, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature and analyzed clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Through searching PubMed until June 03, 2020, we identified 16 relevant case studies (33 cases) from a total of 45 studies that have reported on patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancies. We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics including type of hematologic malignancies, initial symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Then, we compared those characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 to the general population infected with COVID-19. RESULTS The median age was 66-year-old. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common type of hematologic malignancy (39.4%). Fever was the most common symptom (75.9%). Most patients had normal leukocyte counts (55.6%), lymphocytosis (45.4%), and normal platelet counts (68.8%). In comparison to patients with COVID-19 without underlying hematologic malignancies, dyspnea was more prevalent (45.0 vs. 24.9%, p=0.025). Leukocytosis (38.9 vs. 9.8%, p=0.001), lymphocytosis (45.4 vs. 8.2%, p=0.001), and thrombocytopenia (31.3 vs. 11.4%, p=0.036) were significantly more prevalent and lymphopenia (18.2 vs. 57.4%, p=0.012) less prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics predicting mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Mortality was much higher in patients with hematologic malignancies compared to those without this condition (40.0 vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Co-occurrence of hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 is rare. However, due to the high mortality rate from COVID-19 in this vulnerable population, further investigation on tailored treatment and management is required.","Kim, J S; Lee, K H; Kim, G E; Kim, S; Yang, J W; Li, H; Hong, S H; Ghayda, R A; Kronbichler, A; Koyanagi, A; Jacob, L; Shin, J I; Smith, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275265/,514

This post hoc analysis assessed prolactin concentrations and sexual side effects in an open-label prospective study of switching long-acting injectable antipsychotics from paliperidone palmitate (PP) to aripiprazole lauroxil (AL). Serum prolactin was measured throughout the study. Patient-reported sexual and endocrine side effects were assessed on the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale sexual function subscale and analyzed in study completers. Prior to starting AL treatment (screening), 49/50 (98%) patients had prolactin concentrations above the upper limit of normal (ULN; >13.13 ng/mL [males]; >26.72 ng/mL [females]). Six months after beginning AL treatment, prolactin levels were above ULN in 2/32 (6.3%) patients. Among 32 study completers, 81.3% reported sexual dysfunction in ≥1 domain at screening versus 56.3% at 6 months after starting AL treatment. Diminished sexual desire was the most common patient-reported sexual complaint at screening (46.9%); at 6 months, it was reported by 18.8%. In this post hoc analysis, the high levels of prolactin observed at screening decreased during AL treatment, and modest improvements in sexual side effects were evident in patients with schizophrenia.","Kelly, Deanna L; Claxton, Amy; Bidollari, Ilda; Du, Yangchun",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118485/,514

There is an urgent need to develop an effective strategy to control the formation of biofilms. In this study, a nanocomposite of tannic acid and silver (Tannin-AgNPs) was designed and successfully prepared based on the quorum sensing (QS) inhibitory activity of tannic acid and the anti-bacterial activity of silver. The dynamic light scattering and SEM observations indicated that the obtained Tannin-AgNPs were spherical with a mean particle size of 42.37 nm. Tannic acid was successfully modified on the surface of silver nanoparticles and characterized via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The prepared Tannin-AgNPs demonstrated a more effective anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity against E. coli than the unmodified AgNPs or tannic acid. In addition, the Tannin-AgNPs can modulate the formation process of E. coli biofilms, shorten the growth period of biofilms and extend the dispersion period of biofilms. Tannin-AgNPs also showed the function of decreasing the production of the QS signal molecule. The proposed strategy of constructing a nanocomposite using AgNPs and natural components with QS inhibitory activity is effective and promising for inhibiting the formation of biofilms.","Liu, Lulu; Ge, Chuang; Zhang, Yu; Ma, Wenrui; Su, Xi; Chen, Li; Li, Shunbo; Wang, Li; Mu, Xiaojing; Xu, Yi",Biomaterials science,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00648c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734981/,514

The new emerging infectious disease has raised many challenges and uncertainties regarding disease management and prognosis in immunocompromised patient populations. The risk of COVID-19 among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has different opinions. Some scholars speculated that patients with HIV may be at decreased risk for complications of COVID-19 because HIV antiretroviral medications may have activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. But others have the opposite because of the immunosuppression for HIV patients. Here we reported a case of HIV-infected patient confirmed with COVID-19 and had a favourable prognosis. The patient was a 24-year-old male who was diagnosed with HIV infection 2 years ago and then followed a regular antiretroviral therapy (ART). After infected with COVID-19, the patient had no other clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities throughout the course of the disease except presented with fever for a short-term (2 days), and no secondary infection or exacerbation occurred after admission in hospital. Follow-up chest CT showed that the lung lesions disappeared within a short period of time. After standard treatment by 9 days, the patient was cured and discharged. This report highlights the importance of ART for HIV-infected persons, and with regular ART for HIV patients may reduce adverse consequences after infection with COVID-19.","Tian, Chong; Tang, Lei; Wu, Jiahong; Li, Wuchao; Ming, Xing; Zhou, Hourong; Wu, Weidong; Zeng, Xianchun",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787379/,514

Currently, two real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the upE and ORF1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome are widely used and are the standard assays recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The MERS outbreaks to date suggest that rapid diagnosis and subsequent isolation of infected patients, particularly superspreaders, are critical for containment. However, conventional real-time RT-PCR assays require large laboratory instruments, and amplification takes approximately 2 h. These are disadvantages for rapid diagnosis. Here, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR test was established: a multiplex assay for upE and ORF1a running on the mobile PCR1100 device. As few as five copies of MERS-CoV RNA can be detected within 20 min using the WHO standard assays with similar sensitivity and specificity to those of a conventional real-time PCR instrument such as the LightCyler, enabling timely intervention to control MERS-CoV infection.","Shirato, Kazuya; Nao, Naganori; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2019.400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31875608/,514

72765,A Brazilian adaptation of the Affective and Cognitive Measure of Empathy.,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND Induction of anaesthesia causes significant macrohaemodynamic changes, but little is known about its effects on the microcirculation. However, alterations in microvascular perfusion are known to be associated with impaired tissue oxygenation and organ dysfunction. Microvascular reactivity can be assessed with vascular occlusion testing, which evaluates the response of tissue oxygen saturation to transient ischaemia and reperfusion. OBJECTIVE The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of an opioid-based anaesthesia induction on microvascular reactivity. We hypothesised that despite minimal blood pressure changes, microvascular function would be impaired. DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Single-centre, tertiary university teaching hospital, Belgium. PATIENTS Thirty-five adult patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. INTERVENTION Microvascular reactivity was assessed before and 30 min after anaesthesia induction by means of vascular occlusion testing and near-infrared spectroscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tissue oxygen saturations, desaturation rate, recovery time (time from release of cuff to the maximum value) and rate of recovery were determined. RESULTS Data are expressed as median (minimum to maximum). Tissue oxygen saturation was higher after induction of anaesthesia [70 (54 to 78) vs. 73 (55 to 94)%, P = 0.015]. Oxygen consumption decreased after induction, appreciable by the higher minimum tissue oxygen saturation [45 (29 to 69) vs. 53 (28 to 81)%, P < 0.001] and the slower desaturation rate [11 (4 to 18) vs. 9 (5 to 16)% min, P < 0.001]. After induction of anaesthesia, recovery times were longer [40 (20 to 120) vs. 48 (24 to 356) s, P = 0.004] and the rate of recovery was lower [114 (12 to 497) vs. 80 (3 to 271)% min, P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION After induction of anaesthesia, oxygen consumption was decreased. The longer recovery times and slower rates of recovery indicate impaired microvascular reactivity after induction of anaesthesia.

The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the diagnosis, perioperative considerations, and treatment of AWE. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies further characterize presenting symptoms and locations of AWE. Prior abdominal surgery remains the greatest risk factor for the development of AWE. Newer evidence suggests that increasing BMI may also be a risk factor. Ultrasound is first-line imaging for diagnosis. Magnetic resonance image is preferred for surgical planning for deep or extensive lesions. Laparotomy with wide local excision is considered standard treatment for AWE with great success. Novel techniques in minimally invasive surgery have been described as effective for the treatment of AWE. A multidisciplinary surgical approach is often warranted for successful excision and reapproximation of skin and/or fascial defects. Noninvasive therapies including ultrasonic ablation or cryotherapy are also emerging as promising treatment strategies in select patients.

The manifestations included ground-glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, irregular line, and air bronchogram sign. RESULTS COVID-19 lesions showed mainly subpleural distribution, which was accompanied by bronchovascular bundle distribution in nearly 30% of the patients. The lower lobes of both lungs were the most commonly involved. In the follow-up, the progression group showed more involvement of the upper lobe of the left lung than the recovery group. GGO was the most common sign. As the disease progressed, round GGO decreased and patchy GGO increased. On follow-up CT, consolidation increased in the progression group while decreasing in the recovery group. Air bronchogram sign was more commonly observed at the initial examination (90.9%) than at follow-up (30%) in the recovery group, but there was no significant change in the progression group. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were absent in the initial examination, but pleural effusion was observed in three cases after follow-up. CONCLUSION As COVID-19 progressed, round GGOs tended to evolve into patchy GGOs, consolidation increased, and pleural effusion could be occasionally observed. As COVID-19 resolved, the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram significantly decreased.","Guan, Chun-Shuang; Wei, Lian-Gui; Xie, Ru-Ming; Lv, Zhi-Bin Department Of Radiology Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University Beijing China; Yan, Shuo; Zhang, Zi-Xin; Chen, Bu-Dong",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2019.20176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436847/,514

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns. RESULTS The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of 6 subcategories of the SDSC questionnaire regarding the present time and six months before symptom onset. The total SDSC scores were also similar in two different evaluation time points described above (p=0.99). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that COVID-19 did not impact the sleep parameters of children. Serum melatonin levels of all patients were higher than the reference range; however, they were higher in the non-COVID-19 patient group than the COVID-19 group. Since serum melatonin levels were higher than the reference values in children with COVID-19, and this disease is significantly less morbid in children, melatonin may have protective effects against COVID-19.","Yayici Köken, Özlem; Gültutan, Pembe; Güngören, Merve Sibel; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Yilmaz, Deniz; Gürkaş, Esra; Özyürek, Hamit; Çitak Kurt, Ayşegül Neşe",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2012-361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843171/,514
77924,The economics of poisoning: The role of telemedicine and toxicovigilance.,2020-11-27,"Previous studies showed that miR-874 expression was abnormally expressed in many tumors. However, the potential role of miR-874 in glioma remains a mystery. This study aimed to investigate its expression, clinical significance, and cellular function in glioma. A total of 105 glioma patients were enrolled in the present study. The RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect the expression of miR-874 in glioma tissues and cells. The χ2 test was used to analyze the association between miR-874 expression and clinical characteristics of patients. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression assays were used to analyze the prognostic value of miR-874 in glioma. Cell counting kit-8 and Transwell assays were used to explore the alterations in a series of cancer-related phenotypes affected by miR-874, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities. The expression of miR-874 was significantly downregulated in human glioma tissue specimens and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of miR-874 was associated with tumor size, KPS, and WHO grade. The decreased expression of miR-874 was associated with shorter overall survival. Then functional assays indicated that upregulation of miR-874 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells in vitro. The present study indicated that miR-874 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells and might be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for glioma.","Li, Yongjuan; Chen, Xiaoyan; Xue, Wei; Liang, Junjun; Wang, Liang",Neuromolecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12017-020-08608-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803522/,514

The minimal requirement for the assembly of VLPs for the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans (SARS-CoV) is still controversial. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV VLP formation depends on either M and E proteins or M and N proteins. Here we show that both E and N proteins must be coexpressed with M protein for the efficient production and release of VLPs by transfected Vero E6 cells. This suggests that the mechanism of SARS-CoV assembly differs from that of other studied coronaviruses, which only require M and E proteins for VLP formation. When coexpressed, the native envelope trimeric S glycoprotein is incorporated onto VLPs. Interestingly, when a fluorescent protein tag is added to the C-terminal end of N or S protein, but not M protein, the chimeric viral proteins can be assembled within VLPs and allow visualization of VLP production and trafficking in living cells by state-of-the-art imaging technologies. Fluorescent VLPs will be used further to investigate the role of cellular machineries during SARS-CoV egress.","Siu, Y L; Teoh, K T; Lo, J; Chan, C M; Kien, F; Escriou, N; Tsao, S W; Nicholls, J M; Altmeyer, R; Peiris, J S M; Bruzzone, R; Nal, B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01052-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753196/,514

84696,Empathic listening: welcoming strategy for nursing Professional in coping with with the coronavirus pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND The advent of single incision laparoscopic surgery has brought renewed attention to cholecystectomy due to the promise of improved cosmesis and less parietal trauma. Small series have demonstrated the feasibility of single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Our series adds to the literature by demonstrating a variety of ancillary techniques that may be employed to perform single incision LC safely, and compares our early experience with that of our standard LC. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent single incision LC between February 2008 and April 2009. These patients were compared with an equal number of randomly selected patients undergoing LC during the same period. We identified 25 attempted single incision LC, which were included in our analysis. RESULTS Single incision LC was successfully performed in 21 patients, with only 4 patients requiring conversion to LC. No patients in either group had acute cholecystitis. The critical view of safety was documented in 20 of 21 patients undergoing a successful single incision LC compared with all patients undergoing LC. Operative time was significantly longer in the single incision group. Complications were minor and comparable between the 2 groups. In 9 patients (43%), a suture passer helped to retract the gallbladder. In 8 patients (38%), 1 or 2 Prolene sutures placed by means of a Keith needle helped to retract the gallbladder over the liver and/or helped to retract the infundibulum. In 2 patients, ≥1 supplemental 5-mm port was utilized. In 5 patients (24%), no supplementary retraction was necessary. CONCLUSION Single incision LC is technically more challenging than LC, but can be performed safely by experienced laparoscopic surgeons with results comparable with LC.","Fronza, Jeffrey S; Linn, John G; Nagle, Alexander P; Soper, Nathaniel J",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2010.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20708764/,514

We examine how legalisation impacted on demand for online telemedicine outside the jurisdiction. METHODS We analysed anonymised data from 534 people from Ireland seeking online telemedicine abortion prior to legalisation (January-March and October-December 2018) and in the first 3 months following legalisation (January-March 2019). Numbers, characteristics and reasons for seeking the service before and after legalisation were compared. Content analysis of emails from people seeking the service following legalisation explored reasons for seeking care. RESULTS Half as many people contacted Women on Web in the 3 months immediately after legalisation as compared with contacts 12 months prior (103 vs 221). Of these, the proportion receiving the service reduced, from 72% prior to legalisation to 26% after legalisation (p≤0.001). After legalisation, access related reasons for seeking online telemedicine featured less while reasons relating to privacy, stigma and avoiding protestors featured more. CONCLUSIONS People continued to seek abortion through online telemedicine after legalisation, though the number of contacts reduced by half and the proportion receiving the service decreased considerably. To address access issues, policy measures should promote normalisation of abortion, legislate for safe zones around providers, and consider access in situations of coercive control or abuse including the role of telemedicine in the local model of care. Abortion provided through online telemedicine continues to be an important part of providing safe, accessible abortion even after legalisation.","Bras, Sierou; Gomperts, Rebecca; Kelly, Michaela; Aiken, Abigail R A; Conlon, Catherine",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361119/,514

Resourcefulness can minimize the effect of stress on health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between caregiving stress during the pandemic, resourcefulness, and self-rated health and assess the mediating effect of resourcefulness. A convenience sample of 70 family caregivers of adults with chronic and/or disabling conditions was recruited using social media groups and professional networking platforms. Data were collected using an online survey and analyzed using linear regression. Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro. Higher levels of caregiving stress during the pandemic and lower levels of resourcefulness were associated with worse self-rated health, while controlling for age, employment status, and weekly caregiving hours. Resourcefulness mediated the relationship between caregiving stress and self-rated health. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the psychological impact of the pandemic on family caregivers' outcomes. Resourcefulness skills can be targeted to improve the health and well-being of family caregivers during and beyond the pandemic.","Irani, Elliane; Niyomyart, Atsadaporn; Zauszniewski, Jaclene A",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2021.1924324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080954/,514

Food safety is identified as an important pillar in mitigating the crisis. Therefore, understanding how popular media are used as a vital disseminator of food safety and health information for public use is more important than ever. YouTube deserves particular attention as one of the most highly trafficked websites on the internet, especially as it has been blamed for spreading misleading or untrustworthy information during the pandemic that contradicts validated information. This study evaluates the food safety information and practices circulated on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic and their alignment with government agencies' recommendations. A search for videos on YouTube was conducted using the keywords ""Food and COVID-19,"" ""Food safety and COVID-19,"" and ""Groceries and COVID-19."" After applying a series of inclusive and exclusive criteria, a total of 85 different videos from the United States and Canada were evaluated. More than half (59%) of the videos presented handwashing procedures, less than a third (22%) showed kitchen disinfection, and most (69%) showed concern for ""take-out"" or ""grocery store"" practices. Multiple and different produce washing procedures were also shown throughout videos.

92056,Timing of GP end-of-life recognition in people aged ≥75 years: retrospective cohort study using data from primary healthcare records in England.,2020-11-02,"The incidence of several respiratory viral infections has been shown to be related to climate. Because humans spend most of their time indoors, measures of indoor climate, rather than outdoor climate, may be better predictors of disease incidence and transmission. Therefore, understanding the relationship between indoor and outdoor climate will help illuminate their influence on the seasonality of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Indoor-outdoor relationships between temperature and humidity have been documented in temperate regions, but little information is available for tropical regions, where seasonal patterns of respiratory viral diseases differ. We have examined indoor-outdoor correlations of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH) over a 1-year period in each of seven tropical cities. Across all cities, the average monthly indoor temperature was 25 ± 3°C (mean ± standard deviation) with a range of 20-30°C. The average monthly indoor RH was 66 ± 9% with a range of 50-78%, and the average monthly indoor AH was 15 ± 3 g/m3 with a range of 10-23 g/m3 . Indoor AH and RH were linearly correlated with outdoor AH when the air conditioning (AC) was off, suggesting that outdoor AH may be a good proxy of indoor humidity in the absence of AC. All indoor measurements were more strongly correlated with outdoor measurements as distance from the equator increased. Such correlations were weaker during the wet season, especially when AC was in operation. These correlations will provide insight for assessing the seasonality of respiratory viral infections using outdoor climate data, which is more widely available than indoor data, even though transmission of these diseases mainly occurs indoors.","Pan, Jin; Tang, Julian; Caniza, Miguela; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Koay, Evelyn; Lee, Hong Kai; Lee, Chun Kiat; Li, Yuguo; Nava Ruiz, Alejandra; Santillan-Salas, Carlos Francisco; Marr, Linsey C",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138487/,514

While the world is still busy figuring out a cure for the deadly disease, scientists worked out on many theories and conducted several studies to establish a relationship between the infection and other known diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the major complications of this infection after the respiratory manifestations. Individuals with cardiovascular complication are said to be more susceptible to acquiring the infection because the novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor for its entry inside the cell and there is a high level of ACE2 expression in individuals with cardiovascular complications because of the enzyme's anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic and anti-hypertensive effects on the heart. Individuals who belong to the older age group are also more susceptible. Knowing the above information, it might seem that using ACE2 inhibitors would help to slow or prevent the entry of the novel coronavirus but it would also at the same time prove to have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system as the protective functions of ACE2 would be lost. While the search for a cure still continues it has been stated many a times that the conditions might worsen with time and the only way to keep ourselves and our family safe would be to follow the appropriate social distancing methods and get a COVID test if we experience any of the major symptoms.","Pal, Aastha; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Sakarde, Apurva; Asia, Priyanka; Gopal, Niranjan; Alam, Sana; Kaim, Kirti; Ahirwar, Pradeep; Sorte, Smita R",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2020-0052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544511/,514

There's not known information about the decreasing and impact on surgery. Mortality of surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is estimated to be around 20%. METHODS We conducted prospective data recruitment of people inpatient in our Digestive and General Surgery section of Girona's University Hospital Dr. Josep Trueta from 03/14 to 05/11. Our objective is to analyze the impact that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic over elective and urgent surgery. RESULTS During the peak occupation of our center Intensive Care Unit (303.8%) there was a reduction on elective (93.8%) and urgent (72.7%) surgery. Mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent surgery (n=10) is estimated to be a 10%. An 80% of these patients suffer complications (sever complications in 30%). CONCLUSIONS The actual study shows a global reduction of the surgical activity (elective and urgent) during de SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Global mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are low, but the severe complications have been over the usual.","Maldonado-Marcos, Eloy; Caula-Freixa, Cèlia; Planellas-Giné, Pere; Rodríguez-Hermosa, José Ignacio; López-Ben, Santiago; Delisau-Puig, Olga; Codina Cazador, Antoni",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819710/,514

It remains to be accurately quantified what proportion of patients with symptom resolution have residual endoscopic activity that might warrant treatment modification. AIM To quantify the prevalence of endoscopic improvement and remission amongst ulcerative colitis patients with various permutations of patient-reported outcomes. METHODS Individual participant data from active intervention and placebo arms of clinical trials of infliximab, golimumab, vedolizumab and tofacitinib were pooled to estimate the prevalence of endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic sub-score [MES] 0 or 1) and remission (MES 0) scores with various permutations of the rectal bleeding sub-score (RBS) and stool frequency sub-score (SFS) of the Mayo score, following induction (6-8 weeks) and maintenance (30-54 weeks) therapy. Subgroup analyses were performed by year of publication and centrally read endoscopy scoring. RESULTS Data from 2586 trial participants were analysed. Using locally scored endoscopy, the prevalence of endoscopic improvement and remission was highest among participants with a RBS 0 + SFS 0 post-induction (MES 0/1:81%, [95% CI 78-84]; MES 0:29% [26-33]) and during maintenance (MES 0/1:91% [87-93]; MES 0:57% [52-62]). Prevalence estimates were lower for more recently performed trials (P < .01). In comparison to locally scored endoscopy, when using central endoscopy scoring, the prevalence of endoscopic improvement and remission was lower post-induction (MES 0/1 57% [50-64], P < .001; MES 0 15% [11-21], P = .09) and during maintenance (MES 0/1 74% [67-81], P = .001; MES 0 31% [24-38], P = .001) for participants achieving a RBS 0 + SFS 0.

We describe restorative restproctectomy as single-port surgery through the ostomy site in a three-stage procedure for refractory ulcerative colitis 12 weeks after laparoscopic subtotal colectomy. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After release of the terminal ileostomy, creating the ileal J pouch extra-abdominally, a single-port device was placed. Through this, the rectal stump was mobilized and extracorporeally closed. The ileal pouch anal anastomosis was created using circular double-stapling technique. The single-port device was removed, and the loop ileostomy was placed at the same site. RESULTS We employed this technique in a 54 year-old patient who had suffered from ulcerative colitis. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS Restorative restproctectomy as single-port surgery through the ostomy site is safe and feasible. No additional incision is necessary. The trauma of conventional laparoscopic access can be further reduced.","Bulian, Dirk Rolf; Knuth, Jürgen; Krakamp, Bernd; Heiss, Markus Maria",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2394-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22710655/,514

MATERIALS & METHODS Patients whose recanalized or residual aneurysms were treated with FDSs in five tertiary hospitals were reviewed retrospectively. The patients' demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, types of previous treatment, and clinical complications, or serious adverse events associated with FDSs, as well as the results of neurological and angiographic follow-up assessments, were recorded. RESULTS Eighty-six patients (37 males) with 87 aneurysms were included in this study. Eighty (91.9%) aneurysms were in the anterior and seven (8.1%) in the posterior circulation. The initial treatment methods were the primary coiling or balloon remodeling technique in 69 (79.3%) and stent-assisted coiling in 18 (20.7%) aneurysms. The endovascular procedure was successful in all patients. Complications occurred in four patients, for a total complication rate of 4.6%. A technical complication developed in one patient (1.2%). An in-stent thrombosis treated with tirofiban was seen in two cases. Late in-stent stenosis exceeding 50% was treated with balloon angioplasty in one patient. The mean length of follow-up was 21.0 months. The first angiographic follow-up (3-6 months) revealed the complete occlusion of 74 aneurysms (85.1%). While 76 aneurysms (87.4%) were occluded at the last angiographic follow-up (mean: 26.0 months), 11 aneurysms (12.6%) were still filling. Morbimortality was zero. CONCLUSION The drawback of endovascular treatment is aneurysmal remnants or recurrences, which is safely and durably amenable to flow diversion.","Akgul, Erol; Onan, Hasan Bilen; Islek, Irem; Tonge, Mehmet; Durmus, Yavuz; Barburoglu, Mehmet; Azizova, Aynur; Erol, Cengiz; Hakyemez, Bahattin; Sencer, Serra; Aydin, Kubilay; Arat, Anil","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019921990507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509011/,514

The array design and application based on flexible strain sensors have been the current research hotspots. However, there are few reports on research of acoustic positioning using the flexible sensor array. Herein, we designed and realized the consistent fabrication of a thin-film, acoustic sensor array. The acoustic sensing research of the sensor was demonstrated as well. We used a convenient fabrication method to design a flexible acoustic sensor using silver nanowires coated on a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with mass block-beam structure. The acoustic sensor can record sound within a frequency domain of 20-2000 Hz and volume detection range of 83-108 dB. The sensor's resonance frequency is 380 Hz, horizontal distance sound detection limit is 5 cm, and vertical detection limit is 3.5 cm. We also achieved 360° azimuth detection in two-dimensional space with a detection accuracy of 15°. In three-dimensional space, the flexible acoustic sensor array was designed with two flexible acoustic sensors to detect the position of the sound source. This research first proposes the use of flexible acoustic sensors to test the sound source orientation.","Zhang, Qiang; Ji, Chao; Lv, Licheng; Zhao, Dong; Ji, Jianlong; Zhuo, Kai; Yuan, Zhongyun; Zhang, Wendong; Sang, Shengbo",Soft robotics,https://doi.org/10.1089/soro.2020.0030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668191/,514

MATERIALS AND METHODS This nested case-control study included the neonates who were administered in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University of Health Sciences, Dr Behçet Uz Children's Hospital during the period of 01 March-30 April 2020. Respiratory PCR samples and COVID-19 samples were taken simultaneously. Only RSV positive and COVID-19 positive infants were compared. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic information system medical records. The chest radiographs at the admission were evaluated by using standard definitions for normal chest X-ray, atelectasis, bronchopenumonia, peribronchial thickening and hyperinflation in various lung volumes. RESULTS A total of 30 infants were enrolled in the study and RSV was identified in 20/30 infants (66%). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of general characteristics. Comparing to the infants with Covid-19 infections, infants with RSV infections had significantly higher rates of having oxygen support (p = .03). Total NICU duration time was 6.7 ± 1.6 days in COVID positive group and 11.1 ± 5.1 days in the RSV group (p = .01). Infants with COVID-19 had more normal chest X-rays. Infants with RSV-positive had a significantly higher proportion of atelectasis than those with COVID-19 infants (p = .04). DISCUSSION This is the first study that compares RSV infection and COVID-19 infection. RSV infection can be more serious in the neonatal period. In cases with suspected COVID-19 infection, it should be kept in mind if atelectasis is seen on chest radiography. Respiratory failure may be more serious in RSV positive infants and RSV infection may be more dangerous for the neonatal period.","Alkan Ozdemir, Senem; Soysal, Buse; Calkavur, Sebnem; Gökmen Yıldırım, Tülin; Kıymet, Elif; Kalkanlı, Oguzhan; Çolak, Rüya; Devrim, İlker","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1849125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225779/,514

In this work, we demonstrated a strategy of using a superhydrophobic photothermal and thermal isolation macroporous xerogel (PMX) to delay icing and remove ice efficiently under faint sunlight irradiation. An oriented macroporous xerogel was prepared by an ice templating method, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes acting as the photothermal genesis component under sunlight irradiation were introduced into the xerogel. After fluorination, the PMX presented a robust water repellency and delayed icing. More importantly, numerous macropores in the PMX matrix acted as the thermal barrier that can restrict heat transmission to surroundings at maximum, which guarantees efficient anti-icing and de-icing in low temperature. Water on the PMX surface can never freeze at -30 °C under 0.25 kW/m2 (""0.25 sun"") sunlight irradiation. The outdoor experiment also has confirmed the availability of PMX in a natural winter environment. The PMX integrated with thermogenesis and thermo-isolation functions provides a new route for highly efficient anti-icing and de-icing.","Yu, Bo; Sun, Zhengrong; Liu, Yubo; Zhang, Zhizhi; Wu, Yang; Zhou, Feng",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c08770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323467/,514
103983,The way of life of the unhoused people as an enhance for COVID-19 care.,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","Randazzo, Walter; Truchado, Pilar; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Simón, Pedro; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470712/,514

Although lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of obesity management, subsequent physiological neurohormonal adaptations limit weight loss, strongly favour weight regain and counteract sustained weight loss. A range of effective therapies are therefore needed to manage this chronic relapsing disease. Bariatric surgery delivers substantial, durable weight loss but limited access to care, perceived high risks and costs restrict uptake. Medical devices are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between more conservative lifestyle intervention and weight-loss pharmacotherapy and more disruptive bariatric surgery. In this Review, we examine the range of gastrointestinal medical devices that are available in clinical practice to treat obesity, as well as those that are in advanced stages of development. We focus on the mechanisms of action as well as the efficacy and safety profiles of these devices.

This European registry study analyzed the initial experience of 15 neurovascular centers with the Flow-Redirection Intraluminal Device (FRED) system. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the FRED between February 2012 and March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Complications and adverse events, transient and permanent morbidity, mortality, and occlusion rates were evaluated. RESULTS During the defined study period, 579 aneurysms in 531 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 13-86 years) were treated with the FRED. Seven percent of patients were treated in the acute phase (≤3 days) of aneurysm rupture. The median aneurysm size was 7.6 mm (range, 1-36.6 mm), and the median neck size 4.5 mm (range, 1-30 mm). Angiographic follow-up of >3 months was available for 516 (89.1%) aneurysms.

With the second generation of TAVI devices improvements in both handling and performance are highly demanded. This brief clinical communication reports the first Polish experience with the second generation of transfemoral TAVI device--Symetis Acurate Neo. METHODS From November 19th 2014 until February 18th 2015 nine (n = 9) patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis have been operated on using the Symetis Acurate Neo. Patients were subject to seven-day evaluation and 30-day phone follow-up. RESULTS The procedure was safely and successfully performed in all patients. A SMALL (S) valve (21-23 mm equivalent) was used in two patients, MEDIUM valve (M; 23-25 mm equivalent) in five patients, and a LARGE valve (L; 25-26 mm equivalent) in two patients. In three cases post-release balloon dilatation was required. There were no intraoperative complications and no major adverse events (as per VARC classification) during initial hospitalisation, including conduction or rhythm disturbances. In all cases, the mean gradient on the prosthetic valves was 7.8 mm Hg (10.2 mm Hg on the ""S"" valves). Rapid improvement in patients' functional class was noted. Perivalvular leak was evaluated as ""mild"" in three cases, ""trace"" in one, and ""not existing"" in five.

This article addresses how such tumors can be classified to inform the eighth edition of the anatomic classification of lung cancer. Separate tumor nodules should be distinguished from second primary lung cancer, multifocal ground glass/lepidic tumors, and pneumonic-type lung cancer, which are addressed in separate analyses. METHODS Survival of patients with separate tumor nodules in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer database were analyzed. This was compared with a systematic literature review. RESULTS Survival of clinically staged patients decreased according to the location of the separate tumor nodule relative to the index tumor (same lobe > same side > other side) in N0 and N-any cohorts (all M0 except possible other-side nodules). However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of patients resected; among only surgically resected or among nonresected patients no survival differences were noted. There were no survival differences between patients with same-lobe nodules and those with other T3 tumors, between patients with same-side nodules and those with T4 tumors, and patients with other-side nodules and those with other M1a tumors. The data correlated with those identified in a literature review. CONCLUSIONS Tumors with same-lobe separate tumor nodules (with the same histologic appearance) are recommended to be classified as T3, same-side nodules as T4, and other-side nodules as M1a.

107332,Differences between quality of life and occupational coping of tenured and outsourced nurses.,2020,"Every branch of science needs visitors' attention during the poster presentation session at conferences, symposiums, seminars, etc. In particular, participants in the chemistry and biochemistry conference need more visual tools to explain their research work in detail. Presence of smartphones and the ability of 2D barcodes will allow chemical reactions or processes to be shown in the form of a movie, animation or augmented reality (AR). Therefore, the next generation of posters will be more interested in this view. Here, the ability of 2D barcodes or QR codes to help researchers to catch more attention in their research work was presented during a poster presentation session. In this way, the visitors showed positive attitudes to the applicability of such tools. Also, some information including the number of poster visitors and interesting topics in the conference can be collected easily which is useful for the scientific and organizing committee of conferences. As a result, biochemistry conference posters can be presented in new ways, based on animation images or video, to capture the attention of viewers and deepen their understanding of poster concepts.","Faridi, Ehsan; Ghaderian, Abolfazl; Honarasa, Fatemeh; Shafie, Arefeh",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/bmb.21520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913586/,514

Afin d’appuyer la conception de lignes directrices sur la prise en charge de la COVID-19, nous avons effectué une revue systématique et une méta-analyse sur l’utilisation du plasma de convalescent pour le traitement de cette maladie et d’autres formes graves d’infections respiratoires virales. MÉTHODES: En mars 2020, nous avons effectué des recherches dans des bases de données biomédicales internationales et chinoises, des registres d’essais cliniques et des sources prépubliées afin de recenser des essais randomisés et contrôlés (ERC) et des études non randomisées comparant les issues de patients ayant reçu du plasma de convalescent à celles de patients n’en ayant pas reçu. Ont été inclus les patients ayant une infection aiguë attribuable à un coronavirus, au virus de l’influenza ou au virus Ebola. Nous avons également réalisé une méta-analyse à l’aide d’un modèle à effets aléatoires et évalué la qualité des données probantes au moyen de l’approche GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). RÉSULTATS: Sur les 1099 études uniques initialement repérées, 6 étaient admissibles, et aucune d’entre elles ne portait sur des patients atteints de la COVID-19. Une étude non randomisée (n = 40) sur l’administration de plasma de convalescent à des patients atteints du coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS-CoV) a fourni des données peu concluantes sur le taux de mortalité (risque relatif [RR] 0,10; intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % 0,01 à 1,70). Des estimations regroupées provenant de 4 ERC sur l’influenza (n = 572) n’ont pas montré d’effet manifeste sur le taux de mortalité (4 ERC; RR 0,94; IC de 95 % 0,49 à 1,81), le rétablissement complet (2 ERC; rapports de cotes [RC] 1,04; IC de 95 % 0,69 à 1,64) et la durée d’hospitalisation (3 ERC; différence moyenne [DM] −1,62; IC de 95 % −3,82 à 0,58 jours). La qualité des données était très faible pour tous les paramètres relatifs à l’efficacité.

Chest CT is a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 by chest CT.The clinical classification of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was predicted by Radiomics using chest CT.From the COVID-19 cases in our institution, 136 moderate patients and 83 severe patients were screened, and their clinical and laboratory data on admission were collected for statistical analysis. Initial CT Radiomics were modeled by automatic machine learning, and diagnostic performance was evaluated according to AUC, TPR, TNR, PPV and NPV of the subjects. At the same time, the initial CT main features of the two groups were analyzed semi-quantitatively, and the results were statistically analyzed.There was a statistical difference in age between the moderate group and the severe group. The model cohort showed TPR 96.9%, TNR 99.1%, PPV98.4%, NPV98.2%, and AUC 0.98. The test cohort showed TPR 94.4%, TNR100%, PPV100%, NPV96.2%, and AUC 0.97. There was statistical difference between the two groups with grade 1 score (P = .001), the AUC of grade 1 score, grade 2 score, grade 3 score and CT score were 0.619, 0.519, 0.478 and 0.548, respectively.Radiomics' Auto ML model was built by CT image of initial COVID -19 pneumonia, and it proved to be effectively used to predict the clinical classification of COVID-19 pneumonia.

109706,Anosmia: an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management in primary care.,2021,"BACKGROUND Bariatric operations mostly combine a restrictive gastric component with a rerouting of the intestinal passage. The pylorus can thereby be alternatively preserved or excluded. With the aim of performing a ""pylorus-preserving gastric bypass"", we present early results of a proximal postpyloric loop duodeno-jejunostomy associated with a sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) compared to results of a parallel, but distal LSG with a loop duodeno-ileostomy as a two-step procedure. METHODS 16 patients underwent either a two-step LSG with a distal loop duodeno-ileostomy (DIOS) as revisional bariatric surgery or a combined single step operation with a proximal duodeno-jejunostomy (DJOS). Total small intestinal length was determined to account for inter-individual differences. RESULTS Mean operative time for the second-step of the DIOS operation was 121 min and 147 min for the combined DJOS operation. The overall intestinal length was 750.8 cm (range 600-900 cm) with a bypassed limb length of 235.7 cm in DJOS patients. The mean length of the common channel in DIOS patients measured 245.6 cm. Overall excess weight loss (%EWL) of the two-step DIOS procedure came to 38.31% and 49.60%, DJOS patients experienced an %EWL of 19.75% and 46.53% at 1 and 6 months, resp. No complication related to the duodeno-enterostomy occurred. CONCLUSIONS Loop duodeno-enterosomies with sleeve gastrectomy can be safely performed and may open new alternatives in bariatric surgery with the possibility for inter-individual adaptation.","Grueneberger, Jodok Matthias; Karcz-Socha, Iwona; Marjanovic, Goran; Kuesters, Simon; Zwirska-Korczala, Krystyna; Schmidt, Katharina; Karcz, W Konrad",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725654/,514

The aim of this study is to produce new total error (TE) specifications for lymphocyte subset enumeration by analyzing the allowable TE using EQAS data and comparing them with that based on reliable biological variation (BV). Methods A total of 54,400 results from 1,716 laboratories were collected from China National EQAS for lymphocyte subset enumeration during the period 2017-2019. The EQA data were grouped according to lower limits of reference intervals for establishing concentration-dependent specifications. The TE value that 80% of laboratories can achieve were considered as TE specifications based on state of the art. The BV studies compliant with Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC) were used to calculate the three levels of TE specifications. Then these TE specifications were compared for determining the recommended TE specifications. Results Four parameters whose quality specifications could achieve the optimum criteria were as follows: the percentages of CD3+, CD3 + CD4+ (high concentration) and CD3-CD16/56+ cells, and the absolute count of CD3-CD16/56+ cells. Only the TE specifications of CD3-CD19+ cells could achieve the minimum criteria. The TE specifications of remaining parameters should reach the desirable criteria. Conclusions New TE specifications were established by combining the EQA data and reliable BV data, which could help laboratories to apply proper criteria for continuous improvement of quality control, and EQA providers to use robust acceptance limits for better evaluation of EQAS results.","Li, Chenbin; Wang, Yu; Lu, Hong; Du, Zhongli; Xu, Chengshan; Peng, Mingting",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697751/,514

The lack of standardized diagnostic tests and protocols for PJI is a challenge for arthroplasty surgeons.Next generation sequencing (NGS) is an innovative diagnostic tool that can sequence microbial deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) from a synovial fluid sample: all DNA present in a specimen is sequenced in parallel, generating millions of reads. It has been shown to be extremely useful in a culture-negative PJI setting.Metagenomic NGS (mNGS) allows for universal pathogen detection, regardless of microbe type, in a 24-48-hour timeframe: in its nanopore-base variation, mNGS also allows for antimicrobial resistance characterization.Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) NGS, characterized by lack of the cell lysis step, has a fast run-time (hours) and, together with a high sensitivity and specificity in microorganism isolation, may provide information on the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes.Metagenomics and cfDNA testing have reduced the time needed to detect infecting bacteria and represent very promising technologies for fast PJI diagnosis.NGS technologies are revolutionary methods that could disrupt the diagnostic paradigm of PJI, but a comprehensive collection of clinical evidence is still needed before they become widely used diagnostic tools.

115452,Changes we learned to love in the time of COVID.,2021-06-01,"In contrast to the computational generation of conventional tautomers, the analogous operation that would produce ring-chain tautomers is rarely available in cheminformatics codes. This is partly due to the perceived unimportance of ring-chain tautomerism and partly because specialized algorithms are required to realize the non-local proton transfers that occur during ring-chain rearrangement. Nevertheless, for some types of organic compounds, including sugars, warfarin analogs, fluorescein dyes and some drug-like compounds, ring-chain tautomerism cannot be ignored. In this work, a novel ring-chain tautomer generation algorithm is presented. It differs from previously proposed solutions in that it does not rely on hard-coded patterns of proton migrations and bond rearrangements, and should therefore be more general and maintainable. We deploy this algorithm as part of a workflow which provides an automated solution for tautomer generation and scoring. The workflow identifies protonatable and deprotonatable sites in the molecule using a previously described approach based on rapid micro-pKa prediction. These data are used to distribute the active protons among the protonatable sites exhaustively, at which point alternate resonance structures are considered to obtain pairs of atoms with opposite formal charge. These pairs are connected with a single bond and a 3D undistorted geometry is generated. The scoring of the generated tautomers is performed with a subsequent density functional theory calculation employing an implicit solvent model. We demonstrate the performance of our workflow on several types of organic molecules known to exist in ring-chain tautomeric equilibria in solution. In particular, we show that some ring-chain tautomers not found using previously published algorithms are successfully located by ours.","Levine, Daniel S; Watson, Mark A; Jacobson, Leif D; Dickerson, Claire E; Yu, Haoyu S; Bochevarov, Art D",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-020-00334-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830300/,514
115590,The Hang Up.,2020-05-01,"In addition to members causing milder human infections, the Coronaviridae family includes potentially lethal zoonotic agents causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome. The ∼30-kb positive-stranded RNA genome of coronaviruses encodes a replication/transcription machinery that is unusually complex and composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). SARS-CoV nsp12, the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exhibits poorly processive RNA synthesis in vitro, at odds with the efficient replication of a very large RNA genome in vivo. Here, we report that SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 activate and confer processivity to the RNA-synthesizing activity of nsp12. Using biochemical assays and reverse genetics, the importance of conserved nsp7 and nsp8 residues was probed. Whereas several nsp7 mutations affected virus replication to a limited extent, the replacement of two nsp8 residues (P183 and R190) essential for interaction with nsp12 and a third (K58) critical for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA were all lethal to the virus. Without a loss of processivity, the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex can associate with nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3'-5' exoribonuclease and RNA cap N7-guanine methyltransferase activities involved in replication fidelity and 5'-RNA capping, respectively. The identification of this tripartite polymerase complex that in turn associates with the nsp14 proofreading enzyme sheds light on how coronaviruses assemble an RNA-synthesizing machinery to replicate the largest known RNA genomes. This protein complex is a fascinating example of the functional integration of RNA polymerase, capping, and proofreading activities.","Subissi, Lorenzo; Posthuma, Clara C; Collet, Axelle; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Decroly, Etienne; Snijder, Eric J; Canard, Bruno; Imbert, Isabelle",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1323705111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25197083/,514

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective, serial cross-sectional study using data from the NIS. Inclusion criteria were: GA less than or equal to 30 weeks, hospitalization at less than or equal to 28 days of age, assignment of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) or ICD10-CM codes for BPD and tracheostomy. Trends in tracheostomy and resource utilization were assessed using Jonckheere-Terpstra test. p-value < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS Overall, 987 out of 68,953 (1.4%) hospitalizations with BPD had tracheostomy. Characteristics of the study population: 60.8% were male, 68.4% less than or equal to 26 weeks GA, 43.8% White, 60.5% with Medicaid or self-pay, 65.2% in the Midwest and South census regions of the United States, and 45.7% had gastrostomy tube placement. Tracheostomy placement (expressed as per 100,000 live births) decreased from 2.7 in 2008 to 1.9 in 2011. Thereafter, it increased from 1.9 in 2011 to 3.5 in 2017 (p < .001). GA less than or equal to 24 weeks was significantly associated with increased odds of tracheostomy placement. Median length of stay increased significantly from 170 to 231 days while median inflation adjusted hospital cost increased significantly from $323,091 in 2008-2009 to $687,141 between 2008-2009 and 2016-2017. CONCLUSION Although tracheostomy placement among preterm hospitalizations with BPD was rare, the frequency of its placement and its associated resource utilization significantly increased during the study period. Future studies should probe the reasons and factors behind these trends.","Donda, Keyur; Agyemang, Christfelly O; Adjetey, Naa A; Agyekum, Afua; Princewill, Nimitariye; Ayensu, Marian; Bray, Leonita; Yagnik, Priyank J; Bhatt, Parth; Dapaah-Siakwan, Fredrick",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524218/,514
116328,Compensation for occupationally acquired COVID-19.,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND Zinc is an essential trace element that has been implicated in numerous biological functions, including immunity, energy metabolism and antioxidative processes. Recent evaluations of the literature have provided evidence of significant acute changes in zinc metabolism following a bout of aerobic exercise. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the zinc status of trained athletes compared with control populations, as described in cross-sectional studies. DESIGN We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library electronic databases from inception to 28 January 2016 to identify cross-sectional studies that determined the zinc status of athletes compared with a control population. Meta-analysis of the differences in serum zinc concentration and dietary zinc intake between groups were conducted. RESULTS Twelve studies were included in the systematic review. Of the included studies, nine and eight studies provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis of serum zinc concentration and dietary zinc intake, respectively. Serum zinc concentration was significantly lower in athletes [- 0.93 μmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.62 to - 0.23] despite significantly higher dietary zinc intake compared with the control population (2.57 mg/day, 95% CI 0.97-4.16). Data on erythrocyte and urinary zinc from the included studies were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Despite higher total dietary zinc intake, athletes generally have lower serum zinc concentration, which suggests that athletes have higher requirement of zinc than those who are physically inactive. Further investigations of zinc metabolism during exercise and dietary zinc requirement in active populations are needed to establish evidence-based recommendations.","Chu, Anna; Holdaway, Cushla; Varma, Trishala; Petocz, Peter; Samman, Samir",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-017-0818-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164533/,514

The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a novel inflammation-based prognostic score. This study was performed to examine the associations of the preoperative CAR with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after curative resection. METHODS We retrospectively assessed the preoperative CAR in 184 patients who underwent curative resection for CRLM from November 2001 to January 2018 at Kumamoto University (Kumamoto, Japan). The optimal cutoff level of the preoperative CAR was determined by survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. We compared clinicopathological factors and prognoses between the high-CAR and low-CAR groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS A higher preoperative CAR was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.003). Applying survival CART analysis, the high-CAR group comprised 33 patients (17.9%). In the multivariate analyses, a high CAR was independently associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-4.72; p = 0.0004) and RFS (HR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.49; p = 0.040). A high CAR was associated with a large tumor size, high serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, high intraoperative blood loss, and more postoperative complications. CONCLUSION A high preoperative CAR is associated with shorter OS and RFS and might serve as a prognostic marker for patients with CRLM after curative resection.","Sakamoto, Yuki; Mima, Kosuke; Imai, Katsunori; Miyamoto, Yuji; Tokunaga, Ryuma; Akiyama, Takahiko; Daitoku, Nobuya; Hiyoshi, Yukiharu; Iwatsuki, Masaaki; Nagai, Yohei; Baba, Yoshifumi; Iwagami, Shiro; Yamashita, Yo-Ichi; Yoshida, Naoya; Baba, Hideo",Surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2020.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932221/,514

Because of the uncertain behavior of COVID-19, it has become imperative for practices to limit exposure to vulnerable patients. Telemedicine has been one of the cornerstones of caring for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an overview of reimbursement policy by public and private payers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, describes implications in cancer care, and offers considerations for future reimbursement policy.","Kircher, Sheetal M; Mulcahy, Mary; Kalyan, Aparna; Weldon, Christine B; Trosman, Julia R; Benson, Al B",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2020.7639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998106/,514

123428,The COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the lifestyles of Brazilian adolescents.,2021,"Clostridioides difficile is an enteric bacterial pathogen that can a cause nosocomial infection leading to debilitating colitis. The development of a murine model of C. difficile infection has led to fundamental discoveries in disease pathogenesis and the host immune response to infection. Recently, C. difficile endogenously present in the microbiota of mice has been reported and was found to complicate interpretation of mouse studies. Here, we report a novel C. difficile strain, named NTCD-035, isolated from the microbiota of our mouse colony. The presence of NTCD-035 in mice prior to challenge with a highly pathogenic C. difficile strain (VPI10463) led to significantly reduced disease severity. Phylogenetic characterization derived from whole genome sequencing and PCR ribotyping identified the isolate as a novel clade 1, ribotype 035 strain that lacks the pathogenicity locus required to produce toxins. Deficiency in toxin production along with sporulation capacity and secondary bile acid sensitivity was confirmed using in vitro assays. Inoculation of germ-free mice with NTCD-035 did not cause morbidity despite the strain readily colonizing the large intestine. Implementation of a culture-based screening procedure enabled the identification of mice harboring C. difficile in their microbiota, the establishment of a C. difficile-free mouse colony, and a monitoring system to prevent future contamination. Taken together, these data provide a framework for screening mice for endogenously harbored C. difficile and support clinical findings that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of non-toxigenic strains in preventing C. difficile associated disease.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful method to understand delirium pathophysiology. We performed a systematic review to investigate associations between delirium and EEG measures recorded prior, during, and after delirium. A total of 1,655 articles were identified using PsycINFO, Embase and MEDLINE, 31 of which satisfied inclusion criteria. Methodological quality assessment was undertaken, resulting in a mean quality score of 4 out of a maximum of 5. Qualitative synthesis revealed EEG slowing and reduced functional connectivity discriminated between those with and without delirium (i.e. EEG during delirium); the opposite pattern was apparent in children, with cortical hyperexcitability. EEG appears to have utility in differentiating those with and without delirium, but delirium vulnerability and the long-term effects on brain function require further investigation. Findings provide empirical support for the theory that delirium is a disorder of reduced functional brain integration.","Boord, Monique S; Moezzi, Bahar; Davis, Daniel; Ross, Tyler J; Coussens, Scott; Psaltis, Peter J; Bourke, Alice; Keage, Hannah A D",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069620/,514
125582,Evaluation of the initial response in clinical trial efforts for COVID-19 in Brazil.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Centhaquine (Lyfaquin®) showed significant efficacy as a resuscitative agent in animal models of haemorrhagic shock. Its safety and tolerability were confirmed in healthy human volunteers. In this study, our primary objective was to determine the safety, and the secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of centhaquine in patients with hypovolemic shock. METHODS A prospective, multicentre, randomized phase II study was conducted in male and female patients aged 18-70 years with hypovolemic shock having systolic BP ≤ 90 mmHg. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control or centhaquine group. The control group received 100 ml of normal saline infusion over 1 h, while the centhaquine group received 0.01 mg/kg of centhaquine in 100 ml normal saline infusion over 1 h. Every patient received standard of care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. RESULTS Fifty patients were included, and 45 completed the trial: 22 in the control group and 23 in the centhaquine group. The demographics of patients in both groups were comparable. No adverse event related to centhaquine was recorded in the 28-day observation period. The baseline, Injury Scoring System score, haemoglobin, and haematocrit were similar in both groups. However, 91% of the patients in the centhaquine group needed major surgery, whereas only 68% in the control group (p = 0.0526). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 0/23 in the centhaquine group and 2/22 in the control group. The percent time in ICU and ventilator support was less in the centhaquine group than in the control group. The total amount of vasopressors needed in the first 48 h of resuscitation was lower in the centhaquine group than in the control group (3.12 ± 2.18 vs. 9.39 ± 4.28 mg). An increase in systolic and diastolic BP from baseline through 48 h was more marked in the centhaquine group than in the control group. Compared with the control group, blood lactate level was lower by 1.75 ± 1.07 mmol/l in the centhaquine group on day 3 of resuscitation. Improvements in base deficit, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were greater in the centhaquine group than in the control group. CONCLUSION When added to SOC, centhaquine is a well-tolerated and effective resuscitative agent. It improves the clinical outcome of patients with hypovolemic shock.

126103,Metagenomic detection methods in biopreparedness outbreak scenarios.,2013,"The N-terminal S1 region of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike (S) glycoprotein contains four antigenic sites (C, B, D and A, from the N- to the C-terminal end) and is engaged in host-cell receptor recognition. The most N-terminal portion of the S1 region, which comprises antigenic sites C and B, is needed for the enteric tropism of TGEV, whereas the major antigenic site A at the C-terminal moiety is required for both respiratory and enteric cell tropism, and is engaged in recognition of the aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor. This study determined the kinetics for binding of a soluble S1 protein to the APN protein. Moreover, the S1 region of the TGEV S protein was dissected, with the aim of identifying discrete modules displaying unique antigenic sites and receptor-binding functions. Following protease treatments and mammalian cell expression methods, four modules or domains (D1-D4) were defined at the S1 region. Papain treatment identified an N-terminal domain (D1) resistant to proteolysis, whereas receptor binding defined a soluble and functional APN receptor-binding domain (D3). This domain was recognized by neutralizing antibodies belonging to the antigenic site A and therefore could be used as an immunogen for the prevention of viral infection. The organization of the four modules in the S1 region of the TGEV S glycoprotein is discussed.","Reguera, Juan; Ordoño, Desiderio; Santiago, César; Enjuanes, Luis; Casasnovas, José M",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.027607-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228126/,514

127534,"Hemodialysis in the context of COVID-19: care, nursing protagonism and quality.",2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review summarizes the physiological basis of autoregulation-oriented therapy in critically ill patients, with a particular emphasis on individual targets based on parameters that describe autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. RECENT FINDINGS The concepts of optimal cerebral perfusion (CPPopt) and arterial pressures (ABPopt), which both take advantage of continuous measures of cerebral autoregulation, recently have been introduced into clinical practice. It is hypothesized that if both pressures are used as individual targets and followed, the incidence and severity of dysautoregulation will diminish sufficiently to improve outcomes across the spectrum of acute neurological illnesses. These parameters have not been tested in randomized trials. However, a Phase II trial for CPPopt in Traumatic Brain Injury (COGITATE) is underway. Clinical series suggest that delirium following cardiac surgery may be reduced if blood pressure is actively regulated above the lower limit of autoregulation. In traumatic brain injury, using CPPopt as a single target allows monitoring of the upper and lower limits of autoregulation that provide a well tolerated 'corridor' for treatment. Pilot studies in which ABPopt is monitored in preterm newborns suggest fewer haemorrhagic events if blood pressure is closer to its optimal target. Brain imaging studies suggest worse tissue outcomes when blood pressure is below ABPopt. SUMMARY Targeted control of brain and systemic blood pressures to optimize cerebral autoregulation is of substantial interest to the neurocritical care and anaesthesia community, as this strategy may help to avoid secondary brain insults associated with ischemia or hyperaemia. The same strategy can be used outside the ICU (e.g. cardiac surgery, or in stroke patients after mechanical thrombectomy); this requires further research.","Czosnyka, Marek; Hutchinson, Peter; Smielewski, Peter",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32022725/,514

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on students' readiness to enter clinical practice or residency and its association with well-being (anxiety, perceived stress, coping and social support, and resilience). METHODS An online REDCap survey was distributed to 407 D1-D4 year dental students and 29 DH3-DH4 year dental hygiene students enrolled at a U.S. dental school. The survey consisted of readiness and wellness measures as well as socio-demographic variables. RESULTS Overall response rate was 58% (N = 252) ranging from 40% among D4 students to 72% among D1 students. About half (55%) of the respondents were White, a third (34%) Asians and 5% were African Americans. Ninety-two percent were non-Hispanics while 62% were female. Overall mean (SD) anxiety score was 6.5 (5.3) and 26% of respondents reported moderate or severe levels of anxiety. Anxiety score differed significantly by gender with females reporting higher anxiety levels, mean (SD) = 7.3 (5.5) versus 5.2 (4.7) for males; P = 0.002). Furthermore, mean anxiety score differed significantly among the dental school classes, ranging from 5.5 (5.3) among D2 students to 11.8 (6.2) in DH4 students (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Academic dental institutions need to be responsive to the heightened anxiety and uncertainly levels of students and provide responsive training and support to mitigate its effects.","Akinkugbe, Aderonke A; Garcia, Dina T; Smith, Carlos S; Brickhouse, Tegwyn H; Mosavel, Maghboeba",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084054/,514

Results Overall, the vast majority of women (>96%) did not regret having had the hysterectomy. Women who received an open abdominal hysterectomy reported slower recovery with about 7% of women still not fully recovered after 12 months compared to those whose surgery was through a less invasive approach. Women who reported no adverse events, having been given a choice of type of hysterectomy, women who received an alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy, and women who felt prepared for discharge from hospital were significantly more likely to be content with their hysterectomy and report positive patient experiences. Conclusions Compared with those who received a less invasive approach to hysterectomy, women who received open surgery were more likely to express negative experiences relating to their hospital stay and recovery from surgery. The results inform future improvements of care for women planning a hysterectomy.","Janda, Monika; Armfield, Nigel R; Kerr, Gayle; Kurz, Suzanne; Jackson, Graeme; Currie, Jason; Page, Katie; Weaver, Edward; Yazdani, Anusch; Obermair, Andreas",Journal of patient experience,https://doi.org/10.1177/2374373519840076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821797/,514
130581,Looking Forward.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Portal hypertension is necessary for the development of most clinical complications of cirrhosis. We recently reported a novel, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided technique for direct portal pressure measurements using a digital pressure wire. AIMS The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate safety in an animal survival model and (2) compare direct portal vein (PV) versus transhepatic access of a first-order venule. MATERIALS AND METHODS Yorkshire pigs, weighing 40-55 kg. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia. PV was identified using a linear array echoendoscope and accessed with a 22-G fine needle aspiration needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Access was confirmed by portal venography. Mean digital pressure measurements were recorded over 30 seconds, and again after accessing a first-order portal venule in a transhepatic manner. Procedure times and video logs were maintained throughout. Animals were survived for 2 weeks. Repeat portal pressure measurements were performed before euthanasia and necropsy. RESULTS EUS-guided portal pressure measurements ranged from 3 to 11 mm Hg (mean 6.1) and were performed in a mean time of 214 seconds. There was no difference in measurement between the PV and first-order venule, or between baseline and 2-week follow-up. Five of 5 animals survived without incident. On necropsy, there was no evidence of thrombus or hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the first survival study after EUS-guided direct portal pressure measurements using a digital pressure wire. This method appears safe, straightforward, and precise. Measurements of the PV and a first-order portal venule appear equivalent, and serial measurement seems feasible.","Schulman, Allison R; Thompson, Christopher C; Ryou, Marvin",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%).

To optimise preoperative patient information and postoperative analgesic treatment the present study investigated postoperative pain in terms of time course, pain intensity and individual pain components during the first 4 days after transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP). METHODS The study was a single-centre prospective trial including 50 consecutive male patients with primary or recurrent inguinal and/or femoral hernia undergoing elective repair. Several pain components (visceral pain, incisional pain and shoulder pain) were studied as well as pain at the three different trocar incisions. Pain was recorded before operation and on a daily basis during the first four postoperative days using a visual analogue and a verbal rating scale. We used 1 × 12 and 2 × 5 mm trocars for TAPP. RESULTS A total of 46 patients were available for analyses (age median 58 years, range 27-69 years). Visceral pain dominated significantly compared with incisional pain (P < 0.01), which again dominated over shoulder pain intensity and incidence (P < 0.01). Pain intensity did not significantly differ between different trocar incisions (5 and 12 mm) (P > 0.05). The overall pain intensity (a conglomerate of the different pain components) was most intense 3 h after TAPP and declined to preoperative levels on day 3 (P > 0.5). CONCLUSION Pain was most intense 3 h after the operation and declined to low levels within the first 3 days. Visceral pain was by far the dominating pain component compared with incisional and shoulder pain.","Tolver, Mette A; Strandfelt, Pernille; Rosenberg, Jacob; Bisgaard, Thue",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1810-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21688078/,514
131721,[Impact of the coronavirus on Dutch oral health care and practice].,2021-04-01,"As demand for genetic services grows, innovative genetic counseling service delivery models (SDMs) are needed. However, there is limited research on the barriers and needs of genetic counselors (GCs) interested in implementing new SDMs into their practice. In fall 2017, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) Access and Service Delivery Committee's SDM Subcommittee sent an online survey to the NSGC membership regarding the use of SDMs, which aimed to update the understanding of current SDM use and how this has changed over time. The survey included several questions with open-response components assessing the need for new SDMs and barriers to implementation. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify common themes. Among 517 usable responses (16% response rate), more than half (54.4%) of respondents indicated their current SDM was inadequate to address the patient need in their area. Nearly two-thirds (64.8%) indicated they were in the process of or planning to make changes to their SDM, although 40.6% did not have a specific timeline. Three major themes related to expanding access, reimbursement for services, and lack of support were identified from responses to questions about implementation of additional SDMs. Access included subthemes of geographic and physical location limitations, addressing long wait times, and the need to expand services. Reimbursement for services included issues with billing, genetic counselor licensure, and limitations due to the need for physician involvement in billing. The lack of support was evident with issues related to understaffing; difficulty gaining support at the administrative, institutional, or physician level; time constraints; and funding concerns. This study shows that GCs need education, tools, and resources to overcome barriers in implementing new or adapting current SDMs, and there is a need for policy change, including new billing and coverage models.","Boothe, Emily; Greenberg, Samantha; Delaney, Christine L; Cohen, Stephanie A",Journal of genetic counseling,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885542/,514

The suture materials that are most commonly employed in abdominal surgery are polypropylene and polydioxanone. However, in recent times, new products have been marketed, such as non-absorbable polyurethane with elastic properties (Assuplus(®), Assut Europe, Italy) and absorbable barbed polydioxanone (Filbloc(®), Assut Europe, Italy). The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of those against the standard polypropylene (Surgipro(TM), Covidien, USA) and polydioxanone (Assufil(®), Assut Europe, Italy) to mimic the biomechanical behavior of the abdominal wall closure. Comparison of the sutures was made first with the materials alone and later in a laparotomy closure of a rabbit abdomen, used as an animal model. The biomechanical analysis consisted of uniaxial tensile tests of threads and sutured samples of the animal abdomen. In the latter case, results were analyzed at short- (21days) and long- (180days) term intervals after the surgery. The morphology studies and collagen expression of the samples were also investigated. The results determined that polydioxanone and polypropylene sutures showed a linear elastic behavior, with barbed polydioxanone as the most compliant suture and polyurethane as the stiffest. The sutured samples showed a statistically significant loss of resistance, measured as the load needed to perform a certain stretch, when compared with the corresponding control tissue. Analysis of the stress-stretch curves showed that elastic polyurethane was the only suture able to reproduce the mechanical behavior of healthy tissue in the short term, while the rest of the sutures remained less stiff. This coincides with the expression of type I collagen observed in this group at this point in the study. In the long term, there was no difference among the sutures, and none was able to mimic control behavior.","Simón-Allué, R; Pérez-López, P; Sotomayor, S; Peña, E; Pascual, G; Bellón, J M; Calvo, B",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.04.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859461/,514

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the United States, uses a replication-incompetent human adenoviral type 26 vector platform* (2) and is administered as a single intramuscular dose, whereas the first two authorized vaccines use an mRNA platform and require 2 doses. On February 28, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥18 years (3). During April 13-23, CDC and FDA recommended a pause in use of Janssen vaccine after reports of six cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/μL of blood) among Janssen vaccine recipients (4). Similar thrombotic events, primarily among women aged <60 years, have been described in Europe after receipt of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vector (5-7).

Among 13,725 VAERS reports reviewed, 97% were classified as nonserious and 3% as serious,† including three reports among women of cases of thrombosis in large arteries or veins accompanied by thrombocytopenia during the second week after vaccination. These three cases and the previously detected CVST cases are consistent with 17 cases of TTS,§ a newly defined condition. Approximately 338,700 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients completed at least one v-safe survey during the week after vaccination; 76% reported a systemic reaction, 61% reported a local reaction, and 34% reported a health impact.¶ Fatigue and pain were commonly reported symptoms in both VAERS and v-safe. The overall safety profile is consistent with preauthorization clinical trials data. Prompt review of U.S. vaccine safety data detected three additional cases of non-CVST TTS, in addition to the previously recognized CVST cases that initiated the pause in use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Ongoing monitoring of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, including vaccination with the Janssen single-dose vaccine, is essential for evaluating the risks and benefits of each vaccine.","Shay, David K; Gee, Julianne; Su, John R; Myers, Tanya R; Marquez, Paige; Liu, Ruiling; Zhang, Bicheng; Licata, Charles; Clark, Thomas A; Shimabukuro, Tom T",MMWR.

To determine the impact of disaggregated mortality and health surveillance data on the ability to identify health disparities for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) subpopulations. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of reporting categories for AI/AN decedents on official death certificates for all 50 US states. Using public data from the 2017-2018 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess disparities in health conditions and outcomes for tribally enrolled and non‒tribally enrolled AI/AN persons compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Results. There was no standard for the collection of tribal enrollment data or AI/AN race on death certificates across all 50 states. There were stark differences in the incidence and prevalence of various health risk factors and chronic diseases for the tribally enrolled AI/AN subpopulation, non‒tribally enrolled AI/AN subpopulation, and non-Hispanic White comparison group. Conclusions. The collection of tribal enrollment data in vital statistics and health surveillance systems is necessary to identify and respond to health disparities among AI/AN subpopulations. These efforts must be conducted in partnership with tribal nations and consider Indigenous data sovereignty.","Small-Rodriguez, Desi; Akee, Randall",American journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2021.306427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314207/,514

METHODS To assess the immediate and long-term effect of the free healthcare policy in place, we conducted an interrupted time series analysis of routinely collected data on febrile illnesses from three urban primary health centers of Ouagadougou between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016. RESULTS Of the 39,046 febrile cases reported in the study period, 17,017 NMFI were included in the study. Compared to the period before the intervention, we observed an immediate, non-statistically significant increase of 7% in the number of NMFI (IRR=1.07; 95% CI= 0.75, 1.51). Compared to the trend that would have been expected in absence of the intervention, the results showed a small but sustained increase of 6% in the trend of monthly number of NMFI during the intervention period (IRR= 1.06; 95%CI= 1.01, 1.12). CONCLUSION Our study highlighted an increase in the uptake of health care services, specifically for NMFI by children under five years of age, after the implementation of a free care policy. This analysis contributes to informing decision-makers on the need to strengthen the capacities of health care centers and to anticipate the challenges of the sustainability of this policy.","Sia, D; Dondbzanga, B D G; Carabali, M; Bonnet, E; Enok Bonong, P R; Ridde, V",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686252/,514

These agents can cause upper or lower respiratory infections commonly observed in veterinary practices. Clinical signs might vary from mild dyspnea, sneezing, and coughing to severe pneumonia with systemic manifestations. Depending on the etiologic agent, the gross and microscopic changes observed during these infections can be rather unspecific or have highly characteristic patterns. While histopathology and cytology are not always required for diagnosis of respiratory infections, they are often useful for establishing a definitive diagnosis and identifying specific etiologic agents. Research regarding epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics, and clinical manifestations related to these infectious pathogens provides valuable information that has improved treatments and management of the diseases they cause.

However, patients and clinicians may disagree how to use these data. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the literature to identify how patient-generated health data and patient-reported outcomes collected outside of clinical settings can affect patient-clinician relationships within surgery and primary care. METHODS Six research databases were queried for publications documenting the effect of patient-generated health data or patient-reported outcomes on patient-clinician relationships. We conducted thematic synthesis of the results of the included publications. RESULTS Thirteen of the 3204 identified publications were included for synthesis. Three main themes were identified: patient-generated health data supported patient-clinician communication and health awareness, patients desired for their clinicians to be involved with their patient-generated health data, which clinicians had difficulty accommodating, and patient-generated health data platform features may support or hinder patient-clinician collaboration. CONCLUSION Patient-generated health data and patient-reported outcomes may improve patient health awareness and communication with clinicians but may negatively affect patient-clinician relationships.","Lordon, Ross J; Mikles, Sean P; Kneale, Laura; Evans, Heather L; Munson, Sean A; Backonja, Uba; Lober, William B",Health informatics journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1460458220928184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567460/,514

Our field has done a terrific job identifying how CD8+ T cell memory forms in response to Ag. However, many studies focused on systems in which inflammation recedes over time. These situations, while relevant, do not cover all situations in which CD8+ T cell memory is relevant. It is increasingly clear that CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype form in response to infections with extensive or prolonged tissue inflammation, for example, influenza, herpes, and more recently, COVID-19. In these circumstances, inflammatory mediators expectedly affect forming memory CD8+ T cells, especially in tissues in which pathogens establish. Notwithstanding recent important discoveries, many outstanding questions on how inflammation shapes CD8+ T cell memory remain unanswered. We will discuss, in this review, what is already known and the next steps to understand how inflammation influences CD8+ T cell memory.","Borges da Silva, Henrique",ImmunoHorizons,https://doi.org/10.4049/immunohorizons.2000102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035081/,514

139929,Functional capacity and life expectancy in elderly quilombolas.,2020-07-08,"AIMS In the pathogenesis of several diseases, neo-angiogenesis is increased (e.g. tumor growth). The peptide L-glutamyl-L-tryptophan (EW/IM862) has been claimed to exhibit inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo. However, the potential role of natural peptides with respect to anti-angiogenic properties is unsettled. The current study explores anti-angiogenic effects of the dipeptides WL, EW, IW, and WE. METHODS AND RESULTS Using a bottom-up strategy, we first evaluated the effects of the peptides on VEGFR-2 signalling and quantified their effects in different angiogenesis assays. WL consistently had the strongest effects on phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and downstream signalling. Therefore, this peptide was chosen in comparison with EW to further assess anti-angiogenic properties. However, sprout formation in 3D fibrin gel bead assay was significantly inhibited by EW only. Furthermore, vessel sprouting in the mouse aortic ring assay was decreased by the presence of WL and EW compared to control. Results from a chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that under VEGF stimulation WL and EW decreased the number of blood vessels versus control. These results were in line with those obtained in a matrigel plug assay. The VEGF-induced increase in the hemoglobin content was nearly abolished when treatment was combined with either WL or EW application. In the murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, WL exhibited a small albeit significant anti-angiogenetic effect. CONCLUSION Comprehensive screening of WL suggests an anti-angiogenic effect, demonstrated in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. Thus, WL is a dipeptide with potential anti-angiogenic effects and is worthy for further exploration.","Khedr, S; Klotzsche-von Ameln, A; Khedr, M; Elsayed, M H; Sudha, T; Mousa, S A; Deussen, A; Martin, M",Acta physiologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894635/,514

This can result in severe disabilities when it result in small infarcts involving eloquent areas in the posterior circulation or the motor tracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a series of 6 cases utilizing a new dual catheter technique for maintaining the patency of at-risk vessels during angioplasty and stenting. There are several methods previously described to help reduce the incidence of stroke but because they do not have a physical presence in the ostia to protect it, they are unable to guarantee the patency of the vessel. RESULTS All 6 patients underwent angioplasty and stenting with the technique. The patients were assessed for complications with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging and no complications were found. CONCLUSION In this preliminary series, the dual catheter technique appears to safe and effective in preventing occlusion of the adjacent branch arteries. This technique may facilitate the use of the Wingspan stent in the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenotic segments by reducing the risk of peri-procedural stroke.","Yeo, Leonard Ll; Wu, W M; Chen, Y L; Yeh, C H; Wong, H F",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2017.19.1.12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28503484/,514

OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to compare viability of PLTs collected in whole blood into 2 different anticoagulants. METHODS Whole blood from 6 healthy adult Thoroughbred horses was collected into citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA) or acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD). Platelet count, pH, and concentrations of glucose, lactate, carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and chloride were measured within 10 minutes of collection and then again one hour later at which time PLT aggregometry was performed to assess PLT function. RESULTS Aggregometry mean amplitudes were significantly higher in CPDA compared to ACD. Blood glucose, pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and lactate concentrations were significantly higher in CPDA compared to ACD. Lactate concentration was higher following one hour in either anticoagulant. Potassium, oxygen, and carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly higher in ACD compared to CPDA at collection. CONCLUSIONS Platelet aggregometry results suggest that CPDA is superior to ACD for maintaining PLT viability following whole blood collection. This may be associated with the higher, more neutral pH as well as an increase in glucose available for metabolism. Although lactate was increased in the CPDA samples it was not high enough to decrease pH and therefore may not have been high enough to cause morphologic lesions and loss of PLT viability.","Bozorgmanesh, Rana; Sutton-Burges, Julie W; Tablin, Fern",Veterinary clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411369/,514

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of the medical records of 27 canine insulinoma patients. Simultaneous occurrence of blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/L (reference interval: 4.2-5.8 mmol/L) and plasma insulin > 10 mIU/L (reference interval: 1.4-24.5 mIU/L) were considered diagnostic for insulinoma. The dogs had a mean age of 9.0 ± 1.7 (SD) years and comprised 11 males and 17 females. RESULTS Using CECT-scans, 26/27 insulinomas were successfully detected. However, CECT-scans predicted the correct location of insulinomas within the pancreas in only 14/27 dogs. In 9/13 inaccurately located insulinoma cases, the location error was major. There was no significant difference between triple, double and single-phase CECT-scans with location accuracies of 54%, 50% and 50%, respectively. Also, there was no specific post-contrast phase in which insulinomas could be visualised best. Detection of lymph node metastases with CECT-scans had a sensitivity of 67% (10/15 lymph node metastases). Detection of liver metastases had a sensitivity of 75% (6/8 liver metastases). This study highlights that major location errors mainly occurred if single- or double-phase CECT-scans were used (6/9 cases). CONCLUSION It is suggested that triple-phase CECT-scans have superior outcome over single- or double-phase CECT-scans in pre-operative imaging of canine insulinomas.","Buishand, Floryne O; Vilaplana Grosso, Federico R; Kirpensteijn, Jolle; van Nimwegen, Sebastiaan A",The Veterinary quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2018.1481545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29806550/,514
143103,Neurobiology of COVID-19: how can the virus affect the brain?,2021-02-10,"One measure of the severity of a pandemic influenza outbreak at the individual level is the risk of death among people infected by the new virus. However, there are complications in estimating both the numerator and denominator. Regarding the numerator, statistical estimates of the excess deaths associated with influenza virus infections tend to exceed the number of deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed infection. Regarding the denominator, few infections are laboratory confirmed, while differences in case definitions and approaches to case ascertainment can lead to wide variation in case fatality risk estimates. Serological surveillance can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection as a denominator that is more comparable across studies. We estimated that the first wave of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 was associated with approximately 232 (95% confidence interval: 136, 328) excess deaths of all ages in Hong Kong, mainly among the elderly. The point estimates of the risk of death on a per-infection basis increased substantially with age, from below 1 per 100,000 infections in children to 1,099 per 100,000 infections in those 60-69 years of age. Substantial variation in the age-specific infection fatality risk complicates comparison of the severity of different influenza strains.","Wong, Jessica Y; Wu, Peng; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Goldstein, Edward; Lau, Eric H Y; Yang, Lin; Chuang, S K; Tsang, Thomas; Peiris, J S Malik; Wu, Joseph T; Cowling, Benjamin J",American journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kws314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23459950/,514

We administered respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to 58 volunteers, of whom 57% became infected. Mucosal neutrophil activation before exposure was highly predictive of symptomatic RSV disease. This was associated with a rapid, presymptomatic decline in mucosal interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and other mediators. Conversely, those who resisted infection showed presymptomatic activation of IL-17- and tumor necrosis factor-related pathways. Vulnerability to infection was not associated with baseline microbiome but was reproduced in mice by preinfection chemokine-driven airway recruitment of neutrophils, which caused enhanced disease mediated by pulmonary CD8+ T cell infiltration. Thus, mucosal neutrophilic inflammation at the time of RSV exposure enhances susceptibility, revealing dynamic, time-dependent local immune responses before symptom onset and explaining the as-yet unpredictable outcomes of pathogen exposure.","Habibi, Maximillian S; Thwaites, Ryan S; Chang, Meiping; Jozwik, Agnieszka; Paras, Allan; Kirsebom, Freja; Varese, Augusto; Owen, Amber; Cuthbertson, Leah; James, Phillip; Tunstall, Tanushree; Nickle, David; Hansel, Trevor T; Moffatt, Miriam F; Johansson, Cecilia; Chiu, Christopher; Openshaw, Peter J M",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba9301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033192/,514
144701,Fixing racism: out of the corner of one's eye.,2021-06-01,"Retardation of Cd(II) migration is an ongoing concern for environmental remediation, but a prevalent obstacle of the procedure originates from the lack of an atomic-scale description of the inherent mechanism for Cd(II) adsorption at mineral-water interfaces. Herein, we performed first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the adsorption mechanism of Cd(II) on the basal surfaces of kaolinite. Representative monodentate and bidentate Cd(II) complexes were constructed on the Kln-Al(001) and Kln-Si(001̅) surfaces. The results showed that bidentate coordination of Cd(II) on the Kln-Al(001) surface was superior to all other studied models due to the favorable formation energy and better agreement with EXAFS data. The calculated electron density difference revealed the charge transfer from surface oxygen (Os) to Cd(II) upon adsorption. In particular, partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicated that the Cd-Os bond exhibited covalent characteristics, attributed to the overlaps of Cd-5p and Os-2p orbitals in the valence band. Furthermore, radial distribution functions supported by AIMD simulations were employed to confirm the structural features of Cd(II) coordination shell at kaolinite-water interfaces.

We tested the hypothesis that the complication rates and outcome of microscopic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) decompression done by supervised residents are not inferior to those of board-certified faculty neurosurgeons (BCFNs). METHODS Retrospective single-center study performed at a Swiss teaching hospital comparing consecutive patients undergoing surgery for LSS by a supervised neurosurgery resident (teaching cases) to a consecutive series of patients operated on by a BCFN (non-teaching cases). The primary endpoint was occurrence of complications during surgery. Secondary endpoints were patients' clinical outcomes 4 weeks after surgery, categorized into a binary responder and non-responder variable, occurrence of postoperative complications, need for re-do surgery, and clinical outcome until the last follow-up (FU). RESULTS In a total of n = 471 operations, n = 194 (41.2 %) were teaching cases and n = 277 (58.8 %) non-teaching cases. A longer operation time (single-level procedures: mean 100.0 vs. 83.2 min, p < 0.001) was recorded for teaching cases, while estimated blood loss was equal (single-level procedures: mean 109.9 vs. 117.0 ml, p = 0.409). In multivariate analysis, supervised residents were as likely as BCFNs to have an intraoperative complication (OR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.41-2.04, p = 0.835). They were as likely as BCFNs to achieve a favorable 4-week response to surgery (OR 1.82, 95 % CI 0.79-4.15, p = 0.155). Until final FU, the likelihood for patients in the teaching group to suffer from postoperative complications (OR 1.07, 95 % CI 0.46-2.49, p = 0.864) or require re-do surgery (OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.31-1.52, p = 0.358) was similar to that of the non-teaching group. CONCLUSIONS Complication rates and short- and mid-term outcomes following LSS decompression were comparable for patients operated on by supervised neurosurgery residents and senior neurosurgeons.

In addition to several preventive measures such as wearing a mask, using sanitizer, measures also need to be taken to prevent anxiety and depressive disorders due to this unexpected crisis situation. Practicing yoga is one of the simple, scientific methods to combat stress and prevent anxiety among children. METHODS The scientific evidence and anecdotal experiences on benefits of yoga is described in this paper, highlighting the importance of yoga in nurturing the mental well-being in children. RESULTS Scientifically designed and conducted studies as part of the research programs by health professionals objectively conclude that mental health parameters improve significantly with yoga as an intervention. In addition to mental health, yoga will also improve the physical health and boost immunity among children which will also help in reducing the infection rate in children. CONCLUSIONS As a way forward, authors strongly recommend establishing yoga as a curriculum at scale to cover the vast vulnerable population of young children who are the future of the nation.","Kuppusamy, Maheshkumar; Ramaswamy, Veni; Shanmugam, Poonguzhali; Ramaswamy, Padmavathi",Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jcim-2020-0404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962512/,514

We aimed to assess the incidence, predictors and outcomes of CS in hospitalized patients with TS. All patients with TS were identified from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from September 2006 to December 2017. The cohort was divided into those with versus without CS and logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of CS and mortality in patients admitted with TS. A total of 260,144 patients with TS were included in our study, of whom 14703 (6%) were diagnosed with cardiogenic shock (CS). In-hospital mortality among patients with CS was approximately 6-fold higher compared to those without CS (23% vs 4%, P <0.01). TS patients with CS had a higher incidence of malignant arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (15.0% vs 4%, P <0.01) and non-shockable cardiac arrests (12% vs 2%, P <0.01). Independent predictors of CS were male gender, Asian and Hispanic ethnicity, increased burden of comorbidities including congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and chronic diabetes. Independent predictors of mortality were male gender, advanced age, history of congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic liver disease. In conclusion, CS occurs in approximately 6% of patients admitted with TS, in-hospital mortality among TS patients with CS was approximately 6-fold higher compared to those without CS (23% vs 4%, P <0.01), male gender and increased burden of comorbidities at baseline were independent predictors of cardiogenic shock and mortality.","Syed, Moinuddin; Khan, Muhammad Zia; Osman, Mohammed; Alharbi, Anas; Khan, Muhammad Usman; Munir, Muhammad Bilal; Balla, Sudarshan",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941812/,514

We compared a group of patients managed using the AFM system with a historical cohort of patients (control group) who had been managed using a manual GDFT strategy. Adherence to the protocol was defined as the relative intraoperative time spent with a stroke volume variation (SVV) < 13%. We hypothesised that patients in the AFM group would have more time during surgery with a SVV < 13% compared to the control group. All patients had a radial arterial line connected to a pulse contour analysis monitor and received a 2 ml/kg/h maintenance crystalloid infusion. Additional 250 ml crystalloid boluses were administered whenever measured SVV ≥ 13% in the control group, and when the software suggested a fluid bolus in the AFM group. We compared 46 AFM-guided patients to 38 controls. Patients in the AFM group spent significantly more time during surgery with a SVV < 13% compared to the control group (median 92% [82, 96] vs. 76% [54, 86]; P < 0.0005), and received less fluid overall (1775 ml [1225, 2425] vs. 2350 ml [1825, 3250]; P = 0.010). The incidence of postoperative complications was comparable in the two groups. Implementation of a decision support system for GDFT guidance resulted in a significantly longer period during surgery with a SVV < 13% with a reduced total amount of fluid administered.

DESIGN/METHODS Healthy term infants without congenital anomalies, patent ductus arteriosus and/or small for gestational age status were enrolled. Infants were placed in supine (SP1), prone (PP) and back in supine (SP2) position for 15 min each while asleep. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were assessed by electrical velocimetry (EV) and echocardiography (echo), and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSO2) in the frontal lobes was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Heart rate (HR) and SpO2 were continuously monitored by conventional monitoring. RESULTS In 34 healthy term infants (mean age 3.7±1.2 days; 16 females), 66 sets of serial CO measurements (34 EV and 32 echo) in three sleep positions were obtained. Mean COEV and COecho were 182±57 (SP1), 170±50 (PP) and 177±54 (SP2), and 193±48 (SP1), 174±40 (PP) and 192±50 (SP2) mL/kg/min, respectively. Mean SVEV and SVecho were 1.46±0.47 (SP1), 1.36±0.38 (PP) and 1.37±0.39 (SP2), and 1.54±40 (SP1), 1.38±0.38 (PP) and 1.51±0.41 (SP2) mL/kg, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a decrease in CO and SV during prone positions by both EV and echo, while HR, SpO2 and CrSO2 did not change. Thirty-eight per cent of the CO measurements decreased≥10% during prone positioning. CONCLUSIONS In healthy term infants, CO decreases in prone position due to a decrease in SV and not HR. CO recovers when placed back in supine. However, frontal lobe CrSO2 does not change in the different positions.","Wu, Tai-Wei; Lien, Rey-In; Seri, Istvan; Noori, Shahab",Archives of disease in childhood.

148426,Time for a little self-love?,2021,"Skin is the largest organ of the body with important protective functions, which become compromised with time due to both intrinsic and extrinsic ageing processes. Cellular senescence is the primary ageing process at cell level, associated with loss of proliferative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction and significantly altered patterns of expression and secretion of bioactive molecules. Intervention experiments have proven cell senescence as a relevant cause of ageing in many organs. In case of skin, accumulation of senescence in all major compartments with ageing is well documented and might be responsible for most, if not all, the molecular changes observed during ageing. Incorporation of senescent cells into in-vitro skin models (specifically 3D full thickness models) recapitulates changes typically associated with skin ageing. However, crucial evidence is still missing. A beneficial effect of senescent cell ablation on skin ageing has so far only been shown following rather unspecific interventions or in transgenic mouse models. We conclude that evidence for cellular senescence as a relevant cause of intrinsic skin ageing is highly suggestive but not yet completely conclusive.","Low, Evon; Alimohammadiha, Ghazaleh; Smith, Lucy A; Costello, Lydia F; Przyborski, Stefan A; von Zglinicki, Thomas; Miwa, Satomi",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487917/,514

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. SETTING Tertiary care academic cochlear implant center. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-five patients referred for cochlear implant candidacy evaluation from 2004 through 2019. INTERVENTION Community and academic audiometry were compared in a matched-pair analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pure-tone audiometry and word recognition scores (WRS) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Cost of repeated audiometry was estimated using the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment data. RESULTS The majority of pure-tone thresholds (PTT) and pure-tone averages (PTA) had no statistically significant differences between community and academic centers. Only air PTT at 2000 Hz on the right and air PTA on the right demonstrated differences with α = 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. Despite statistical differences, mean differences in PTT and PTA were all under 3.5 dB. WRS were on average lower at the academic center, by 14.7% on the right (p < 0.001) and 10.6% on the left (p = 0.003). Repeating initial audiometry costs patients up to $60.58 and costs the healthcare system up to $42.94 per patient. CONCLUSIONS Pure-tone audiometry between community and academic centers did not demonstrate clinically significant differences. Lower academic WRS implies that patients identified as potential cochlear implant candidates based on community WRS are likely suitable to proceed to sentence testing without repeating audiometry, saving patients and the healthcare system time and resources.","Shah, Ravi R; Jeon, Jun W; Naples, James G; Hwa, Tiffany P; Davis, Sherrie; Eliades, Steven J; Brant, Jason A; Bigelow, Douglas C; Ruckenstein, Michael J","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555746/,514

150095,Working conditions and depression in hospital emergency service nurses.,2020,"Medical imaging plays a critical role in clinical decision-making across disciplines, and as such, there is frequent need for non-radiologist clinicians to interact with medical imaging. This review examines the literature about the delivery of medical imaging education to non-radiologist clinicians, spanning junior doctors, advanced trainees and specialists. Knowledge of medical imaging among non-radiologist clinicians is paramount to the quality of patient care, with calls for formal implementation of radiology education into non-imaging specialty training programmes. Overall, there is a demand across non-imaging disciplines for greater formalised medical imaging education. Concerns are raised that too great a reliance on informal methods of teaching radiology, for example in ward settings, results in greater variation in the quality and volume of educational opportunities and risks the perpetuation of erroneous attitudes and practices. The evolution of the medical imaging workplace and increasing utilisation of remote reporting has distanced the collaborative relationship between radiologists and their non-imaging colleagues, diminishing opportunities for ad hoc learning and engagement in larger formalised educational collaborations. Ideally, radiologists should be directly involved in the development and delivery of medical imaging education to post-graduate doctors to not only benefit patient care but also foster inter-specialty relationships and respect. Evidence supports the value of structured radiological teaching opportunities, including tutorials, lectures and electronic resources, in improving medical imaging skills among non-radiologist clinicians. There is wide scope for growth in the e-learning arena to address this demand for quality and accessible imaging education for our non-radiology colleagues.","Ayesa, Sally L; Katelaris, Annette G; Brennan, Patrick C; Grieve, Stuart M",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180148/,514

152830,COVID-19: a magnifying glass for gender inequalities in medical research.,2020-11-01,"The most effective way to prevent and control infectious disease outbreak is through vaccines. The increasing use of vaccines has elevated the need to establish new manufacturing strategies. One of the major approaches is cell-based production, which creates a need for high cell density to enable higher cell production levels. This has led to development of the technology of cell carriers, including micro and macro cell carriers. To follow the production process, quantifying the number of cells on these carriers is required, as well as the tracking of their viability and proliferation. However, owing to various carriers' unique structures, tracking the cell's is challenging using current traditional assays that were originally developed for monolayers of adherent cells. The current ""gold standard"" method is counting cell nuclei, separating cells from the carrier, staining with crystal violet and visually counting under a microscope. This method is tedious and counts both live and dead cells. A few other techniques were developed but were specific to the carrier type and involved specialized equipment. In this study, we describe a broadly ranging method for counting cells on carriers that was developed and employed as part of the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The method is based on the Alamar blue dye, a well-known, common marker for cell activity, and was found to be successful in tracking cell adsorption, cell growth and viability on carriers. No separation of the cells from the carriers is needed, nor is any specialized equipment; the method is simple and rapid, and provides comprehensive details necessary for process control of viral vaccine production in cells. This method can be easily implemented in any of a number of cell-based processes and other unique platforms for measuring growth of encapsulated cells. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS A three-dimensional anatomically realistic computation aneurysm model was created from the digital subtraction angiogram of a large internal carotid artery-ophthalmic artery aneurysm which could have been treated with either a neck bridging stent or a flow diversion stent. Three-dimensional computational models of the Neuroform EZ neck bridging stent and Pipeline embolization device were created based on measurements with a stereo-microscope. Each stent was placed in the computational aneurysm model and intra-aneurysmal flow structures were compared before and after placement of the stents. Computational fluid dynamics were performed by numerically solving the continuity and Navier-Stokes momentum equations for a steady blood flow based on the finite volume method. Blood was assumed as an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Vessel walls were assumed to be rigid, and no-slip boundary conditions were applied at the lumens. To estimate the change in the intra-aneurysmal pressures we assumed that, at the inlets, the intra-arterial pressure at peak systole was 120 mm Hg both before and after stent placement RESULTS Without any stent, the blood flow entered into the aneurysm dome from the mid to proximal neck area and ascended along the distal wall of the aneurysm. The flow then changed its direction anteriorly and moved along the proximal wall of the aneurysm dome. In addition to the primary intra-aneurysmal circulation pattern, a counterclockwise vortex was observed in the aneurysm dome. The placement of a Neuroform EZ stent induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 14% and a small change in the overall intra-aneurysmal flow pattern. The placement of a Pipeline device induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 74% and a significant change in flow pattern. Despite the flow velocity changes, Neuroform EZ and Pipeline devices induced reductions in intra-aneurysmal pressure of only 4 mm Hg and 8 mm Hg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The flow diversion effects of both stents were limited to flow velocity reduction. In a non-thrombosed aneurysm or an aneurysm with delayed thrombosis, the intra-aneurysmal pressure remains essentially unchanged regardless of the level of the intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction induced by the stents.","Shobayashi, Yasuhiro; Tateshima, Satoshi; Kakizaki, Ryuichi; Sudo, Ryo; Tanishita, Kazuo; Viñuela, Fernando",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23048176/,514

MATERIALS AND METHODS The qualitative study was undertaken in a tertiary referral intensive care unit in Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. Drawing upon patient case studies of decisions about non escalation and/or withdrawal of life support, we undertook indepth interviews with senior and junior physicians. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and narratively analysed. RESULTS Eighteen senior and junior physicians involved in 21 patient case studies were interviewed. Analysis determined two predominant themes: key moral distress triggers; and strategies and consequences. Junior residents reported most instances of moral distress, triggered by perceived futility, lack of continuity, protracted decisions and failure to ensure 'good death'. Senior physicians' triggers included constraint of clinical autonomy. Moral distress was far reaching, affecting personal life, working relationships and career choice. CONCLUSION This study is the first to explore physicians' moral distress in end-of-life decisions in intensive care via a narrative inquiry approach using case studies.

One leading hypothesis is that clinicians may unknowingly display racial bias when considering ECT for patients of color. Studies have consistently shown that patients of color face numerous racially driven, provider-level interpersonal and perceptual biases that contribute to clinicians incorrectly overdiagnosing them as having a psychotic-spectrum illness rather than correctly diagnosing a severe affective disorder. A patient's diagnosis marks the entry to evidence-based service delivery, and ECT is best indicated for severe affective disorders rather than for psychotic disorders. As a consequence of racially influenced clinician misdiagnosis, patients from racial-ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among those given severe affective diagnoses, which are most indicated for ECT referral. Evidence also suggests that clinicians may use racially biased treatment rationales when considering ECT after they have given a diagnosis of a severe affective or psychotic disorder, thereby producing secondary inequities in ECT referral. Increasing the use of gold-standard treatment algorithms when considering ECT for patients of color is contingent on clinicians transcending the limitations posed by aversive racism to develop culturally unbiased, clinically indicated diagnostic and treatment rationales.","Black Parker, Carmen; McCall, William V; Spearman-McCarthy, E Vanessa; Rosenquist, Peter; Cortese, Niayesh",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730880/,514
154773,What role is there for 'nudging' clinicians?,2021,": Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the critical innate immune effector cells that directly kill tumors and virus-infected cells, and modulate other immune cells including dendritic cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Signals from activating and inhibitory surface receptors orchestrate the regulatory and cytotoxic functions of NK cells. Although a number of surface receptors are involved, multiple signaling molecules are shared so that NK cell responses are synergistically regulated. Many pathogens and tumors evade NK cell responses by targeting NK cell signaling. Particularly in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection, the NK cell repertoire is diminished by changes in subsets of NK cells, expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, and intracellular signaling molecules. However, in-depth studies on intracellular signaling in NK cells in HIV/SIV infections remain limited. Checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells have demonstrated enhanced NK cell activities against tumors and viral infections. In addition, targeting intracellular signaling molecules by small molecules could also improve NK cell responses towards HIV/SIV infection in vivo. Therefore, further understanding of NK cell signaling including identification of key signaling molecules is crucial to maximize the efficacy of NK cell-based treatments. Herein, we review the current state of the literature and outline potential future avenues where optimized NK cells could be utilized in HIV-1 cure strategies and other immunotherapeutics in PLWH.","Sugawara, Sho; Manickam, Cordelia; Reeves, R Keith",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116071/,514

Vaccine hesitancy is a challenge for the pediatric provider, given the diverse factors associated with hesitancy and the limited evidence on effective strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy in the provider office. In this article, we review available evidence and approaches for vaccine communication, including the importance of using a whole-team approach, building trust, starting the conversation early, using a presumptive approach for vaccine recommendations, motivational interviewing with parents who have concerns for vaccines, and additional techniques for responding to parent questions.

Twenty four clinically healthy Holstein dairy cows were divided randomly into two groups. In the transrectal guidance group, an assistant grasped the ovaries via the transrectal route and pulled them to a position where they could be visualized with a camera. On the other hand, the control group was operated without guidance. The time required to remove both ovaries in the guidance group was shorter than that in the control group (P<0.01). We concluded that laparoscopic ovariectomy with transrectal guidance of the ovaries can substantially shorten operative time, thereby greatly contributing to animal welfare and to reducing the burden on the operator.","Sato, Reiichiro; Kanai, Eiichi; Kitahara, Go; Noguchi, Michiko; Kawai, Kazuhiro; Shinozuka, Yasunori; Tsukamoto, Atsushi; Ochiai, Hideharu; Onda, Ken; Steiner, Adrian",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.17-0449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29033408/,514

157380,COVID-19 vaccine availability: what are the side effects?,2021,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a chiral drug can significantly differ between application of the racemate and single enantiomers. During drug development, the characteristics of candidate compounds have to be assessed prior to clinical testing. Since biotransformation significantly influences drug actions in an organism, metabolism studies represent a crucial part of such tests. Hence, an optimized and economical capillary electrophoretic method for on-line studies of the enantioselective drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes was developed. It comprises a diffusion-based procedure, which enables mixing of the enzyme with virtually any compound inside the nanoliter-scale capillary reactor and without the need of additional optimization of mixing conditions. For CYP3A4, ketamine as probe substrate and highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin as chiral selector, improved separation conditions for ketamine and norketamine enantiomers compared to a previously published electrophoretically mediated microanalysis method were elucidated. The new approach was thoroughly validated for the CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation pathway of ketamine and applied to the determination of its kinetic parameters and the inhibition characteristics in presence of ketoconazole and dexmedetomidine. The determined parameters were found to be comparable to literature data obtained with different techniques. The presented method constitutes a miniaturized and cost-effective tool, which should be suitable for the assessment of the stereoselective aspects of kinetic and inhibition studies of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic steps within early stages of the development of a new drug.","Řemínek, Roman; Glatz, Zdeněk; Thormann, Wolfgang",Electrophoresis,https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201400356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25382218/,514

The composition of pathogenic variants differs greatly among human populations, but historically, research about monogenic diseases has focused mainly on people with European ancestry. By comparison, less is known about pathogenic DNA variants in people from other parts of the world. Consequently, inclusion of currently underrepresented Indigenous and other minority population groups in genomic research is essential to enable equitable outcomes in ECS and other areas of genomic medicine. Here, we discuss this issue in relation to the implementation of ECS in Australia, which is currently being evaluated as part of the national Government's Genomics Health Futures Mission. We argue that significant effort is required to build an evidence base and genomic reference data so that ECS can bring significant clinical benefit for many Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians. These efforts are essential steps to achieving the Australian Government's objectives and its commitment ""to leveraging the benefits of genomics in the health system for all Australians."" They require culturally safe, community-led research and community involvement embedded within national health and medical genomics programs to ensure that new knowledge is integrated into medicine and health services in ways that address the specific and articulated cultural and health needs of Indigenous people.

To evaluate the possibility of identifying antibodies with broad neutralizing activity, we isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, that cross-reacts with eight β-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting β-coronaviruses. B6 broadly neutralizes entry of pseudotyped viruses from lineages A and C, but not from lineage B, and the latter includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography and membrane fusion assays reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery. The data indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with the spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with β-coronaviruses from three lineages, along with a proof of concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination.

AIM OF THE STUDY To determine the findings on high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) and 24-h pH recording in patients with typical GERD symptoms, refractory to PPI treatment. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of patients referred for HREM and 24-h pH recording was done. We selected patients who were referred for evaluation of refractory GERD symptoms despite > 8 weeks of at least once-daily PPI treatment. Details noted were demographic profile, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy report, HREM findings and 24-h pH findings. RESULTS Ninety-six patients had symptoms of GERD that were refractory to PPI therapy. Seven patients (7.1%) were diagnosed having diseases mimicking GERD: eosinophilic esophagitis (n=2), supragastric belching (n=4) and rumination (n=1). After excluding these patients and those with insufficient data, the final study cohort included 82 cases. Fifty patients (61%) had normal motility. Major motility disorders were detected in 8 (9.75%) patients: achalasia cardia (6) and distal esophageal spasm (2). Ineffective esophageal motility was noted in 24 patients. A total of 74 patients underwent 24-h pH testing. Significant acid reflux with good symptom correlation was noted in 56 patients. Eighteen patients did not have significant acid reflux (Johnson-DeMeester score < 14.7): hypersensitive esophagus (12) and functional heartburn (6).

159239,Prevention of COVID-19 in the workplace.,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the changes in end-expiratory lung volume during an oxygenation-guided stepwise recruitment procedure in elective high-frequency ventilation. We hypothesized that high continuous distending pressure impedes pulmonary blood flow as evidenced by reduced lung volume measurements using respiratory inductive plethysmography. Changes in oxygenation, ventilation, and peripheral perfusion were evaluated as secondary outcomes. DESIGN A prospective, single center, observational, nonrandomized study. SETTING The study was conducted in a neonatal ICU in Italy. PATIENTS High-frequency ventilated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS During the recruitment procedure, end-expiratory lung volume measured by respiratory inductive plethysmography, oxygen saturation, perfusion index, regional cerebral and perirenal tissue oxygenation, heart rate, transcutaneous PCO2, and tidal volume were simultaneously recorded at each airway pressure step. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In 12 preterm newborns (gestational age, 27.4 ± 0.2 wk; birth weight, 979 ± 198 g), high-frequency ventilation was initiated at a continuous distending pressure of 10 cm H2O and incrementally increased by 1-2 cm H2O every 2-5 minutes until FIO2 was less than or equal to 0.25. End-expiratory lung volume progressively increased during the initial recruitment, but decreased at the maximum airway pressure in nine patients, indicative of a reduction in pulmonary perfusion. At the end of recruitment, tidal volume was significantly higher (p = 0.002) and oxygenation was significantly improved (p = 0.002); however, mean perfusion index, postductal saturation, and mean renal tissue oxygenation values were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with baseline. Mean cerebral tissue oxygenation and mean transcutaneous PCO2 values were reduced but failed to reach significance. CONCLUSIONS High distending lung pressures increased oxygenation but decreased peripheral perfusion with no adverse cerebral side effects. Coupled with the reduction in respiratory inductive plethysmography-derived lung volume, high continuous distending pressure had adverse cardiopulmonary effects. Incorporation of lung volume and hemodynamic and oxygenation variables may guide optimum lung volume determination during high-frequency ventilation recruitment procedure while preventing adverse effects on the pulmonary circulation.","Tana, Milena; Polglase, Graeme R; Cota, Francesco; Tirone, Chiara; Aurilia, Claudia; Lio, Alessandra; Ricci, Cinzia; Romagnoli, Costantino; Vento, Giovanni",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25803651/,514

In the last few decades, advancement of molecular technologies has provided us with more robust tools to expand our armamentarium in this microbial hunting process. Areas covered: In this article, we give a brief overview of the most important molecular technologies we use for identification of emerging microbes associated with unexplained infectious syndromes, including 16S rRNA and other conserved targets sequencing for bacteria, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and other target gene sequencing for fungi, polymerase and other gene sequencing for viruses, as well as deep sequencing. Then, we use several representative examples to illustrate how these techniques have been used for the discoveries of a few notable bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens associated with unexplained infectious syndromes in the last 20-30 years. Expert opinion: In the past and present, characterization of emerging pathogens of unexplained infectious disease syndromes has relied on a combination of conventional culture- and phenotype-based technologies and nucleic acid amplification and sequencing. In the next era, we envisage more widespread adoption of next generation technologies that can detect both known and previously undescribed pathogens.","Li, Xin; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2019.1651200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385539/,514

Available studies do not specifically enroll patients who undergo emergency laparotomy and thus do not consider the distinct biological characteristics of these patients. The present randomized controlled trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of two commonly applied abdominal wall closure strategies in patients undergoing primary emergency midline laparotomy. METHODS/DESIGN The CONTINT trial is a multicenter, open label, randomized controlled trial with a two-group parallel design. Patients undergoing a primary emergency midline laparotomy are enrolled in the trial. The two most commonly applied strategies of abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy are compared: the continuous, all-layer suture technique using slowly absorbable monofilament material (two Monoplus loops) and the interrupted suture technique using rapidly absorbable braided material (Vicryl sutures). The primary endpoint within the CONTINT trial is an incisional hernia within 12 months or a burst abdomen within 30 days after surgery. As reliable data on this primary endpoint is not available for patients undergoing emergency surgery, an adaptive interim analysis will be conducted after the inclusion of 80 patients, allowing early termination of the trial if necessary or modification of design characteristics such as recalculation of sample size.

Early on, concerns grew that lockdowns and travel restrictions could have severe consequences, especially for marginalized communities in the Global South. In Sub-Saharan Africa, wood charcoal is not only an important cooking fuel, but provides income for many rural households. Despite its economic value, the charcoal sector is, however, largely unregulated and viewed exclusively as an environmentally damaging industry by policy makers and the public who make it responsible for large-scale deforestation. The present study employs a sustainable livelihood framework to assess the ability of charcoal producers in northwestern Kenya, to cope with a short-term shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures. It furthermore compares their access to health information to that of non-producers. A street survey of 139 respondents allowed to gain rapid insights into the realities of a group not accessible via online or telephone surveys. The results show that 87% of charcoal producers face severe decline of this economic practice because of limited market access. These losses cause them food insecurities, while non-charcoal producers are more worried about social consequences of the restrictions. Though charcoal producers and non-producers feel equally well informed about the pandemic, producers are less likely to access reliable information channels than non-producers, resulting in an uneven distribution of health information across the community. By investigating the response of producers to an external shock and limited market access this study adds to the understanding of local vulnerabilities and the sustainability of rural livelihood strategies. This research argues for inclusive policy response to ensure consideration of the informal sector in crisis response as well as to provide adequate and low-threshold access to health information.","Petersen, M.; Kamurio, C.

Inter-State borders were closed, restrictions were imposed on the operation of public catering organizations and the holding of sports and entertainment events was suspended, some of the fundamental rights were heavily constrained. This resulted in the growth of public disaffection, falling of incomes and a worsening of the overall economic environment. As a result, the problem of the permissibility of restrictions of human rights and freedoms for the sake of public security, as well as the requirements for such restrictions, had once again become relevant. The purpose of the article is, firstly, to learn what is the concept of ""freedom"" nowadays, to define the conditions and principles of application the permissible restrictions on human rights and freedoms, their aims and purpose. The authors dare to analyze the laws and regulations establishing the possibility of restricting human rights and freedoms and to give a description of the procedure for imposing restrictions in situations of greater danger. The methodology of research includes formal legal interpretation of legal acts, systemic approach to cognition of social relations, analysis and synthesis. The main results, scope of application. The definition and concept of freedom, its limited character, the regulation of the possibility of its restriction for the purpose of protecting society have been studied and defined. Russian and international legislation on the restriction of human rights and freedoms has been analyzed. The principles on the basis of which it is permissible to restrict human rights and freedoms have been identified. The principle of the inadmissibility of restrictions on all rights and freedoms;the adequacy of the imposed restrictive measures to the existing threat;the principle of economic efficiency;the principle of detailed regulation of the imposed restrictions are among them. It has been found out that there is a threat of establishing tyranny with arbitrary restrictions on human rights and freedoms. Conclusions. In today's world, the restriction of human rights and freedoms should be considered as a necessary measure to ensure the security of the individuals and of society as a whole, especially in the situations of a great danger to public interests. At the same time, the imposing restrictions should be strictly regulated and, moreover, possible abuses should be avoided in order to minimize the negative consequences and avoid establishing totalitarian regime.","Evstratov, A.

186088,Prognosticating COVID-19: A need for Africa-specific laboratory predictors.,2020-05-08,"Regulated secretory proteins are thought to be sorted in the trans- Golgi network (TGN) via selective aggregation. The factors responsible for this aggregation are unknown. We show here that two widespread regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (granins), remain in an aggregated state when TGN vesicles from neuroendocrine cells (PC12) are permeabilized at pH 6.4 in 1-10 mM calcium, conditions believed to exist in this compartment. Permeabilization of immature secretory granules under these conditions allowed the recovery of electron dense cores. The granin aggregates in the TGN largely excluded glycosaminoglycan chains which served as constitutively secreted bulk flow markers. The low pH, high calcium milieu was sufficient to induce granin aggregation in the RER. In the TGN of pituitary GH4C1 cells, the proportion of granins conserved as aggregates was higher upon hormonal treatment known to increase secretory granule formation. Our data suggest that a decrease in pH and an increase in calcium are sufficient to trigger the selective aggregation of the granins in the TGN, segregating them from constitutive secretory proteins.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289203/,514

He was born at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) in 1982. His mother was a sex worker who also injected drugs. He died at 3½ years following multiple episodes of opportunistic infection and metastatic lymphoma. In the years between 1986 and 1990, 163 HIV-positive mothers gave birth at YNHH. The mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate was 20 percent. Women represented 8 percent of all HIV cases in the US compared with 29 percent in New Haven. We had a six times greater proportion of children living with HIV. The mean number of HIV-exposed babies rose annually from 26 (1985-87) to 37 (1988-90). Our first team of caregivers comprised a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and me. We were, in time, joined by a growing number of colleagues. Enlightened and generous hospital administrators provided us with outpatient space and the promise of continued funding to support additional staff and in 1987, an independent Pediatric AIDS Care Program. We implemented the proven MTCT prevention guidelines articulated in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocol 076 and by 1995, the MTCT rate at YNHH fell to 9 percent. Since 1996, the MTCT rate at YNHH has been zero percent. Combination antiretroviral therapy, cART, made its debut in the mid-1990s; five classes of drugs with multiple agents in each were licensed between 2003 and 2013. We designed individual treatment plans for each child and gradually entered an era when our clinic was populated with healthier long-term survivors.

186660,SARS: lessons to learn for GPs when handling a public health crisis.,2005,"An allele-specific oligonucleotide microarray was developed for rapid typing of pathogens based on analysis of genomic variations. Using a panel of Escherichia coli strains as a model system, selected loci were sequenced to uncover differences, such as single- or multiple-nucleotide polymorphisms as well as insertion/deletions (indels). While typical genomic profiling experiments employ specific sequences targeted to genomic DNA unique to a single strain or virulent gene, the present array is designed to type bacteria based on a patterned signature response across multiple loci. In the signature concept, all strains are interrogated by hybridizing their amplified DNA to an array containing multiple probe sequences. Allele-specific oligonucleotide probe sequences targeting each of these variable regions were synthesized and included in a custom fiber-optic array. For each locus, a set of specific probe sequences is selected, such that hybridization gives a binary signal/no signal response to each of the probes. Using this strategy for multiple loci, many pathogens or microorganisms could be classified using a limited number of probes. Because of the advantages of the fiber-optic array platform over other array formats, including sensitivity and speed, the platform described in this paper is capable of supporting a high-throughput diagnostic strategy.","Shepard, Jason R E; Danin-Poleg, Yael; Kashi, Yechezkel; Walt, David R",Analytical chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15623311/,514

The feline infectious peritonitis virus was compared in vitro with canine coronavirus, a reported enteric pathogen of dogs. The feline isolate was characterized, by chloroform sensitivity and resistance to 5-iododeoxyuridine, respectively, as containing essential lipid and an RNA genome. Other traits of the isolate included resistance to acidic conditions, heat lability, and resistance to trypsin. Electron microscopy showed viral particles with a structure consistent with that of the prototype of the coronavirus group, infectious bronchitis virus. Indirect immunofluorescence with canine coronavirus monospecific antiserum showed the viral isolate to be antigenically related to canine coronavirus. Specific-pathogen-free cats inoculated by various routes with cell-culture-propagated virus had both clinical symptoms and lesions consistent with feline infectious peritonitis.","Evermann, J F; Baumgartener, L; Ott, R L; Davis, E V; McKeirnan, A J",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7467085/,514
187501,The impact of obesity on the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19.,2020-12-14,"Contact tracing, followed by treatment or isolation, is a key control measure in the battle against infectious diseases. It is an extreme form of locally targeted control, and as such has the potential to be highly efficient when dealing with low numbers of cases. For this reason it is frequently used to combat sexually transmitted diseases and new invading pathogens. Accurate modelling of contact tracing requires explicit information about the disease-transmission pathways from each individual, and hence the network of contacts. Here, pairwise-approximation methods and full stochastic simulations are used to investigate the utility of contact tracing. A simple relationship is found between the efficiency of contact tracing necessary for eradication and the basic reproductive ratio of the disease. This holds for a wide variety of realistic situations including heterogeneous networks containing core-groups or super-spreaders, and asymptomatic individuals. Clustering (transitivity) within the transmission network is found to destroy the relationship, requiring lower efficiency than predicted.","Eames, Ken T D; Keeling, Matt J",Proceedings.

This paper describes how the two relevant ministries in Japan worked together to cope with recent disease outbreaks, including cases of classical swine fever (CSF) and avian influenza, which evidence suggests might have been the result of the deliberate misuse of unauthorised vaccines that had been illegally imported. By implementing successful control measures the two ministries were able to eradicate all the diseases within very short periods. In the past few years, the Republic of Korea has also experienced outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and CSF, all of which had previously been absent (or had been eradicated) in Korea.

NSAIDs may interfere with the defense process against viral infection and are best avoided. Systemic corticosteroids have not shown benefit in viral infection, including other coronavirus; thus they should be avoided, unless prescribed for another indication. The benefit-risk ratio is however clearly in favor of continuing inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma or COPD. ACE inhibitors and sartans upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the pulmonary receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

Antisera directed against a bovine (Breda strain) and equine (Berne strain) torovirus failed to react with BRTV-infected cells in immunofluorescence assays and did not neutralise BRTV. No toroviral RNA was found in the supernatants of infected cells by means of a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with torovirus-specific primers.

Therefore, it is difficult to point out what the patients exactly need because their needs are set on a broad range of a difficult boundary. The level of care that follows will be complex and multifactorial because nursing will challenge the interaction with the individual as a whole: behaviors and relations with family members. At this stage exploring interpersonal conflicts, with past and present aggression behaviors will be crucial. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Aim of this paper is to investigate the professional experience in a work context where the patient's clinical condition poses a daily challenge from a physical and emotional perspective. Narrative investigation is performed here in order to explore the psychological load of the professional's psychological experience and its implication in facing aggressive situations. Moreover, this investigation highlights the importance of some professional and personal resources that can be made available to the operator. RESULTS These tools could improve the understanding of the subjective experience of acute events guiding the individual through an exploration of the phenomenology of what happened decreasing the intimate stress load.

Chemokines are important inflammatory mediators and regulate disease due to viral infection. In previous study, we found that SARS-CoV has the ability to replicate in mononuclear cells. In present work, we sought to characterize the replication of SARS-CoV at the presence of RANTES in THP-1 cells. METHODS To determine whether RANTES play an role in the process of SARS, THP-1 cells were incubated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV and ELISA was used to test RANTES levels in the supernatants; Then the effect of dexamethasone on the induced secretion was evaluated. Real-time PCR was used to investigate the effort of RANTES on the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro. Macrophages, induced by THP-1 cells, were used as cell model. FINDINGS Inactive SARS-CoV could induce THP-1 cells secret RANTES and this increase effect could not be suppressed by DXM. RANTES itself could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in THP-1 cells when it was added into the culture before or at the same time with the virus; No inhibition effect was shown when RANTES were added into the culture after SARS-CoV infected the cells.","Li, D; Wu, N; Yao, H; Bader, A; Brockmeyer, Norbert H; Altmeyer, P",European journal of medical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15851378/,514

These models contribute to the structuring of the knowledge already available in various disciplines, to finding epidemiological connnections, to demonstrating lacunas within the pool of knowledge and to the comparison of the expected effects and costs of preventative and intervention measures. The use of models leads to a 'made-to-measure' analysis ofthe effects and costs of preventative and intervention measures which takes account of the specific characteristics of infectious diseases. The integration of knowledge from various disciplines can be supported by more research into the theoretical epidemiology of infectious disease and by better integration of mathematical models into policy development.

Studies of human tissue RAS expression, however, have been limited by the lack of availability of sufficient amounts of fresh human tissues and a sensitive method for detecting specific mRNAs. To demonstrate the presence of components of local RASs in humans we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after reverse transcription to detect renin- angiotensinogen-, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-mRNA in small quantities of human tissues. Results indicated that all components of the RAS were widely expressed in human organ samples. In order to study changes of gene expression in small tissue samples (e.g., renal biopsies) obtained from patients, we established a competitive PCR assay for quantification of renin, using a 155-basepair deletion mutant of the human renin cDNA as an internal standard. Renin-mRNA concentration was quantitated in the kidney (1.74 +/- 0.2 pg renin/micrograms total RNA), adrenal gland (1.15 +/- 0.15 pg renin/micrograms total RNA), placenta (0.7 +/- 0.1 pg renin/micrograms total RNA), and saphenous vein (0.02 +/- 0.01 pg renin/micrograms total RNA).

Throughout the years, scientists have spent tremendous efforts in looking for microorganisms associated with these ""unexplained infectious disease syndromes"". Recently, a novel bacterium, Laribacter hongkongensis, was discovered and shown to be associated with gastroenteritis and traveller's diarrhoea. This review summarizes the current status, and shares with the readers the authors' experience in the microbiology, classification, epidemiology, clinical disease, laboratory diagnosis, antibiotic resistance and treatment of L. hongkongensis. It also discusses the importance and perspective of describing novel pathogenic bacterial species. RECENT FINDINGS L. hongkongensis was shown to be associated with gastroenteritis and traveller's diarrhoea. Consumption of fish was associated with recovery of L. hongkongensis. Freshwater fish was a reservoir of L. hongkongensis. Genotypic typing revealed the possibility of virulent clones of L. hongkongensis. The class C beta-lactamase of L. hongkongensis has been cloned and characterized. SUMMARY In 2001, L. hongkongensis, a novel genus and species, was first discovered in Hong Kong from the blood and empyema pus of a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis. Subsequently, it was isolated from patients in other parts of the world. Recently, this bacterium was found to be associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveller's diarrhoea using cefoperazone MacConkey agar as the selective medium. Further studies, including setting up of animal and tissue culture models and characterization of virulence factors, should be performed. For pathogenic microbes, even one strain of a novel species should be described, so that global concerted efforts can be drawn to look for more cases associated with such a pathogen.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Teng, Jade L L; Yuen, Kwok-yung",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16148528/,514

Thirty days after vaccination, the animals were challenged by nasal instillation of 10(8.2) CCID50 of a virulent BHV-1 strain (Cooper). The vaccinated calves were protected against wildtype virus challenge as demonstrated by clinical evaluation. Most of the vaccinates developed only a mild rhinitis (lasting an average of 6.5 days) with almost no systemic symptoms, whereas the controls developed a serious illness characterized by rhinitis (mean = 11.5 days), conjunctivitis, hyperthermia, apathy, loss of appetite, and dyspnea. The vaccinates also shed significantly less virus and for a shorter period of time (mean = 5.5 days) than the controls (mean = 9 days). Thirty days after vaccination, the vaccinates were negative in an anti-gIII specific blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), despite the fact that most of them had developed neutralizing antibodies (serum neutralization titers ranging from 1:2 to 1:16). Seroconversion to gIII was detected as early as 7 days postinfection (dpi). Fourteen days after the challenge, all the animals exposed to wildtype BHV-1 had developed anti-gIII antibodies and were positive in this differential serologic test. Six controls plus 8 vaccinates kept in isolation were still positive to gIII when tested at 75 dpi. The use of the IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII strain in conjunction with an anti-gIII specific blocking ELISA kit represents a powerful tool for BHV-1 control/eradication programs.","Flores, E F; Osorio, F A; Zanella, E L; Kit, S; Kit, M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8286451/,514

The mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of ribavirin and EICAR have not yet been definitely elucidated, but they seem to be similar. In order to study the mechanisms responsible for their antiviral effects using a photolabeling approach, we have developed photolabeling probes of ribavirin and EICAR, in which an azido group was introduced into the pseudobases of triazole and imidazole, respectively. The ribavirin photoprobes were obtained by directly coupling the azidotriazole to the protected ribose sugar, while the EICAR probe was prepared by diazotizing AICAR and subsequently substituting with NaN3.

194544,Exciting times: towards a totally minimally invasive paediatric urology service.,2011,"Dear Editor, The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and remains a global challenge. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Even though the COVID-19 vaccine has become available since December 2020, the main preventive measures still include social distancing, hand washing, and the use of protective face masks. By May 22, 2021, 3,437,545 deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been registered by WHO, confirming the burden of this disease (1). Consequently, the pandemic has become a challenge for health care systems, as they had to be focused on the care of patients with COVID-19. During the first lockdown from March to May 2020, it was advised to postpone clinical visits whenever this could be done without risk. This recommendation was mainly aimed at older patients and those with chronic diseases, as it has been shown that they are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19. Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are at a greater risk for infections and different cancers due to their permanent immunosuppressive therapy. The most common malignancies in RTRs are skin cancers, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers. It has been estimated that RTRs have a 65-250 times higher risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 10 times higher risk for basal cell carcinoma, and 2-5 times higher risk for melanoma when compared with the general population (2-4). RTRs are at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19, not only because of their immunosuppressive therapy but also because of different comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (5). Therefore, RTRs tend to limit their medical visits and postpone clinical examinations for skin cancer screenings. Moreover, during clinical visits the patients are commonly asked to keep their protective masks on, increasing the risk of overlooking their facial skin changes. Herein we present two RTRs who developed skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the tumors were diagnosed with a significant delay. Patient 1 A 67-year-old woman with unknown primary kidney disease received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2014. The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In January 2020, she had noticed a reddish squamous lesion on her right cheek, which enlarged slowly. Since there were no other symptoms, she postponed the dermatologic examination. Additionally, she further postponed the visit to her physician during the pandemic as she wanted to avoid social contact as much as possible. One year later, at the nephrologist's examination, she was asked to take off her face mask for a skin check, and two skin tumors on her right cheek were noticed (Figure 1). One lesion was located at the angle of her mandible and presented as a hypertrophic, sharply marginated lesion with central crusting and a diameter of 2 cm. The other lesion was at the right zygomatic region and appeared as a scaly, erythematous lesion with a diameter of 7 mm. The patient was referred to a dermatologist, and a biopsy of both lesions was indicated. The pathohistological analysis revealed cutaneous SCC in situ for the mandibular lesion and actinic keratosis for the zygomatic lesion. SCC in situ has been excised, and actinic keratosis was treated by cryosurgery. Patient 2 A 66-year-old woman received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2010 due to chronic glomerulonephritis without biopsy. The immunosuppressive protocol included basiliximab induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In June 2020, an erosion occurred at her left infraocular area and did not heal but instead gradually enlarged. The patient suspected that the ""wound"" developed due to the friction from the rim of her eyeglasses. Six months later, the nephrologist noticed the erosion which was 10×5 mm in size with a slightly elevated, pearl-colored margin (Figure 2). The patient was referred to a dermatologist who indicated tumor excision due to suspected basal cell carcinoma. The pathohistological analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis. DISCUSSION Both presented patients did not inform their family physicians about their skin changes because they avoided all non-nephrological medical visits during the pandemic. The additional reason for the diagnostic delay was the fact that they kept the masks on their faces during most examinations, with the skin lesions behind the mask consequently remaining unnoticed. The problem of diagnostic delay of skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized by several studies. Canadian authors compared the number of biopsies for skin cancers during the first 15 weeks in 2020 and during the same period in 2019. They found a decrease in the number of biopsies for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and melanoma of 18% and 27%, respectively (6). A multicenter study performed in northern-central Italy showed that the number of skin cancer (NMSC and melanoma) diagnoses fell by 56.7% in weeks 11 to 20 of 2020 compared with the average number noted in the same periods of 2018 and 2019 (7). Furthermore, a single-center retrospective study in Italy demonstrated that the number of advanced skin cancers surgically treated between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher than in the same period in 2019. These findings led the authors to conclude that the surgical excisions were postponed due to the delay in follow-ups, which resulted in increased incidence of advanced skin cancers (8). RTRs are at particular risk of severe consequences from diagnostic delay with regard to skin cancers. Namely, skin cancers in RTRs are more aggressive and are associated with a higher incidence rate of metastases and recurrences than in the general population (9). Therefore, RTRs should be advised to regularly check their skin for potential skin cancer, which includes self-examinations and dermatologic follow-ups.","Mokos, Mislav; Bašić-Jukić, Nikolina",Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477079/,514

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes and complications of simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS. Methods: We performed a preliminary case series of 4 patients with synchronous upper urinary tract (UUT) tumor and invasive bladder cancer who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS between 2014 and 2017 at our hospital. Demographic data, pathologic features, the surgical technique, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Result: All 4 patients were men whose median age was 79 years (range 65-85 years) and median body mass index was 24.2 kg/m2 (range 21.5-27.3 kg/m2). The laparoscopic approach was technically successful in all 4 patients without the need for open conversion. The median total operative time was 434 minutes (range 372-481 minutes). The median estimated blood loss was 773 ml (range 153-923 ml), median interval to resuming oral intake was 2 days (range 1-7 days), and median hospital stay was 16 days (range 13-20 days). Conclusion: The reduced port approach is technically feasible in terms of many outcome measures, with significant cosmetic advantages. This method can be performed safely and recommended as a viable option for patients with concomitant UUT and bladder cancer.","Tanaka, Yutaro; Okamura, Takehiko; Chaya, Ryosuke; Nagai, Takashi; Kobayashi, Daichi; Kobayashi, Takahiro; Akita, Hidetoshi; Yasui, Takahiro",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583675/,514

The lack of knowledge regarding the transmission mechanisms and the potential risks for the mother and the newborn, even when the vertical transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated, has led to the abandonment of practices such as skin-to-skin and the early initiation of breastfeeding (BF), which offer great benefits for maternal and child health. Taking into account the available scientific evidence and the protective effect of BF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other organisms recommend, in cases of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mother, maintaining mother-child contact and BF, adopting preventive measure procedures to minimize the risk of contagion. These measures include hand hygiene, before and after contact with the newborn and the use of a mask. If a temporary separation of mother and child is required, it is recommended to feed the newborn with expressed breast milk. The presence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in the milk of infected women, so BF could reduce the clinical impact of the disease in the infant, if it becomes infected.","Lalaguna Mallada, Paula; Díaz-Gómez, N Marta; Costa Romero, Marta; San Feliciano Martín, Laura; Gabarrell Guiu, Carme",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643708/,514

This mini-review aims to provide a summary of available studies on exocrine pancreas involvement during COVID-19 infection. A search through MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted on the topic in hand. With regard to exocrine function, some studies highlight the presence of an associated hyperenzymemia (hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia), while others describe isolated and rare cases of acute pancreatitis. More attention should be paid to pancreatic impairment in subjects with COVID-19, as this may prove to be one of the elements aggravating its clinical course. Indeed, acute pancreatitis, especially when presenting in severe forms with hyperstimulation of the pro-inflammatory response, may represent a crucial factor in the progression of COVID-19, entailing both an increase in hospitalization days and in mortality rate.","Zippi, Maddalena; Hong, Wandong; Traversa, Giampiero; Maccioni, Francesca; De Biase, Dario; Gallo, Claudio; Fiorino, Sirio",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257624/,514
196599,Critical care triaging in the shadow of COVID-19: Ethics considerations.,2020-04-16,"Positive-strand RNA viruses are the largest virus class and include many pathogens such as hepatitis C virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a representative positive-strand RNA virus whose RNA replication, gene expression, and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using traditional yeast genetics, host genes have been identified that function in controlling BMV translation, selecting BMV RNAs as replication templates, activating the replication complex, maintaining a lipid composition required for membrane-associated RNA replication, and other steps. To more globally and systematically identify such host factors, we used engineered BMV derivatives to assay viral RNA replication in each strain of an ordered, genome-wide set of yeast single-gene deletion mutants. Each deletion strain was transformed to express BMV replicase proteins and a BMV RNA replication template with the capsid gene replaced by a luciferase reporter. Luciferase expression, which is dependent on viral RNA replication and RNA-dependent mRNA synthesis, was measured in intact yeast cells. Approximately 4500 yeast deletion strains ( approximately 80% of yeast genes) were screened in duplicate and selected strains analyzed further. This functional genomics approach revealed nearly 100 genes whose absence inhibited or stimulated BMV RNA replication and/or gene expression by 3- to >25-fold. Several of these genes were shown previously to function in BMV replication, validating the approach. Newly identified genes include some in RNA, protein, or membrane modification pathways and genes of unknown function. The results further illuminate virus and cell pathways. Further refinement of virus screening likely will reveal contributions from additional host genes.","Kushner, David B; Lindenbach, Brett D; Grdzelishvili, Valery Z; Noueiry, Amine O; Paul, Scott M; Ahlquist, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671320/,514
196630,[A new Spanish enemy; the Spanish flu in the Netherlands in the period 1918-1920].,2020-08-13,"The reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case, is a crucial quantity for identifying the intensity of interventions required to control an epidemic. Current estimates of the reproduction number for seasonal influenza show wide variation and, in particular, uncertainty bounds for R for the pandemic strain from 1918 to 1919 have been obtained only in a few recent studies and are yet to be fully clarified. Here, we estimate R using daily case notifications during the autumn wave of the influenza pandemic (Spanish flu) in the city of San Francisco, California, from 1918 to 1919. In order to elucidate the effects from adopting different estimation approaches, four different methods are used: estimation of R using the early exponential-growth rate (Method 1), a simple susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (Method 2), a more complex SEIR-type model that accounts for asymptomatic and hospitalized cases (Method 3), and a stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) with Bayesian estimation (Method 4) that determines the effective reproduction number Rt at a given time t. The first three methods fit the initial exponential-growth phase of the epidemic, which was explicitly determined by the goodness-of-fit test. Moreover, Method 3 was also fitted to the whole epidemic curve. Whereas the values of R obtained using the first three methods based on the initial growth phase were estimated to be 2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.73, 3.25), 2.38 (2.16, 2.60) and 2.20 (1.55, 2.84), the third method with the entire epidemic curve yielded a value of 3.53 (3.45, 3.62). This larger value could be an overestimate since the goodness-of-fit to the initial exponential phase worsened when we fitted the model to the entire epidemic curve, and because the model is established as an autonomous system without time-varying assumptions. These estimates were shown to be robust to parameter uncertainties, but the theoretical exponential-growth approximation (Method 1) shows wide uncertainty. Method 4 provided a maximum-likelihood effective reproduction number 2.10 (1.21, 2.95) using the first 17 epidemic days, which is consistent with estimates obtained from the other methods and an estimate of 2.36 (2.07, 2.65) for the entire autumn wave. We conclude that the reproduction number for pandemic influenza (Spanish flu) at the city level can be robustly assessed to lie in the range of 2.0-3.0, in broad agreement with previous estimates using distinct data.","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Bettencourt, Luís M A","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17254982/,514

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of AKI with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS In this cohort study, we reviewed electronic medical data from patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen from January 11 to February 19, 2020. Clinical features and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI were analyzed. Further, we evaluated the association between AKI development and clinical outcomes. RESULTS In this study, 9.6% patients developed AKI during hospitalization. Those with AKI presented older age, severer pneumonia, more comorbidity and lower lymphocyte count. Totally, more patients (77.5%) had primary composite outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and mechanical ventilation) in AKI group compared to non-AKI group (2.9%) during the observation period. The median length of stay (LOS) and ICU stay were longer among those with AKI. After adjusted for related covariates, AKI development was independently correlated with LOS (β (95% CI): 9.16 (3.87-14.46)), rather than primary outcomes (HR (95% CI): 1.34 (0.56-3.21)) in COVID-19 patients.

198271,[Air pollution: a determinant for COVID-19?],2020-05-28,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory virus that has affected millions of people worldwide in the span of months. The burden of disease among healthcare workers (HCW) has not been well studied despite reports of infectivity and transmission around the world. Two HCW in Hospital Teluk Intan (HTI) contracted COVID-19 while attending a social event. They were in close proximity with colleagues upon returning to work, resulting in the spread of infection among other HCW in HTI. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this paper are to gain a better understanding of the key presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in HCWs in a district specialist hospital, to establish the proportion of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among HCWs and its severity and to determine the time taken from onset of symptoms or perceived exposure to diagnostic testing. METHODOLOGY This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics of subjects infected with COVID-19 among HCW in HTI. Their demography and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS There were 47 HCW in HTI who tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.5 years old. 7 patients (15.2%) had at least more than one comorbidity. Average duration of time from perceived close contact to onset of symptom was 4.5 days, while the mean duration of time from symptoms to first positive RT-PCR result was 3.4 days. Six patients (13.0%) were asymptomatic throughout, whereas 40 (87.0%) had at least one symptom prior to hospitalization. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever (65.2%), sore throat (39.1%) and cough (37.0%). In terms of severity of symptoms, the majority of patients experienced mild symptoms (Group 2, 52.2%). Two patients (4.3%) with multiple comorbidities had severe disease requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. There were no mortalities, and the longest staying patient was hospitalized for 18 days. The high rates of infectivity among HCW in HTI can be attributed to working in close proximity while in the asymptomatic incubation phase, while no HCW directly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients were tested positive. CONCLUSION We report that HCW share similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as those of non HCW patients in earlier studies. The infection can spread rapidly within healthcare settings via close contacts among infected HCWs. As such, we advocate distancing when working and usage of personal protective equipment when treating patients with respiratory illness to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Tan-Loh, J; Cheong, B M K",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33510104/,514

The variability of S2 genes and S2 proteins from 12 strains isolated in the early, intermediate and advanced stages of the SARS outbreak were analyzed and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with Lasergene, Clustal X, DNAman and Treeview. T cell antigen epitopes of S2 protein were predicted on the basis of Internet database. RESULT With the epidemic spread of SARS-CoV, the S2 genes of the virus tended to become stable. Homology of S2 genes of SARS-CoV isolated in advanced stage of the outbreak reached 99.9%. Prediction of T cell antigen epitope showed that mutation at the 57th amino acid effected T cell antigen epitope.

METHODS A database of all SARS cases in Beijing in 2003 was established and the data of 1291 cases whose data were complete among them was analyzed. The effects of cerebrocardiovascular diseases, other comorbid diseases and absence of underlying diseases on the incidence of critical conditions and MODS in SARS cases were compared with chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The incidence rates of critical conditions and MODS in SARS cases were 34.86% and 13.71% respectively. The incidence rates of critical conditions and MODS among the SARS cases without underlying diseases, with other comorbid diseases, and with cerebrocardiovascular diseases were 28.10%, 43.70%, and 58.18%, and 9.83%, 18.52%, and 27.27% respectively. The differences among the three groups were all statistically significant (all P < 0.0001).

This is a prospective single-center study including 16 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. All were dialyzed using a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) filter. Interleukin-6 levels were obtained before and after the first admission hemodialysis session and at 1 week. Baseline comorbidities, laboratory values, chest X-ray, and treatments were recorded and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Out of 16 patients (13 males, mean age 72 ± 15 years), 4 (25%) died. Factors associated with mortality were dialysis vintage (P = 0.01), chest X-ray infiltrates (P = 0.032), serum C-reactive protein (P = 0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.02) at 1 week, oxygen therapy requirement (P = 0.02) and anticoagulation (P < 0.01).

206244,Rapid Development of a Tool for Prioritizing Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 for Intensive Care,2021,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) mortality is higher in patients with cancer than in the general population, yet the cancer-associated risk factors for COVID-19 adverse outcomes are not fully characterized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical characteristics and outcomes from patients with cancer and concurrent COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until March 31, 2020 (n = 309), and observed clinical end points until April 13, 2020. We hypothesized that cytotoxic chemotherapy administered within 35 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of severe or critical COVID-19. In secondary analyses, we estimated associations between specific clinical and laboratory variables and the incidence of a severe or critical COVID-19 event. RESULTS: Cytotoxic chemotherapy administration was not significantly associated with a severe or critical COVID-19 event (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.60). Hematologic malignancy was associated with increased COVID-19 severity (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.80). Patients with lung cancer also demonstrated higher rates of severe or critical COVID-19 events (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.30). Lymphopenia at COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe or critical illness (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.50 to 3.10). Patients with baseline neutropenia 14-90 days before COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcomes (HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.70 to 11.00). Findings from these analyses remained consistent in a multivariable model and in multiple sensitivity analyses. The rate of adverse events was lower in a time-matched population of patients with cancer without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Recent cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment was not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Patients with active hematologic or lung malignancies, peri-COVID-19 lymphopenia, or baseline neutropenia had worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interactions among antineoplastic therapy, cancer type, and COVID-19 are complex and warrant further investigation.","Jee, Justin; Foote, Michael B; Lumish, Melissa; Stonestrom, Aaron J; Wills, Beatriz; Narendra, Varun; Avutu, Viswatej; Murciano-Goroff, Yonina R; Chan, Jason E; Derkach, Andriy; Philip, John; Belenkaya, Rimma; Kerpelev, Marina; Maloy, Molly; Watson, Adam; Fong, Chris; Janjigian, Yelena; Diaz, Luis A; Bolton, Kelly L; Pessin, Melissa S",J Clin Oncol,,514
206886,Trust me - I'm a millennial GP,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacteria mediated gemcitabine resistance in pre-clinical models. We determined if intratumoural lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detection by immunohistochemistry is associated with outcome in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treated with gemcitabine and non-gemcitabine containing 1st-line chemotherapy. METHODS: We examined LPS on tumour tissue from 130 patients treated within the randomised AIO-PK0104 trial and a validation cohort (n = 113) and analysed the association of LPS detection to patient outcome according to treatment subgroups. RESULTS: In 24% of samples from the AIO-PK0104 study LPS was detected; in LPS-positive patients median OS was 4.4 months, compared to 7.3 months with LPS negative tumours (HR 1.732, p = 0.010). A difference in OS was detected in 1st-line gemcitabine-treated patients (n = 71; HR 2.377, p = 0.002), but not in the non-gemcitabine treatment subgroup (n = 59; HR 1.275, p = 0.478). Within the validation cohort, the LPS positivity rate was 23%, and LPS detection was correlated with impaired OS in the gemcitabine subgroup (n = 94; HR 1.993, p = 0.008) whereas no difference in OS was observed in the non-gemcitabine subgroup (n = 19; HR 2.596, p = 0.219). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of intratumoural LPS as surrogate marker for gram-negative bacterial colonisation may serve as a negative predictor for gemcitabine efficacy in advanced PDAC.

207443,OncoNet: Weakly Supervised Siamese Network to automate cancer treatment response assessment between longitudinal FDG PET/CT examinations,2021-08-03,"Thiol-disulphide homeostasis (TDH) is a new parameter indicating oxidative stress that plays a role in the pathogenesis of various clinical disorders. Our study planned to investigate TDH in COVID-19 patients. Age and gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 70) and COVID-19 patients (n = 144) were included in the study. In addition to the routine laboratory parameters of the groups, their native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT) and disulphide levels were measured. Primarily, we compared COVID-19 patients to the healthy control group for inflammatory parameters, NT, TT and disulphide levels. Then, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of the disease as mild to moderate and severe COVID-19, and the three groups were compared with each other. Predictive value of thiol parameters in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in the determining its severity, and its correlation with presence and duration of symptoms were investigated. Severe COVID-19 patients had lower NT and TT levels compared with healthy controls and mild to moderate patients (P < 0.001 for both). The results of ROC analysis show that the greatest AUC was IL-6 and NT (AUC = 0.97, AUC = 0.96, respectively) between control and COVID-19 patients, while it was CRP and NT (AUC = 0.85, AUC = 0.83) between mild to moderate and severe patients. A negative correlation was found between duration of symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, fever, and sore throat and NT (r = -0.45, P = 0.017, r = -0.418, P < 0.001, r = -0.131, P = 0.084, r = -0.452, P = 0.040, respectively). NT and TT levels have a strong predictive value in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in determining disease severity. Our results support that changing TDH parameters appears to have an important role in disease pathogenesis and it can be used in clinical management of patients.","Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Neselioglu, Salim; Eser, Fatma; Hasanoglu, Imran; Aypak, Adalet; Akinci, Esragul; Akca, H Nisa; Erel, Ozcan; Guner, Rahmet",Free Radic Biol Med,,514

Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts using anterior nasal (AN) swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for clinical testing. Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (&#8804;18 years of age) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess interoperator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone, and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Of 2,482 participants, 1,380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. In this study, 974/1,380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0 to 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms and 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1 to 95.6) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 94.5 to 100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (95% CI, 56.6 to 81.6) and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.9 to 99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children, they were 65.4% (95% CI, 55.6 to 74.4) and 99.0% (95% CI, 98.0 to 99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (CT ) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n = 292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with CT values of &#8804;25, 95.8% with CT values of &#8804;30, and 81.2% with CT values of &#8804;35. Twelve false-positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2,308 tests) were observed; in all 12, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Interoperator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2,230/2,230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms &#8804;7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer's recommended range (46 to 58.5°F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%. BinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with CT values of &#8804;30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for &#8804;7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent interoperator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour. Careful attention to temperature is critical.","Pollock, Nira R; Jacobs, Jesica R; Tran, Kristine; Cranston, Amber E; Smith, Sita; O039,; Kane, Claire Y; Roady, Tyler J; Moran, Anne; Scarry, Alison; Carroll, Melissa; Volinsky, Leila; Perez, Gloria; Patel, Pinal; Gabriel, Stacey; Lennon, Niall J; Madoff, Lawrence C; Brown, Catherine; Smole, Sandra C",J. clin. microbiol,,514

228030,Learning from Covid,2020,"The deadly coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, and mathematical models can be used to show suspected, recovered, and deceased coronavirus patients, as well as how many people have been tested. Researchers still do not know definitively whether surviving a COVID-19 infection means you gain long-lasting immunity and, if so, for how long? In order to understand, we think that this study may lead to better guessing the spread of this pandemic in future. We develop a mathematical model to present the dynamical behavior of COVID-19 infection by incorporating isolation class. First, the formulation of model is proposed; then, positivity of the model is discussed. The local stability and global stability of proposed model are presented, which depended on the basic reproductive. For the numerical solution of the proposed model, the nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme and Runge-Kutta fourth order method are used. Finally, some graphical results are presented. Our findings show that human to human contact is the potential cause of outbreaks of COVID-19. Therefore, isolation of the infected human overall can reduce the risk of future COVID-19 spread.","Zeb, Anwar; Alzahrani, Ebraheem; Erturk, Vedat Suat; Zaman, Gul",Biomed Res Int,,514

Among 515 individuals with Covid-19 from Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) and the Korean Clonal Hematopoiesis (KoCH) consortia, we found that CH was associated with severe Covid-19 outcomes (OR=1.9, 95%=1.2-2.9, p=0.01). We further explored the relationship between CH and risk of other infections in 14,211 solid tumor patients at MSK. CH was significantly associated with risk of Clostridium Difficile (HR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.3, p=6×10 -3 ) and Streptococcus/Enterococcus infections (HR=1.5, 95% CI=1.1-2.1, p=5×10 -3 ).

Data were derived from a large US-based case series of patients with COVID-19, captured from a quaternary academic health network covering New York City and Long Island. From March 2 to May 24, 2020, 11,512 patients who were hospitalized were tested for COVID-19, with 4,446 (38.62%) receiving a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Among those who tested positive, 959 (21.57%) died of COVID-19-related complications at the hospital. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling showed mortality risks were strongly associated with greater age (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.05), ethnic minority (Asians, Non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics) (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44), low household income (HR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.49), and male sex (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.97).

The objectives of the study were to know how rhythmic gymnastics training developed during the lockdown period (the conditions, type of training, performance monitoring means, and determinants of gymnasts' participation) and to provide recommendations for a possible future lockdown. Three hundred and two RG coaches from twenty-six different countries throughout the five continents and four professional levels took part in the study: national team (28), international (26), national (172) and regional (75). The data collection tool was a questionnaire consisting of 39 closed questions structured in three dimensions: identification data of the coaches, training data during confinement and gymnast participation data. The independent variable was the gymnasts' performance levels and the dependent variables organized in four categories: the technical media used to conduct and monitor the training sessions, the type of training done, the mechanisms for monitoring training performance and the aspects that determined participation. Most coaches kept their gymnasts training during confinement, although 76.5% confirm abandonment of any of their gymnasts. The main means used were real-time video conferencing, although at the lower practice levels the media stand out in deferred time. The contents of the training were mainly body technique, physical preparation and body difficulties. For performance monitoring, challenges, physical, and technical tests were predominant.

The allograft injury has various histopathological manifestations. Our case illustrates the unusual combination of allograft rejection, acute kidney injury secondary to oxalate nephropathy and SARS CoV-2 nephropathy as the cause of irreversible allograft failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year old renal allograft recipient presented with a history of fever and diarrhoea for the preceding 4 weeks, tested positive for Sars-CoV2 on nasal swab and was found to have severe allograft dysfunction, necessitating haemodialysis. He subsequently underwent an allograft biopsy, which demonstrated antibody mediated rejection along with the presence of extensive oxalate deposition in the tubules. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated spherical spiked particles in the glomerular capillary endothelium and the presence of tubulo-reticular inclusions suggestive of an active COVID-19 infection within the kidney. The intra-tubular oxalate deposition was considered to be the result of high dose, supplemental Vitamin C used as an immune booster in many patients with COVID - 19 infection in India. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complex pathology that may be seen in following COVID-19 disease and the need for kidney biopsies in these patients to better understand the aetiology of disease.","Anandh, Urmila; Gowrishankar, Swarnalata; Sharma, Alok; Salama, Alan; Dasgupta, Indranil",BMC Nephrol,,514

In particular, we analyze the datasets of regional infected cases, derive the growth rates for regions characterized by a readable exponential growth phase in their evolution spread curve and plot them against the environmental temperatures averaged within the same regions, derive the relationship between temperature and growth rate, and evaluate its statistical confidence. The results clearly support the first reported statistically significant relationship of negative correlation between the average environmental temperature and exponential growth rates of the infected cases.

238471,A tale of two epidemics: France and the UK,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a complex challenge for medical staff within emergency departments (ED) of hospitals at all care levels. Beside regular emergency care, rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 cases are obligatory for prevention of internal viral transmission and efficient medical staff protection. METHODS: In this study a model of risk stratification for suspected SARS-CoV­2 and COVID-19 cases was developed on the basis of epidemiologic criteria of the Robert-Koch Institute including five risk categories (RC). The model was implemented in a hospital of basic and regular care level. By combination of risk categories with specific isolation, hygienic and personal protection procedures all areas of the ED were restructured. In a retrospective study all inpatient cases (nâ¯= 491) were re-evaluated during a 4-week interval (26 March-26 April 2020). RESULTS: In the study population 25 SARS-CoV­2 positive cases (5.2%) were identified. These cases were categorized according to the risk stratification model as follows: RC I-confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infection 36% (nâ¯= 9), RC II-reasonable suspected cases 32% (nâ¯= 8), RC III-differential diagnostic cases 12% (nâ¯= 3), RC IV-low probability 8% (nâ¯= 2) and RC V-no evidence 12% (nâ¯= 3). No viral transmission was detected during the whole period within medical staff and patients of the ED. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of COVID-19 risk categories within the ED permits central control of important hygienic processes with respect to SARS-CoV­2 infection probability. By continuous re-evaluation of case definitions local outbreaks can be used to adapt criteria within the risk categories. Risk stratification of COVID-19 cases allows for a strict separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 emergencies and thus ensures effective infection prevention of medical staff and patients.","Wieckenberg, M; Meier, V; Pfeiffer, S; Blaschke, S",Med.

Digital divide is any uneven distribution in Information and Communications Technologies between people. AIMS: The purpose of this work was to describe the digital divide of a population of patients with dementia contacted by telemedicine during Italian lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: One hundred eight patients with cognitive impairment were contacted by video call to perform a telemedicine neurological evaluation. Information on patients and caregivers attending the televisit were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients connected with neurologist (successful televisit, 68.5%) and 34 patients were not able to perform televisit and were contacted by phone (failed televisit, 31.5%). No significant differences were observed among the two groups concerning age, gender, and education, but the prevalence of successful televisit was higher in the presence of younger caregivers: televisits performed in the presence of subjects of younger generation (sons and grandsons) had a successful rate higher (86% successful, 14% failed) than the group without younger generation caregiver (49% successful, 51% failed). This difference is mainly due to the ability of technological use among younger people. DISCUSSION: The most impacting factors on digital divide in our population are the social support networks and the experience with the technology: the presence of a digital native caregiver. The COVID-19 pandemic is unmasking an emerging form of technology-related social inequalities: political and community interventions are needed to support the most socially vulnerable population and prevent social health inequalities.","Arighi, Andrea; Fumagalli, Giorgio Giulio; Carandini, Tiziana; Pietroboni, Anna Margherita; De Riz, Milena Alessandra; Galimberti, Daniela; Scarpini, Elio",Neurol. sci,,514

Unfortunately, kidney transplant recipients are a high-risk group during the disease course, and scientific data are still limited in this patient group. Beyond the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, pharmacological immunosuppression may also alter the infection response in the COVID-19 course. The effects of immunosuppressive agents on the development and process of infection should not be decided only by determining how potent they are and how much they suppress the immune system; it is also thought that the direct effect of the virus, increased oxidative stress, and cytokine storm play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. There are data about immunosuppressive drugs like calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) therapy related to their beneficial effects during any infection course. Limited data suggest that the use of CNI or mTORi may have beneficial effects on the process. In this hypothetical review, the probable impacts of CNI and mTORi on the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 were investigated.","Hasbal, Nuri Baris; Turgut, Didem; Gok Oguz, Ebru; Ulu, Sena; Gungor, Ozkan",Ann Transplant,,514

The present meta-analysis was conducted to gain clarity regarding AKI incidence and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases were systematically searched for COVID-19-related case reports published through 25 July 2020. Pooled analyses were conducted using R. RESULTS: The pooled incidence of AKI in 51 studies including 21,531 patients was 12.3% (95% CI 9.5-15.6%), with higher rates of 38.9% in 290 transplant patients (95% CI 27.3-51.9%), 39.0% in 565 ICU patients (95% CI 23.2-57.6%) and 42.0% among 1745 deceased patients (95% CI 30.3-54.7%). RRT usage was reported in 39 studies of 17,664 patients, with an overall pooled use of 5.4% (95% CI 4.0-7.1%), with higher rates of 15.6% in 117 transplant patients (95%CI 9.9-23.8%) and 16.3% in 776 ICU patients (95% CI 11.1-23.3%). CONCLUSION: AKI and RRT use among COVID-19 patients represent a major public health concern, and early and appropriate intervention should be called upon to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from AKI.","Yang, Xiaopeng; Tian, Shasha; Guo, Hui",Int Immunopharmacol,,514

Clinical outcomes in sepsis depend on timely diagnosis and appropriate early therapeutic intervention. There is a growing interest in the evaluation of nanotechnology-based solutions for sepsis management due to the inherent and unique properties of these nano-sized systems. This review presents recent advancements in nanotechnology-based solutions for sepsis diagnosis and management. Development of nanosensors based on electrochemical, immunological or magnetic principals provide highly sensitive, selective and rapid detection of sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein and are reviewed extensively. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery of antibiotics in sepsis models have shown promising results in combating drug resistance. Surface functionalization with antimicrobial peptides further enhances efficacy by targeting pathogens or specific microenvironments. Various strategies in nanoformulations have demonstrated the ability to deliver antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents, simultaneously, have been reviewed. The critical role of nanoformulations of other adjuvant therapies including antioxidant, antitoxins and extracorporeal blood purification in sepsis management are also highlighted. Nanodiagnostics and nanotherapeutics in sepsis have enormous potential and provide new perspectives in sepsis management, supported by promising future biomedical applications included in the review.","Pant, Amit; Mackraj, Irene; Govender, Thirumala",J Biomed Sci,,514

Furthermore, due to amplified global connection and speedy modernization, epidemic outbreaks caused by novel and re­emergingviruses signify potential risk to community health. Despite, great advancements in immunization and drug discovery processes, still various viruses lack prophylactic vaccines and efficient antiviral therapies. Although, vaccine is prophylaxes option, but it can be not applied to infected patients, hence therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to control the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic condition. To spot the novel antiviral therapy is of decisive importance and Mother Nature is an excellent source for such discoveries.

260825,Impact of COVID-19 on Nuclear Medicine Departments in Africa and Latin America,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although a positive association has been established, it is unclear whether lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause chronic wheezing illnesses. If RSV-LRTI were causal, we would expect RSV-LRTI prevention to reduce the incidence of chronic wheezing illnesses in addition to reducing acute disease. We aimed to evaluate the strength of evidence for a causal effect of RSV-LRTI on subsequent chronic wheezing illness to inform public health expectations for RSV vaccines. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the association between RSV-LRTI and subsequent wheezing illness (exposure studies) and studies evaluating the association between RSV immunoprophylaxis and subsequent wheezing illness (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies were included if the exposure group members had an LRTI with laboratory-confirmed RSV and if the exposure ascertainment period began before 2 years of age and ended before 5 years of age. We required a wash-out period of more than 30 days between the index RSV-LRTI and the outcome measurement to allow for resolution of the acute illness. Comparisons between RSV-LRTI and non-RSV-LRTI were not included. Immunoprophylaxis studies were included if they measured the association with subsequent wheezing illness relative to a control group, either in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or an observational design. For the immunoprophylaxis drugs in question, we required evidence of efficacy in targeting RSV-LRTI from at least one RCT to ensure biological plausibility. All variations of wheezing illness were combined into a single outcome that refers broadly to asthma or any other respiratory illness with wheezing symptoms. Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from inception up to Aug 28, 2018. We evaluated whether data from exposure studies could provide evidence against the most viable non-causal theory that RSV-LRTI is a marker of respiratory illness susceptibility rather than a causal factor. Additionally, we tested whether RSV immunoprophylaxis reduces the odds of subsequent wheezing illnesses. We used a random-effects modelling framework and, to accommodate studies providing multiple correlated estimates, robust variance estimation meta-regressions. Meta-regression coefficients (b) quantify differences between exposure and comparator groups on the loge odds ratio (loge OR) scale. FINDINGS: From 14â235 records we identified 57 eligible articles that described 42 studies and provided 153 effect estimates. 35 studies estimated the direct effect of RSV-LRTI on wheezing illnesses (exposure studies) and eight evaluated the effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies that adjusted for genetic influences yielded a smaller mean adjusted OR estimate (aOR+ 2·45, 95% CI 1·23-4·88) compared with those that did not (4·17, 2·36-7·37), a significant difference (b 0·53, 95% CI 0·04-1·02). Infants who were not protected with RSV immunoprophylaxis tended to have higher odds of subsequent wheezing illness, as we would expect if RSV-LRTI were causal, but the effect was not significant (OR+ 1·21, 95% CI 0·73-1·99). There was generally a high threat of confounding bias in the observational studies. Additionally, in both the observational studies and immunoprophylaxis RCTs, there was high risk of bias due to missing outcome data. INTERPRETATION: Our findings, limited to exposure and immunoprophylaxis studies, do not support basing policy decisions on an assumption that prevention of RSV-LRTI will reduce recurrent chronic wheezing illnesses.

A conversation analysis of participation in online reflection sessions for general practitioners in training,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, with 10%-20% of severe cases and over 508 000 deaths worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from ""nonsevere"" toward ""nonsurvived"" via ""severe and survived"" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients.","Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Tan, Ge; Dong, Xiang; Wang, Bin-Chen; Lin, Jun; Yan, You-Qin; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Mübeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,,514
272783,Domestic abuse in the time of coronavirus,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes one of the largest threats in recent decades to the health and economic welfare of populations globally. In this paper, we analyze different types of policy measures designed to fight the spread of the virus and minimize economic losses. Our analysis builds on a multi-group SEIR model, which extends the multi-group SIR model introduced by Acemoglu et al.~(2020). We adjust the underlying social interaction patterns and consider an extended set of policy measures. The model is calibrated for Germany. Despite the trade-off between COVID-19 prevention and economic activity that is inherent to shielding policies, our results show that efficiency gains can be achieved by targeting such policies towards different age groups. Alternative policies such as physical distancing can be employed to reduce the degree of targeting and the intensity and duration of shielding. Our results show that a comprehensive approach that combines multiple policy measures simultaneously can effectively mitigate population mortality and economic harm.","Bach, Philipp; Chernozhukov, Victor; Spindler, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01092v1.pdf,514

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence of the clinical presentations suggestive for COVID-19 infection among patients with Multiple Sclerosis in the province of Lecco, in the North Italy, the closest province capital to Bergamo. To describe the association of demographics, clinical characteristics, and use of DMTs categories with the risk of contracting the disease. METHODS: We telephonically interviewed all the 275 MS patients followed in the MS center. The collected data included recent contact with a patient with COVID-19 diagnosis or a subject with respiratory symptoms and the developing of COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed diagnosis. RESULTS: 15 out of 275 patients reported symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 infection, only one of them with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. No one of them presented severe symptoms or needed hospitalization. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, the only factor associated with being in the COVID-suspect group was the report of a recent contact with a patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 within MS patients seems to resemble the prevalence in general population. The lack of associations with other factors assessed, including DMTs, may reflect a lack of statistical power. Larger population studies are needed to explore the correlation between different disease-modifying therapies and COVID-19 course.","Mantero, Vittorio; Abate, Lucia; Balgera, Roberto; Basilico, Paola; Salmaggi, Andrea; Cordano, Christian",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,514
276801,An interactive website tracking COVID-19 vaccine development,2021,"General anaesthesia is known to achieve the shortest decision-to-delivery interval for category-1 caesarean section. We investigated whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the decision-to delivery interval and influenced neonatal outcomes in patients who underwent category-1 caesarean section. Records of 562 patients who underwent emergency caesarean section between 1 April 2019 and 1 July 2019 in seven UK hospitals (pre-COVID-19 group) were compared with 577 emergency caesarean sections performed during the same period during the COVID-19 pandemic (1 April 2020-1 July 2020) (post-COVID-19 group). Primary outcome measures were: decision-to-delivery interval; number of caesarean sections achieving decision-to-delivery interval < 30 min; and a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes (Apgar 5-min score < 7, umbilical arterial pH < 7.10, neonatal intensive care unit admission and stillbirth). The use of general anaesthesia decreased significantly between the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups (risk ratio 0.48 (95%CI 0.37-0.62); p < 0.0001). Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group, the post-COVID-19 group had an increase in median (IQR [range]) decision-to-delivery interval (26 (18-32 [4-124]) min vs. 27 (20-33 [3-102]) min; p = 0.043) and a decrease in the number of caesarean sections meeting the decision-to-delivery interval target of < 30 min (374/562 (66.5%) vs. 349/577 (60.5%); p = 0.02). The incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes was similar in the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups (140/568 (24.6%) vs. 140/583 (24.0%), respectively; p = 0.85). The small increase in decision-to-delivery interval observed during the COVID-19 pandemic did not adversely affect neonatal outcomes.","Bhatia, K; Columb, M; Bewlay, A; Tageldin, N; Knapp, C; Qamar, Y; Dooley, A; Kamath, P; Hulgur, M",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,514

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root-transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (-0.23, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.08; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02). Change in sleep quality was similar between the two groups.

282156,Health inequality and COVID-19: the culmination of two centuries of social murder,2020,"In S. aureus biofilms, bacteria are embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and are highly tolerant to antimicrobial drugs. We thus sought to identify non-antibiotic substances with broad-spectrum activity able to destroy the EPS matrix and enhance the effect of antibiotics on embedded biofilm bacteria. Among eight substances tested, subtilisin A (0.01 U/mL) and calcium gluconate (CaG, Ca2+ 1.25 mmol/L) significantly reduced the biomass of biofilms formed by at least 21/24 S. aureus isolates. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that they both eliminated nearly all the proteins and PNAG from the matrix. By contrast, antibiotics alone had nearly no effect on biofilm biomass and the selected one (oxytetracycline-OTC) could only slightly reduce biofilm bacteria. The combination of OTC with CaG or subtilisin A led to an additive reduction (average of 2 log10 CFU/mL) of embedded biofilm bacteria on the isolates susceptible to OTC (MBC < 10 µg/mL, 11/24). Moreover, these two combinations led to a reduction of the embedded biofilm bacteria higher than 3 log10 CFU/mL for 20-25% of the isolates. Further studies are now required to better understand the factors that cause the biofilm produced by specific isolates (20-25%) to be susceptible to the combinations.","Liu, JingJing; Madec, Jean-Yves; Bousquet-Mélou, Alain; Haenni, Marisa; Ferran, Aude A",Sci Rep,,514
284456,Renewed Grammars of Care: A(n Abbreviated) Case for the End of “the Service Provider”,2020,"Several uncertainties exist regarding how we will conduct our clinical, didactic, business, and social activities as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic abates and social distancing guidelines are relaxed. We anticipate changes in how we interact with our patients and other providers, how patient workflow is designed, the methods used to conduct our teaching sessions, and how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of the present report is to review some of the changes to consider in the clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow and, allow for a smoother transition, with less risk to our patients and healthcare personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and nonclinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for COVID-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and establishing the epidemiologic linkage will be crucial to containing and preventing new COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or an alternate solution is available. Additionally, the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs and personal protective equipment, the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, the increase in overhead costs, and the possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary, must be considered. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths will likely continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or the next 12 to 24 months. Thus, we must prioritize surgery, balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain COVID-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment, and ethical values to continue to deliver high-quality, economical, and accessible patient care.","Chigurupati, Radhika; Panchal, Neeraj; Henry, Andrew M; Batal, Hussam; Sethi, Amit; D039,; innocenzo, Richard; Mehra, Pushkar; Krishnan, Deepak G; Roser, Steven M",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,514

290933,Tolerating a difference of opinion,2021,"Uruguay River is the most important river in western Rio Grande do Sul, separating Brazil from Argentina and Uruguay. However, its pollution is of great concern due to agricultural activities in the region and the extensive use of pesticides. In a long term, this practice leads to environmental pollution, especially to the aquatic system. The objective of this study was to analyze the physicochemical characteristics, metals and pesticides levels in water samples obtained before and after the planting and pesticides' application season from three sites: Uruguay River and two minor affluents, Mezomo Dam and Salso Stream. For biomonitoring, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used, which were exposed for 24 h. We did not find any significant alteration in physicochemical parameters. In the pre- and post-pesticides' samples we observed a residual presence of three pesticides (tebuconazole, imazethapyr, and clomazone) and metals which levels were above the recommended (As, Hg, Fe, and Mn). Exposure to both pre- and post-pesticides' samples impaired C. elegans reproduction and post-pesticides samples reduced worms' survival rate and lifespan. PCA analysis indicated that the presence of metals and pesticides are important variables that impacted C. elegans biological endpoints. Our data demonstrates that Uruguay River and two affluents are contaminated independent whether before or after pesticides' application season. In addition, it reinforces the usefulness of biological indicators, since simple physicochemical analyses are not sufficient to attest water quality and ecological safety.","Kuhn, Eugênia Carla; Jacques, Maurício Tavares; Teixeira, Daniela; Meyer, Sören; Gralha, Thiago; Roehrs, Rafael; Camargo, Sandro; Schwerdtle, Tanja; Bornhorst, Julia; Ávila, Daiana Silva",,,514

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out at the Psychiatric Service of the General Hospital/University of Perugia (Italy). Patients were recruited from January 2015 until December 2018. The sample consists of patients with dual diagnosis, divided into two subgroups based on gender; descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed (p<0.05). Male and females were compared according to socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological features, measured by Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and factor models of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). RESULTS: In our sample (n=157), no significant differences in socio-demographic features were found between male (n=108, 68.8%) and female subjects (n=49, 31.2%). Women displayed a higher frequency of involuntary hospitalizations (53.1% vs 32.4%, p=0.022) and a higher score on the general psychopathology scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (41.86±8.96 vs 36.54±10.38, p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the prevalence of dual diagnosis in the male gender. Female sex appears more frequently connected to some indices of clinical severity.

Despite my concern about the near-term outlook, advising business leaders requires that I look past the pandemic. Akcigit and Ates argue that greater concentration among firms and a slowdown in business dynamism is the cause of a myriad of factors that slow economic growth. Furthermore, a slowing pace of growth of the working-age population and an increase in older members of the workforce, as well as a greater number of retirees, has significant economic consequences for the pace of startups. In contrast, it is possible that the shock from COVID may have boosted business formation and pushed technology adoption across generations, perhaps mitigating some of the demographic impediments to technology adoption.

295230,FDG PET/CT in a Patient With Mantle Cell Lymphoma and COVID-19: Typical Findings,2020,"PURPOSE: Nasal irrigation or nebulizing aerosol of isotonic or hypertonic saline is a traditional method for respiratory or nasal care. A recent small study in outpatients with COVID-19 without acute respiratory distress syndrome suggests substantial symptom resolution. We therefore analyzed pharmacological/pharmacodynamic effects of isotonic or hypertonic saline, relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory care. METHODS: Mixed search method. RESULTS: Due to its wetting properties, saline achieves an improved spreading of alveolar lining fluid and has been shown to reduce bio-aerosols and viral load. Saline provides moisture to respiratory epithelia and gels mucus, promotes ciliary beating, and improves mucociliary clearance. Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 damage ciliated epithelium in the nose and airways. Saline inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells; possible interactions involve the viral ACE2-entry mechanism (chloride-dependent ACE2 configuration), furin and 3CLpro (inhibition by NaCl), and the sodium channel ENaC. Saline shifts myeloperoxidase activity in epithelial or phagocytic cells to produce hypochlorous acid. Clinically, nasal or respiratory airway care with saline reduces symptoms of seasonal coronaviruses and other common cold viruses. Its use as aerosol reduces hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in children. Preliminary data suggest symptom reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 patients if saline is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Saline interacts at various levels relevant to nasal or respiratory hygiene (nasal irrigation, gargling or aerosol). If used from the onset of common cold symptoms, it may represent a useful add-on to first-line interventions for COVID-19. Formal evaluation in mild COVID-19 is desirable as to establish efficacy and optimal treatment regimens.","Huijghebaert, Suzy; Hoste, Levi; Vanham, Guido",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,514

We hypothesized that parents of children with ADHD (compared to without) would perceive their children as experiencing higher levels of loneliness, and that perceived executive functions deficits, parents' social involvement, parental hope, and family cohesion would mediate this relationship. 280 parents of children (166 with ADHD, 114 without) completed questionnaires concerning their child. Children with ADHD were perceived by their parents as lonelier compared to their non-ADHD peers. Individual and parental factors fully mediated the association between ADHD and loneliness. Family cohesion moderated the association between executive function deficits and child's loneliness. We discuss this moderated mediation model in terms of the importance of parental resources for child's well-being in the face of COVID-19-related challenges.","Laslo-Roth, Roni George-Levi Sivan Rosenstreich Eyal",Personality and Individual Differences,,514

Aerosols from these procedures may be inhaled by bystanders, and there are consequent concerns regarding the transmission of infection or, specific to nebulized therapy, secondary drug exposure. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a proprietary high-efficiency-particulate-air-filtering extractor tent on reducing the aerosol dispersal of nebulized bronchodilator drugs. METHODS: The study was conducted in an unoccupied outpatient room at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. A novel real-time, fluorescent particle counter, the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS), monitored room air continuously for 3 h. Baseline airborne particle count and count during nebulization of bronchodilator drug solutions were recorded. FINDINGS: Nebulization within the tent prevented any increase over background level. Nebulization directly into room air resulted in mean fluorescent particle counts of 4.75 x 105/m3 and 4.21 x 105/m3 for Ventolin and Ipramol, respectively, representing more than 400-fold increases over mean background level. More than 99.3% of drug particles were <2 µm in diameter and therefore small enough to enter the lower respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: The extractor tent was completely effective for the prevention of airborne spread of drug particles of respirable size from nebulized therapy. This suggests that extractor tents of this type would be efficacious for the prevention of airborne infection from aerosol-generating procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fennelly, M; Keane, J; Dolan, L; Plant, B J; O039,; Connor, D J; Sodeau, J R; Prentice, M B",J Hosp Infect,,514

The outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. Thus, identification of regions with high risk for COVID-19 outbreak and analyzing the behaviour of the infection is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak for identifying the areas having high risk of infection and to evaluate the behaviour of infection in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS)-based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID-19 in Fars Province, Iran whereas the daily observations of infected cases were tested in the-polynomial and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of the disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors were selected for spatial modelling of outbreak risk. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) that displays a good prediction of outbreak risk change detection. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARIMA models in the province revealed an increasing trend with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although a more volatile growth of the infected cases is expected in the province. The results of this study might assist better programming COVID-19 disease prevention and control and gaining sorts of predictive capability would have wide-ranging benefits.","Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza; Pouyan, Soheila; Farajzadeh, Zakariya; Sadhasivam, Nitheshnirmal; Heidari, Bahram; Babaei, Sedigheh; Tiefenbacher, John P",PLoS One,,514

In this study, OP was formulated as a dry powder for inhalation, which allows drug targeting to the site of action and potentially reduces the dose, aiming a more efficient therapy. Binary formulations were based on micronized excipient particles acting like diluents, which were blended with the drug OP. Different excipient types, excipient ratios, and excipient size distributions were prepared and examined. To investigate the feasibility of delivering high doses of OP in a single dose, 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1 drug/diluent blending ratios have been prepared. Subsequently, the aerosolization performance was evaluated for all prepared formulations by cascade impaction using a novel medium-resistance capsule-based inhaler (UNI-Haler). Formulations with micronized trehalose showed relatively excellent aerosolization performance with highest fine-particle doses in comparison to examined lactose, mannitol, and glucose under similar conditions. Focusing on the trehalose-based dry-powder inhalers' (DPIs) formulations, a physicochemical characterization of extra micronized grade trehalose in relation to the achieved performance in dispersing OP was performed. Additionally, an early indication of inhaled OP safety on lung cells was noted by the viability MTT assay utilizing Calu-3 cells.","Aziz, Shahir; Scherließ, Regina; Steckel, Hartwig",,,514

The co-prescription of psychotropics with COVID-19 medication is not uncommon. Healthcare providers should be familiar with many Potential Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) between COVID-19 therapeutic agents and psychotropic drugs based on cytochrome P450 metabolism. This review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on DDIs between antiretroviral drugs and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and psychotropics, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics. Methods: Medical databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify studies in English with keywords related to psychiatric disorders, medications used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 medications. Results: There is a great potential for DDIs between psychiatric and COVID-19 medications ranging from interactions that are not clinically apparent (minor) to those that produce lifethreatening adverse drug reactions, or loss of treatment efficacy. The majority of interactions are pharmacokinetic interactions via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Conclusion: DDIs are a major concern in the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 infection resulting in the alteration of expected therapeutic outcomes. The risk of toxicity or lack of efficacy may occur due to a higher or lower plasma concentration of medications. However, psychiatric medication can be safely used in combination with COVID-19 pharmacotherapy with either a wise selection of medication with the least possibility of interaction or careful patient monitoring and management.","Mohebbi, Niayesh; Talebi, Ali; Moghadamnia, Marjan; Taloki, Zahra Nazari; Shakiba, Alia",Basic Clin.

One needs team work, emotional competencies, prioritization ( first things first), listening skills, advocacy, negotiation, networking skills, along with conviction, commitment, and courage to do what one thinks is right.

342520,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on people with mild cognitive impairment/dementia and on their caregivers,2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT The consequences of public health protection measures may include loss of income, lack of access to basic resources (including health care), and increased psychological burdens. This has led to cancellation of elective surgical cases and greater reliance on telemedicine to conduct consultations and maintain patient access to orthopedic providers. Little is currently known regarding the effects that this has on spine surgery patients and their recovery. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect individuals differently according to their access to socioeconomic resources, preexisting burden of psychological distress, and knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage their health care. Evidence suggests that the presence of psychological distress, defined as a high burden of symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, is associated with poorer postoperative outcomes than those for patients without psychological distress. Because of the effects of the pandemic, patients may need to rely more than ever on their internal strengths as they recover from spine surgery. One measure of internal strength is “patient activation,” which is a hierarchical construct that encompasses the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage one's health care. Patient activation may mitigate the negative effects of psychological stress in patients undergoing spine surgery. PURPOSE We tested the hypotheses that patients with greater socioeconomic resources would experience less disruption of access to basic resources;those with psychological distress would experience worsening pain and HRQOL;and those with high patient activation would experience less worsening of pain and HRQOL. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING This was a prospective survey of patients presenting to an academic medical center. PATIENT SAMPLE We selected adults who had undergone or were scheduled to undergo spine surgery for cervical or lumbar spine degeneration or deformity correction at our academic center. Between May 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020, patients were asked to complete a survey regarding the effects of COVID-19 on their health, well-being, and personal life. Surveys were sent to 1,506 patients, 431 of whom (29%) completed and returned them. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age of the 431 respondents was 61 ± 15 years. Fifty-five percent of respondents identified as female, and most respondents were non-Hispanic (92%) and white (81%). Most reported living with a partner (71%) and were not currently employed (68%). Approximately one-fifth of respondents reported an annual household income of ≤$50,000, and 120 reported having less than a college education. Two hundred twenty-nine patients were being treated for a degenerative lumbar condition, 118 for a degenerative cervical condition, and 84 for spinal deformity. We found no significant differences between groups in terms of demographic characteristics. OUTCOME MEASURES Respondents reported on their access to basic resources and health care and on their health and wellness. Patients scored their worst back, leg, neck and arm pain during the previous week on a numeric rating scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 29-Item profile (PROMIS-29), version 2, which assesses HRQOL using the following domains: pain interference, Physical Function, Fatigue, Anxiety, Depression, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles. At their preoperative visit, patients provided information on their annual income and highest level of education attained and completed assessments of psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and patient activation. Patient activation was assessed using the Patient Activation Measure. Psychological distress was assessed from PROMIS-29 domains. Methods We surveyed 431 patients who had undergone or were scheduled for surgical treatment of lumbar or cervical spine degeneration or deformity at 1 institution. The survey inquired about the effec s of COVID-19 on patients’ access to basic resources and health care and assessed pain (numeric rating scale) and HRQOL (PROMIS-29). We compared the proportions of patients who reported worsening pain and HRQOL between groups defined by presence of psychological distress and high patient activation measured before the pandemic. Alpha = 0.05. Results Respondents reported only minor disruptions in access to basic resources but significant worsening of pain and HRQOL during COVID-19. Health care access was interrupted, with 117 respondents (43%) reporting a canceled health care appointment. Respondents who had undergone spine surgery before the pandemic (N = 296) reported significantly worse outcomes between the most recent pre-pandemic and COVID-19. assessments. During COVID-19, respondents reported worsening of the following: back pain (mean increase, 0.57 ± 3.0 points;p=.027), leg pain (mean increase, 0.74 ± 3.4 points;p=.013), physical function (mean decrease, 2.4 ± 7.5 points;p&lt;.001), fatigue (mean increase, 3.8 ± 9.6 points;p&lt;.001) and satisfaction with participation in social roles (mean decrease, 1.9 ± 11 points;p=.048). Those with psychological distress were more likely to experience clinically relevant worsening of back pain, leg pain and physical function than those without distress (p&lt;.01 for all outcomes). High patient activation (measured before the pandemic) was associated with less worsening of physical function (p = 0.031). Conclusions Spine surgery patients reported little disruption in access to basic resources during COVID-19. Psychological distress was associated with worsening of pain and HRQOL. High patient activation appeared to mitigate the worsening of physical function during COVID-19. Health care systems should screen for psychological distress and patient activation and, during times of disruption, enhance supports to manage pain and maintain HRQOL.

To minimise this risk, UK Armed Forces (UKAF) recruits receive a prevention-focused dental care intervention during military training (known as 'Project MOLAR') before their entry to the trained strength of the Armed Forces.Aim To evaluate whether Project MOLAR is effective in preventing future dental emergency events and subsequent oral disease in UKAF recruits.Methods This is a retrospective cohort analysis of UKAF recruits who enlisted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011, conducted by analysing electronic primary dental care records. Adverse outcomes were defined as: i) incidence of dental emergency events during the five-year follow-up period; and ii) further oral disease at 18 months measured by an increase in Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT).Results In total, 7,361 recruits met the inclusion criteria. The total follow-up time for the cohort was 31,957 person-years (mean follow-up 4.3 years/recruit). Individuals whose treatment was completed under Project MOLAR were found to experience a 30% reduction in dental emergency incidence (RR: 0.70-95% CI: 0.63-0.76) (p <0.001) and a 64% reduction in the odds of DMFT increase at 18 months (OR: 0.36-95% CI: 0.28-0.47) (p <0.001) compared to individuals whose treatment was incomplete.Conclusions Defence dentistry's focus on delivering prevention-focused dentistry early in a recruit's military career confers a downstream benefit to personnel who complete the intervention, such that dental emergency occurrences and DMFT progression are significantly reduced.","Armstrong, Sarah; Dermont, Mark",Br Dent J,,514

At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.","Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J; Li, Hongying",Biosaf Health,,514

(2) Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled three groups of subjects: pneumonia-free (control group), COVID-19 pneumonia and RP patients. CT images were analyzed by mean of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on a novel deep convolutional neural network structure. The cut-off value of risk probability of COVID-19 was 30%;values higher than 30% were classified as COVID-19 High Risk, and values below 30% as COVID-19 Low Risk. The statistical analysis included the Mann-Whitney U test (significance threshold at p &lt; 0.05) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with fitting performed using the maximum likelihood fit of a binormal model. (3) Results: Most patients presenting RP (66.7%) were classified by the algorithm as COVID-19 Low Risk. The algorithm showed high sensitivity but low specificity in the detection of RP against COVID-19 pneumonia (sensitivity = 97.0%, specificity = 2%, area under the curve (AUC = 0.72). The specificity increased when an estimated COVID-19 risk probability cut-off of 30% was applied (sensitivity 76%, specificity 63%, AUC = 0.84).

Despite the significant efforts made in developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs, there is currently no available effective treatment against this new coronavirus infection, hence the need to continue research which is aimed at limiting the progression of this virus. The present study which has as objective to carry out in silico studies on the metabolites of some Cameroonian medicinal plants of the Asteraceae family with a view to propose potential molecules to fight against COVID-19. The selected plants are commonly used to treat respiratory infectious diseases, and for this reason they may contain some constituents which could exhibit an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a set of 74 naturally occurring compounds are computed with SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (PDB ID: 6lu7) and spike protein (PDB ID: 6m0j) for their affinity and stability using binding energy analysis and molecular docking. Chrysoeriol-7-O-ß-D-glucuronopyranoside (compound 16) has showed promising results including excellent Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) parameters as well as insignificant toxicity. Finally, the stability of this compound is complex with the two proteins validated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, they displayed stable trajectory and molecular properties with consistent interaction profile in molecular dynamics simulations.

387594,Emerging epidemics,2021,"A recent fatal outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, identified preliminary as a causative agent for series of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, China has infected more than 20 million individuals with more than 4 million mortalities. Since, the infection crossed geographical barriers, the WHO permanently named the causing disease as COVID-2019 by declaring it a pandemic situation. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus causing a wide range of pathological conditions from common cold symptoms to pneumonia and fatal severe respiratory syndrome. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed 96% identity to the bat coronavirus and 79.6% sequence identity to the previous SARS-CoV. The main protease (known as 3C-like proteinase/ Mpro) plays a vital role during the infection with the processing of replicase polyprotein thus offering an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 97% sequence identity, with 12 variable residues but none of them present in the catalytic and substrate binding site. With the high level of sequence and structural similarity and absence of any drug/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing against Mpro is an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. Here, we report a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of 12 divergent residues on the molecular microenvironment of Mpro. A structural comparison and analysis is made on how these variable residues affects the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the monomer and biologically active dimer form of Mpro. The present MD simulations study concluded the change in microenvironment of active-site residues at the entrance (T25, T26, M49 and Q189), near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) and other residues in substrate binding site (V35T, N65S, K88R and N180K) due to 12 mutation incorporated in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 dimer is more stable and less flexible state compared to monomer which may be due to these variable residues, mainly F140, E166 and H172 which are involved in dimerization. This also warrants a need for inhibitor design considering the more stable dimer form. The mutation accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indirectly reconfigures the key molecular networks around the active site conferring a potential change in SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a challenge in drug repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19. The new networks and changes in microenvironment identified by our work might guide attempts needed for repurposing and identification of new Mpro inhibitors.","Patel, Dhaval; Parmar, Meet; Thumar, Ritik; Patel, Bhumi; Athar, Mohd.; Jha, Prakash",,,514
387595,Emerging epidemics,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the strategies used and critical considerations among an international sample of hospital leaders when mobilizing human resources in response to the clinical demands associated with the COVID-19 pandemic surge. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, qualitative research study designed to investigate strategies used by health system leaders from around the world when mobilizing human resources in response to the global COVD-19 pandemic. Prospective interviewees were identified through nonprobability and purposive sampling methods from May to July 2020. The primary outcomes were the critical considerations, as perceived by health system leaders, when redeploying health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic determined through thematic analysis of transcribed notes. Redeployment was defined as reassigning personnel to a different location or retraining personnel for a different task. RESULTS: Nine hospital leaders from 9 hospitals in 8 health systems located in 5 countries (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were interviewed. Six hospitals in 5 health systems experienced a surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the remaining 3 hospitals anticipated, but did not experience, a similar surge. Seven of 8 hospitals redeployed their health care workforce, and 1 had a redeployment plan in place but did not need to use it. Thematic analysis of the interview notes identified 3 themes representing effective practices and lessons learned when preparing and executing workforce redeployment: process, leadership, and communication. Critical considerations within each theme were identified. Because of the various expertise of redeployed personnel, retraining had to be customized and a decentralized flexible strategy was implemented. There were 3 concerns regarding redeployed personnel. These included the fear of becoming infected, the concern over their skills and patient safety, and concerns regarding professional loss (such as loss of education opportunities in their chosen profession). Transparency via multiple different types of communications is important to prevent the development of doubt and rumors. CONCLUSIONS: Redeployment strategies should critically consider the process of redeploying and supporting the health care workforce, decentralized leadership that encourages and supports local implementation of system-wide plans, and communication that is transparent, regular, consistent, and informed by data.","Panda, Nikhil; Sinyard, Robert D; Henrich, Natalie; Cauley, Christy E; Hannenberg, Alexander A; Sonnay, Yves; Bitton, Asaf; Brindle, Mary; Molina, George",J Patient Saf,,514
388737,Diabetes-related major and minor amputation risk increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: Air pollution and COVID-19 problems are being increasingly scrutinized. This article discusses the optimum design of an indoor and semi-outdoor air purifier, using a water-based filtration system. METHODS: An air purifier was fabricated, then comparison of purifying efficacy of the system between untreated air and using an air pump was done. Incense smoke was generated within a room for 10 seconds. The number of particle sizes of PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1.0, PM3.0, PM5.0, and PM10 µm (particle/ m3) as well as the detection of mass concentration of PM1.0, PM2.5, PM5.0, and PM10 (mg/m3) at 0 and 5â¯min were recorded. Each experiment was repeated 10 times. RESULTS: Particles in untreated air, except PM10, showed the maximum increase rate of the number of particle sizes greater than the air pump experiment. The highest differentiation between two methods was that PM1.0 and PM0.5 of untreated air increased to 113.647 and 61.539 % whereas the air pump method showed 4.720 and 2.533 %, respectively. The PM mass concentration of untreated air increased from 50.217 to 51.167 % while the increased rate of PM using an air pump was 2.784 to 2.902 %. CONCLUSION: This study proposed a water-based air filtration technique, which can reduce the level of particulate matter, and also is a low-cost prototype. For the next experiment, the study should extend test length, clarify an optimum ratio of disinfectant technologies, connect with the internet of things, compare the efficiency with a HEPA filter air purifier, and then also measure some particles which are smaller than 0.2â¯µm.","Jumlongkul, Arnon",Environ Res,,514

Daily (low cost) data are easily collected at this level, and are worked out for a fast evaluation of the local health status thanks to control systems methods. Precisely, the identifiability of the parameters of the hospital model is proven and thanks to the availability of clinical data, essential characteristics of the local health status are identified.

However, there was no association between aPL positivity and mean levels of C reactive protein (mean difference was 32 (95% CI -15 to 79), p=0.18), D-dimer (mean difference was 34 (95% CI -194 to 273), p=0.77), mortality (1.46 (95% CI 0.29 to 7.29), p=0.65), invasive ventilation (1.22 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.91), p=0.65) and venous thromboembolism (1.38 (95% CI 0.57 to 3.37), p=0.48). CONCLUSIONS: aPLs were detected in nearly half of patients with COVID-19, and higher prevalence of aPL was found in severe disease. However, there was no association between aPL positivity and disease outcomes including thrombosis, invasive ventilation and mortality. However, further studies are required to identify the clinical and pathological role of aPL in COVID-19.","Taha, Muhanad; Samavati, Lobelia",,,514
406742,Changes in Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Health After Detraining in Older Men with Osteosarcopenia: 6-Month Follow-Up of the Randomized Controlled Franconian Osteopenia and Sarcopenia Trial (FrOST) Study,2021,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 10 million people develop tuberculosis (TB) every year, with 1.5 million deaths attributed to TB in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). The majority of the disease burden occurs in low-income countries, where access to diagnostics and tailored treatment remains problematic. The current COVID-19 pandemic further threatens to impact global TB control by diverting resources, reducing notifications and hence significantly increasing deaths attributable to TB (World Health Organization, 2020). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming increasingly accessible, and has particular value in the diagnosis and management of TB disease (Cabibbe et al., 2018; Meehan et al., 2019). Not only does it have the potential to give more rapid and complete information on drug-resistance, but the high discriminatory power it offers allows detection of clusters and transmission pathways, as well as likely contamination events, mixed infections and to differentiate between re-infection and relapse with much greater confidence than previous typing methods.","Kizny Gordon, Alice; Marais, Ben; Walker, Timothy M; Sintchenko, Vitali",Int. j. infect. dis,,514

407278,Family adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic: A dyad study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Top public health experts and organizations strongly recommend universal masking for children older than 2 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic, but speculate it may be difficult for young children. This study sought to assess the usage of cloth face masks in grades pre-K-2 and identify associated characteristics and adverse events. It is the first data to assess mask wearing by young children in school. METHODS: This online, prospective, observational, survey in multiple schools within a single school district in a major metropolitan area measured adherence to face covering mandates by students in grades pre-K-2 as measured by percentage of day with appropriate face mask wearing per report via daily teacher surveys for the first 4 weeks of school. RESULTS: The primary outcome was percent of the day that the entire class was wearing their masks appropriately. Of the estimated almost 1000 students and 1048 classroom days reported, the mean percentage of the school day with appropriate mask usage was 76.9%. CONCLUSIONS: For a majority of the day while conducting in-person instruction, children in grades pre-K-2 are able to adhere to mask wearing as a key mitigation strategy for limiting SARS-CoV2 infection spread and possible future use.","Mickells, Geoffrey E; Figueroa, Janet; West, Kelly Withers; Wood, Anna; McElhanon, Barbara O",J. sch. health,,514

418766,"Covid-19 Fares Gently with Children and Youngsters, but They Bear a Large Burden Due to the Lock down of the Society",2020,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This study examines the journey of U.S. dental schools' predoctoral senior class of 2020, from the influences on and their motivations to pursue careers in dentistry, aspects of their dental school experiences, to plans upon graduation and the investment in their careers. METHODS: The study is an analysis of the results of the ADEA Survey of Dental School Seniors, 2020 Graduating Class. Each year, ADEA surveys senior predoctoral students from the accredited U.S. dental schools. Whenever feasible, the answers of the survey respondents from the 2020 class were compared with their 2015 counterparts. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that 46% of the 2020 respondents decided to become a dentist before going to undergraduate college, more than the proportion of those deciding while in college (42%). When it comes to preparedness to practice dentistry, the responses indicated a high level of readiness to go into the profession. Seventy-seven percent of survey participants reported the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect their plans after graduation. Between 2015 and 2020, the share of survey respondents who planned to go into advanced dental education immediately after graduation increased from 35% to 40%. Almost a third of the 2020 respondents who planned to go into private practice immediately upon graduation intended to join a Dental Service Organization (DSO). Grants and scholarships represented a higher share of the average funding for dental education for the 2020 respondents than five years ago. The share of respondents expecting to graduate without any loans to finance their dental degrees and predental education (educational debt) increased significantly, from 12% in 2015 to 17% in 2020. CONCLUSION(S): This research shows that during these uncertain times, U.S. dental schools continued their mission to train and graduate oral health professionals fully prepared to go into the profession.","Istrate, Emilia C; Slapar, Franc J; Mallarapu, Monisha; Stewart, Denice C L; West, Karen P",J Dent Educ,,514

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to September 25, 2020. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to estimate pooled results. Random - or fixed-effect models based on heterogeneity were used for the meta-analysis. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of ten articles with 361,934 participants were selected for meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled OR in the fixed-effect model showed that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.00-2.05). In addition, COVID-19-positive individuals had lower vitamin D levels than COVID-19-negative individuals (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). Significant heterogeneity existed in both endpoints. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests revealed significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that low vitamin D status might be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the clinical severity and prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

Extensive efforts in testing for coronavirus infection, combined with isolating infected cases and quarantining those in contact, have proven successful in bringing the epidemic under control. Rapid and facile screening of this disease is in high demand. This review summarises recent advances in strategies reported by international researchers and engineers concerning how to tackle COVID-19 via rapid testing, mainly through nucleic acid- and antibody- testing. The roles of biosensors as powerful analytical tools are emphasized for the detection of viral RNAs, surface antigens, whole viral particles, antibodies and other potential biomarkers in human specimen. We critically review in depth newly developed biosensing methods especially for in-field and point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this review describes possible future strategies for virus rapid detection.

435335,Reactive Axillary Lymphadenopathy to COVID-19 Vaccination on F18-FDG PET/CT,2021,"Salvia pomifera subsp. calycina (Sm.) Hayek (Lamiaceae), is an Eastern Mediterranean element, which is used in traditional medicine and cuisine in the same manner as S. fruticosa Mill. and S. officinalis L.. The essential oil (EO) and the extracts of S. pomifera possess bioactive compounds with anti-proliferative, anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antiviral and antifungal properties. In this study, the chemical (EO), genetic (DNA microsatellites, SSRs) and morphological diversity of forty-nine individuals of Salvia pomifera subsp. calycina, originating from five natural populations of the Peloponnese (Greece) were determined, in order to explore the potential for successful breeding and to reveal tools and biomarkers for identification and authentication. Chemical and genetic analyses revealed high levels of variation both within and among populations, while morphological analysis mainly within populations. Essential oil yield ranged from 1.79 to 5.79â¯ml 100â¯g-1 dry wt, among individuals while ß-thujone ranged from 6.04 to 64.75%. Consistency was found in the EO yield and composition of specific individuals, when sampled during the same period, for three consecutive years, while the analysis during spring and summer months showed differentiation that still retained individual's discrimination. Genetic analysis using SSRs showed that the observed population heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.48 to 0.67, while high number of private alleles were revealed in all populations. Considerable genetic differentiation was observed among the three Salvia taxa (S. pomifera subsp. calycina, S. fruticosa, S. officinalis) (Fst values ranged from 0.27 to 0.48) and lower among S. pomifera subsp. calycina populations (Fst values ranged from 0.06 to 0.13). The great variation that was revealed in all measured traits, in combination with the demonstrated, genetically based, consistency of their EO yield and composition, advocates to a successful breeding, whereas SSR genotyping presents a strong identification and authentication tool.","Leontaritou, Peggy; Lamari, Fotini N; Papasotiropoulos, Vasileios; Iatrou, Gregoris",Phytochemistry,,514

The SPICE-R authors, however, suggested for additional items for subscales ""roles and responsibilities for collaborative care"" and ""patient outcomes from collaborative practice"". We added two items and introduced SPICE-R3 to differentiate it from the 10-item SPICE-R2 and to adapt the scale to a wider range of healthcare members. We administered the SPICE-R3 to healthcare students at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong in February 2020. Using data from 225 students from Chinese medicine, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy, confirmatory factor analysis indicated nine items having acceptable item coefficients. Our data obtained a good fit to the three-factor, nine-item model suggesting construct validity. Results of the between-network analysis suggest that the three subscales of SPICE-R3 correlated systematically with other theoretically relevant variables in the nomological network suggesting convergent validity.

436653,Doffing personal protective equipment in times of Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Although COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, there is mounting evidence suggesting that the GI tract is involved in this disease. We investigated whether the gut microbiome is linked to disease severity in patients with COVID-19, and whether perturbations in microbiome composition, if any, resolve with clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: In this two-hospital cohort study, we obtained blood, stool and patient records from 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serial stool samples were collected from 27 of the 100 patients up to 30 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiome compositions were characterised by shotgun sequencing total DNA extracted from stools. Concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured from plasma. RESULTS: Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 individuals irrespective of whether patients had received medication (p<0.01). Several gut commensals with known immunomodulatory potential such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale and bifidobacteria were underrepresented in patients and remained low in samples collected up to 30 days after disease resolution. Moreover, this perturbed composition exhibited stratification with disease severity concordant with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers such as C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. CONCLUSION: Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses. Furthermore, the gut microbiota dysbiosis after disease resolution could contribute to persistent symptoms, highlighting a need to understand how gut microorganisms are involved in inflammation and COVID-19.","Yeoh, Yun Kit; Zuo, Tao; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Zhang, Fen; Liu, Qin; Li, Amy Yl; Chung, Arthur Ck; Cheung, Chun Pan; Tso, Eugene Yk; Fung, Kitty Sc; Chan, Veronica; Ling, Lowell; Joynt, Gavin; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chow, Kai Ming; Ng, Susanna So Shan; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Ng, Rita Wy; Yip, Terry Cf; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung; Chan, Francis Kl; Wong, Chun Kwok; Chan, Paul Ks; Ng, Siew C",Gut,,514

Within this context, health care workers are at greater risk of infection for being in close contact with patients, which is inherent to their work activities. To reduce the risk, protective measures must be adopted and personal protective equipment is essential. However, the process of removing personal protective equipment, named doffing, is as important as its correct use and can be a source of contamination for workers, especially when equipment is lacking in the market and lifespan is increased. Therefore, this review aimed to discuss the process of doffing personal protective equipment and its correct sequence based on data available in the literature. © 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho.

Patients with end-stage kidney disease were excluded. AKI was classified as per KDIGO criteria. RESULTS: Of the 1032 patients with COVID-19 studied,164 (15.9%) were taking anticoagulant therapy prior to admission. There were similar rates of AKI between those on anticoagulants and those not anticoagulated (23.8% versus 19.7%) with no difference in the severity of AKI or requirement of renal replacement therapy between groups (1.2% versus 3.5%). Risk factors for AKI included hypertension, pre-existing renal disease and male sex. There was a higher mortality in those taking anticoagulant therapy (40.2% versus 30%). Patients taking anticoagulants were less likely to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (8.5% versus 17.4%) and to receive mechanical ventilation (42.9% versus 78.1%). CONCLUSION: Patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy did not have a reduced incidence or severity of AKI suggesting that AKI is unlikely to be thrombotic in nature. Therapeutic anticoagulation is currently still under investigation in randomised controlled studies to determine whether it has a potential role in COVID-19 treatment.","Parker, Kathrine; Hamilton, Patrick; Hanumapura, Prasanna; Castelino, Laveena; Murphy, Michelle; Challiner, Rachael; Thachil, Jecko; Ebah, Leonard",BMC Nephrol,,514
446121,The importance of PrEP persistence in preventing HIV infections on PrEP,2020,"Purpose This paper reviews the current literature on the major challenges faced by building contractors in the UK due to COVID-19 to create an evaluation framework. Design/methodology/approach A PRISMA scoping review systematically maps the information published and establishes the potential challenges, as a precursor to a literature review that synthesises the data available to establish an initial COVID-19 evaluation framework to build a rationale for a future series of studies. Findings The research identified these seven challenges: health and safety on-site, economic cost, possible legal exposures, manpower availability, instability of the supply chain and subcontractors, and the uncertainty related to the constant and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. The magnitude of each challenge was also found to differ depending on the size of the contractor, the rigor of local regulations and the sector where the contractor works. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to increasing understanding on the subject and provides an initial assessment framework, based on these seven parameters, so that contractors can analyse their weaknesses and plan specific priorities so that their companies can remain competitive, minimising the impact of COVID-19 and possible future waves. Originality/value This research is timely and relevant as it produces the first academic review on how COVID-19 has affected contractors and the construction stage. This document gives a holistic view of the new scenario created by COVID-19 and creates a self-assessment system for contractors to test their resistance to COVID-19.","Sierra, F.",Engineering Construction and Architectural Management,,514

467287,In-hospital treatment of COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Robust serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are essential for determining prior infection and the suitability of donated convalescent plasma for plasma therapy. We compared two in-house and three commercial serological assays in a family cohort with SARS-CoV-2-infected members. CASE PRESENTATION: Three individuals in a family of five developed COVID-19 confirmed by PCR, following a trip abroad. Three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms, three commercial ELISAs and an in-house immunofluorescence test demonstrated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. An in-house neutralisation test also demonstrated neutralising antibodies. INTERPRETATION: The in-house assays and one commercial assay gave congruent results, which were also consistent with the initial PCR and/or clinical evaluation, indicating prior infection in three of the five family members. The other commercial assays indicated possible infection in a fourth family member, but this result was likely due to cross-reactivity. The neutralising antibodies suggest complete or partial immunity against reinfection.","Henriksen, Stian; Trydal, Øyvind; Sigurdsen, Sten-Eigil; Tylden, Garth D; Rinaldo, Christine Hanssen",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,514
472768,COVID-19 and Collective Grief,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable pathogenic viral infection that causes a disease known as COVID-19. It is a pandemic and public health challenge ravaging the world today. Unfortunately, with the daily increase of infected individuals, there is no known drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are therapeutic drugs with the potentials to inhibit endocytic pathways, suppress ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase activities, and reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2. These drugs modifications are aimed at reducing inflammation, time of recovery, and number of deaths. This review is aimed at providing updated information on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, preventive measures and therapeutic drugs used against SARS-CoV-2. The finding of this review revealed that some of these drugs are transmembrane protease, serine 2, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors with the capacity to block the entrance/replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a host cell and therefore, may be promising in preventing the spread and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. However, these drugs may cause detrimental health effects such as toxic and non-efficacy issues. Therefore great caution should be employed by health professionals when prescribing these drugs to COVID-19 patients.","Ikonne, Eleazer U; Ikpeazu, Victor O; Ugbogu, Ositadinma C; Emmanuel, Okezie; Nwakuche, Ikechukwu P; Iweala, Emeka J; Ugbogu, Eziuche A",Drug Metab.

Ineffective government communication has resulted in a great deal of public confusion and misunderstanding, as well as serious errors in responding to this evolving health threat, leading to disastrous health and social outcomes for the public and prolonging the pandemic, especially within the United States. This article uses systems theory as a template for analyzing government communication in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing governments with recommendations for establishing effective health risk communication strategies for use with the public. The communication strategies offered here promote the delivery of relevant, accurate, and sensitive information to key public groups, minimizing communication noise to guide desirable coordinated actions. These communication strategies can be applied locally, nationally, and internationally.","Kim, Do Kyun David; Kreps, Gary L",,,514

The proposed metasurface is composed of two kinds of unit cells which are designed on the basis of the spatial k-dispersion engineering of spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). By arranging these two kinds of unit cells in the chessboard configuration, the three functions of transmission, anomalous refraction and absorption can be integrated into one metasurface. High transmission and strong absorption can be achieved in 2.0-9.0 GHz and 12.6-20.0 GHz, respectively. Meanwhile, anomalous refraction can be achieved in 10-11.7 GHz due to forward scattering cancellation of two unit cells. To verify the design, a prototype was fabricated and measured. The measured results are consistent with the simulation ones. The metasurface can integrate multiple functions into one aperture and therefore has potential application values in multifunctional microwave devices such as shared-aperture antennas, etc.","Qu, Bingyue; Pang, Yongqiang; Zhang, An Xue; Yan, Sen; Xu, Zhuo",Opt Express,,514

From November 2019 till February 2021, this virus infected nearly 104 million, with more than two million deaths and about 25 million active cases. This has prompted scientists to discover effective drugs to combat this pandemic. Area covered: Drug repurposing is the magic bullet for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Therefore, several drugs have been investigated in silico, in vitro, as well as through human trials such as anti-SARS-CoV2 agents, or to prevent the complications resulting from the virus. In this review, the mechanisms of action of different therapeutic strategies are summarized. According to the WHO, different classes of drugs can be used, including anti-malarial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-coagulant drugs, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics, vitamins, zinc, neutralizing antibodies, and convalescent plasma therapy. Recently, there are some vaccines which are approved against SARS-CoV2. Expert opinion: A complete understanding of the structure and function of all viral proteins that play a fundamental role in viral infection, which contribute to the therapeutic intervention and the development of vaccine in order to reduce the mortality rate.

500599,Time for a little self-love?,2021,"BACKGROUND: In less well-resourced settings, where access to radiology services is limited, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can be used to assess patients and guide clinical management. The aim of this study was to describe ultrasound practice in the assessment of medical inpatients at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, and evaluate uptake and impact of POCUS following the introduction of a training programme at the college of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS: : A weekly prospective record review of sequential adult medical inpatients who had received an ultrasound examination was conducted. RESULTS: Of 835 patients screened, 250 patients were included; 267 ultrasound examinations were performed, of which 133 (50%) were POCUS (defined as performed by a clinician at the bedside). The time from request to performance of examination was shorter for POCUS examinations than radiology department ultrasound (RDUS) (median 0 [IQR 0-2, range 0-11] vs 2 [IQR 1-4, range 0-15] d, p=0.002); 104/133 (78.2%) POCUS and 90/133 (67.7%) RDUS examinations were deemed to have an impact on management. CONCLUSION: Following the introduction of a training programme in POCUS, half of all ultrasound examinations were delivered as POCUS. POCUS was performed rapidly and impacted on patient management. POCUS may relieve the burden on radiology services in less well-resourced settings.","Limani, Fumbani; Dula, Dingase; Keeley, Alexander J; Joekes, Elizabeth; Phiri, Tamara; Tembo, Ephraim; Gadama, Luis; Nnensa, Victoria; Jordan, Sabine; Mallewa, Jane; Kreuels, Benno",Trans.

510619,Psychological effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on children and families in the UK,2020,"BACKGROUND: The immunization uptake rates in Pakistan are much lower than desired. Major reasons include lack of awareness, parental forgetfulness regarding schedules, and misinformation regarding vaccines. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and distancing measures, routine childhood immunization (RCI) coverage has been adversely affected, as caregivers avoid tertiary care hospitals or primary health centers. Innovative and cost-effective measures must be taken to understand and deal with the issue of low immunization rates. However, only a few smartphone-based interventions have been carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to improve RCI. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether a personalized mobile app can improve children's on-time visits at 10 and 14 weeks of age for RCI as compared with standard care and to determine whether an artificial intelligence model can be incorporated into the app. Secondary objectives are to determine the perceptions and attitudes of caregivers regarding childhood vaccinations and to understand the factors that might influence the effect of a mobile phone-based app on vaccination improvement. METHODS: A mixed methods randomized controlled trial was designed with intervention and control arms. The study will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital vaccination center. Caregivers of newborns or infants visiting the center for their children's 6-week vaccination will be recruited. The intervention arm will have access to a smartphone app with text, voice, video, and pictorial messages regarding RCI. This app will be developed based on the findings of the pretrial qualitative component of the study, in addition to no-show study findings, which will explore caregivers' perceptions about RCI and a mobile phone-based app in improving RCI coverage. RESULTS: Pretrial qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in February 2020. Enrollment of study participants for the randomized controlled trial is in process. Study exit interviews will be conducted at the 14-week immunization visits, provided the caregivers visit the immunization facility at that time, or over the phone when the children are 18 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study will generate useful insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of an Android-based smartphone app for improving RCI in Pakistan and in LMICs.

515675,Thyroid surgery during COVID-19 pandemic: is it feasible?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and the decisions made by the municipal government of Florianópolis (Brazil) regarding social distancing. METHODS: We analyzed new cases of COVID-19 identified in Florianópolis residents between February 1 and July 14, 2020, using a nowcasting approach. Decrees related to COVID-19 published in the Official Gazette of the Municipality between February 1 and July 14, 2020 were also analyzed. Based on the actions proposed in the decrees, whether they loosened social distancing measures, or increased or maintained existing restrictions, was analyzed, thus creating a Social Distancing Index. Time-dependent reproduction numbers (Rt) for a period of 14 days prior to each decree were calculated. A matrix was constructed associating the classification of each decree and the Rt values, analyzing the consonance or dissonance between the potential dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and the actions of the decrees. RESULTS: A total of 5,374 cases of COVID-19 and 26 decrees were analyzed. Nine decrees increased social distancing measures, nine maintained them, and eight loosened them. Of the 26 actions, 9 were consonant and 17 dissonant with the tendency indicated by the Rt. Dissonance was observed in all of the decrees that maintained the distance measures or loosened them. The fastest expansion in the number of new cases and the greatest amount of dissonant decrees was found in the last two months analyzed. CONCLUSION: There was an important divergence between municipal measures of social distancing with epidemiological indicators at the time of each political decision.","Garcia, Leandro Pereira; Traebert, Jefferson; Boing, Alexandra Crispim; Santos, Grazielli Faria Zimmer; Pedebôs, Lucas Alexandre; d039,; Orsi, Eleonora; Prado, Paulo Inacio; Veras, Maria Amelia de Sousa Mascena; Boava, Giuliano; Boing, Antonio Fernando",Rev Bras Epidemiol,,514
515678,COVID-19: a magnifying glass for gender inequalities in medical research,2020,"The coronavirus has come to the world and spread with great wide among the countries of the world and has resulted in numerous infections that exceeded 167,181,023 million patients and are close to 3.5 deaths by September 2021. It also brought with it panic and fear, halted many activities, and led to the decline of the global economy. It changed human behavior and forced people to change their lifestyles to avoid infection. One of the most sectors that must be taken into consideration through pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) around the globe is the air conditioning systems. The HVAC systems depend on the air as a heat transfer medium. The air contains a group of pollutants, viruses, and bacteria, and it affects and destroys human life. The air filter plays a major role as an important component in the air conditioning systems. Thus, it requires more effort by researchers to improve its design to prevent the ultra-size of particles loaded with coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper provides insight into the design of existing combined air-conditioners on their suitability and their impact on the spread of the hybrid coronavirus epidemic and review efforts to obtain a highly efficient air filter to get rid of super-sized particles for protection against epidemic infection. In addition, important guideline recommendations have been made to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to obtain indoor air quality in air-conditioned places.","Elsaid, Ashraf Mimi; Ahmed, M Salem",Environ Res,,514

BACKGROUND: Full gear personal protective equipment is the primary and foremost measure to prevent the contact and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2); however, working in full gear personal protective equipment may hinder nursing care activities and thus negatively affect patients' and nurses' health. DESIGN: This descriptive qualitative inquiry followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of 15 frontline nurses who were dispatched to the outbreak epicentre from March to April 2020. Verbatim transcripts were content analysed. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data: inadequate preparedness for working with full gear personal protective equipment, full gear personal protective equipment stimulated stress responses, coping strategies and professional growth. Participants learned a great deal from problem-focussed and emotion-focussed strategies to tackle challenges related to the prolonged wearing of full gear personal protective equipment for quality nursing care and reduced risk of exposure. They became more vigilant to the adherence to evolving protocols and appropriate training concerning full gear personal protective equipment use. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline nurses confronted various but diminishing challenges related to the use of full gear personal protective equipment when caring for patients with COVID-19 across the approximate 40-day period. Consistent use of coverall personal protective equipment to protect from SARS-CoV-2 in high exposure settings would be feasible if nurses were better prepared; therefore, scenario-based skill training concerning the prolonged use of full gear personal protective equipment should be offered regularly and intensively. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study informs future decisions concerning improved full gear personal protective equipment-related psychomotor training and promoting ways for nurses to cope with the stress that comes from working in highly contiguous environments.","Chen, Feifei; Zang, Yuli; Liu, Yuan; Wang, Xiaomin; Lin, Xingfeng",J Clin Nurs,,514

Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered. METHODS: Reports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel. RESULTS: Pharmacological mechanism, action characteristics and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, reducing Cardiovascular Diseases risk and slowing down the progression of the disease. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing Guideline-principles, pharmacological treatment, biotechnology interference, interventional surgical treatment, managing hypertension with technical means of big data, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Intervention, as well as providing future directions, for facilitating Current and Developing knowledge into clinical implementation.","Hong, Dongsheng; Shan, Wenya",Curr. pharm. des,,514

This report describes two distinct infective episodes of COVID-19 occurring in the same individual, at the time of writing the first published case in the UK. In April 2020 a 25-year-old UK doctor exhibited classical COVID-19 symptoms, including fevers, headaches, and fatigue. A COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the time returned negative. However, a follow-up antibody test in May 2020 returned positive. In October 2020 the same individual exhibited coryzal symptoms and headaches. He was COVID-19 NAAT tested and found to be positive. There was exposure to high viral load prior to reinfection. Overall the second infection was symptomatically milder, with a faster recovery. This evidence for reinfection poses challenges for public health and vaccination efforts to protect against the COVID-19 pandemic.","West, Jack; Everden, Serenydd; Nikitas, Nikitas",,,514
591217,"An Invited Commentary on “World Health Organization declares global emergency: A review of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)"": Emergency or new reality?",2020-03-10,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental disorder in the present day as all individuals' lives, irrespective of being employed or unemployed, is going through the depression phase at least once in their lifetime. In simple terms, it is a mood disturbance that can persist for an individual for more than a few weeks to months. In MDD, in most cases, the individuals do not consult a professional, and even if being consulted, the results are not significant as the individuals find it challenging to identify whether they are depressed or not. Depression, most of the time, cooccurs with anxiety and leads to suicide in few cases, among the employees, who are about to handle the pressure at work and home and mostly unnoticing such problems. This is why this work aims to analyze the IT employees who are mostly working with targets. The artificial neural network, which is modeled loosely like the brain, has proved in recent days that it can perform better than most of the classification algorithms. This study has implemented the multilayered neural perceptron and experimented with the backpropagation technique over the data samples collected from IT professionals. This study aims to develop a model that can classify depressed individuals from those who are not depressed effectively with the data collected from them manually and through sensors. The results show that deep-MLP with backpropagation outperforms other machine learning-based models for effective classification.","Vincent, P. M.

Rapid tests, such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), play an important role in monitoring COVID-19 infection and controlling its spread. However, the changes in the genotypes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants may result in decreased sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assay and it is necessary to monitor the mutations in primers and probes of SARS-CoV-2 detection over time. METHODS: We developed two rRT-PCR assays to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated these assays together with our previously published assays targeting the ORF1ab and N genes for the detection and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern (VOCs). In addition, we also developed two rRT-PCR assays (S484K and S501Y) targeting the spike gene, which when combined with the open reading frames (ORF)1ab assay, respectively, to form duplex rRT-PCR assays, were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (lineages B.1.351 and B.1.1.7). RESULTS: Using a SARS-CoV-2 stock with predetermined genomic copies as a standard, the detection limit of both assays targeting RdRp and N was five copies/reaction. Furthermore, no cross-reactions with six others human CoVs (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) were observed using these assays. In addition, the S484K and S501Y assays were combined with the ORF1ab assay, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Four rRT-PCR assays (RdRp, N, S484K, and S501Y) were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants, and these assays were shown to be effective in screening for multiple virus strains.","Lu, Rou-Jian; Zhao, Li; Huang, Bao-Ying; Ye, Fei; Wang, Wen-Ling; Tan, Wen-Jie",Chin Med J (Engl),https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000001687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402479/,514

Many cytokines play essential roles in carcinogenesis and have been developed for the treatment of cancer. In this study, we identified a novel potential cytokine using immunogenomics designated colon-derived SUSD2 binding factor (CSBF), also known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 99 (C10orf99). CSBF/C10orf99 is a classical secreted protein with predicted molecular mass of 6.5 kDa, and a functional ligand of Sushi Domain Containing 2 (SUSD2). CSBF/C10orf99 has the highest expression level in colon tissue. Both CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 are down-regulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines with different regulation mechanisms. CSBF/C10orf99 interacts with SUSD2 to inhibit colon cancer cell growth and induce G1 cell cycle arrest by down-regulating cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). CSBF/C10orf99 displays a bell-shaped activity curve with the optimal effect at ~10 ng/ml. Its growth inhibitory effects can be blocked by sSUSD2-Fc soluble protein. Our results suggest that CSBF/C10orf99 is a novel potential cytokine with tumor suppressor functions.","Pan, Wen; Cheng, Yingying; Zhang, Heyu; Liu, Baocai; Mo, Xiaoning; Li, Ting; Li, Lin; Cheng, Xiaojing; Zhang, Lianhai; Ji, Jiafu; Wang, Pingzhang; Han, Wenling",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25351403/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep06812,514

Several US states have made strong commitments to this effort through legislation and dedicated funds. However, it is not known if these efforts have resulted in population-level increments in HPV awareness overtime. Using the Health Information National Trends Survey data, we examined the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine in the US, between 2008 and 2018. Prevalence estimates and confidence intervals were calculated for HPV and HPV vaccine awareness. Further, we assessed awareness after stratifying by key sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined over time. The lowest awareness was among racial minorities, rural residents, male respondents, those aged 65 years and older, as well as those with the lowest educational and socioeconomic standing. Between 2013 and 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined by almost 10% among males, those with a high school level of education or lower, and those who earned less than USD 35,000 per annum. In 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine was highest among non-Hispanic whites (65.8% and 66.5%) and female adults (70.5% and 71.4%); however, these figures represented declines of about 5% from rates observed in 2008. Amidst a background of sub-optimal HPV vaccination uptake and a growing incidence of HPV-associated cancers in the US, HPV-related awareness within the general US population has declined over time. This calls for stricter enforcement of legislation aimed at boosting HPV awareness, as well as frequent evaluation of government-funded HPV awareness programs.","Chido-Amajuoyi, Onyema Greg; Jackson, Inimfon; Yu, Robert; Shete, Sanjay",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1783952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692632/,514

Materials and Methods: A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: “COVID-19” (n = 12,137), “Novel corona virus” (n = 63), “COVID-19 and dentistry” (n = 46), “COVID-19 and oral health” (n = 41), “Novel Corona virus and Dentistry” (n = 0), “dental health and Novel Coronavirus” (n = 26), and “dental practice and Novel Coronavirus” (n = 6). Results: After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of >100.4 F or 38 °C should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm. More research highlighting evidence-based safety practices and multisectoral collaboration is required to help dental professionals make informed decisions and make the profession safe, both for the patient and dental professionals.","Mahdi, Syed Sarosh; Ahmed, Zohaib; Allana, Raheel; Peretti, Alessandro; Amenta, Francesco; Nadeem Bijle, Mohammed; Seow, Liang Lin; Daood, Umer",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255716/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56120644,514
609292,Women and COVID-19: reflections for a sexual and reproductive rights-based obstetric care.,2021,"Recently, a highly contagious novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged, posing a global threat to public health. Identifying a potential target and developing vaccines or antiviral drugs is an urgent demand in the absence of approved therapeutic agents. The 5′-capping mechanism of eukaryotic mRNA and some viruses such as coronaviruses (CoVs) are essential for maintaining the RNA stability and protein translation in the virus. SARS-CoV-2 encodes S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase (MTase) enzyme characterized by nsp16 (2′-O-MTase) for generating the capped structure. The present study highlights the binding mechanism of nsp16 and nsp10 to identify the role of nsp10 in MTase activity. Furthermore, we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics behind the binding of SAM to nsp16 and nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer by employing molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. We observed from our simulations that the presence of nsp10 increases the favorable van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between SAM and nsp16. Thus, nsp10 acts as a stimulator for the strong binding of SAM to nsp16. The hydrophobic interactions were predominately identified for the nsp16-nsp10 interactions. Also, the stable hydrogen bonds between Ala83 (nsp16) and Tyr96 (nsp10), and between Gln87 (nsp16) and Leu45 (nsp10) play a vital role in the dimerization of nsp16 and nsp10. Besides, Computational Alanine Scanning (CAS) mutagenesis was performed, which revealed hotspot mutants, namely I40A, V104A, and R86A for the dimer association. Hence, the dimer interface of nsp16/nsp10 could also be a potential target in retarding the 2′-O-MTase activity in SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic process of binding nsp16 and nsp10 that will contribute to the novel design of peptide inhibitors based on nsp16.","Sk, Md Fulbabu; Jonniya, Nisha Amarnath; Roy, Rajarshi; Poddar, Sayan; Kar, Parimal",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330626/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.590165,514

We trialled daily testing of contacts as an alternative to assess whether this resulted in similar control of transmission, while allowing more school attendance. METHODS: We did an open-label, cluster-randomised, controlled trial in secondary schools and further education colleges in England. Schools were randomly assigned (1:1) to self-isolation of school-based COVID-19 contacts for 10 days (control) or to voluntary daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing for 7 days with LFD-negative contacts remaining at school (intervention). Randomisation was stratified according to school type and size, presence of a sixth form, presence of residential students, and proportion of students eligible for free school meals. Group assignment was not masked during procedures or analysis. Coprimary outcomes in all students and staff were COVID-19-related school absence and symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19, adjusted for community case rates, to estimate within-school transmission (non-inferiority margin <50% relative increase). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis using quasi-Poisson regression, also estimating complier average causal effects (CACE). This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN18100261. FINDINGS: Between March 18 and May 4, 2021, 204 schools were taken through the consent process, during which three decided not to participate further. 201 schools were randomly assigned (control group n=99, intervention group n=102) in the 10-week study (April 19–May 10, 2021), which continued until the pre-appointed stop date (June 27, 2021). 76 control group schools and 86 intervention group schools actively participated; additional national data allowed most non-participating schools to be included in analysis of coprimary outcomes. 2432 (42·4%) of 5763 intervention group contacts participated in daily contact testing. There were 657 symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections during 7 782 537 days-at-risk (59·1 per 100 000 per week) in the control group and 740 during 8 379 749 days-at-risk (61·8 per 100 000 per week) in the intervention group (intention-to-treat adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·96 [95% CI 0·75–1·22]; p=0·72; CACE aIRR 0·86 [0·55–1·34]). Among students and staff, there were 59 422 (1·62%) COVID-19-related absences during 3 659 017 person-school-days in the control group and 51 541 (1·34%) during 3 845 208 person-school-days in the intervention group (intention-to-treat aIRR 0·80 [95% CI 0·54–1·19]; p=0·27; CACE aIRR 0·61 [0·30–1·23]). INTERPRETATION: Daily contact testing of school-based contacts was non-inferior to self-isolation for control of COVID-19 transmission, with similar rates of symptomatic infections among students and staff with both approaches. Infection rates in school-based contacts were low, with very few school contacts testing positive. Daily contact testing should be considered for implementation as a safe alternative to home isolation following school-based exposures.

Wearable devices that allow continuous monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), such as the Garmin Fēnix(®) 5X Plus (GAR), might provide early detection to prevent hypoxia-induced diseases. We therefore aimed to validate GAR-derived SpO(2) readings at 4559 m. SpO(2) was measured with GAR and the medically certified Covidien Nellcor SpO(2) monitor (COV) at six time points in 13 healthy lowlanders after a rapid ascent from 1130 m to 4559 m. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis served as the criterion measure and was conducted at four of the six time points with the Radiometer ABL 90 Flex. Validity was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Bland–Altman plots. Mean (±SD) SO(2), including all time points at 4559 m, was 85.2 ± 6.2% with GAR, 81.0 ± 9.4% with COV, and 75.0 ± 9.5% with ABG. Validity of GAR was low, as indicated by the ICC (0.549), the MAPE (9.77%), the mean SO(2) difference (7.0%), and the wide limits of agreement (−6.5; 20.5%) vs. ABG. Validity of COV was good, as indicated by the ICC (0.883), the MAPE (6.15%), and the mean SO(2) difference (0.1%) vs. ABG. The GAR device demonstrated poor validity and cannot be recommended for monitoring SpO(2) at high altitude.","Schiefer, Lisa M.; Treff, Gunnar; Treff, Franziska; Schmidt, Peter; Schäfer, Larissa; Niebauer, Josef; Swenson, Kai E.; Swenson, Erik R.; Berger, Marc M.; Sareban, Mahdi",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640680/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196363,514

The risk of infection or disease in a population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host, and the host population, as well as behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Viral disease epidemiology has come to have a major role in clarifying the etiologic role of particular viruses and viral variants as the cause of specific diseases, in improving our understanding of the overall nature of specific viral diseases, and in determining factors affecting host susceptibility and immunity, in unraveling modes of transmission, in clarifying the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, in determining the safety, efficacy, and utility of vaccines and antiviral drugs, and especially in alerting and directing disease prevention and control actions. Information on incidence, prevalence, and morbidity and mortality rates contributes directly to the establishment of priorities for prevention and control programs, whether this involves vaccine or drug development and delivery, environmental and hygienic improvements, enhancement of nutritional status, personal or community behavior, agricultural and food processing enhancements, reservoir host and vector control, and international cooperation and communication.","Murphy, F.

A Supportive Guide to Help Everyone Working in Healthcare: Look after Yourself by Looking after Others.,2021-09-01,"Points essentiels La Société de pneumologie de langue française définie l’exacerbation aiguë de bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive comme une majoration des symptômes respiratoires au-delà des variations quotidiennes (en pratique, d’une durée ≥ 48 h ou justifiant une modification thérapeutique). La cause de ces exacerbations est principalement infectieuse : virale (rhinovirus, virus influenzae et parainfluenzae, coronavirus, adénovirus et virus respiratoire syncytial) ou bactérienne (principalement, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae et Moraxella catarrhalis). Elles peuvent également résulter de l’exposition à certains polluants : NO2, SO2, ozone et pollution particulaire (PM10 et PM2,5). Elle reste indéterminée dans près de 30 % des cas. Les diagnostics différentiels incluent les pneumopathies infectieuses, les pneumothorax, les poussées d’insuffisance cardiaque et les embolies pulmonaires. La présence de signes de gravité conditionne l’hospitalisation : signes d’insuffisance respiratoire aiguë, de choc ou de défaillance neurologique, mais aussi en cas de patient fragile, d’absence de soutien familial à domicile ou de réponse au traitement initial. Le traitement consiste en une majoration des bronchodilatateurs, une kinésithérapie respiratoire, une antibiothérapie en cas d’expectoration franchement purulente. La prescription de corticoïdes systémiques ne doit pas être systématique. La dose recommandée est de 0,5 mg/kg sur une courte période (5–7 jours). Lors d’une hospitalisation, une oxygénothérapie et une thromboprophylaxie peuvent être instaurées. La ventilation non invasive est principalement indiquée en cas de persistance d’une hypercapnie malgré un traitement médical optimal. Que le patient soit pris en charge en ambulatoire ou en hospitalisation, une réévaluation clinique à 48–72 h est indispensable. Key points The Société de pneumologie de langue française defines acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE COPD) as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms, basically duration ≥ 48h or need for treatment adjustment. Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO2, SO2, ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. Recommended dose is 0.5 mg/kg on short course (5–7 days). During hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. The main interest in non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. During ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment at 48–72 h is mandatory.","Jouneau, Stéphane; Brinchault, Graziella; Desrues, Benoît",Journal Européen des Urgences et de Réanimation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211423815000036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211423815000036,514

A rationalisation of resources and a specific treatment path were necessary. The study suggests a predictive model drawing on clinical data gathered by 119 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in Busto Arsizio hospital. We derived a score that identifies the risk of clinical evolution and in-hospital mortality clustering patients into four groups. The study outcomes have been compared across the derivation and validation samples. The prediction rule is based on eight simple patient characteristics that were independently associated with study outcomes. It is able to stratify COVID-19 patients into four severity classes, with in-hospital mortality rates of 0% in group 1, 6–12.5% in group 2, 7–20% in group 3 and 60–86% in group 4 across the derivation and validation sample. The prediction model derived in this study identifies COVID-19 patients with low risk of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. The prediction model that the study presents identifies COVID-19 patients with low risk of in-hospital mortality and admission to ICU. Moreover, it establishes an intermediate portion of patients that should be treated accurately in order to avoid an unfavourable clinical evolution. A further validation of the model is important before its implementation as a decision-making tool to guide the initial management of patients.","Foieni, Fabrizio; Sala, Girolamo; Mognarelli, Jason Giuseppe; Suigo, Giulia; Zampini, Davide; Pistoia, Matteo; Ciola, Mariella; Ciampani, Tommaso; Ultori, Carolina; Ghiringhelli, Paolo",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02480-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930963/,514

We set out to determine the efficacy and safety of the Swiss LithoClast® Trilogy, in a prospective European multicentre evaluation and compared it to published stone clearance rates for Trilogy based on surface area (68.9 mm(2)/min) and using the 3D calculated stone volume (526.7 mm(3)/min). METHODS: Ten European centres participated in this prospective non-randomized study of Trilogy for PCNL. Objective measures of stone clearance rate, device malfunction, complications and stone-free rates were assessed. Each surgeon subjectively evaluated ergonomic and device effectiveness, on a 1–10 scale (10 = extremely ergonomic/effective) and compared to their usual lithotrite on a 1–10 scale (10 = extremely effective). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty seven PCNLs using Trilogy were included (53% male, 47% female; mean age 55 years, range 13–84 years). Mean stone clearance rate was 65.55 mm(2)/min or 945 mm(3)/min based on calculated 3D volume. Stone-free rate on fluoroscopy screening at the end of the procedure was 83%. Feedback for suction effectiveness was 9.0 with 9.1 for combination and 9.0 for overall effectiveness compared to lithotrite used previously. Ergonomic score was 8.1, the least satisfactory element. Complications included 13 (8.2%) Clavien–Dindo Grade II and 2 (1.3%) Grade III. Probe breakage was seen in 9 (5.7%), none required using a different lithotrite. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that Trilogy is highly effective at stone removal. From a user perspective, the device was perceived by surgeons to be highly effective overall and compared to the most commonly used previous lithotrite, with an excellent safety profile.","Thakare, N.; Tanase, F.; Saeb-Parsy, K.; Atassi, N.; Endriss, R.; Kamphuis, G.; Pérez-Fentes, D.; Hasan, M.; Brehmer, M.; Osther, P.; Jung, H.; Turney, B.; Finch, W.; Burgess, N.; Irving, S.; Dragos, L.; Liatsikos, E.; Knoll, T.; Cauni, V.; Wiseman, O.",World J Urol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03710-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991214/,514

METHOD: : Chest CT derived measurements were evaluated retrospectively for 217 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Using a CT histogram analysis, we measured pectoralis muscle volume (PV) and pectoralis muscle density (PD). Patients were divided into groups first according to gender and then subgroups, which are age and outcome. RESULTS: : The COVID-19 diagnoses were confirmed by RT-PCR testing, chest CT and clinical findings in 217 patients (108 men, 109 women), aged 21-92 years (mean 61 years). PD measurements were lower in the exitus group (p= 0.001) and in patients aged ≥65 than in those aged <65 years (p<0.05). There was a significant difference between PD measurements of outpatient and inpatient under 65 years age (p<0.05). Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between fatty volume measurements according to the exitus status of cases (p <0.05).

METHODS: Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively. RESULTS: A total of 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. In total, 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19-related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.","Cosco, Theodore D; Best, John; Davis, Daniel; Bryden, Daniele; Arkill, Suzanne; van Oppen, James; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin R; Conroy, Simon",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448278/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab008,514

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2018 and June 2019, 200 consecutive hospitalized patients taking oral rivaroxaban, who were diagnosed with NVAF and registered in the hospital information management system, were randomly assigned to a control group (n=100) and a study group (n=100) in a single-blind manner. The control group received pharmaceutical care based on the general pharmaceutical care model whereas the study group received care based on an evidence-based pharmaceutical care model. Patients’ satisfaction and cognition were evaluated regularly using questionnaires. The follow-up time was 1 year. We compared differences in satisfaction and cognition between the two groups after pharmaceutical-related care administered by clinical pharmacists. RESULTS: The study group had higher satisfaction scores than the control group after the EBP intervention (14.58±0.88 vs.13.81±1.01, p<0.01); cognition scores were also higher in the study group (22.58±2.19 vs 20.80±3.02, p<0.01) after the intervention.

Glucose uptake is correlated with an increased anaerobic glycolysis seen in activated inflammatory cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. The aim of the study was to assess the inflammatory status at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in non-critically ill patients requiring admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Patients admitted with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. FDG PET/CT was performed from day 6 to day 14 of the onset of symptoms. Depending on FDG PET/CT findings, patients’ profiles were classified as “inflammatory” or “low inflammatory.” FDG PET/CT data were compared with chest CT evolution and short-term clinical outcome. All inflammatory sites were reported to screen potential extra-pulmonary tropism. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Maximum standardized uptake values ranged from 4.7 to 16.3 in lungs. All patients demonstrated increased mediastinal lymph nodes glucose uptake. Three patients (23%) presented mild nasopharyngeal, two patients (15%) bone marrow, and five patients (38%) splenic mild increase in glucose uptake. No patient had significant digestive focal or segmental glucose uptake. There was no significant physiological myocardial glucose uptake in all patients except one. There was no correlation between PET lung inflammatory status and chest CT evolution or short-term clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory process at the presumed peak of the inflammatory phase in COVID-19 patients is obvious in FDG PET/CT scans. Glucose uptake is heterogeneous and typically focused on lungs.

645274,"COVID19 –Nuclear Medicine Departments, be prepared!",2020-03-11,"As clinicians and support personnel struggle with their responsibilities to treat during the current COVID-19 pandemic, several ethical issues have emerged. Will healthcare workers and support staff fulfill their duty to treat in the face of high risks? Will institutional and government leaders at all levels do the right things to help alleviate healthcare workers risks and fears? Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives? With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment—both to treat patients and protect themselves. With their personal and possibly their family’s lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks—including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers’ risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques). Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions. Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input. Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.","Iserson, Kenneth V.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.4.47549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302284/,514

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the psychological responses toward COVID-19 among university students from 3 countries—Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. METHODS: We used a web-based, cross-sectional survey to recruit 1985 university students from 5 public universities (2 in Indonesia, 1 in Thailand, and 1 in Taiwan) via popular social media platforms such as Facebook, LINE, WhatsApp, and broadcast. All students (n=938 in Indonesia, n=734 in Thailand, and n=313 in Taiwan) answered questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts (or sadness), confidence in pandemic control, risk perception of susceptibility to infection, perceived support, resources for fighting infection, and sources of information in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 3 student groups, Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources for fighting COVID-19. Factors associated with higher anxiety differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian students. On the other hand, Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff than were Indonesian or Thai students. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that health care providers in Thailand may need to pay special attention to Thai university students given that high levels of anxiety were observed in this study population. In addition, health care providers should establish a good support system for university students, as the results of this study indicate a negative association between support and suicidal thoughts.","Pramukti, Iqbal; Strong, Carol; Sitthimongkol, Yajai; Setiawan, Agus; Pandin, Moses Glorino Rumambo; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Ko, Nai-Ying",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296867/,514

The relationship with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain‐like lesions as a COVID‐19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children’s families and pediatricians OBJECTIVES: to verify whether the chilblain‐like lesions were caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. METHODS: prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from April 1 to April 30, 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID‐19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. RESULTS: We evaluated 8 patients (5 females, 3 males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with RT‐PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR‐assay on skin lesion biopsy for Parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS‐CoV‐2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviors, habits, lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, a “cluster” of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious trigger may have contributed to the pathogenesis.","Iria, Neri; Annalucia, Virdi; Ilaria, Corsini; Alba, Guglielmo; Tiziana, Lazzarotto; Liliana, Gabrielli; Cosimo, Misciali; Annalisa, Patrizi; Marcello, Lanari",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533899/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16751,514

However, the roles of lncRNAs in acute myocarditis (AM), especially fulminant myocarditis (FM), remain unclear. METHODS: FM and non-fulminant myocarditis (NFM) were induced by coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) in different mouse strains. Then, the expression profiles of the lncRNAs in the heart tissues were detected by sequencing. Finally, the patterns were analyzed by Pearson/Spearman rank correlation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cytoscape 3.7. RESULTS: First, 1,216, 983, 1,606, and 2,459 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in CVB3-treated A/J, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H mice with myocarditis, respectively. Among them, 88 lncRNAs were commonly dysregulated in all four models. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses further confirmed that four out of the top six commonly dysregulated lncRNAs were upregulated in all four models. Moreover, the levels of ENSMUST00000188819, ENSMUST00000199139, and ENSMUST00000222401 were significantly elevated in the heart and spleen and correlated with the severity of cardiac inflammatory infiltration. Meanwhile, 923 FM-specific dysregulated lncRNAs were detected, among which the levels of MSTRG.26098.49, MSTRG.31307.11, MSTRG.31357.2, and MSTRG.32881.28 were highly correlated with LVEF. CONCLUSION: Expression of lncRNAs is significantly dysregulated in acute myocarditis, which may play different roles in the progression of AM.","Nie, Xiang; Li, Huihui; Wang, Jin; Cai, Yuanyuan; Fan, Jiahui; Dai, Beibei; Chen, Chen; Wang, Dao Wen",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504807/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.704919,514

However, the specific TNF-α receptors (TNFR) involved in this disease and how they mediate this effect are uncertain. Here, we showed that the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the liver and spleen was triggered by MHV-3. However, only TNFR1(−/−) mice were resistant to MHV-3 mediated FH, as displayed by a dramatic decrease in tissue necrosis and cell apoptosis in the infected spleens and livers from TNFR1(−/−) mice, as well as prolonged survival in these mice compared to wild type littermate controls. Mechanistically, TNFR1 deficiency directly impeded the serum and tissue levels of fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), a virus-induced procoagulant molecule that promotes cell apoptosis. Additionally, the expression of apoptosis-associated molecules, Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) in the infected organs from TNFR1(−/−) mice were also decreased. Moreover, the infiltration of neutrophils rather than Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, which produce proinflammatory factors and FGL2 directly, into the infected liver and spleen tissues was also decreased in TNFR1(−/−) mice. These combined results indicate that signaling through TNFR1 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of FH caused by MHV-3 infection, and interruption of this signaling pathway could be useful for clinical therapy.","Xu, Huan; Li, Hong; Cao, Dayan; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Immunol Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.11.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247813001752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286726/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247813001752,514

661109,Outcomes Among HIV-Positive Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, more than 30 % of all newly transplanted kidney transplant recipients in The Netherlands were above 65 years of age. Elderly patients are less prone to rejection, and death censored graft loss is less frequent compared to younger recipients. Elderly recipients do have increased rates of malignancy and infection-related mortality. Poor kidney transplant function in elderly recipients may be related to both pre-existing (i.e. donor-derived) kidney damage and increased susceptibility to nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in kidneys from older donors. Hence, it is pivotal to shift the focus from prevention of rejection to preservation of graft function and prevention of over-immunosuppression in the elderly. The OPTIMIZE study will test the hypothesis that reduced CNI exposure in combination with everolimus will lead to better kidney transplant function, a reduced incidence of complications and improved health-related quality of life for kidney transplant recipients aged 65 years and older, compared to standard immunosuppression. METHODS: This open label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial will include 374 elderly kidney transplant recipients (≥ 65 years) and consists of two strata. Stratum A includes elderly recipients of a kidney from an elderly deceased donor and stratum B includes elderly recipients of a kidney from a living donor or from a deceased donor < 65 years. In each stratum, subjects will be randomized to a standard, tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen with mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids or an adapted immunosuppressive regimen with reduced CNI exposure in combination with everolimus and glucocorticoids. The primary endpoint is ‘successful transplantation’, defined as survival with a functioning graft and an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in stratum A and ≥ 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in stratum B, after 2 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The OPTIMIZE study will help to determine the optimal immunosuppressive regimen after kidney transplantation for elderly patients and the cost-effectiveness of this regimen. It will also provide deeper insight into immunosenescence and both subjective and objective outcomes after kidney transplantation in elderly recipients.

664580,"Ventilators, Guidelines, Judgment, and Trust",2020-06-29,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in governments implementing disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children’s mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents’ bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children’s development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.

668299,What Should the Dean Do?,2012-02-08,"BACKGROUND: Chronic subclinical hemolysis is frequent in patients implanted with Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and is associated with adverse outcomes. Consequences of LVADs-induced subclinical hemolysis on kidney structure and function is currently unknown. METHODS: Thirty-three patients implanted with a Heartmate II LVAD (Abbott, Inc, Chicago IL) were retrospectively studied. Hemolysis, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and the evolution of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate were analyzed. Proximal Tubulopathy (PT) groups were defined according to proteinuria, normoglycemic glycosuria, and electrolytic disorders. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze threshold of LDH values associated with PT. RESULTS: Median LDH between PT groups were statistically different, 688 IU/L [642–703] and 356 IU/L [320–494] in the “PT” and “no PT” groups, respectively p = 0.006. To determine PT group, LDH threshold > 600 IU/L was associated with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 42.1–99.6) and a specificity of 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1–95.6). The ROC's Area Under Curve was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68–0.98). In the “PT” group, patients had 4.2 [2.5–5.0] AKI episodes per year of exposure, versus 1.6 [0.4–3.7] in the “no PT” group, p = 0.03. A higher occurrence of AKI was associated with subsequent development of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (p = 0.02) and death (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LVADs-induced subclinical hemolysis is associated with proximal tubular functional alterations, which in turn contribute to the occurrence of AKI and subsequent CKD. Owing to renal toxicity of hemolysis, measures to reduce subclinical hemolysis intensity as canula position or pump parameters should be systematically considered, as well as specific nephroprotective therapies.","de Nattes, Tristan; Litzler, Pierre-Yves; Gay, Arnaud; Nafeh-Bizet, Catherine; François, Arnaud; Guerrot, Dominique",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253314/,514

The course was free of charge and used e-learning as its main approach. In the end, 2,500 pharmacists were trained. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an in-service and e-learning course for pharmacists working in a public health system. Materials and Methods: Three workshops involving 67 participants were conducted at the conclusion of the course to analyze the perspective of the PSAMM course's faculty (tutors, regional coordinators, professors, and management committee) and students (pharmacists). Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis and qualitative analysis methods were used. Results and Discussion: The strength dimension had the greatest number of items. The qualitative analysis resulted in six categories: the category “E-learning in continuing education” had the most cited items. Internal elements such as in-service hands-on activities directly related to the professionals' roles, course contents, faculty, and the methods to offer the course (the mixed methods and materials) were positively assessed. Nonetheless, external elements were considered critical for the course's outcomes such as investments in the infrastructure of pharmaceutical services, access to the internet, local managers' support for continuing education and innovation implementation, practice of interprofessional collaboration, and political stability. The continuing education course in the public health system was affected by internal elements such as its project and structure as well as external elements such as the sociopolitical scenario. Continuing education investment must be accompanied by infrastructure investment and coordination of services.","Manzini, Fernanda; Diehl, Eliana Elisabeth; Farias, Mareni Rocha; dos Santos, Rosana Isabel; Soares, Luciano; Rech, Norberto; Lorenzoni, Andrigo Antonio; Leite, Silvana Nair",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.561238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324594/,514

The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes of post-primary educators in Ireland regarding the promotion of student wellbeing. Method: Semi-structured interviews (n = 11) were conducted with post-primary educators located across the Republic of Ireland. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Analysis resulted in the interpretation of five themes related to best practice, the value of wellbeing promotion, work-related time constraints, an atheoretical approach to wellbeing promotion and educators’ accounts of their own wellbeing. Participants shared numerous concerns regarding their ability to attend to student wellbeing, principal among which were a lack of appropriate training, work-related time constraints and a potential systematic de-valuing of the wellbeing curriculum relative to the core curriculum. Conclusion: It is recommended that appropriate accreditation be necessary in order to register to teach any aspect of the wellbeing curriculum, and that a requisite wellbeing-orientated knowledge and skillset be mandatory for all educators in order to register as a post-primary teacher with the teaching council in Ireland.","Byrne, David; Carthy, Dr Aiden",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2021.1946928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187345/,514

Though in vitro studies identified various molecules as possible therapies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), these findings call for substantiation by human studies. We conducted this review aiming at reporting evidences on therapies used so far globally for management of COVID-19 in clinical settings. We searched electronic databases as PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and extracted 612 possible studies as on May 31, 2020. We included original studies of any epidemiological design done on human COVID-19 patients and measured clinical outcomes. Finally, following removal of duplicates and studies meeting exclusion criteria, we derived 22 studies, of which eight were clinical trials, seven were case reports and case series, and seven were observational studies. The most reported therapies were hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (eight studies) and lopinavir/ritonavir (four studies). We conclude from the evidence generated so far that interferon combined with antivirals, remdesivir, umifenovir and favipiravir were mostly associated with better clinical outcomes. The therapeutic effect of HCQ was established initially by two clinical trials; one of them showing a reinforcing effect by azithromycin but subsequent studies did not elicit any effectiveness rather increased rate of adverse events was reported. Lopinavir/ritonavir was found beneficial when administered with interferon and ribavirin, but one clinical trial on its sole use proved contrary. As many clinical trials are in process, we expect to get concrete evidences on repurposing of existing drugs based on less biased, high powered studies.","Chakraborty, Debjit; Debnath, Falguni; Biswas, Subrata; Bhatta, Mihir; Ganguly, Suman; Deb, Alok Kumar; Saha, Malay Kumar; Dutta, Shanta",J Clin Med Res,https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849934/,514

In Cyprus, the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9, 2020 and since then 33,567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant (VOC-202012/01) was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall, we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures.","Richter, J.; Fanis, P.; Tryfonos, C.; Koptides, D.; Krashias, G.; Bashiardes, S.; Hadjisavvas, A.; Loizidou, M.; Oulas, A.; Alexandrou, D.; Kalakouta, O.; Panayiotidis, M.
