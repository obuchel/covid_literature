A Case Study,23.191668,3.4746037,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Apparent Young’s modulus (AYM), which reflects the fundamental mechanical property of live cells measured by atomic force microscopy and is determined by substrate stiffness regulated cytoskeletal organization, has been investigated as potential indicators of cell fate in specific cell types. However, applying biophysical cues, such as modulating the substrate stiffness, to regulate AYM and thereby reflect and/or control stem cell lineage specificity for downstream applications, remains a primary challenge during in vitro stem cell expansion. Moreover, substrate stiffness could modulate cell heterogeneity in the single-cell stage and contribute to cell fate regulation, yet the indicative link between AYM and cell fate determination during in vitro dynamic cell expansion (from single-cell stage to multi-cell stage) has not been established. RESULTS: Here, we show that the AYM of cells changed dynamically during passaging and proliferation on substrates with different stiffness. Moreover, the same change in substrate stiffness caused different patterns of AYM change in epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. Embryonic stem cells and their derived progenitor cells exhibited distinguishing AYM changes in response to different substrate stiffness that had significant effects on their maintenance of pluripotency and/or lineage-specific characteristics. On substrates that were too rigid or too soft, fluctuations in AYM occurred during cell passaging and proliferation that led to a loss in lineage specificity. On a substrate with ‘optimal’ stiffness (i.e., 3.5 kPa), the AYM was maintained at a constant level that was consistent with the parental cells during passaging and proliferation and led to preservation of lineage specificity. The effects of substrate stiffness on AYM and downstream cell fate were correlated with intracellular cytoskeletal organization and nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of YAP. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study suggests that optimal substrate stiffness regulated consistent AYM during passaging and proliferation reflects and contributes to hESCs and their derived progenitor cells lineage specificity maintenance, through the underlying mechanistic pathways of stiffness-induced cytoskeletal organization and the downstream YAP signaling. These findings highlighted the potential of AYM as an indicator to select suitable substrate stiffness for stem cell specificity maintenance during in vitro expansion for regenerative applications.","Guo, Anqi; Wang, Bingjie; Lyu, Cheng; Li, Wenjing; Wu, Yaozu; Zhu, Lu; Bi, Ran; Huang, Chenyu; Li, Jiao Jiao; Du, Yanan",Cell Regen,485,18

Mothers’ own milk (MOM) may be considered the ultimate “personalized medicine” since milk composition and bioactive components vary among mothers and multiple milk constituents provide specific protection based on shared exposures between mother and infant. MOM feedings reduce the risks and associated costs of prematurity-associated morbidities, with the greatest reduction afforded by MOM through to NICU discharge. Although black and non-black mothers have similar lactation goals and initiation rates, black VLBW infants are half as likely to receive MOM at NICU discharge in the United States. Black mothers are significantly more likely to be low-income, single heads of household and have more children in the home, increasing the burden of MOM provision. Although rarely considered, the out-of-pocket and opportunity costs associated with providing MOM for VLBW infants are especially onerous for black mothers. When MOM is not available, the NICU assumes the costs of inferior substitutes for MOM, contributing further to disparate outcomes. Novel strategies to mitigate these disparities are urgently needed. IMPACT: Mother’s own milk exemplifies personalized medicine through its unique biologic activity. Hospital factors and social determinants of health are associated with mother’s own milk feedings for very low-birth-weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Notably, out-of-pocket and opportunity costs associated with providing mother’s own milk are borne by mothers. Conceptualizing mother’s own milk feedings as an integral part of NICU care requires consideration of who bears the costs of MOM provision—the mother or the NICU?","Patel, Aloka L.; Johnson, Tricia J.; Meier, Paula P.",Pediatr Res,485,1

However, because it requires direct manipulation of microbial metabolism in situ, establishing a causal link between these two processes remains challenging. We demonstrate an optogenetic method to control gene expression and metabolite production from bacteria residing in the host gut. We genetically engineer an Escherichia coli strain that secretes colanic acid (CA) under the quantitative control of light. Using this optogenetically-controlled strain to induce CA production directly in the Caenorhabditis elegans gut, we reveal the local effect of CA in protecting intestinal mitochondria from stress-induced hyper-fragmentation. We also demonstrate that the lifespan-extending effect of this strain is positively correlated with the intensity of green light, indicating a dose-dependent CA benefit on the host. Thus, optogenetics can be used to achieve quantitative and temporal control of gut bacterial metabolism in order to reveal its local and systemic effects on host health and aging.","Hartsough, Lucas A; Park, Mooncheol; Kotlajich, Matthew V; Lazar, John Tyler; Han, Bing; Lin, Chih-Chun J; Musteata, Elena; Gambill, Lauren; Wang, Meng C; Tabor, Jeffrey J",,485,1

Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, now much improved by genetic engineering. However, even current methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the virus’s ability to grow. Reduced viral growth has the undesired side-effect of reducing the host immune response below that of infection with wild-type. Might some methods of attenuation instead lead to an increased immune response? We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus with innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus pathology and immunity. We find that modification of some virus immune-evasion pathways can indeed reduce pathology yet enhance immunity. Thus, attenuated vaccines can, in principle, be directed to be safe yet create better immunity than is elicited by the wild-type virus.","Antia, Rustom; Ahmed, Hasan; Bull, James J.",PLoS Comput Biol,485,1

In particular, adjuvants that can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses would be particularly advantageous because the majority of licensed vaccines are formulated with aluminum hydroxide (alum) which predominantly promotes antibodies. We previously demonstrated that bacterial-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMV) possess inherent adjuvanticity and drive antigen-specific antibody and cellular immune responses to OMV components. Here, we investigated the ability of OMVs to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity and to function as a stand-alone adjuvant. We show that OMVs are more potent than heat-inactivated and live-attenuated bacteria in driving dendritic cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Mice immunized with OMVs admixed with heterologous peptides generated peptide-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells responses. Notably, OMV adjuvant induced much greater antibody and B cell responses to co-delivered ovalbumin compared to the responses elicited by the adjuvants alum and CpG DNA. Additionally, pre-existing antibodies raised against the OMVs did not impair OMV adjuvanticity upon repeat immunization. These results indicate that vaccines adjuvanted with OMVs elicit robust cellular and humoral immune responses, supporting further development of OMV adjuvant for use in next-generation vaccines.","Prior, J.

Another research priority is evaluating changes in the immune system before and after treatment in responders vs. nonresponders. Our group has been studying immune networks as an accurate reflection of the global immune state. Flow cytometry (FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting) data characterizing immune cell panels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) patients were used to analyze changes in immune networks in this setting. Here, we describe a novel computational pipeline to perform secondary analyses of FACS data using systems biology/machine learning techniques and concepts. The pipeline is centered around comparative Bayesian network analyses of immune networks and is capable of detecting strong signals that conventional methods (such as FlowJo manual gating) might miss.

The effect of airflow-directors on time-averaged characteristics, turbulence intensity, and temperature fluctuation intensity are achieved through the simultaneous measurement of fluctuating velocity and fluctuating temperature using a two-wire probe hot-wire anemometer. Moreover, the influence of airflow-directors on fibre oscillations are also investigated through high-speed photography. The distribution of turbulence intensity and temperature fluctuation intensity reveals the characteristics of fluctuating airflow fields formed by different melt-blowing slot-die nozzles.

Participating centers have implemented varied evidence-based programs that fit their institutional resources and needs, offering a wide range of services including in-person and telephone-based counseling, point of care, interactive voice response systems, referral to the quitline, text- and web-based services, and medications. METHODS: We used a mixed methods comparative case study design to evaluate system-level implementation costs across 15 C3I-funded cancer centers that reported for at least one 6-month period between July 2018 and June 2020. We analyzed operating costs by resource category (e.g., personnel, medications) concurrently with transcripts from semi-structured key-informant interviews conducted during site visits. Personnel salary costs were estimated using Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data adjusted for area and occupation, and non-wage benefits. Qualitative findings provided additional information on intangible resources and contextual factors related to implementation costs. RESULTS: Median total monthly operating costs across funded centers were $11,045 (range: $5129–$20,751). The largest median operating cost category was personnel ($10,307; range: $4122–$19,794), with the highest personnel costs attributable to the provision of in-person program services. Monthly (non-zero) cost ranges for other categories were medications ($17–$573), materials ($6–$435), training ($96–$516), technology ($171–$2759), and equipment ($10–$620). Median cost-per-participant was $466 (range: $70–$2093) and cost-per-quit was $2688 (range: $330–$9628), with sites offering different combinations of program components, ranging from individually-delivered in-person counseling only to one program that offered all components. Site interviews provided context for understanding variations in program components and their cost implications. CONCLUSIONS: Among most centers that have progressed in tobacco treatment program implementation, cost-per-quit was modest relative to other prevention interventions. Although select centers have achieved similar average costs by offering program components of various levels of intensity, they have varied widely in program reach and effectiveness. Evaluating implementation costs of such programs alongside reach and effectiveness is necessary to provide decision makers in oncology settings with the important additional information needed to optimize resource allocation when establishing tobacco treatment programs.","Salloum, Ramzi G.; D’Angelo, Heather; Theis, Ryan P.; Rolland, Betsy; Hohl, Sarah; Pauk, Danielle; LeLaurin, Jennifer H.; Asvat, Yasmin; Chen, Li-Shiun; Day, Andrew T.; Goldstein, Adam O.; Hitsman, Brian; Hudson, Deborah; King, Andrea C.; Lam, Cho Y.; Lenhoff, Katie; Levinson, Arnold H.; Prochaska, Judith; Smieliauskas, Fabrice; Taylor, Kathryn; Thomas, Janet; Tindle, Hilary; Tong, Elisa; White, Justin S.; Vogel, W.

A clinical peculiarity of cancer pain is the breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), which is defined as a temporary exacerbation of pain that “breaks through” a phase of adequate pain control by an opioid-based therapy. The NP-BTcP occurs in the absence of any specific activity. In this paper, we addressed the topic through a mathematical approach to provide many indications for identifying the diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in NP-BTcP management. ABSTRACT: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a temporary exacerbation of pain that “breaks through” a phase of adequate pain control by an opioid-based therapy. The non-predictable BTcP (NP-BTcP) is a subtype of BTcP that occurs in the absence of any specific activity. Since NP-BTcP has an important clinical impact, this analysis is aimed at characterizing the NP-BTcP phenomenon through a multidimensional statistical technique. This is a secondary analysis based on the Italian Oncologic Pain multiSetting—Multicentric Survey (IOPS-MS). A correlation analysis was performed to characterize the NP-BTcP profile about its intensity, number of episodes per day, and type. The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) determined the identification of four groups (phenotypes). A univariate analysis was performed to assess differences between the four phenotypes and selected covariates. The four phenotypes represent the hierarchical classification according to the status of NP-BTcP: from the best (phenotype 1) to the worst (phenotype 4). The univariate analysis found a significant association between the onset time >10 min in the phenotype 1 (37.3%)’ vs. the onset > 10 min in phenotype 4 (25.8%) (p < 0.001). Phenotype 1 was characterized by the gastrointestinal type of cancer (26.4%) with respect to phenotype 4, where the most frequent cancer affected the lung (28.8%) (p < 0.001). Phenotype 4 was mainly managed with rapid-onset opioids, while in phenotype 1, many patients were treated with oral, subcutaneous, or intravenous morphine (56.4% and 44.4%, respectively; p = 0.008). The ability to characterize NP-BTcP can offer enormous benefits for the management of this serious aspect of cancer pain. Although requiring validation, this strategy can provide many indications for identifying the diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in NP-BTcP management.","Cascella, Marco; Crispo, Anna; Esposito, Gennaro; Forte, Cira Antonietta; Coluccia, Sergio; Porciello, Giuseppe; Amore, Alfonso; Bimonte, Sabrina; Mercadante, Sebastiano; Caraceni, Augusto; Mammucari, Massimo; Marchetti, Paolo; Mediati, Rocco Domenico; Natoli, Silvia; Tonini, Giuseppe; Cuomo, Arturo",Cancers (Basel),485,1

This aim of this technical note is to help in triaging patients with brain tumours who are sent for radiotherapy during this pandemic and to provide safe and evidence-based care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published data for this review were identified by systematically searching PubMed database from November 2007 onwards with the following Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms ‘Brain tumours’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘SARS-nCoV-2’, ‘Radiotherapy’, ‘Guidelines’ ‘hypofractionation’ using Boolean search algorithm. Articles in English language were reviewed. RESULTS: We tried to apply the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle in triaging and management of patients for radiotherapy. We identified protocols which have hypofractionated regimens (reducing patient visits to hospital, time spent in treatment console) with similar outcomes when compared to conventional fractionated regimens and not overburdening the healthcare facility. We also identified the tumours for which we could safely avoid or delay the initiation of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic rely on the safety first/do no harm principle and evidence-based prioritisation of cases for triage. This article is a tool to aid in triaging and prioritising brain tumour patient management.

The 2032 projected forest species cover map indicate a strong regression of Cedar atlas and thuriferous juniper cover and a medium regression of mixture holm oak and thuriferous juniper, mixture of atlas cedar and thuriferous juniper, and sylvatic and asylvatic vacuums, a very strong progression of holm oak, and of mixture atlas cedar, holm oak and thuriferous juniper and medium progression of mixture of atlas cedar and holm oak. These findings provide important insights to planners, natural resource managers and policy-makers to reconsider their strategies to ensure the sustainability goals.","Legdou, Anass; Chafik, Hassan; Amine, Aouatif; Lahssini, Said; Berrada, Mohamed",Image and Signal Processing,485,1

However, the application of feedback indicators in the clinic practice is rare. Pulse oximetry has been widely used and reported to correlate spontaneous circulation restoration during CPR. However, it is unclear if pulse oximetry can monitor the quality of chest compression. We hypothesized that pulse rate monitored by pulse oximetry can be used as a feedback indicator of the chest compression rate during CPR in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. Seven domestic male pigs (30–35 kg) were utilized in this study. Eighteen intermittent chest compression periods of 2 min were performed on each animal. Chest compression and pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveforms were recorded simultaneously. Chest compression and pulse rates were calculated based on both waveforms. Compression interruption and synchronous pulse interruption times were also measured. Agreement was analyzed between pulse rates and synchronous chest compression rates, as well as between compression interruption times and synchronous pulse interruption times. A total of 126 compression periods of 2 min were performed on seven animals. Interclass correlation coefficients and Bland–Altman analysis revealed reliable agreement between pulse rates and synchronous chest compression rates. Similarly, compression interruption and synchronous pulse interruption times obtained also showed high agreement. Pulse rate can be used as an alternative indicator of chest compression rate during CPR in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. Pulse interruption time also can be used to reflect compression interruption time precisely in this model.","Fu, Yangyang; Yin, Lu; Seery, Samuel; Dai, Jiayuan; Zhu, Huadong; Jin, Kui; Li, Yi; Yu, Shanshan; Zhang, Lili; Xu, Jun; Yu, Xuezhong",J Clin Monit Comput,485,1

This article explores instructional techniques used in the transition, student perceptions of effectiveness/enjoyment/accessibility of those techniques, barriers that students faced due to the transition, and race/class/gender inequality in experiencing those barriers. We used surveys in introductory courses by two instructors (the authors) to compare students’ reactions to our transitions and the transitions in their other courses. We found that which instructional technique instructors use is less important than how well they implement it for student learning. Although there is a tradeoff between enjoyment and accessibility, instructors can use techniques to increase accessibility of interactive formats. Internet and technology barriers were extremely common, even for students who did not anticipate problems. Most students experienced barriers to their learning due to the pandemic, including distractions, increased anxiety, and feeling less motivated, especially for nonwhite, female, and first-generation college students.","Gillis, Alanna; Krull, Laura M.",Teach Sociol,485,1

Since early immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) set the stage for subsequent control or progression to active tuberculosis disease, early host–pathogen interactions following Mtb infection can be thought of as establishing a mycobacterial “set point,” which we define as the mycobacterial burden at the point of adaptive immune activation. This early immune response is impaired in the context of HIV coinfection, allowing for a higher mycobacterial set point and greater likelihood of progression to active disease with greater bacterial burden. Alveolar macrophages, as the first cells to encounter Mtb in the lungs, play a critical role in containing Mtb growth and establishing the mycobacterial set point. However, a number of key macrophage functions, ranging from pathogen recognition and uptake to phagocytosis and microbial killing, are blunted in HIV coinfection. To date, research evaluating the effects of HIV on the alveolar macrophage response to Mtb has been relatively limited, particularly with regard to the critical early events that help to dictate the mycobacterial set point. A greater understanding of alveolar macrophage functions impacted by HIV coinfection will improve our understanding of protective immunity to Mtb and may reveal novel pathways amenable to intervention to improve both early immune control of Mtb and clinical outcomes for the millions of people worldwide infected with HIV.","Auld, Sara C.; Staitieh, Bashar S.",Retrovirology,485,22

Functional studies demonstrated that PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor directing it to its lysosomal degradation. Therefore, carriers of gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 exhibit decreased expression of LDL receptors on the hepatocyte surface and have higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. On the contrary, loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with low LDL-C concentrations and significantly reduced lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. These insights motivated the search for strategies to pharmacologically inhibit PCSK9. In an exemplary rapid development, fully human monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 were developed and found to effectively reduce LDL-C. Administered subcutaneously every 2–4 weeks, the PCSK9 antibodies evolocumab and alirocumab reduce LDL-C by up to 60% in a broad range of populations either as monotherapy or in addition to statins. Two large cardiovascular outcome trials involving a total of ∼46,000 cardiovascular high-risk patients on guideline-recommended lipid-lowering therapy showed that treatment with evolocumab and alirocumab led to a relative reduction of cardiovascular risk by 15% after 2.2 and 2.8 years of treatment, respectively. These findings expanded the armamentarium of pharmacological approaches to address residual cardiovascular risk associated with LDL-C. Furthermore, the unprecedented low LDL-C concentrations achieved (e.g., 30 mg/dL in the FOURIER study) suggest that the relationship between LDL-C and cardiovascular risk is without a lower threshold, and without associated adverse events during the timeframe of the studies. The side effect profile of PCSK9 antibodies is favorable with few patients exhibiting injection-site reactions. Currently, the access to PCSK9 antibodies is limited by high treatment costs. The development of novel approaches to inhibit PCSK9 such as the use of small interfering RNA to inhibit PCSK9 synthesis seems promising and may soon become available.","Katzmann, Julius L.; Gouni-Berthold, Ioanna; Laufs, Ulrich",Front Physiol,485,1

METHODS: The GCCCR is a deidentified registry of patients <19 years of age with cancer or recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic data, cancer diagnosis, cancer-directed therapy, and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected. Outcomes were collected at 30-days and 60-days post infection. RESULTS: As of August 10(th) 2020, the GCCCR included 730 cases from 35 countries, including 64 children with CNS tumors (8.8%) from 17 countries. The most frequent diagnoses were embryonal tumors (31.2%) and low-grade glioma (17.2%). Thirty-nine (60.9%) children were asymptomatic from infection, while 19 (29.7%) patients required hospital admission and 2 (6.3%) transferred to the intensive care unit. There was a significant association between infection severity and ANC <500 (p=0.04). At the time of infection, 44 (68.8%) patients were undergoing cancer-directed therapy. Thirty-two cases have follow-up data. No modification in cancer-directed therapy occurred in 11 (34.4%) patients, while chemotherapy was modified in 6 (18.8%), radiotherapy delayed in 2 (6.3%), and surgery postponed in 1 (3.1%). No patients died from SARS-CoV-2 infection, although 2 died from non-COVID-19 related causes. CONCLUSION: The frequency and severity of COVID infection among children with CNS tumors appears to be proportionally lower compared to other children with cancer. Although this is the largest cohort of patients reported to date, additional insight is needed, including the effects of treatment modifications on outcomes.","Moreira, Daniel; Bouffet, Eric; Bhakta, Nickhill; Chantada, Guillermo; Chen, Yichen; Faughnan, Lane; Vedaraju, Yuvanesh; Avula, Maghana; Homsi, Maysam; Naidu, Paula; Pappas, Andrew; Ranadive, Radhikesh; Santana, Victor; Sullivan, Michael; Baroni, Lorena; Caniza, Miguela; Devidas, Meenakshi; Pritchard-Jones, Kathy; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Mukkada, Sheena",Neuro Oncol,485,1

Conferences often bridge this gap, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced their indefinite delay. Virtual solutions are needed to capitalize on the breadth of national simulation research experts and grow mentorship in a postpandemic world. Methods We developed two complementary innovations to facilitate scholarship development and minimize COVID-associated career challenges resulting from social distancing requirements. The e-fellows forum (FF) provides a capstone experience for works-in-progress and the e-consultation service (CS) supports simulation research during the earlier project stages of design and development. In conjunction with the Society for Academic Medicine's Simulation Academy, we applied videoconferencing technology for both of these novel, virtual innovations. We analyzed corresponding chat transcripts and detailed field notes for emerging themes. In addition, we collected quantitative data via participant surveys regarding their experiences and impact on their projects. Results Nine simulation fellows presented at the FF and seven junior simulation investigators participated in the CS sessions. Most preferred the virtual format (56% FF, 66% CS) and found the sessions to be helpful in project advancement (66% FF, 100% CS). COVID-19 affected most projects (89% FF, 67% CS). We identified three themes via qualitative analysis: design concerns and inquiries, validation or support shown by mentors and peers, and professional cohesion. Conclusions Participants felt that both virtual mentorship innovations advanced their simulation research projects and fostered a sense of professional cohesion within a greater community of practice. These benefits can be powerful at a time where simulation researchers in EM feel disconnected in an era of social distancing. Our future work will include adaptations to a hybrid model with both virtual and in-person modalities as well as creation of more e-mentorship opportunities, thus broadening the early-career simulation research community of practice.","Stapleton, Stephanie N; Wong, Ambrose H; Ray, Jessica M; Rider, Ashley C; Moadel, Tiffany; Bentley, Suzanne; Cassara, Michael",AEM education and training,485,20

Rapid degradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by dsRNA-degrading nucleases (dsRNases) has been implicated to cause low RNAi efficiency in several insect species. In this study, we identified four dsRNase genes (OfdsRNase1, OfdsRNase2, OfdsRNase3 and OfdsRNase4) from the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) transcriptome database. Bioinformatic analyses showed that each deduced protein sequence contained endonuclease NS domains and signal peptides. Gene expression analysis revealed that OfdsRNase2 was exclusively expressed in the midgut of larvae. RNAi efficiency was investigated in 2-day-old fifth-instar larvae (high expression of dsRNase2) and 2-day-old pupae (low expression of dsRNase2) by feeding or injecting dsRNA targeting a marker gene that encodes the lethal giant larvae protein (OfLgl). Our results showed that OfLgl only partially silenced the expression of OfLgl in pupae, but not in larvae, suggesting that OfdsRNase2 could contribute to lower RNAi efficiency in larval stages. This hypothesis was supported by our RNAi-of-RNAi experiment using a tissue culture technique where the silencing efficiency against the reporter gene, OfHex1, was significantly improved after knockdown of OfdsRNase2. When double luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the role of the four dsRNases in vitro, only OfdsRNase2 expressed in S2 cells significantly affected RNAi efficiency by degrading dsRNA. Taken together, our results suggested that the degradation of dsRNA by OfdsRNase2 in the midgut contributed to low RNAi efficiency in O. furnacalis larvae. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN AND METHODS From September 2007 through January 2008 several episodes of hPIV-3 infection were observed among young patients followed at the Oncohematology Unit (OHU) or other units of the Pediatrics Department. In 32 young patients (median age 3.5 years, range 21 days-27 years), hPIV-3 infection was diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody staining of cells from respiratory secretions, and virus quantified by real-time RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In addition, the epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing two variable regions of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene (nt 1-569 and nt 762-1239). RESULTS Of the 32 hPIV-3-positive patients, 19 were hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients, 8 had hematologic malignancies, and 5 were immunocompetent children. Sixteen patients had upper, and 16 lower respiratory tract infection. All patients but one had high viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (>1.0x10(6) RNA copies/mL). One patient died from respiratory failure with a high viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 16/32 strains were identical. Besides this major cluster, three other clusters were identified, each one defining a smaller outbreak. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic analysis allows identification of the role of a single or multiple hPIV-3 strains in the person-to-person transmission within an outbreak occurring in clinical units.","Piralla, Antonio; Percivalle, Elena; Di Cesare-Merlone, Alessandra; Locatelli, Franco; Gerna, Giuseppe",Haematologica,485,17

A second hair stylist (stylist B), who had been exposed to stylist A, developed respiratory symptoms on May 15, 2020 (day 3), and worked with clients at salon A until day 8 before seeking testing for SARS-CoV-2, which returned a positive result on day 10. A total of 139 clients were directly serviced by stylists A and B from the time they developed symptoms until they took leave from work. Stylists A and B and the 139 clients followed the City of Springfield ordinance* and salon A policy recommending the use of face coverings (i.e., surgical masks, N95 respirators,† or cloth face coverings) for both stylists and clients during their interactions. Other stylists at salon A who worked closely with stylists A and B were identified, quarantined, and monitored daily for 14 days after their last exposure to stylists A or B. None of these stylists reported COVID-19 symptoms. After stylist B received a positive test result on day 10, salon A closed for 3 days to disinfect frequently touched and contaminated areas. After public health contact tracings and 2 weeks of follow-up, no COVID-19 symptoms were identified among the 139 exposed clients or their secondary contacts. The citywide ordinance and company policy might have played a role in preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 during these exposures. These findings support the role of source control in preventing transmission and can inform the development of public health policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. As stay-at-home orders are lifted, professional and social interactions in the community will present more opportunities for spread of SARS-CoV-2. Broader implementation of masking policies could mitigate the spread of infection in the general population.","Hendrix, M Joshua; Walde, Charles; Findley, Kendra; Trotman, Robin",MMWR.

We primarily compared the efficacy of Baska mask (BM) and laryngeal mask airway supreme (LMAS) for the rate of first time successful placement and the seal pressure. The secondary outcome measures included laryngopharyngeal morbidity and the correct positioning of the gastric port. Material and Methods A sample size of 30 was calculated in each study group. A total of 70 study participants were included in the statistical analysis of which 36 patients were in the BM group and 34 patients were in the LMAS group. Results The BM was successfully inserted in 28 patients (77.8%), whereas LMAS was successfully inserted in 33 patients (97.1%) in the first attempt (P = 0.028). The mean oropharyngeal seal pressure in the BM group was higher (33.28 ± 6.80 cm H2O) than compared to the LMAS group (27.47 ± 2.34 cm H2O) with a P value <0.001.

Successful management of such outbreaks has depended upon intensive screening of patients to identify those that are colonized and the subsequent isolation or cohorting of affected patients to prevent onward transmission. Here we describe the evaluation of a novel chromogenic agar, CHROMagarTM Candida Plus, for the specific identification of Candida auris isolates from patient samples. Candida auris colonies on CHROMagarTM Candida Plus are pale cream with a distinctive blue halo that diffuses into the surrounding agar. Of over 50 different species of Candida and related genera that were cultured in parallel, only the vanishingly rare species Candida diddensiae gave a similar appearance. Moreover, both the rate of growth and number of colonies of C. auris recovered from swabs of pure and mixed Candida species were substantially increased on CHROMagarTM Candida Plus agar when compared with growth on the traditional mycological isolation medium, Sabouraud dextrose agar. Taken together, the present data suggest that CHROMagarTM Candida Plus agar is an excellent alternative to current conventional mycological media for the screening of patients who are potentially colonized/infected with Candida auris, can be reliably used to identify this emerging fungal pathogen, and should be tested in a clinical setting.","Borman, Andrew M; Fraser, Mark; Johnson, Elizabeth M",Medical mycology,485,1

The aim of this study was to develop a novel HORC model that contains the retina, RPE-choroid and sclera to maintain retinal integrity when culturing retinal explants. After cutting circumferentially along the limbus to remove iris and lens, four deep incisions were made to flatten the eyecup. In contrast to previous HORC protocols, a trephine was used to cut through not only the retina but also the RPE-choroid and sclera. The resultant triple-layered explants were cultured for 72 h. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&E) was used to assess anatomical structures and retinal explants were further characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for apoptosis, Müller cell integrity and retinal inflammation. To confirm the possibility of disease induction, explants were exposed to high glucose (HG) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cyt), to mimic diabetic retinopathy (DR). The Luminex magnetic bead assay was used to measure DR-related cytokines released into the culture medium. H&E staining revealed distinct retinal lamellae and compact nuclei in retinal explants with the underlying RPE-choroid and sclera, while retinas without the underlying structures exhibited reduced thickness and severe nuclei loss. IHC results indicated absence of apoptosis and retinal inflammation as well as preserved Müller cell integrity. The Luminex assays showed significantly increased secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in retinal explants exposed to HG + Cyt relative to baseline levels at 24 h. We successfully developed and characterized a novel HORC protocol in which retinal integrity was preserved without apoptosis or retinal inflammation. Moreover, the induced secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory biomarkers when exposing retinal explants to HG + Cyt suggests that this model could be used for clinically translatable retinal disease studies.","Kuo, Charisse Y J; Louie, Henry H; Rupenthal, Ilva D; Mugisho, Odunayo O",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,485,19

The use of a rigid barrier between the heart and the sharp sternal edges has been successfully tested on pigs. In the present article, we demonstrate increased safety in NPWT through the use of the HeartShield device. METHODS Six patients were treated with a specially designed device in combination with NPWT. The device consists of a horizontally placed disk covered in foam. The back of the T-shaped device sticks up between the sternal edges and up above skin level. This part of the device is also covered in foam. Drainage is performed through two holes at the top of the device. The device and foam are changed every second to third day, and -120 mm Hg of continuous therapy is used. Six patients were treated with traditional NPWT, serving as control group. RESULTS No signs of calluslike formation were seen on the right ventricle in the group treated with the HeartShield device. In the conventional NPWT control group, all six patients had calluslike formation (>1 × 2 cm2) on the anterior part of the right ventricle. All patients in the HeartShield group had grade 1 epicardial petechial bleeding (<0.5 cm2) on the right ventricle. In the control group, one patient had grade 1 (<0.5 cm2), three patients had grade 2 (0.5-2.0 cm2), and two patients had grade 3 (>2.0 cm2) epicardial petechial bleeding on the right ventricle. No major bleeding or mortality was observed in either group during the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS The use of the HeartShield device significantly minimizes the contact between the right ventricle and the sternal edges, thereby decreasing the risk for life-threatening complications due to bleeding.","Ingemansson, Richard; Malmsjö, Malin; Lindstedt, Sandra",Innovations,485,1

Although intermediate distal access catheters can go beyond the tortuous segment of internal carotid arteries, they may increase the risk of procedure-related complications, require significantly complex technical procedures, and limit the use of adjunctive techniques. Using simple neck extension alone, we successfully improved guiding catheter access in 2 patients. METHODS Through a provocative test, we confirmed suitability of manual neck extension in 2 patients with severe posterior curvature of a tortuous internal carotid artery. Intraoperatively, we manually extended the neck and stretched the curvatures. We guided a 6F guiding catheter superiorly and performed coil embolization with an occlusion balloon catheter in 1 case and with the balloon-assisted neck remodeling technique in 1 case. RESULTS Coil embolization was completed without any adverse events in both cases. CONCLUSIONS The simple neck extension technique successfully improved accessibility of the guiding catheter. As the need for safe and highly skilled intervention increases, our technique may be useful because it can reduce procedure-related complications and allow balloon-assisted techniques.","Takata, Megumu; Fukuda, Hitoshi; Kinosada, Masanori; Miyake, Kosuke; Murao, Kenichi",World neurosurgery,485,26

RECENT FINDINGS The potential reach of social media is overwhelmingly encouraging, but academic organizations have much work to do in order to compete for viewership on social media platforms, and users need to remain vigilant of easily spread misinformation. Individual ophthalmology practices can tailor their social media presence to attract and educate patients. Using hashtags to supplement the experience of academic conferences has boosted engagement both of attendees and other interested parties. As an effective indicator of the popularity of different subjects in medicine, new studies are leveraging social media for epidemiological models. Finally, social media is emerging as a powerful tool for patient advocacy in ophthalmology. SUMMARY The accessibility of social media uniquely positions it to educate patients, disseminate public eye health initiatives, and increase the reach of individual physicians.

Thus, we refined our laparoscopic technique from a simple hernia sac ligation into combined posterior wall repair for pediatric groin hernias. METHODS Between March 2010 and March 2013, 41 consecutive infants and children with primary inguinal hernia were treated surgically with our refined mini-laparoscopic hernia technique. The mean patient age was 4.5 years. Before hernia repair, there were synchronous bilateral hernias in 4 (9.7 %), left inguinal hernias in 14 (34.2 %) and right inguinal hernias in 23 (56.1 %). The mini-laparoscopic hernia repair was carried out with three 3.5 mm trocar ports including 3 mm telescope and 3 mm instruments. RESULTS Totally 61 repairs were performed. The mean follow-up period was 12 months. The mean operation time was 45 min. None of the repaired groin hernias had a recurrence or procedure-related complication during the period of follow-up. None of them experienced a chronic pain postoperatively. To date there was no scrotal or testicular complication detected by regular ultrasonographic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our refined laparoscopic technique is a safe and effective method in the management of groin hernias in infants and children with a minimal early recurrence rate.","Tsai, Y-C; Da Lin, C; Chueh, S-C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,485,24

We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive antibody test based on single molecule array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient-reported health outcomes after hospital admission for acute stroke. METHODS This retrospective study included adults with acute stroke admitted to the University College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Hyperacute Stroke Unit. We included two separate cohorts of consecutively enrolled patients from the same geographical population at two time points: 16th March-16th May 2018 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic); and 16th March-16th May 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Patients in both cohorts completed the validated Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29 version 2.0) at 30 days after stroke. RESULTS We included 205 patients who were alive at 30 days (106 admitted before and 99 admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic), of whom 201/205 (98%) provided patient-reported health outcomes. After adjustment for confounding factors, admission with acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with increased anxiety (β = 28.0, p < 0.001), fatigue (β = 9.3, p < 0.001), depression (β = 4.5, p = 0.002), sleep disturbance (β = 2.3, p = 0.018), pain interference (β = 10.8, p < 0.001); and reduced physical function (β = 5.2, p < 0.001) and participation in social roles and activities (β = 6.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared with the pre-pandemic cohort, patients admitted with acute stroke during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reported poorer health outcomes at 30 day follow-up in all domains. Stroke service planning for any future pandemic should include measures to mitigate this major adverse impact on patient health.","Ozkan, Hatice; Ambler, Gareth; Banerjee, Gargi; Chan, Edgar; Browning, Simone; Mitchell, John; Perry, Richard; Leff, Alex P; Simister, Robert J; Werring, David J",Journal of neurology,485,30

Loss of ACE2 function is implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathogenesis, but little is known about ACE2 biogenesis and activity in the airways. We report that ACE2 is shed from human airway epithelia, a site of SARS-CoV infection. The regulation of ACE2 release was investigated in polarized human airway epithelia. Constitutive generation of soluble ACE2 was inhibited by DPC 333, implicating a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17). Phorbol ester, ionomycin, endotoxin, and IL-1beta and TNFalpha acutely induced ACE2 release, further supporting that ADAM17 and ADAM10 regulate ACE2 cleavage. Soluble ACE2 was enzymatically active and partially inhibited virus entry into target cells. We determined that the ACE2 cleavage site resides between amino acid 716 and the putative transmembrane domain starting at amino acid 741. To reveal structural determinants underlying ACE2 release, several mutant and chimeric ACE2 proteins were engineered. Neither the juxtamembrane stalk region, transmembrane domain, nor the cytosolic domain was needed for constitutive ACE2 release. Interestingly, a point mutation in the ACE2 ectodomain, L584A, markedly attenuated shedding. The resultant ACE2-L584A mutant trafficked to the cell membrane and facilitated SARS-CoV entry into target cells, suggesting that the ACE2 ectodomain regulates its release and that residue L584 might be part of a putative sheddase ""recognition motif."" Thus ACE2 must be cell associated to serve as a CoV receptor and soluble ACE2 might play a role in modifying inflammatory processes at the airway mucosal surface.","Jia, Hong Peng; Look, Dwight C; Tan, Ping; Shi, Lei; Hickey, Melissa; Gakhar, Lokesh; Chappell, Mark C; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; McCray, Paul B",American journal of physiology.

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence, outcomes, and risk profile of in-hospital CPRA for patients receiving opioids and medications with central nervous system sedating side effects (sedatives). METHODS A retrospective analysis of adult inpatient discharges from 2008-2012 reported in the Premier Database. Patients were grouped into four mutually exclusive categories: (1) opioids and sedatives, (2) opioids only, (3) sedatives only, and (4) neither opioids nor sedatives. RESULTS Among 21,276,691 inpatient discharges, 53% received opioids with or without sedatives. A total of 96,554 patients suffered CPRA (0.92 per 1000 hospital bed-days). Patients who received opioids and sedatives had an adjusted odds ratio for CPRA of 3.47 (95% CI: 3.40-3.54; p<0.0001) compared with patients not receiving opioids or sedatives. Opioids alone and sedatives alone were associated with a 1.81-fold and a 1.82-fold (p<0.0001 for both) increase in the odds of CPRA, respectively. In opioid patients, locations of CPRA were intensive care (54%), general care floor (25%), and stepdown units (15%). Only 42% of patients survived CPRA and only 22% were discharged home. Opioid patients with CPRA had mean increased hospital lengths of stay of 7.57 days and mean increased total hospital costs of $27,569. CONCLUSIONS Opioids and sedatives are independent and additive risk factors for in-hospital CPRA. The impact of opioid sparing analgesia, reduced sedative use, and better monitoring on CPRA incidence deserves further study.","Overdyk, Frank J; Dowling, Oonagh; Marino, Joseph; Qiu, Jiejing; Chien, Hung-Lun; Erslon, Mary; Morrison, Neil; Harrison, Brooke; Dahan, Albert; Gan, Tong J",PloS one,485,1

Data about outcome of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in these patients remains scarce. METHODS Eight patients with dyskinetic CP and DBS of the Globus Pallidus internus were investigated. Using pre- and postoperative videos the severity of dystonia and changes thereof during standardized settings ('on') and after the stimulator had been switched off ('off') were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Furthermore, subjective impression (SI) of the extent of postoperative change as well as gait (Leonardo Mechanograph® Gangway), speech (Frenchay Dysarthria) and swallowing performances (fiberoptic laryngoscopy) were assessed during 'on' and 'off'. RESULTS When comparing pre- and postoperative as well as 'on' and 'off', the BFMDRS and most of the gait, speech, and swallowing parameters did not differ significantly. In contrast, patients reported significant improvement of their SI postoperatively (3.1 on a 10-point-scale). CONCLUSION Data show that our CP-patients did not benefit from GPi-DBS when tested formally for dystonia, gait, speech and swallowing.

STUDY DESIGN Case series with planned data collection. METHODS An analysis was undertaken of 314 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary academic practice between January 2009 and April 2013. There were 187 patients with single-gland disease; 68 failed to meet inclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 119 patients. Preoperative parathyroid hormone, calcium, ionized calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate values were determined, along with postoperative calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative parathyroid hormone values: elevated parathyroid hormone and normal parathyroid hormone. RESULTS Thirty (25.2%) patients achieved postoperative normocalcemia but had elevated parathyroid hormone levels. This group had significantly higher preoperative levels of parathyroid hormone (P =.002) and creatinine (P =.007), and a lower glomerular filtration rate (P =.002) than patients with normal postoperative parathyroid hormone levels. The preoperative 25-OH-vitamin D level was not significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone (odds ratio [OR]: 1.56). Preoperative impaired renal function, specifically an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (OR: 12.8), was significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS Parathyroid hormone remains elevated in 25% of patients who are cured (eucalcemic) after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. This phenomenon was associated with higher preoperative parathyroid hormone levels and impaired renal function rather than low 25-OH-vitamin D levels. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4.

Yet, healthcare decision-making and communication for this population can pose significant challenges. As a result, healthcare professionals may struggle to help patients define and prioritise their values, goals, and preferences in ways that are clinically and personally meaningful, incorporating physical functioning and quality of life, when faced with numerous diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The aim of this systematic review is to locate and synthesise a body of fine-grained observational research on communication between professionals, older adults, and carers regarding self-management in audio/audio-visually recorded naturalistic interactions. METHODS/DESIGN The paper describes a systematic review of the published conversation analytic and discourse analytic research, using an aggregative thematic approach and following the PRISMA-P guidelines. This review will include studies reporting on adult patients (female or male) aged ≥ 60 years whose consultations are conducted in English in any healthcare setting and stakeholders involved in their care, e.g. general practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, and family carers. We will search nine electronic databases and the grey literature and two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts to identify potential studies. Discrepancies will be resolved via consultation with the review team. The methodological quality of the final set of included studies will be appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research and a detailed description of the characteristics of the included studies using a customised template.

Methods: The data of imported COVID-19 in Guangzhou reported as of April 1, 2020 were collected from National Notifiable Disease Report System of China. The software Excel 2010 and SPSS 19.0 were applied for data cleaning and statistical analysis. Results: As of April 1, 2020, a total of 103 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported in Guangzhou, in which 92 were confirmed cases and 11 were asymptomatic infection cases. The number of the confirmed imported cases accounted for 11.4% (92/806) in of the total in China at the same time. The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.58∶1 (63∶40). The median age of the cases was 31 years (P(25)-P(75):22-40 years), range of age was 11-63 years. The main occupational distributions of the cases were business services (41/103, 39.8%) and students (36/103, 35.0%). The imported cases whose destinations were 19 provinces and municipalities rather than Guangdong after entering the country accounted for 43.7%. The main source countries of infections were the United Kingdom (27/103, 26.2%), the Philippines (13/103, 12.6%), the United States (13/103, 12.6%) and Nigeria (7/103, 6.8%). There were 34 inbound flights from which the imported COVID-19 cases were detected, in which 10 flights (10/34, 29.4%) were found to carry more than 3 cases, with an average voyage time of (11.14±0.53) hours. A total of 29 imported cases(28.2%) showed symptoms before entering the country, and 65 cases (63.1%) had been isolated before the onset of the disease. The mean free activity time of the isolated cases after the onset was (6.76±0.79) days. The average number of the imported cases' close contacts was 53. There were 13 clusters of COVID-19 caused by the imported cases, involving 36 cases (including 1 imported associated case). Conclusions: The sources of the imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou were widely distributed, and no cases had been found to be infected on the flights. In the early stage of the imported epidemic, there was high risk for the spread of the epidemic. Strengthened prevention and control of imported COVID-19 effectively reduced the of transmission risk of COVID-19 in communities.","Zhen, R N; Huang, Y; Li, Y L; Zhou, S; Chen, Y Y; Qin, F J; Liang, Y R; Ma, X W; Xie, C J; Yuan, J",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,485,31

Reliable, fast, accurate, and sensitive platforms that can be deployed at the point-of-care (POC) in multiple settings, such as airports and offices, for detection of infectious pathogens are essential for the management of epidemics and possible biological attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no viral load technology adaptable to the POC settings exists today due to critical technical and biological challenges. Here, we present for the first time a broadly applicable technology for quantitative, nanoplasmonic-based intact virus detection at clinically relevant concentrations. The sensing platform is based on unique nanoplasmonic properties of nanoparticles utilizing immobilized antibodies to selectively capture rapidly evolving viral subtypes. We demonstrate the capture, detection, and quantification of multiple HIV subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, G, and subtype panel) with high repeatability, sensitivity, and specificity down to 98 ± 39 copies/mL (i.e., HIV subtype D) using spiked whole blood samples and clinical discarded HIV-infected patient whole blood samples validated by the gold standard, i.e., RT-qPCR. This platform technology offers an assay time of 1 h and 10 min (1 h for capture, 10 min for detection and data analysis). The presented platform is also able to capture intact viruses at high efficiency using immuno-surface chemistry approaches directly from whole blood samples without any sample preprocessing steps such as spin-down or sorting. Evidence is presented showing the system to be accurate, repeatable, and reliable. Additionally, the presented platform technology can be broadly adapted to detect other pathogens having reasonably well-described biomarkers by adapting the surface chemistry. Thus, this broadly applicable detection platform holds great promise to be implemented at POC settings, hospitals, and primary care settings.","Inci, Fatih; Tokel, Onur; Wang, Shuqi; Gurkan, Umut Atakan; Tasoglu, Savas; Kuritzkes, Daniel R; Demirci, Utkan",ACS nano,485,23

During the past decades, macrophages and the complement pathway (as a part of the innate immune system) have been identified as important contributors to the development of AMD, and we suggest that these mechanisms are of similar importance for the clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Based on the experience with AMD, we discuss how behavioral factors such as diet, smoking and higher body mass index, as well as genetic determinants such as the complement and immune pathway genes may lead to the overactive inflammatory phenotypes seen in some patients with COVID-19, and may in part explain the heterogeneity of disease manifestations and outcomes. Based on this experience, we discuss potential genetic research projects and elaborate on preventive and treatment approaches related to COVID-19.","Jager, Martine J; Seddon, Johanna M",Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology,485,1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the adoption of recommendations for the management of patients with gynaecologic cancer receiving treatment during the pandemic resulted in containment of infections and continuing oncologic care. METHODS Based on the published recommendations, and according to the local Health Direction guidelines, we developed and drafted a security protocol to modify access of patients with gynaecologic cancer to the ""Fondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli-IRCCS, Rome"" between February 1 and April 30, 2020 and compared results with the corresponding 3 months of 2019. RESULTS Between February and April 2019, we registered 3254 admissions, including 2253 patients receiving intravenous chemotherapies, 298 receiving oral therapies, and 703 having hospital visits. Between February and April 2020, we registered 3213 admissions, including 2221 patients receiving intravenous chemotherapies, 401 receiving oral therapies, and 591 having hospital visits. Oral treatments and general visits were different in the two time periods (p<0.001). Despite the elevated patient flow, only one patient (0.1%) tested positive for COVID-19 and there were no cases among healthcare staff. CONCLUSIONS Based on the adopted security protocol we provided continuity of care for all patients and limited the spread of the COVID-19 infection.","Palluzzi, Eleonora; Corrado, Giacomo; Marchetti, Claudia; Bolomini, Giulia; Vertechy, Laura; Bottoni, Carolina; Distefano, Mariagrazia; Scambia, Giovanni; Ferrandina, Gabriella",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,485,17

Here, we review three common and versatile regional flaps used in head and neck reconstruction that are comparable alternatives to free tissue transfer. RECENT FINDINGS Initial anatomic descriptions of the facial artery musculocutaneous (FAMM) flap, the supraclavicular artery island flap and the submental artery island flap were published decades ago. Since then, many have proposed modifications to these descriptions to improve technical ease and patient outcomes. Benefits of regional flaps include ease of harvest, comparable outcomes to free tissue microvascular flaps, shorter operative time and hospital length of stay. Drawbacks to regional flaps include limitations to size and reach, partial necrosis, wound dehiscence and surgeon experience. The integrity of the vascular pedicle is also contingent upon vessel preservation during the cancer ablation. SUMMARY Although a resurgence of regional flaps began well before the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions began looking for alternatives to free flap reconstruction to conserve healthcare resources and minimize patient hospitalization time in the past year. There has been a revival of regional flaps such as the FAMM, supraclavicular and submental flaps that are valuable reconstructive options for many defects of the head and neck.","Gray, Mingyang L; Drake, Virginia E; Desai, Shaun C",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,485,1

To characterize the cell-mediated immune response directed toward JHMV antigens, we have generated and analyzed the properties of four T cell clones reactive to JHMV antigens. All four clones are of the Ly-1+2- phenotype and show an antigen-specific, I-Ab-restricted proliferative response that is dependent on antigen-presenting cells (APC). The fine specificity of I-A restriction was revealed by their differential recognition of JHMV antigen in the context of mutant I-A molecules present on B6.C-H-2bm12 APC. Two clones were unable to recognize JHMV antigen presented on bm12 APC, whereas a third clone showed an equivalent response with both bm12 and wild type B6 APC. In the analysis of the viral specificity, three of the clones showed distinct cross-reactions with MHV-2 and very little if any cross-reaction with MHV-A59. In addition, three of three clones tested responded well to sucrose gradient-purified, UV-inactivated JHMV, indicating that their specificity is directed toward virus structural rather than nonstructural proteins. Finally, two of the clones were analyzed for their ability to induce a DTH reaction when injected together with antigen into the footpads of various mouse strains. Consistent with the in vitro data, both clones produced a marked DTH response only in those strains carrying the I-Ab genotype. These data demonstrate, both in vivo and in vitro, that at least one component of the cell-mediated immune response to JHMV is characterized by an Ly-1+2-, I-A-restricted T cell specific for JHMV structural proteins.","Woodward, J G; Matsushima, G; Frelinger, J A; Stohlman, S A",Journal of immunology,485,1

Scarce medical resources must often be rationed effectively to contain the disease outbreak. In the case of COVID-19, even the best-resourced countries will have inadequate intensive care facilities for the large number of patients needing admission and ventilation. The scarcity of medical resources creates the need for national governments to establish admission criteria that are evidence-based and fair. Questions have been raised whether infection with HIV or tuberculosis (TB) may amplify the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore whether these conditions should be factored in when deciding on the rationing of intensive care facilities. In light of these questions, clinical evidence regarding inclusion of these infections as comorbidities relevant to intensive care unit admission triage criteria is investigated in the first of a two-part series of articles. There is currently no evidence to indicate that HIV or TB infection on their own predispose to an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or worse outcomes for COVID-19. It is recommended that, as for other medical conditions, validated scoring systems for poor prognostic factors should be applied. A subsequent article examines the ethicolegal implications of limiting intensive care access of persons living with HIV or TB.","Rossouw, T M; Boswell, M T; Nienaber, A G; Moodley, K",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,485,20

However, there is limited evidence on this issue in Thailand. We aimed to evaluate the association of economic burden during the first phase of the pandemic and the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in the Thai population. METHODS: We recruited 2,303 participants aged 18 years or above with employment/full-time jobs before the national lockdown in April-May 2020. The measures of economic burden were job loss, income loss, and financial problems related to the outbreak. The outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress. The association between economic burden and adverse mental health outcomes was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Individuals who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic had a higher risk of perceived stress compared to those who maintained their job (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.51; p = .006). A higher risk of anxiety was observed in individuals with a monthly income loss of 50% (adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.99; p = .035; individuals without income loss, reference group) or over. Self-reported financial problems were significantly associated with adverse mental health outcomes (nonexperienced financial problems, reference group): Adjusted ORs of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.34-2.51; p < .001) for depressive symptoms, 2.00 (95% CI, 1.48-2.71; p < .001) for anxiety, and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.51-2.95; p < .001) for perceived stress.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown to improve motor and cognitive functioning. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the assistive effects of tDCS on the action observer network in both novice and expert gamers during an occlusion task, as well as the related electroencephalographic spectral power response. Twenty-three novice and 23 expert video gamers received either sham or active tDCS with a right parietal anode and left frontal cathode. Only experts demonstrated a significant improvement in predicting ball direction for the overall and early occlusions after tDCS. Spectral power results revealed significant changes in theta, high-gamma, and delta frequencies. The findings indicate that tDCS was able to modulate anticipatory behavior and cortical activity in experts compared with novice participants, suggesting a facilitatory role for tDCS to improve anticipatory effects and assist as a neurocognitive training technique.","Gold, Joshua; Ciorciari, Joseph",J Sport Exerc Psychol,485,6

Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress, resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation, and difficulties with self-management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to redefining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Because of this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients' needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementational scientific research.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Leung, Samantha E; Cassin, Stephanie E",Obesity (Silver Spring),485,18

Given the factors included in SDoH, such as education level, race, rurality, and socioeconomic status are interconnected, it is unclear how individual SDoH factors may uniquely impact risk. Lower socioeconomic status often occurs in concert with lower educational attainment, for example. Because literacy provides access to information needed to avoid infection and content can be made more accessible, it is essential to determine to what extent health literacy contributes to successful containment of a pandemic. By incorporating this information into clinical data, we have isolated literacy and geographic location as SDoH factors uniquely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. For patients with comorbidities linked to higher illness severity, residents of rural areas associated with lower health literacy at the zip code level had a greater likelihood of positive COVID-19 results unrelated to their economic status.","Greer, Melody L; Sample, Steven; Jensen, Hanna K; McBain, Sacha; Lipschitz, Riley; Sexton, Kevin W",Stud Health Technol Inform,485,1

In this paper, we describe the synthesis of a new partial inclusion complex of bis(1,10-phenanthroline)silver(I) salicylate in ß-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) which was synthesized with a good yield. The compounds were characterized by FTIR, 1H, 13C NMR including 1H-1H COSY, TGA/DSC, elemental analysis (CHN), and X-ray powder diffraction. The results suggest the presence of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the partial inclusion compound between ß-CD and bis(1,10-phenanthroline)silver(I) salicylate [Ag(phen)2]salH. Additionally, an in silico prediction of 1,10-phenanthroline biological activities was carried out and the acquired data suggests several potential targets associated with the antimicrobial activity of this compound and its silver complex. Most predicted targets are related to antimicrobial virulence and resistance that are a serious threat to global public health. The inclusion compound showed a higher inhibiting growth of Candida albicans than the free complex [Ag(phen)2]salH indicating that the formation of the inclusion complex with ß-CD increases the bioavailability of the antimicrobial active species [Ag(phen)2]+ of the new silver(I) compound.","BriÑez-Ortega, Edwin; Almeida, Vera L DE; Lopes, Julio C D; Burgos, Ana E",An Acad Bras Cienc,485,10

Yet, the stagnant progress in recruiting, retaining, and supporting racial/ethnic minority trainees and faculty at medical training institutions is well-documented and reflects unaddressed systemic racism along the academic pipeline. In this article, the authors draw upon their experiences as early-career physicians of color who have led and supported antiracism efforts within their institutions to highlight key barriers to achieving meaningful progress.

SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe pneumonia rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and die of multiple organ failure. Despite advances in supportive care approaches, ARDS is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy may be an potential alternative strategy for treating ARDS by targeting the various pathophysiological events of ARDS. By releasing a variety of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles, MSC can exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-microbial, and pro-angiogenic effects, promote bacterial and alveolar fluid clearance, disrupt the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell damage, eventually avoiding the lung and distal organ injuries to rescue patients with ARDS. An increasing number of experimental animal studies and early clinical studies verify the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in ARDS. Since low cell engraftment and survival in lung limit MSC therapeutic potentials, several strategies have been developed to enhance their engraftment in the lung and their intrinsic, therapeutic properties. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and optimization of MSC therapy in ARDS and highlighted the potentials and possible barriers of MSC therapy for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.","Qin, Hua; Zhao, Andong",Protein Cell,485,4

375327,375327,375327,Coronavirus and a greener future,23.115017,6.115993,2020,"Introduction Smart technology, like AI-enabled chatbots, has transformed how healthcare consumers (patients) co-create value with their service providers (doctors). However, for effective co-creation, consumers also have to equally integrate their resources (like information). Here, trust plays an important role. If consumers do not trust the chatbots, they will contribute fewer resources resulting in value co-destruction. This dynamic of trust and resource integration is further challenged in uncertain times (like COVID-19). Thus, it becomes imperative to explore the factors that imbibes/ abstain trust within chatbot users while consuming healthcare services during a pandemic? This study focuses on this question. Additionally, since trust has two sides (cognitive & affective) and the factors affecting them can act from two different levels of service ecosystem (individual & institutional);therefore the study categorizes the trust factors using a 2 × 2 matrix, i.e., (Individual & cognitive, Institutional & cognitive, Individual & affective, Institutional & affective). There is hardly any study that adopts this multifaceted view of trust factors in AI-empowered healthcare services. Method The study uses an inductive qualitative approach, where thirty regular chatbot users were interviewed using a semi-structured interview. Excerpts from the interviews were thematically coded and analyzed (using QSR Nvivo-12). Identified factors are validated using social simulation approach. Results The study identifies 16 key factors influencing consumers' trust in chatbot based on 2 × 2 matrix proposed in this study. To cite a few of them, Cognitive trust factors: perceived knowledge, level of task orientation in interaction, level of automation;affective trust factors: avatar like presence, level of emotional support offered, perceived honesty & ethics, perceived security & privacy. Conclusion The results show that consumers phenomenologically process the trust in chatbot usage getting influenced both cognitively and emotionally at multiple levels. Thus, practitioners should accordingly plan the 'trust-building strategy'.","Saxena, S.; Ahmed, A.; Amritesh,",BMJ Open,485,30

Rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic techniques are urgently needed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We devised a reverse transcription multiple cross-displacement amplification (RT-MCDA) coupled with a nanoparticle-based biosensor assay (RT-MCDA-BS) for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Two primer sets were designed to target the open reading frame 1a/b and nucleoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 183 clinical samples, including 65 patients with COVID-19 infection and 118 patients with other pathogen infections were used to testify the assay's feasibility. Diagnosis results were reported visually using the biosensor. FINDINGS: The assay designed was performed using a simple instrument which could maintain the reaction in a constant temperature at 64°C for only 35â min. The total COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS test procedure could be finished within 1â h. The COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS could detect down to five copies of target sequences. Among 65 clinical samples from the COVID-19 patients, 22 (33.8%) positive results were obtained from faeces, nasal, pharyngeal and anal swabs via COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS assay, while real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay only detected 20 (30.7%) positive results in these samples. No positive results were obtained from clinical samples with non-COVID-19 infections. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS was a rapid, reliable, low-cost and easy-to-use assay, which could provide an attractive laboratory tool to diagnose COVID-19 in multiple clinical specimens, especially for field, clinic laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-poor settings.","Li, Shijun; Jiang, Weijia; Huang, Junfei; Liu, Ying; Ren, Lijuan; Zhuang, Li; Zheng, Qinni; Wang, Ming; Yang, Rui; Zeng, Yi; Wang, Yi",Eur. respir. j,485,30

RESULTS: A reduction in training workloads was observed in all participants during the lockdown (-63.7%), which was accompanied by a reduced heart rate variability in all but one participant (-2.0%). A significant reduction was also observed for countermovement jump (-6.5%) and 1-repetition maximum performance (-11.5%), which decreased in all but one participant after the lockdown. However, after the retraining phase, all measures returned to similar values to those found at baseline. At the individual level, there were divergent responses, as exemplified by one athlete who attenuated the reduction in training workloads and increased her performance during the lockdown and another one who markedly reduced his workload and performance, and got injured during the retraining phase. CONCLUSIONS: Although there seems to be a large interindividual variability, COVID-19 lockdown is likely to impose negative consequences on elite athletes, but these detrimental effects might be avoided by attenuating reductions in training workloads and seem to be overall recovered after 6 to 8 weeks of retraining.","Valenzuela, Pedro L; Rivas, Fernando; Sánchez-Martínez, Guillermo",Int J Sports Physiol Perform,485,16

The objective is to describe the process of lifting these mitigation measures. METHODS: The Plan for the Transition to a New Normality, approved on April 28, contained four sequential phases with progressive increase in socio-economic activities and population mobility. In parallel, a new strategy for early diagnosis, surveillance and control was implemented. A bilateral decision mechanism was established between the Spanish Government and the autonomous communities (AC), guided by a set of qualitative and quantitative indicators capturing the epidemiological situation and core capacities. The territorial units were established ad-hoc and could be from Basic Health Zones to entire AC. RESULTS: The process run from May 4 to June 21, 2020. AC implemented plans for reinforcement of core capacities. Incidence decreased from a median (50% of territories) of 7.4 per 100,000 in 7 days at the beginning to 2.5 at the end. Median PCR testing increased from 53% to 89% of suspected cases and PCR total capacity from 4.5 to 9.8 per 1000 inhabitants weekly; positivity rate decreased from 3.5% to 1.8%. Median proportion of cases with traced contacts increased from 82% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Systematic data collection, analysis, and interterritorial dialogue allowed adequate process control. The epidemiological situation improved but, mostly, the process entailed a great reinforcement of core response capacities nation-wide, under common criteria. Maintaining and further reinforcing capacities remained crucial for responding to future waves.","Monge, Susana; Zamalloa, Pello Latasa; Moros, María José Sierra; Olaso, Oscar Pérez; Miguel, Lucía García San; Varela, Carmen; Ariza, Silvia Rivera; Torres, María C Vázquez; Lucerón, María Del Carmen Olmedo; Yuste, Paloma González; Crespo, Pilar Soler; Pozo, Javier Segura Del; Gullón, Pedro; Carrasco, José Miguel; Sánchez, Elena Vanessa Martínez; Bravo, Lidia Redondo; Castañeda, Myriam Pichiule; Hermida, María Jesús Purriños; Vidal, Xurxo Hervada; Gonzalez, Ismael Huerta; Margolles, Mario; Luna, Hermelinda Vanaclocha; Gómara, Enrique Ramalle; Martín, Jaime Jesús Pérez; López, María Dolores Chirlaque; Fernández, María Jesús López; Lorusso, Nicola; Ubago, Alberto Carmona; Perez, Ana Rivas; Marin, Violeta Ramos; Alvarez, Juan José Criado; Pérez, Daniel Castrillejo; Anés, Atanasio A Góméz; Frontera, Marga; Rodriguez, Pedro Macias; León, Eva Elisa Álvarez; Casañas, Miriam Díaz; Perez, Maria Angeles Lopaz; Ágreda, Juan Pablo Alonso Pérez de; Gutierrez, Paloma Navas; Aguilar, Ignacio Rosell; Axpe, Jose Mª Arteagoitia; Carril, Fernando Gonzalez; Azcárraga, Pilar Aparicio; Soria, Fernando Simón; Rodríguez, Berta Suarez",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

School-based mass drug administration (MDA) using the anthelminthic drug Mebendazole/Albendazole have succeeded in controlling morbidity associated to these diseases but failed to interrupt their transmission. In areas were filarial diseases are co-endemic, another anthelminthic drug (Ivermectin) is distributed to almost the entire population, following the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) strategy. Since Ivermectin is a broad spectrum anthelmintic known to be effective against STH, we conducted cross-sectional surveys in two health districts with very contrasting histories of Ivermectin/Albendazole-based PC in order to investigate whether CDTI might have contributed in STH transmission interruption. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in two health districts with similar socio-environmental patterns but with very contrasting CDTI histories (Akonolinga health district where CDTI was yet to be implemented vs. Yabassi health district where CDTI has been ongoing for two decades). Stool samples were collected from all volunteers aged >2 years old and analyzed using the Kato-Katz technique. Infections by different STH species were compared between Akonolinga and Yabassi health districts to decipher the impact of Ivermectin/Albendazole-based MDA on STH transmission. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 610 and 584 participants aged 2-90 years old were enrolled in Akonolinga and Yabassi health districts, respectively. Two STH species (Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) were found, with prevalence significantly higher in Akonolinga health district (43.3%; 95% CI: 38.1-46.6) compared to Yabassi health district (2.5%; 95% CI: 1.1-5.1) (chi-square: 90.8; df: 1; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings (i) suggest that Mebendazole- or Albendazole-based MDA alone distributed only to at-risk populations might not be enough to eliminate STH, (ii) support the collateral impact of Ivermectin/Albendazole MDA on A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections, and (iii) suggest that Ivermectin/Albendazole-based PC could accelerate STH transmission interruption.","Djune-Yemeli, Linda; Nana-Djeunga, Hugues C; Lenou-Nanga, Cédric G; Donfo-Azafack, Cyrille; Domche, André; Fossuo-Thotchum, Floribert; Niamsi-Emalio, Yannick; Ntoumi, Francine; Kamgno, Joseph",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,485,16

The main goal of this article is to evaluate how the number of visits developed after the first zoo re-openings and what specific factors limited attendances the most after the reopening, using the example of Czech zoos in May and June 2020. In addition to the information available on zoos’ online communication channels, the authors’ questionnaire survey data and attendance data provided by the zoos were used. The results indicate that the attendance was reduced the most by the obligation to buy tickets online, by the closure of state borders, and by a low limit on daily maximum number of visitors allowed. Different approaches to restricting zoos’ capacity are discussed and the use of the maximum number of people by surface area of visitor routes at one time to limit attendance is recommended. In the future, this could be a key factor for sustainability of many zoos.","Nekolný, Lukáš Fialová Dana",Journal of Zoological and Botanical Gardens,485,1

The main objectives of this paper were to analyse the status of medical waste generation and treatment in recent years, and also address the discussions on the impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on its generation in the first half of 2020. It showed that the reported quantities have slightly increased from 35,747 metric tonnes (Mt) in 2016 to 40,407 Mt in 2019, showing an average increase by 4.17%. This rate of increase was consistent with the hospital services. When classified by the reported codes, the C-type waste (infectious waste) accounted for about 89% of the reported quantities, which indicated an annual increase by 4.14% during the same period. In addition, the medical waste treatment in 2019 was mainly dependent on the commissioned treatment (80.18%), followed by the recycling (18.53%) and the self-treatment (1.29%). Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on the medical waste generation in Taiwan was not significant in the first half of 2020 compared to the data during the years of 2016-2019. It was indicated that the consistent trend was observed at the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan during this period. Obviously, the reduction in the hospital medical services during the COVID-19 outbreak should be offset by the increase in medical waste generation from the medical services. In order to try to ensure safe and complete destruction of the COVID-19 virus, all the waste generated from the healthcare facilities should be treated in the incineration plants.","Tsai, Wen-Tien",Waste Manag Res,485,16

In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases?To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes.Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future.","Hanney, Stephen R; Wooding, Steven; Sussex, Jon; Grant, Jonathan",Health Res Policy Syst,485,20

As an infectious disease with no specific treatment, several measures have been established to minimize the outbreak of this disease, including social isolation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the behavior of adolescents during the isolation period. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the Adolescent Health Studies Center. Data were obtained from a questionnaire prepared on Google Forms, sent by a multiplatform instant messaging application, and analyzed using the Stata 14 software. RESULTS: A total of 208 adolescents with a mean age of 15.3 years (SD ± 1.8) answered the questionnaire, 57.7% were female. About 93.3% of adolescents said they were in isolation with a changed routine, 67.3% increased their food consumption, 86.5% were inactive, and 58.7% reported screen time over 8 h/d.

We sought to determine whether obesity is a risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort, including patients with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The primary objective was to determine if obesity is a predictor of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were included, 218 patients (91.6%) were African American, 113 (47.5%) were male, and the mean age was 58.5 years. Of the included patients, 146 (61.3%) were obese (BMI >30kg/m2 ), with 63 (26.5%), 29 (12.2%), and 54 (22.7%) with class 1, 2, and 3 obesity, respectively. Obesity was identified as a predictor for mortality (OR 1.7(1.1-2.8),p=0.016), as was male gender (OR 5.2(1.6-16.5),p=0.01) and older age (OR 3.6(2.0-6.3),p<0.0005). Obesity (OR 1.7(1.3-2.1),p<0.0005) and older age (OR 1.3(1.0-1.6),p=0.03) were also risk factors for hypoxemia.

Here, we report the efficient separation of both propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) and ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) mixtures for the first time by a cheap and customized anion-functionalized metal-organic framework, ZU-36 (also termed as GeFSIX-3-M, M = Ni2+, Co2+), through molecular recognition and cross-section matching mechanism. Specifically, the pore window size of the fine-tuned ZU-36-Ni (4.42 × 4.42 Å2) decorated with high density of electronegative anions matches well with the cross section of C3H6 (4.16 × 4.65 Å2) and C2H4 (3.28 × 4.18 Å2), leading to efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6. The high uptake capacity and separation selectivity of ZU-36-Ni were confirmed by adsorption isotherms and breakthrough tests. Binary dynamic breakthrough results showed that ZU-36-Ni can trap 1.35 mmol g-1 C3H6 and 1.08 mmol g-1 C2H4 from C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, respectively. The separation selectivity for C3H6/C3H8 on ZU-36-Ni calculated from the breakthrough tests is 19, which sets a new benchmark for C3H6/C3H8 separation. The proposed cross-section matching mechanism together with proper selective binding affinity may serve as a guide for the design of effective porous materials for other important gas separation.","Zhang, Zhaoqiang; Ding, Qi; Cui, Xili; Jiang, Xiao-Ming; Xing, Huabin",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),485,16

Coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury have not been characterized. METHODS: We analyzed the data of five COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury who had D-dimer surge (defined as a rapid increase in the D-dimer level in 72âh, from <5-21âµg/mL) during hospitalization, which were extracted from a registered retrospective study (ChiCTR2000031301). Clinical data and data on changes in coagulation parameters were collected, verified, and characterized. RESULTS: Among these five patients, four had pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. D-dimer surge was accompanied with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and reduced platelet count (PLT) and fibrinogen level. Three patients had an ISTH DIC score of 5 and met the criteria for overt DIC. All five patients needed invasive ventilation support and were incubated 0 to 6 days after the first D-dimer upper reference limit (URL) was reached. All five patients died within 10 days after the first D-dimer URL was reached. All five patients had observed D-dimer URL results 1 to 3 days before death. CONCLUSION: D-dimer surge in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury surely leads to worse in-hospital outcome. D-dimer surge and concomitant DIC can be the leading causes of in-hospital death. Pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases might pose a higher risk for developing these coagulation disorders. These findings can serve as hypothesis generating and need further clinical trials to confirm.","Wang, Xingtong; Du, Beibei; Li, Jia; Wang, Shunan; Wang, Xiuxiu; Guo, MengYuan; Yang, Bo; Si, Daoyuan; Bai, Ou",Medicine (Baltimore),485,16

Predicting the effect of the virus (SARS-CoV-2), via studies and analyses, enables us to understand the nature of SARS-CoV- 2 with reference to factors that promote its growth and spread. Therefore, these foster widespread awareness; and the populace can become more proactive and cautious so as to mitigate the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19). Furthermore, understanding and predicting the demand for Personal Protective Equipment promotes the efficiency and safety of healthcare workers in Community Health Centres.

No recent large studies about their use and perception among internal medicine (IM) residents exist. OBJECTIVE: Characterize the use and perceived helpfulness of educational resources. DESIGN: Nationwide survey from December 2019 to March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: IM residents in the USA. MAIN MEASURES: Residents were surveyed on their use and their perceived helpfulness of resources for both attaining general medical knowledge and for point-of-care (POC) learning. Traditional resources included board review resources, clinical experience, digital clinical resources (e.g., UpToDate), journal articles, pocket references, professional guidelines, textbooks, and residency curricula. Novel resources included Twitter, video streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube), online blogs, podcasts, and Wikipedia. KEY RESULTS: We had 662 respondents from 55 residency programs across 26 states. On average, residents used 9 total resources (7 traditional and 2 novel). Digital clinical resources and clinical experience were used by all residents and found helpful by the highest percentage of residents (96% and 94%, respectively). Journal articles were next (used by 90%), followed by board review resources and residency curricula (both used by 85%).

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downsin cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand. Methods We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period. Findings We estimated given that 1) By the date (5th March 2020) of the first report death in the UK, around 7499 people would have already been infected with the virus. After taking suppression on 23rd March, the peak of infection in the UK would have occurred between 28th March and 4th April 2020; the peak of death would have occurred between 18th April and 24th April 2020. 2) By 29th April, no significant collapse of health system in the UK have occurred, where there have been sufficient hospital beds for severe and critical cases. But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96th day (12th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97th day (13th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand. Interpretation: Considering social and economic costs in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, long-term suppression is not economically viable. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, g.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.",,485,3

The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we clarified the phylogenetic relationship of viral pathogens isolated from leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 live-trapped leopard cats and 29 that were found dead were collected from 2015 to 2019 in Miaoli County in northwestern Taiwan. Protoparvoviruses and CoVs were detected in leopard cats, and their prevalence (95% confidence interval) was 63.5% (50.4%–76.6%) and 8.8% (0%–18.4%), respectively. Most of the protoparvovirus sequences amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All of the CoV sequences amplified from leopard cats were identified as feline CoV. No spatial or temporal aggregation of protoparvovirus infection in leopard cats was found in the sampling area, indicating a wide distribution of protoparvoviruses in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the identified pathogens. We strongly recommend management of protoparvoviruses and feline CoV in the leopard cat habitat, particularly vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats.

In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","Mariani, Rachele; Renzi, Alessia; Di Trani, Michela; Trabucchi, Guido; Danskin, Kerri; Tambelli, Renata",Front Psychiatry,485,20

However, single-chain antibodies are often unstable and poorly expressed in Escherichia coli. Here, we explore the feasibility of converting scFv antibodies to an intrinsically fluorescent format by inserting the monomeric, stable fluorescent protein named thermal green, between the light- and heavy-chain variable regions. Our results show that the scTGP format maintains the affinity and specificity of the antibodies, improves expression levels, allows one-step fluorescent assay for detection of binding and is a suitable reagent for epitope binning. We also report the crystal structure of an scTGP construct that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine on FcεR1 receptor of the allergy pathway.","Velappan, Nileena; Close, Devin; Hung, Li-Wei; Naranjo, Leslie; Hemez, Colin; DeVore, Natasha; McCullough, Donna K; Lillo, Antonietta M; Waldo, Geoffrey S; Bradbury, Andrew R M",Protein Eng Des Sel,485,16

All countries are challenged, but low-income and developing countries are facing a more challenging situation than others due to their limited health infrastructure, limited financial and human resources, and limited capacity of governments to respond. Further, the interconnected nature of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis demands an integrated approach and coordinated action, which complicates decision making even more. Identifying the best set of policies and instruments to address COVID-19 challenges, and aligning them with broader social goals will be critically important for sustainable recovery from the pandemic. The key practical challenge facing the policy makers of developing countries is how to prioritize policies to achieve the interconnected goals of managing the health crisis, recovering the economy, and achieving environmental sustainability. We present a framework for identifying and prioritizing policy actions to address the COVID-19 challenges and ensure sustainable recovery. The framework outlines principles and criteria and provides insights into developing shared policy goals, identifying smart strategies, assessing policy compatibility, aligning policy instruments, and factoring sustainability into short and long-term policy decisions. This framework can assist policy makers in linking short and long-term goals, mapping the interactions of different policy options, and assessing anticipated consequences and cross-sectoral implications. This will enable policy makers to prioritize policy choices and allocate limited resources in such a way that they are directed toward actions that generate synergy and co-benefits, have multiplier effects, and achieve interconnected solutions for health, the economy and environment.","Rasul, Golam",Front Public Health,485,28

We had previously postulated that acetaminophen exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered acetaminophen at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4–10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37–49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial activity, in animals treated with acetaminophen plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of acetaminophen in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.","Suda, Navneet; Cendejas Hernandez, Jasmine; Poulton, John; Jones, John P.; Konsoula, Zacharoula; Smith, Caroline; Parker, William",PLoS One,485,33

We analyze the impact of socio-economic and political announcements, as well as of financial stimulus disclosures, on the reference stock markets of the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany and Italy. We quantify market efficiency in processing SARS-CoV-2 related news by means of the observed Omori power-law exponents and we relate these empirical regularities to investors’ behavior through the lens of a stylized Agent-Based financial market model. The analysis reveals that financial markets may underreact to the announcements by taking a finite time to re-adjust prices, thus moving against the efficient market hypothesis. We observe that this empirical regularity can be related to the speculative behavior of market participants, whose willingness to switch toward better performing investment strategies, as well as their degree of reactivity to price trend or mispricing, can induce long-lasting volatility cascades.","Spelta, Alessandro; Pecora, Nicolò; Flori, Andrea; Giudici, Paolo",Ann Oper Res,485,22

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms may be particularly sensitive to the context of the pandemic. Previous research suggests insomnia symptoms may contribute to increased OCD symptoms over time, particularly during times of stress, such as the pandemic. The present study examined pre-coronavirus outbreak insomnia symptoms as a predictor of post-coronavirus outbreak OCD symptoms in a sample of community adults who completed a 2016 survey study and were re-contacted on April 1, 2020 (N = 369). Results revealed a small significant increase in OCD symptoms following the coronavirus outbreak and a small significant decrease in insomnia symptoms. Pre-coronavirus outbreak insomnia symptoms significantly predicted increases in post-coronavirus outbreak OCD symptoms. Similar results were found for specific OCD symptom facets with the exception of washing and hoarding symptoms, which were unrelated to pre-coronavirus insomnia symptoms. There was no evidence for a reverse effect of prior OCD symptoms on insomnia symptoms during the pandemic. These findings suggest those with insomnia symptoms prior to the coronavirus pandemic may be vulnerable to increases in some OCD symptoms during the pandemic.

METHODS: The HPS was positioned at 45° on the bed and programmed to mimic mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H(2)O). Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) started at 10 cm H(2)O and gradually increased to 18 cm H(2)O, whereas expiratory pressure was maintained at 4 cm H(2)O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet, and images were captured by high definition video. Normalized exhaled air concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. FINDINGS: As IPAP increased from 10 to 18 cm H(2)O, the exhaled air of a low normalized concentration through the ComfortFull 2 mask (Respironics) increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the median sagittal plane. When the IPAP of 10 cm H(2)O was applied via the Image 3 mask (Respironics) connected to the whisper swivel, the exhaled air dispersed to 0.95 m toward the end of the bed along the median sagittal plane, whereas higher IPAP resulted in wider spread of a higher concentration of smoke. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 1-m region, from patients receiving NPPV via the ComfortFull 2 mask and the Image 3 mask, with more diffuse leakage from the latter, especially at higher IPAP.","Hui, David S.; Chow, Benny K.; Ng, Susanna S.; Chu, Leo C.Y.; Hall, Stephen D.; Gin, Tony; Sung, Joseph J.Y.; Chan, Matthew T.V.",Chest,485,17

In this context, we explored the degree to which digital technologies have contributed to teaching and learning practices over the past decade. The study employed a systematic review using a newly developed tripartite model for conducting and presenting literature review reports. The model approaches the literature review process systematically and employs three phases for the critical examination of literature: description, synthesis, and critique. The current review focused on student engagement across technologies that encompass social media, video, and collaborative learning technologies. Relevant articles were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Three core themes were identified: there was no shared understanding of what constitutes student engagement with learning technologies, there was a lack of explanation concerning the contextual variation and modalities of student engagement across the digital technologies, and self-reporting was the primary method of measuring student engagement, rendering results as perceptual rather than behavioural. We argue that using multiple datasets and different methodological approaches can provide further insights into student engagement with digital technologies. This approach to measuring engagement can substantiate findings and most likely provide additional insights into students' engagement with digital technologies.","Nkomo, Larian M.; Daniel, Ben K.; Butson, Russell J.",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,485,21

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP. METHODS: In this study, 81 severe NCP patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) were enrolled. The results of conventional coagulation parameters and lower limb vein ultrasonography of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of VTE in these patients was 25% (20/81), of which 8 patients with VTE events died.

Background: Stroke is the leading cause of death and long-term disability in China, with high incidence, high mortality, and heavy disease burden. In addition to Western medicines, Chinese clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke recommend application of Chinese patent medicines. Ginkgolide injection is commonly used in the clinical treatment of stroke in China to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. The economy of ginkgolide injection needs to be evaluated. Methods: A Markov model was constructed consisting of four disease states: no significant disability, disability, stroke recurrence, and death. Therapeutic data were taken from the Ginkgolide in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Large Artery Atherosclerosis (GISAA) study. Utilities and transition probabilities were extracted from the literature. Cost data were obtained from the China Health Statistics Yearbook and hospital record survey. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 13 years of cycles (calculated by average age of subjects and Chinese life expectancy) were calculated through TreeAge Pro11 software. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set as the Chinese per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, CN¥70,892/QALY. The results were analyzed by single factor and probability sensitivity analyses. Results: Ginkgolide plus aspirin had a higher expected per-patient cost than placebo plus aspirin but a higher QALYs. Compared with placebo plus aspirin, ginkgolide plus aspirin produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CN¥14,866.06/QALY, which is below the WTP threshold.
