1101,1101,1101,Pandemic influenza in Papua New Guinea: a modelling study comparison with pandemic spread in a developed country,14.871488,3.373018,2013-03-26,"OBJECTIVES: The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher death rates compared with developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean (PNG) community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared with those obtained from a comparable Australian model. DESIGN: A modelling study. SETTING: The towns of Madang in PNG (population ∼35 000) and Albany (population ∼30 000) in Australia. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios. RESULTS: The unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared with the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60–70% less effective in a PNG setting compared with an Australian setting. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature.","Milne, George J; Baskaran, Pravin; Halder, Nilimesh; Karl, Stephan; Kelso, Joel",BMJ Open,263,22
4057,4057,4057,#CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns: A Twitter Analysis,14.557628,3.330164,2018-11-05,"BACKGROUND: The CDC hosts monthly panel presentations titled ‘Public Health Grand Rounds’ and publishes monthly reports known as Vital Signs. Hashtags #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns were used to promote them on Twitter. OBJECTIVES: This study quantified the effect of hashtag count, mention count, and URL count and attaching visual cues to #CDCGrandRounds or #VitalSigns tweets on their retweet frequency. METHODS: Through Twitter Search Application Programming Interface, original tweets containing the hashtag #CDCGrandRounds (n = 6,966; April 21, 2011–October 25, 2016) and the hashtag #VitalSigns (n = 15,015; March 19, 2013–October 31, 2016) were retrieved respectively. Negative binomial regression models were applied to each corpus to estimate the associations between retweet frequency and three predictors (hashtag count, mention count, and URL link count). Each corpus was sub-set into cycles (#CDCGrandRounds: n = 58, #VitalSigns: n = 42). We manually coded the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle, whether it contained visual cues (images or videos). Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency for each cycle, between tweets with and without visual cues. FINDINGS: URL links increased retweet frequency in both corpora; effects of hashtag count and mention count differed between the two corpora. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significantly different retweet frequencies between tweets with and without visual cues. Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate < 1; twenty-four, PR > 1 but < 3; and four, PR > 3. Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant. Of these 19 cycles, six were PR > 1 and < 3; and thirteen, PR > 3. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of retweet frequency through attaching visual cues varied across cycles for original tweets with #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns. Future research is needed to determine the optimal choice of visual cues to maximize the influence of public health tweets.","Jackson, Ashley M.; Mullican, Lindsay A.; Yin, Jingjing; Ho Tse, Zion Tsz; Liang, Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Ahweyevu, Jennifer O.; Jenkins, Jimmy J.; Saroha, Nitin; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",,263,1

We argue that bioethics has a universal range because it relates to three shared human characteristics,—human vulnerability, institutional precariousness and scarcity of resources. These three components of our argument provide support for a related notion of ‘weak foundationalism’ that emphasizes the universality and interrelatedness of human experience, rather than their cultural differences. After presenting a theoretical position on vulnerability and human rights, we draw on recent criticism of this approach in order to paint a more nuanced picture. We conclude that the dichotomy between universalism and cultural relativism has some conceptual merit, but it also has obvious limitations when we consider the political economy of health and its impact on social inequality.","Turner, Bryan Stanley; Dumas, Alex",Med Health Care Philos,263,1

Miniaturization of key bio-diagnostic techniques, such as: nucleic acid detection and quantification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), results in substantial reduction of reaction volumes (expensive samples/reagents) and shorter reaction times. Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is one of several miniaturized bio-sample handling techniques available for manipulating clinical samples and reagents in microliter (10(−6) L) to picoliter (10(−12) L) volume regime. Electro-actuation of sample and reagent in the form of droplets in the aforementioned volume regime, using dielectrophoresis (DEP) and/or Electrowetting (EW) are achieved by means of patterned, insulated metal electrodes on one or more substrates. In this work, we have utilized electro-actuation based DMF technology, integrated with suitably tailored resistive micro-heaters and temperature sensors, to achieve chip based real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). This qRT-PCR micro-device was utilized to detect and quantify the presence of influenza A and C virus nucleic acids, using in-vitro synthesized viral RNA segments. The experimental analysis of the DMF micro-device confirms its capabilities in qRT-PCR based detection and quantification of pathogen samples, with accuracy levels comparable to established commercial bench-top equipment (PCR efficiency ∼95%). The limit of detection (LOD) of the chip based qRT-PCR technique was estimated to be ∼5 copies of template RNA per PCR reaction.","Prakash, R.; Pabbaraju, K.; Wong, S.; Wong, A.; Tellier, R.; Kaler, K.

However, there exists a default position wherein niches of species in a community are determined by their evolutionary and biogeographic histories, irrespective of other species within the community. According to this viewpoint, a broad range of pair‐wise niche overlaps—from completely overlapping to completely distinct—are expected in any community without the need to invoke interspecific interactions. We develop a method that can test for both habitat associations and niche differences along an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal niche dimensions and apply it to a 24‐yr data set of the eight dominant woody‐plant species (representing 84% and 76% of total community abundance and basal area, respectively) from a 50‐ha permanent plot in a southern Indian tropical dry forest, using edaphic, topographic, and precipitation variables as niche axes. Species separated into two broad groups in niche space—one consisting of three canopy species and the other of a canopy species and four understory species—along axes that corresponded mainly to variation in soil P, Al and a topographic index of wetness. Species within groups tended to have significantly greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Community‐wide niche overlap in spatial and temporal niche axes was never smaller than expected by chance. Species‐habitat associations were neither necessary nor sufficient preconditions for niche differences to be present. Our results suggest that this tropical dry‐forest community consists of several tree species with broadly overlapping niches, and where significant niche differences do exist, they are not readily interpretable as evidence for niche differentiation. We argue, based on a survey of the literature, that many of the observed niche differences in tropical forests are more parsimoniously viewed as autecological differences between species that exist independently of interspecific interactions.","Pulla, Sandeep; Suresh, Hebbalalu S.; Dattaraja, Handanakere S.; Sukumar, Raman",Ecology,263,1

However, linear controllers typically need to balance between these conflicting objectives. In order to balance this tradeoff in a more desirable manner, a variable-gain controller is proposed, which switches the controller gain based on the magnitude of the patient flow.

11522,11522,11522,Medical Ethics in Extreme and Austere Environments,14.803406,3.2009096,2020-03-14,"Many neurological diseases may cause acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to involvement of bulbar respiratory center, spinal cord, motoneurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or skeletal muscles. In this context, respiratory emergencies are often a challenge at home, in a neurology ward, or even in an intensive care unit, influencing morbidity and mortality. More commonly, patients develop primarily ventilatory impairment causing hypercapnia. Moreover, inadequate bulbar and expiratory muscle function may cause retained secretions, frequently complicated by pneumonia, atelectasis, and, ultimately, hypoxemic ARF. On the basis of the clinical onset, two main categories of ARF can be identified: (i) acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, which is common in slowly progressive neurological diseases, such as movement disorders and most neuromuscular diseases, and (ii) sudden-onset respiratory failure which may develop in rapidly progressive neurological disorders including stroke, convulsive status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, phrenic neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. A tailored assistance may include manual and mechanical cough assistance, noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or tracheotomy.

Therefore, this study summarizes the experience of second systemic-pulmonary shunt for congenital heart disease in our hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-five children with congenital heart disease who underwent systemic-pulmonary shunt for the second time in our hospital were analyzed. At the early stage after the operation, cyanosis improved and SpO(2) significantly increased. One patient died in hospital (1.54%) and the causes of death were aggravated atrioventricular regurgitation, low cardiac output syndrome, and liver failure. Early complications occurred in 18 patients (27.7%). All the children were rechecked in our hospital every 3–6 months and the McGoon index significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Systemic-pulmonary artery shunt can promote pulmonary vascular development, improve cyanosis symptoms, and increase the chance of radical treatment in children with pulmonary vascular dysplasia.","Yang, Xue-Yong; Jing, Xiao-Yong; Chen, Zhe; Li, Lun; Fan, Xiang-Ming; Su, Jun-Wu",J Cardiothorac Surg,263,1

However, whether NMD is capable of restricting DNA viruses is not known. The DNA virus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Here, we demonstrate that NMD restricts KSHV lytic reactivation. Leveraging high-throughput transcriptomics we identify NMD targets transcriptome-wide in PEL cells and identify host and viral RNAs as substrates. Moreover, we identified an NMD-regulated link between activation of the unfolded protein response and transcriptional activation of the main KSHV transcription factor RTA, itself an NMD target. Collectively, our study describes an intricate relationship between cellular targets of an RNA quality control pathway and KSHV lytic gene expression, and demonstrates that NMD can function as a cell intrinsic restriction mechanism acting upon DNA viruses.","Zhao, Yang; Ye, Xiang; Shehata, Myriam; Dunker, William; Xie, Zhihang; Karijolich, John",Nat Commun,263,1

In the absence of efficacy data, immunobridging is an approach to infer the likelihood of a vaccine protective effect, by translating vaccine immunogenicity in humans to a protective effect, using the relationship between vaccine immunogenicity and the desired outcome in a suitable animal model. We here propose to infer the protective effect of the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen with an 8-week interval in humans by immunobridging. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy data were obtained for Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimens using a fully lethal EBOV Kikwit challenge model in cynomolgus monkeys (nonhuman primates [NHP]). The association between EBOV neutralizing antibodies, glycoprotein (GP)-binding antibodies, and GP-reactive T cells and survival in NHP was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Binding antibodies against the EBOV surface GP were identified as the immune parameter with the strongest correlation to survival post EBOV challenge, and used to infer the predicted protective effect of the vaccine in humans using published data from phase I studies. The human vaccine-elicited EBOV GP-binding antibody levels are in a range associated with significant protection against mortality in NHP. Based on this immunobridging analysis, the EBOV GP-specific-binding antibody levels elicited by the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen in humans will likely provide protection against EBOV disease.","Roozendaal, Ramon; Hendriks, Jenny; van Effelterre, Thierry; Spiessens, Bart; Dekking, Liesbeth; Solforosi, Laura; Czapska-Casey, Dominika; Bockstal, Viki; Stoop, Jeroen; Splinter, Daniel; Janssen, Sarah; Baelen, Ben van; Verbruggen, Nadia; Serroyen, Jan; Dekeyster, Eline; Volkmann, Ariane; Wollmann, Yvonne; Carrion, Ricardo; Giavedoni, Luis D.; Robinson, Cynthia; Leyssen, Maarten; Douoguih, Macaya; Luhn, Kerstin; Pau, Maria Grazia; Sadoff, Jerry; Vandebosch, An; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Zahn, Roland; Callendret, Benoit",NPJ Vaccines,263,13

In adults, the classification of septic patients by clinical AKI phenotypes (severity and timing) demonstrates unique associations with patient outcome vs. broadly defined AKI. METHODS: In a multinational prospective observational study, AKI diagnosis in critically ill septic children was stratified by duration (transient vs. persistent) and severity (mild vs. severe by creatinine change and urine output). The outcomes of interest were mortality and intensive care unit resource complexity at 28 days. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty-seven septic children were studied (male 52.7%, age 4.6 years (1.5–11.9)). Mortality (overall 12.1%) was different between severe AKI and mild AKI (18.3 vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) as well as intensive care unit (ICU) complexity (overall 34.5%, 45 vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with Persistent AKI had fewer ICU-free days (17 (7, 21) vs. 24 (17, 26), p < 0.001) and higher ICU complexity (52.8 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002) than transient AKI, even after exclusion of patients with early mortality. AKI phenotypes incorporating temporal and severity data correlate with unique survival (range 4.4–21.6%) and ICU-free days (range of 15–25 days) CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of septic children with AKI changes by clinical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of prognostic enrichment in sepsis and AKI for the purpose of trial design and patient management. IMPACT: Although AKI occurs commonly in patients with sepsis (S-AKI), outcomes for children with S-AKI varies based on the severity and timing of the AKI. Existing S-AKI pediatric data utilize a broad singular definition of kidney injury. Increasing the precision of AKI classification results in a new understanding of how S-AKI associates with patient outcome. A refined classification of S-AKI identifies subgroups of children, making possible a targeted and a personalized medicine approach to S-AKI study and management.","Basu, Rajit K.; Hackbarth, Richard; Gillespie, Scott; Akcan-Arikan, Ayse; Brophy, Patrick; Bagshaw, Sean; Alobaidi, Rashid; Goldstein, Stuart L.",Pediatr Res,263,1

Mitochondrial transplantation therapy has been an active research area for treating mitochondria-associated diseases from animal studies to clinical trials. However, the specific mechanism involved in the anti-tumor activity of healthy mitochondria remain to be characterized. Here we investigate the signal mechanism and gender difference of mitochondrial transplantation therapy against malignant melanoma. In the study, we administrated intact mitochondria extracted from mouse livers respectively to the mice bearing malignantly subcutaneous and metastatic melanoma, and identified the signal mechanism responsible for the mitochondrial treatment through transcriptomic analysis. Meanwhile, the efficiency of female mitochondria and male mitochondria was compared in the cultured melanoma cells and transplanted melanoma in mice. The results suggested that the mitochondria significantly inhibited the tumor cell proliferation in vitro through cell cycle arrest and induction of cell apoptosis. In the melanoma-bearing mice, the mitochondria retard the tumor growth and lung migration, and the transcriptomic analysis indicated that general chromosome silencing was strongly associated with the mitochondria against melanoma after the mitochondrial transplantation on the metastasis melanoma. Moreover, the anti-tumor activity of mitochondria from female animals was more efficient in comparison to the males, and the female mitochondria could probably induce more persuasive mitochondria-nuclear communication than the mitochondria from male mice. The study identifies the anti-tumor mechanism of the mitochondrial transplantation therapy, and provides a novel insight into the effect of mitochondria from different gender.","Yu, Zhenyao; Hou, Yixue; Zhou, Wei; Zhao, Zizhen; Liu, Zesheng; Fu, Ailing",Int J Biol Sci,263,1

At the same time the number of people retaining some of their own teeth is rising. There significant differences between those living in care and their community dwelling peers, with evidence showing those in care having fewer teeth and significantly higher levels of dental decay. There are numerous Cochrane reviews linking the use of fluoride to a reduction in dental decay, however, the majority of research on effectiveness has been conducted on children and consequently, children and adolescents tend to be the main recipients of fluoride interventions. There are to date no studies comparing the effectiveness of fluoride interventions in older people in care homes in the UK. However, prior to developing an appropriate protocol for full-scale trial comparing clinical effectiveness of fluoride interventions, there are a number of trial feasibility and statistical parameters that need to be clarified. METHODS: This trial is a single centre, multi-site randomised controlled assessor blind parallel group (three groups) trial, with the primary objective of establishing the feasibility, practicability and compliance of fluoride interventions to prevent dental decay in care homes. Secondary and tertiary objectives will aim to explore the acceptability of the interventions from resident, care home and dental services perspectives, and estimate the efficacy of the three different fluoride treatments. DISCUSSION: This feasibility trial will produce new knowledge and add value to a landscape that is under researched. Although the efficacy of fluoride interventions is proven, the feasibility of dental research and prevention in this vulnerable group and in the complex care home setting is novel. This work will not only add to our understanding of the interface of dental care and social care but will also contribute to our broader understanding on undertaking research in care home settings. Dental care for older people has been a longstanding issue, and the events of this past year has shone a light on the vulnerabilities of those residing in care homes and so this research is landing at a pivotal time.

Few studies have investigated the pharmacodynamic effect of the FC on hemodynamic flow and pressure variables. We designed this trial aiming at describing the pharmacodynamic profile of two different FC infusion times, of a fixed dose of 4 ml kg(−1). METHODS: Forty-nine elective neurosurgical patients received two consecutive FCs of 4 ml kg(−1) of crystalloids in 10 (FC(10)) or 20 (FC(20)) minutes, in a random order. Fluid responsiveness was defined as stroke volume index increase ≥ 10%. We assessed the net area under the curve (AUC), the maximal percentage difference from baseline (d(max)), time when the d(max) was observed (t(max)), change from baseline at 1-min (d(1)) and 5-min (d(5)) after FC end. RESULTS: After FC(10) and FC(20,) 25 (51%) and 14 (29%) of 49 patients were classified as fluid responders (p = 0.001). With the exception of the AUCs of SAP and MAP, the AUCs of all the considered hemodynamic variables were comparable. The d(max) and the t(max) were overall comparable. In both groups, the hemodynamic effects on flow variables were dissipated within 5 min after FC end. CONCLUSIONS: The infusion time of FC administration affects fluid responsiveness, being higher for FC(10) as compared to FC(20). The effect on flow variables of either FCs fades 5 min after the end of infusion.

This study aimed to predict language outcomes at 2 years corrected gestational age (CGA) for children born preterm. METHODS: We analysed data from 89 preterm neonates (median GA 29 weeks) who underwent diffusion MRI (dMRI) at term-equivalent age and language assessment at 2 years CGA using the Bayley-III. Feature selection and a random forests classifier were used to differentiate typical versus delayed (Bayley-III language composite score <85) language development. RESULTS: The model achieved balanced accuracy: 91%, sensitivity: 86%, and specificity: 96%. The probability of language delay at 2 years CGA is increased with: increasing values of peak width of skeletonized fractional anisotropy (PSFA), radial diffusivity (PSRD), and axial diffusivity (PSAD) derived from dMRI; among twins; and after an incomplete course of, or no exposure to, antenatal corticosteroids. Female sex and breastfeeding during the neonatal period reduced the risk of language delay. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of perinatal clinical information and MRI features leads to accurate prediction of preterm infants who are likely to develop language deficits in early childhood. This model could potentially enable stratification of preterm children at risk of language dysfunction who may benefit from targeted early interventions.

In the literature review that informs this work, we assess the current, limited models for connecting communities to formal institutions, as well as the emerging role of community-based organizations in this work, and we offer our own assessment of some of the key tensions, lacunae, and trends in the community resilience field. Principally, we explore the potential of the CCA model, as spearheaded by the East Scarborough Storefront and the Centre for Connected Communities in Toronto, Canada, as a promising approach for building the relational space between civil society and the state that is so often called for in the literature. The paper concludes with future directions for research and practice.","Poland, Blake; Gloger, Anne; Morgan, Garrett T.; Lach, Norene; Jackson, Suzanne F.; Urban, Rylan; Rolston, Imara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,263,1

To narrow the scope of the research, the study concentrates on metaphors and their role in risk cognition, especially in the face of information overload. This approach allows the author to study the metaphorical dimension of risk cognition as well as its dynamics connected with the necessity of a constant response to changing internal and external conditions. Theoretical investigations on metaphors in food, health and risk discourse are often supported by empirical analyses on the use of metaphors in communicating food-borne diseases. This study encompasses selected materials on food-borne diseases gathered from Italian online sources and covers the corpus of investigated verbal metaphors. The aim of this chapter is to show whether metaphors strengthen or weaken risk cognition, and how far they determine the risk communication of food-borne diseases.","Bielenia-Grajewska, Magdalena",Risk and Cognition,263,13

Thoracic radiation as well as cancer pharmacotherapeutics, including conventional chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and cancer immunotherapies, have been associated with a unique spectrum of histopathologic injury patterns that may involve the lung parenchyma, pleura, airways, and/or pulmonary vasculature. Injury patterns may be idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and highly variable from one agent class to the next. Variability in lung injury patterns within a specific therapeutic class of drugs also occurs, adding to the conundrum. Drug-induced toxicities to the thoracic cavity are infrequent, and early recognition of clinical clues portends a good outcome in most cases. Failure to recognize early clinical signs, however, may result in irreversible and potentially lethal consequences. This chapter provides an overview of our current knowledge of thoracic complications associated with cancer pharmacotherapies. The review is not intended to be a treatise of all cancer agents that adversely affect the lungs, but rather a discussion of established risk factors and histopathologic patterns of lung injury associated with broad classes of cancer agents. Optimal management strategies, based on existing clinical experience, will also be discussed. Complications associated with thoracic radiation are also reviewed. It is hoped that these discussions will facilitate early recognition and management of treatment-related thoracic complications and, ultimately, better patient outcomes.","Shannon, Vickie R.",Oncologic Critical Care,263,1

Multiple clinical studies have evaluated this technology, the strongest evidence to date supporting its use being the Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial, which showed survival advantage when patients were treated with a protocol that included ECMO. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) is similar in concept to ECMO, but has a lower flow rate and does not significantly oxygenate the patient.

We further validate our conclusion on our real-world inspired vehicle datasets and also find applying oversampling techniques can improve the performance by around 10%. In addition, seven data complexity measures are considered for the initial purpose of investigating the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of resampling techniques.

This study proposes two novel concepts; a structural model of environmental deviance to aid in autonomous navigation, and a method to use the output of said model to implement a collision avoidance system.

This function may then be used to retrieve, from the whole dataset, a ranked list of points that satisfy the concept of interest. CHOCOLATE relies on a Choquet integral to aggregate the relevance of individual attribute values among all the representative points as well as the representativity of sets of such attribute values.

In this study, we aim at relaxing this assumption on stationarity and isotropy of the neighborhood shape in order to get a prior probability term that is relevant not only within the homogeneous areas but also close to object borders and within thin structures. To tackle the issue of neighborhood shape estimation, we propose to use tensor voting, that allows for the estimation of structure direction and saliency at various scales. We propose three main ways to derive anisotropic neighborhoods, namely shape-based, target-based and cardinal-based neighborhood. Then, having defined the neighborhood field, we introduce an energy that will be minimized using graph cuts, and illustrate the benefits of our approach against the use of isotropic neighborhoods in the applicative context of crack detection.

Moreover, threshold guards can be found in recent blockchain algorithms such as Tendermint consensus. In this tutorial, we give an overview of the techniques implemented in Byzantine Model Checker (ByMC). ByMC implements several techniques for automatic verification of threshold-guarded distributed algorithms. These algorithms have the following features: (1) up to t of processes may crash or behave Byzantine; (2) the correct processes count messages and make progress when they receive sufficiently many messages, e.g., at least [Formula: see text]; (3) the number n of processes in the system is a parameter, as well as t; (4) and the parameters are restricted by a resilience condition, e.g., [Formula: see text]. Traditionally, these algorithms were implemented in distributed systems with up to ten participating processes. Nowadays, they are implemented in distributed systems that involve hundreds or thousands of processes. To make sure that these algorithms are still correct for that scale, it is imperative to verify them for all possible values of the parameters.","Konnov, Igor; Lazić, Marijana; Stoilkovska, Ilina; Widder, Josef","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",263,1

In this paper, we explore the usage of user-level threading to enable productive and efficient communication overlap and pipelining. We extend OpenSHMEM with integrated user-level thread scheduling, enabling applications to leverage fine-grain threading as an alternative to non-blocking communication. Our solution introduces communication-aware thread scheduling that utilizes the communication state of threads to minimize context switching overheads. We identify several patterns common to multi-threaded OpenSHMEM applications, leverage user-level threads to increase overlap of communication and computation, and explore the impact of different thread scheduling policies. Results indicate that user-level threading can enable blocking communication to meet the performance of highly-optimized, non-blocking, single-threaded codes with significantly lower application-level complexity. In one case, we observe a 28.7% performance improvement for the Smith-Waterman DNA sequence alignment benchmark.","Wasi-ur- Rahman, Md.; Ozog, David; Dinan, James",High Performance Computing,263,22

Safety verification is a key issue for weakly-hard systems, as it ensures system safety under allowed deadline misses. Previous works are either for linear systems only, or limited to a certain type of nonlinear systems (e.g., systems that satisfy exponential stability and Lipschitz continuity of the system dynamics). In this work, we propose a new technique for infinite-time safety verification of general nonlinear weakly-hard systems. Our approach first discretizes the safe state set into grids and constructs a directed graph, where nodes represent the grids and edges represent the reachability relation. Based on graph theory and dynamic programming, our approach can effectively find the safe initial set (consisting of a set of grids), from which the system can be proven safe under given weakly-hard constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, when compared with the state-of-the-art. An open source implementation of our tool is available at https://github.com/551100kk/SAW.

Nutrition is closely associated with postoperative outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) on PPCs in radical cystectomy. METHODS: PNI was calculated as 10 × (serum albumin) + 0.005 × (total lymphocyte count). The risk factors for PPCs were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of PNI was performed, and an optimal cut-off value was identified. Propensity score-matched analysis was used to determine the impact of PNI on PPCs. Postoperative outcomes were also evaluated. RESULTS: PPCs occurred in 112 (13.6%) of 822 patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified PNI, age, and serum creatinine level as risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of PNI for predicting PPCs was 0.714 (optimal cut-off value: 45). After propensity score matching, the incidence of PPCs in the PNI ≤ 45 group was significantly higher compared with the PNI > 45 group (20.8% vs. 6.8%; p < 0.001), and PNI ≤ 45 was associated with a higher incidence of PPCs (odds ratio 3.308, 95% confidence interval 1.779–6.151; p < 0.001). The rates of intensive care unit admission and prolonged (> 2 days) stay thereof were higher in patients who developed PPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative PNI ≤ 45 was associated with a higher incidence of PPCs in radical cystectomy, suggesting that PNI provides useful information regarding pulmonary complications after radical cystectomy.","Yu, Jihion; Hong, Bumsik; Park, Jun-Young; Hwang, Jai-Hyun; Kim, Young-Kug",Ann Surg Oncol,263,1

This survey aims to appraise the literacy level and gather the opinions of public health experts and allied professionals working in the field of infectious diseases in Belgium concerning the implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in public health practice. METHODS: In May 2019, Belgian public health and healthcare professionals were invited to complete an online survey containing eight main topics including background questions, general attitude towards pathogen genomics for public health practice and main concerns, genomic literacy, current and planned NGS activities, place of NGS in diagnostic microbiology pathways, data sharing obstacles, end-user requirements, and key drivers for the implementation of NGS. Descriptive statistics were used to report on the frequency distribution of multiple choice responses whereas thematic analysis was used to analyze free text responses. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to identify important predictors for a positive attitude towards the implementation of pathogen genomics in public health practice. RESULTS: 146 out of the 753 invited public health professionals completed the survey. 63% of respondents indicated that public health agencies should be using genomics to understand and control infectious diseases. Having a high level of expertise in the field of pathogen genomics was the strongest predictor of a positive attitude (OR = 4.04, 95% CI = 1.11 – 17.23). A significantly higher proportion of data providers indicated to have followed training in the field of pathogen genomics compared to data end-users (p < 0.001). Overall, 79% of participants expressed interest in receiving further training. Main concerns were related to the cost of sequencing technologies, data sharing, data integration, interdisciplinary working, and bioinformatics expertise. CONCLUSIONS: Belgian health professionals expressed favorable views about implementation of pathogen genomics in their work activities related to infectious disease surveillance and control. They expressed the need for suitable training initiatives to strengthen their competences in the field. Their perception of the utility and feasibility of pathogen genomics for public health purposes will be a key driver for its further implementation.","Van Goethem, N.; Struelens, M.

To help curb this problem, we propose the novel notion of a responsible Internet, which provides higher degrees of trust and sovereignty for critical service providers (e.g., power grids) and all kinds of other users by improving the transparency, accountability, and controllability of the Internet at the network-level. A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP. We believe that a responsible Internet is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet and that the concept is useful for clean slate Internet systems as well.","Hesselman, Cristian; Grosso, Paola; Holz, Ralph; Kuipers, Fernando; Xue, Janet Hui; Jonker, Mattijs; de Ruiter, Joeri; Sperotto, Anna; van Rijswijk-Deij, Roland; Moura, Giovane C.

There is a growing recognition of the damage the lockdown has caused to economic and social life. This paper presents a simple cost–benefit analysis inspired by optimal control theory and incorporating the SIR model of disease propagation. It also reports simulations informed by the theoretical discussion. The optimal path for government intervention is computed under a variety of conditions. These include a cap on the permitted level of infection to avoid overload of the health system, and the introduction of a test and trace system. We quantify the benefits of early intervention to control the disease. We also examine how the government’s valuation of life influences the optimal path. A 10-week lockdown is only optimal if the value of life for COVID-19 victims exceeds £10m. The study is based on a standard but simple epidemiological model, and should therefore be regarded as presenting a methodological framework rather than giving policy prescriptions.","Rowthorn, Robert; Maciejowski, Jan",,263,22

Amongst intrinsic biochemicals activity, the differential response of radical scavenging, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (POX) activities, were observed in the selected rice varieties at 14 days old seedling stage, developed under controlled growth conditions. Comparatively, North India region rice varieties displayed an enhanced intrinsic biochemical response than south India region rice varieties. Similarly, basmati rice varieties showed increased biochemical response compared to non-basmati rice varieties. Thus, the differential biochemical responses (radical scavenging, SOD, CAT, and POX activities) observed creates a significant difference between rice varieties and provides valuable information about rice ecotype-biochemical interaction for sustainable adaptive value under different ecological conditions.","Haq, Shamshad Ul; Kumari, Deepa; Dhingra, Prerna; Kothari, S.

In this study, the TRAF3 ortholog from the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (LvTRAF3) was cloned and characterized. LvTRAF3 has a transcript of 3,865 bp, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,002 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 333 amino acids, including a conserved TRAF-C domain. The expression of LvTRAF3 in the intestine and hemocyte was up-regulated in response to poly (I:C) challenge and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. RNAi knockdown of LvTRAF3 in vivo significantly increased WSSV gene transcription, viral loads, and mortality in WSSV-infected shrimp. Next, we found that LvTRAF3 was not able to induce the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which was crucial for synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which mediate antiviral immunity. Specifically, in dual-luciferase reporter assays, LvTRAF3 could not activate several types of promoters with NF-κB binding sites, including those from WSSV genes (wsv069, wsv056, and wsv403), Drosophila AMPs or shrimp AMPs. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of shrimp AMPs did not significantly change when TRAF3 was knocked down during WSSV infection. Instead, we found that LvTRAF3 signaled through the IRF-Vago antiviral cascade. LvTRAF3 functioned upstream of LvIRF to regulate the expression of LvVago4 and LvVago5 during WSSV infection in vivo. Taken together, these data provide experimental evidence of the participation of LvTRAF3 in the host defense to WSSV through the activation of the IRF-Vago pathway but not the NF-κB pathway.","Li, Haoyang; Fu, Qihui; Wang, Sheng; Chen, Rongjian; Jiang, Xiewu; Zhu, Peng; He, Jianguo; Li, Chaozheng",Front Immunol,263,4

The composite phase TBCs showed promising performance related benefits over conventional single phase TBCs, including durability, material affordability, thermal stability and low thermal conductivity. The present work is to continue the effort to exploring the TBC behaviors of erosive wear by solid particle erosion test and thermal cyclic shock by special burner rig test. In the erosion test, the investigation was focused on the most important characteristics of erosion test results using different characterization methods, including the variations of erosion damages with impingement angle and finally the effect of high temperature sintering. In the burner rig test, the TBC was exposed to a rapidly thermal cycling condition introduced by a high heat flux and high-velocity combustion torch. The TBC damages and failure modes were identified and explained in terms of microstructural observation and mechanism discussion. The composite phase c + t′ TBC demonstrated improved erosion resistance relative to a Gd(2)Zr(2)O(7) TBC and equivalent thermal shock resistance to a conventional 8YSZ TBC.","Ma, Xinqing; Rivellini, Kristina; Ruggiero, Peter; Wildridge, George",J Therm Spray Tech,263,1

The article describes in detail theoretical approaches to the analysis of the spread of social diseases and discusses methodological limitations that reduce the possibility of predicting such phenomena and affect decision-making by the authorities. At the same time, we believe that for most regions, including Moscow, until May 12, 2020, the dynamics of confirmed cases are a reduced and delayed reflection of actual processes. Thus, the introduced self-isolation regime in Moscow and other agglomerations affected the decrease in the number of newly confirmed cases two weeks after its introduction. In accordance with our model, at the first stage, carriers infected abroad were concentrated in regions with large agglomerations and in coastal and border areas with a high intensity of internal and external links. Unfortunately, the infection could not be contained, and it started growing exponentially across the country. By mid-April 2020, cases of the disease were observed in all Russian regions; however, the remotest regions least connected with other parts of Russia and other countries had only isolated cases. By mid-May, at least in Moscow, the number of new cases began to decline, which created the prerequisites for reducing restrictions on the movement of residents. However, the decrease in the number of new cases after passing the peak of the epidemic in May is slower than the increase at the beginning. These facts contradict the diffusion model; thus, the model is not applicable for epidemiological forecasts based on empirical data. Using econometric methods, it is shown that for different periods of diffusion, various characteristics of the regions affect the spread of the disease. Among these features we note the high population density in cities, proximity to the largest metropolitan areas, higher proportion of the most active and frequently traveling part of the population (innovators, migrants), and intensive ties within the community, as well as with other regions and countries. The virus has spread faster in regions where the population has a higher susceptibility to diseases, which confirms the importance of the region’s health capital. The initial stage was dominated by random factors. We conclude this paper with directions for further research.","Zemtsov, S. P.; Baburin, V. L.",Reg,263,16

Several studies have reported the interaction of bovine viral-diarrhea virus (BVDV) with gametes and in-vitro-produced (IVP) bovine embryos. Since, gene expression in BVDV-infected IVP bovine embryos is scarcely addressed. The aim of this work was to evaluate the differential expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory response. Groups of 20–25 embryos on Day 6 (morula stage) were exposed (infected) or not (control) to an NCP-BVDV strain in SOF medium. After 24 h, embryos that reached expanded blastocyst stage were washed. Total RNA of each embryo group was extracted to determine the transcription levels of 9 specific transcripts related with antiviral and inflammatory response by SYBR Green real time quantitative (RT-qPCR). Culture media and an aliquot of the last embryos wash on Day 7 were analyzed by titration and virus isolation, respectively. A conventional PCR confirmed BVDV presence in IVP embryos. A significantly higher expression of interferon-α was observed in blastocysts exposed to NCP-BVDV compared to the controls (p < 0.05). In this study, the upregulation of INFα and TLR7 genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in BVDV-infected IVP bovine embryos is a new finding in this field. This differential expression suggest that embryonic cells could function in a manner like immune cells by recognizing and responding early to interaction with viral pathogens. These results provide new insights into the action of BVDV on the complex molecular pathways controlling bovine early embryonic development.","González Altamiranda, Erika A.; Arias, María E.; Kaiser, Germán G.; Mucci, Nicolás C.; Odeón, Anselmo C.; Felmer, Ricardo N.",Mol Biol Rep,263,33

However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women. Building on this, we tested whether older adults – and particularly older men -- would report the least amount of COVID-19 worry and also fewer COVID-19 behavior changes. To do so, from March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. Our results showed that during the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults (e.g., thought COVID-19 was different than the flu). Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes, such as wearing a mask. These tesults suggest that interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 behavior changes in older men. These results also highlight the importance of understanding emotional-responses to COVID-19, as these are predictive of their behavioral responses.","Barber, Sarah; Kim, Hyunji",Innov Aging,263,1

We hypothesized that use of correct technique such as changing gloves after N95 contact or providing rapid decontamination between each use would reduce the risk for contamination. METHODS: We conducted a randomized crossover study using simulated patient care interactions to compare the effectiveness of interventions to reduce contamination of personnel and the environment with high-level N95 contamination (10(7) plaque-forming units [PFU] of bacteriophage MS2 applied to front of respirator). Ten healthcare personnel performed 4 randomly-assigned standardized examinations of mannequins including: 1) Control (PPE donning and doffing not including glove change after N95 contact); 2) Glove change after any N95 contact; 3) Control with 1-minute ultraviolet-C light (UV-C) treatment between simulations; 4) Control with 30-second steam treatment between simulations. A second trial was conducted with groups 1–3 using a lower inoculum (10(5) PFU). The frequencies of participant and environmental contamination were compared. RESULTS: As shown in Figure 1.A, use of a highly contaminated N95 respirator resulted in frequent MS2 contamination in the Control, Glove change, and UV-C groups, but was dramatically reduced with steam treatment of the N95. With the lower level of contamination, MS2 contamination occurred less frequently across all groups, and was significantly reduced in the UV group, compared to the Control (Figure 1.B). Figure 1: Bacteriophage MS2 contamination during simulated patient care interactions with contaminated N95 respirators [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Reuse of contaminated N95 respirators resulted in contamination of personnel and the environment even when correct technique was used.

We aimed to assess whether the CO(2) gap can predict postoperative adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 5,151 patients from our departmental database who underwent cardiac surgery from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018. Lactate level (mmol·L(−1)), central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO(2)) (%), and the venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (CO(2) gap) were measured at intensive care unit (ICU) admission and on days 1 and 2 after cardiac surgery. The following postoperative adverse outcomes were collected: ICU mortality, hemopericardium or tamponade, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, major bleeding, acute hepatic failure, mesenteric ischemia, and pneumonia. The primary outcome was the presence of at least one postoperative adverse outcome. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between ScVO(2), lactate, and the CO(2) gap with adverse outcomes. Their diagnostic performance was compared using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: There were 1,933 patients (38%) with an adverse outcome. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) parameters were similar between groups. The CO(2) gap was slightly higher for the “adverse outcomes” group than for the “no adverse outcomes” group. Arterial lactate at admission, day 1, and day 2 was also slightly higher in patients with adverse outcomes. Central venous oxygen saturation was not significantly different between patients with and without adverse outcomes. The area under the ROC curve to predict outcomes after CPB for the CO(2) gap at admission, day 1, and day 2 were 0.52, 0.55, and 0.53, respectively. CONCLUSION: After cardiac surgery with CPB, the CO(2) gap at ICU admission, day 1, and day 2 was associated with postoperative adverse outcomes but showed poor diagnostic performance.","Huette, Pierre; Beyls, Christophe; Mallat, Jihad; Martineau, Lucie; Besserve, Patricia; Haye, Guillaume; Guilbart, Mathieu; Dupont, Hervé; Guinot, Pierre-Grégoire; Diouf, Momar; Mahjoub, Yazine; Abou-Arab, Osama",Can J Anaesth,263,31

The rGA733-2 and rGA733-Fc proteins were highly expressed when the pBINPLUS vector system was used for transient expression in tobacco plants. In addition, the length of interval between rGA733-2 and left border of T-DNA affected the expression of rGA733 protein.

In particular, travel demand has registered an unprecedented overall contraction, dramatically dropping down with peaks of - 90%-95% passengers for public transport (PT). During the re-opening phase, demand is gradually resuming the levels before the crisis, although some structural changes are observed in travel behaviour, and containment measures to reduce the risk of contagion are still being applied, affecting transport supply. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims at assessing to what extent keeping a one-meter interpersonal distancing on-board trains is sustainable for public transport companies. METHOD: The analysis is based on travel demand forecasting models applied to two case-studies in Italy: a suburban railway line and a High-speed Rail (HSR) line, differentiated by demand characteristics (e.g. urban vs. ex-urban) and train access system (free access vs. reservation required). RESULTS: In the suburban case, the results show the need of new urban policies, not only limited to the transport domain, in order to manage the demand peaks at the stations and on-board vehicles. In the ex-urban case, the outputs suggest the need for public subsidies in order for the railways undertakings to cope with revenue losses and, at the same time, to maintain service quality levels.","Coppola, Pierluigi; De Fabiis, Francesco",Eur,263,1

The research hypotheses are tested with survey data collected through two studies among Pakistani-based professionals: 316 in study 1 and 421 in study 2. The results pinpoint a salient risk for employees who experience fear during a pandemic crisis, in that the associated economic and psychological hardships make the situation worse by undermining their sleep quality, which eventually could diminish the quality of their lives even further. It also reveals how organizations can mitigate this risk if employees can leverage pertinent personal resources, such as mindfulness.","De Clercq, Dirk; Haq, Inam Ul; Azeem, Muhammad Umer; Khalid, Samia",,263,30

In this study, we investigate how ca. 400 students determine the trustworthiness of false, biased and credible news. We find that students use different strategies depending on what they evaluate. For example, students who fail to debunk a manipulated image often rely on what they see in the image in contrast to students who determine credibility upon what is not in the image. Students finding junk news credible may have special problems separating different kinds of sources. We identify potentials and pitfalls among students important for further investigation, research and a focus on education.","Nygren, Thomas; Wiksten Folkeryd, Jenny; Liberg, Caroline; Guath, Mona",Disinformation in Open Online Media,263,15

Therefore, UUS development needs better concerted guidelines to coordinate various urban systems and the multiple components of the underground world. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which should be viewed as important yardsticks for UUS development, do not explicitly mention urban underground space, although many of them are affected by both the positive and negative consequences of its development. To fill this gap, this review lays the foundations of relevant UUS concepts and uses exemplary cases to reveal that 11 out of 17 SDGs can be linked with UUS uses. These linkages also manifest that land administration, integrated planning, architectural design, and construction technology are critical dimensions for increasing the contributions of UUS to the realization of SDGs. To achieve multi-disciplinary synergies among these four critical dimensions, a collaborative approach framework based on spatial data infrastructure is required. Thus, this work provides academics and practitioners with a holistic view of sustainable UUS development.","Peng, Fang-Le; Qiao, Yong-Kang; Sabri, Soheil; Atazadeh, Behnam; Rajabifard, Abbas",Front,263,3

Eighty undergraduate student participants (mean age = 19.46 years, SD = 1.43; gender: 48 females, 29 males, 3 preferred not to answer) were assigned to one of two groups in alternating order: one who played Flower and the comparison group who participated in a body scan, each lasting 20 min. Psychological and physiological stress measurements were made before and after each intervention. Self-perceived psychological stress was measured using a modified version of the nine-item Psychological Stress Measure (PSM-9), and physiological stress (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) was measured using an electronic blood-pressure cuff. The results were analyzed with a 2 (measurement: pre, post) × 2 (intervention: video game, mindfulness-meditation) mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each of the four outcome measures. There was a statistically significant reduction (pre- to post-intervention) across all outcome measures. Notably, there was a significant measurement × intervention interaction (p < .001) for the psychological stress measure; participants in the mindfulness-meditation group reported greater stress reduction after the intervention than participants in the video game group. Although these results suggest mindfulness-meditation provides a slight advantage for stress reduction than casual video games, the similarity in reduction across all physiological measures between the two interventions nevertheless suggests casual video games may also be an effective medium. This finding is especially promising given casual video games’ accessibility, ease of use, and popularity among students. These results may inform initiatives by colleges and universities to better support students during peak times of stress and especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Desai, Veeral; Gupta, Arnav; Andersen, Lucas; Ronnestrand, Bailey; Wong, Michael",Trends in Psychol.,263,16

These strategies should be multidisciplinary, personalised interventions, performed in appropriate settings along a healthcare continuum from inpatient to community care. Personalisation, and the complexity of levels of care and interventions make evaluation of treatments difficult. The present study aims to measure the effectiveness of a complex treatment programme for EDs which includes hospitalisation, day hospital and outpatient settings. Our purpose is to assess the complete therapeutic process of each patient through all these levels of care, capturing the multiplicity of trajectories that a programme of these characteristics involves. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a multicentre, naturalistic, observational study. All patients starting between November 2017 and October 2020 in a healthcare network for EDs in Spain are being invited to participate. The first phase of intensive change monitoring to November 2020 is followed by lower intensity follow-up until October 2025. In the first phase progress of all participants is assessed every 3 weeks using specific measures for ED and the Clinical Outcomes Routine Evaluation system, a family of instruments specifically designed to measure change in psychotherapy. In the second phase data collection will happen quarterly. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses will be conducted, with a special focus on patterns and predictors of change studied through multilevel linear models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Research Bioethics Committee of the University of Barcelona (no. IRB00003099) and the ethical committee of ITA Mental Health, the organisation to which all participating centres belong. Dissemination will be in papers for peer-reviewed research journals and to clinicians working with ED.

Taking Latour’s idea of the reformulation of the mission of university around outreach as the key organising principle, we argue for reform of doctoral education to produce graduates who are proponents of public and persuasive science. Our model for public science is drawn from that of public health, that aggregation of specialisations which is able to propel public policy, as evinced in the management of the pandemic, by bridging the gap between science and policy. We respond to Latour’s provocations for the re-orientation of the university with some specific considerations pertaining to doctoral education and curricula; and the relationship between STEM-M and HASS fields and capabilities in the outreach focused university. Our proposals include the need to shift from involuted models of doctoral education as preparing ‘stewards of the discipline’ to an idea of doctoral education as a different kind of worldly stewardship and a challenge to positivity and a plea for normativity. We call for a public and persuasive PhD: programs which produce graduates who have advanced capacities in communication, in reason-based argument, in persuasion, and who can deal adeptly with the demands of academic debate and the rigours of public discourse.","Cuthbert, Denise; Barnacle, Robyn",The PhD at the End of the World,263,1

Provided the affirmative outcome, this would mean greater competition but also greater opportunities for universities teaching logistics programs to apply blended learning. We present an overview of logistics-related material on three major platforms totaling 95 courses and compare a sample of five logistics curricula against this list to demonstrate the extent of coverage by online material as well as to point out the gaps. The data suggests that the current status of logistics MOOCs can mostly cover more introductory and broader managerial-type programs but not material on logistics operations in-depth. Also, MOOCs tend to struggle with more interdisciplinary topic approaches.

The organization is rapidly expanding their current market share and are winning awards for it. This achievement is quite noteworthy considering that prospective competitors in the insurance industry are often challenged by numerous market barriers in developing countries. These barriers include an existing saturated market with many big competitors offering insurance products at cut-throat prices. Adding to the challenge is the market’s strict compliance regulation prescriptions. This sparked the interest to investigate how this organization has achieved their success. A case study approach was used to investigate the extent to which the eight factors of a business strategy development approach – the Eight S model as proposed by Higgins [1] – was used and subsequently contributed to the overall success of the organization. After numerous observations, the analysis of secondary documentation and open-ended interviews across different levels of the organization, the main finding was that the seven contextual factors of the Eight S model proposed by Higgins [1] namely – strategy and purpose, structure, systems and processes, management style, staff, shared values contributing to strategic performance – were to some extent implemented in the organization. However, the main contributor towards achieving their success was the re-Sources (resources) factor.

The pandemic of COVID-19 has claimed numerous lives with the counts constantly rising day by day. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 30,000 base pairs. It belongs to the family Coronaviridae. Genomic characterization has revealed that it is a zoonotic virus that has somehow jumped to humans. SARS-CoV-2 complies with the general morphological characteristics of coronaviruses and has a diameter of about 70–90 nm. Spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins comprise the main structural proteins of the virus and help in its transmission and pathogenesis. Its genome contains at least six open reading frames (ORFs) at the 5′ end which encode pp1a and pp1b proteins. These produce nonstructural proteins which are required for optimum function of the virus particle. The structural proteins are coded for by the ORFs near the 3′-end of the genome. SARS-CoV-2 displays typical viral internalization and amplification cycles inside the host cell to which it binds by the spike protein. This spike protein displays specific amino acid sequences in its receptor binding domain which enable it to form a strong bond to host receptor. Host cells produce different immune products as a reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These are responsible for controlling the progress of infection. However, they can lead to acute respiratory distress and other tissue injuries if produced in uncontrolled quantities. Histopathological examinations of affected organs show cytopathic effects due to viral infection.

Extant research has mostly focused on the device specific characteristics to explain the adoption of VA. In this research, we take a different approach and examine the psychological determinants of VA adoption. We look at how factors such as playfulness, escapism, anthropomorphism, and visual appeal of VA influence the attitudes (hedonic and utilitarian) of consumers. Moreover, we also examine the effects of psychological characteristics of VA on usage intentions and satisfaction, which lead to a favorable word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior that is critical for adoption of a technology. Using a structural equation modeling approach, our results suggest that psychological factors have a significant positive influence on both attitudes. Hedonic attitude further influences satisfaction and utilitarian attitude positively impacts usage and satisfaction, which have a positive association with WOM. Our research offers useful insights to marketers to increase the VA adoption and makes contributions to the literature.","Mishra, Anubhav; Shukla, Anuja",Re-imagining Diffusion and Adoption of Information Technology and Systems: A Continuing Conversation,263,1

Also, given the nature of face recognition, which fosters discrimination and surveillance, this paper introduces some ideas that can be used as a reference point for businesses to consider when establishing governance in the use of the face recognition technology.","Ozaki, Aimi",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,263,1

In fact, the theories and debates on care, which date back to the 1980s in the United States, have developed much more recently in Europe, where publications only appeared in late 1990s. This phenomenon has also elicited a growing interest in Latin America from late 2000s, where research has been conducted in different countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. On the other hand, although comparative studies are frequent, they cover mostly European countries. Nevertheless, Latin America is a social space where professional care has expanded dramatically over the past 20 years. However, unlike Japan, in the US and European countries, such expansion took place in a context of heterogeneous and poorly structured markets, which challenge not only academics but also decision makers. This chapter aims at presenting the scenario of Latin American research on care and care work vis-à-vis the international debates in the field. Firstly, the authors will situate the new empirical material vis-à-vis the broader preexisting literature. Secondly, they will explore how the Latin American experience transforms existing understandings on the social organization of care, especially on its relations with gender and race/ethnicity inequalities, which ground the new experiences of care policies in the region.","Araujo Guimarães, Nadya; Hirata, Helena",Care and Care Workers,263,1

Employee stress is harmful for both society (due to increased risk of mental health disorders and cardiovascular diseases) and for enterprise performance (due to increased risk of presenteeism, employee turnover and early retirement). This work aims at helping enterprises to improve employee wellbeing. To this end, we introduce a concept of IoT-based privacy-aware “team barometer” and present a first study into using inexpensive PIR (passive infrared) motion detection sensors in such barometers. The study was conducted as follows: first, we deployed IoT system in real offices and collected employee data in the course of everyday work during several months. Second, we developed a machine learning method to classify human conditions on the basis of collected PIR data. In the tests, this method recognised employees’ stress with 80% accuracy and dissatisfaction with indoor environmental quality - with 75% accuracy. Third, we integrated stress detection results into a “team barometer” and conducted interviews of line managers. Interview results suggest that the proposed IoT-based team barometer can be beneficial for both employees and enterprises because of its potential to discover and mitigate workplace problems notably faster than with current practice to use periodic surveys.","Vildjiounaite, Elena; Kallio, Johanna; Kantorovitch, Julia; Kyllönen, Vesa; Räsänen, Pauli; Ronkainen, Jussi",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,263,30

Often students struggle with cryptology as sound previous mathematical knowledge is required and study time is limited. Teachers face the problem to fairly assess the students’ knowledge and understanding of cryptology. The paper presents an approach to face these challenges by utilizing test driven software development techniques for students who have taken courses in programming and theoretical cryptology. The paper describes the practical experience gained in courses with ~30 students utilizing a specialized client-server system to automate the tests. We propose that this setup is beneficial for learning as it gives immediate feedback and allows students to focus on the erroneous parts of their software.

The solution to this threat, which is defined as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is currently undergoing very intensive studies. There is a consensus that the use of Computed Tomography (CT) techniques for early diagnosis of pandemic disease gives both fast and accurate results. This study provides an automated and highly effective method for detecting COVID-19 at an early stage. CT image features are extracted using the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is the most successful image processing tool of today, for the detection of COVID-19, where early detection is vital for human life. Representation power is increased by combining features from the output of four CNN architectures with data fusion. Finally, the features combined with the feature ranking method are sorted, and their length is reduced. In this way, the dimensional curse is saved. From 150 CT images, 16 × 16 (Subset-1) and 32 × 32 (Subset-2) patches were obtained to create a subset. Within the scope of the proposed method, 3000 patch images are labeled as “COVID-19 (coronavirus)” or “No finding” for use in training and test stages. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method then classified the processed data.

In tandem with the foregoing analysis, I will more comprehensively address the issue of shifts and changes which have taken place in Cyprus in recent years, particularly in the wake of the collapse of the talks in 2017. My analysis remains primarily empirical and focused on the influence of the various internal, geopolitical and economic factors in the political management of the Cyprus dispute. At the same time, this chapter poses certain theoretical questions from a historical perspective. Given that this is the last substantive chapter, my analysis here, leading up to the book’s conclusion, is more abstract and somewhat more generalised in order to capture broader dynamics and structural tendencies, as well as trying to encompass implications for the future.","Ioannou, Gregoris",The Normalisation of Cyprus&#x02019; Partition Among Greek Cypriots,263,1

It does so not by building a new financial system from scratch, but by developing three far-reaching changes to our present system that will transform it. The first reform is a new National Investment Council (NIC) that will coordinate investment across sectors and industries within our economy. The second reform is to expand the Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) current liability portfolio to include digitized taxpayer account wallets along with the private sector bank Reserve Accounts that it currently maintains. This expansion to a full People’s Fed will ensure that all have free digital banking. It will also afford, fee-free, a faster and more efficient, hence growth-friendly payments system, while affording the Fed a more efficient channel through which to conduct countercyclical monetary policy. The third reform will be the establishment of a Price Stabilization Fund, or ‘People’s Portfolio,’ through which the NIC or the Fed can modulate swings among systemically important prices. This will enable fine-grained price stability maintenance, a need that the Green New Deal’s operating in multiple industries will render acute from the point of view of both justice and sustainability.","Hockett, Robert C.",Financing the Green New Deal,263,1

Critical theorists have observed how work is linked to recognition and self-realization. Consequently, they see how unemployment can lead to a sense of alienation. Exploring the social practices among young entrepreneurial creative people receiving unemployment benefits in Denmark, we pose the following research question: how do young people in the unemployment benefit system work within and against the system? Based on interviews with young unemployed people conducted as part of a PhD (Pultz, 2017), we aim to unfold how the young people challenge the ‘work first paradigm’, including resisting the neoliberal understanding that human worth is determined by employment status. We combine insight from critical theory in order to understand the current work pathologies and apply the critical psychological concepts of restricted and expansive agency to shed light on how our sample engages in recognition struggles. They do so by seeking to gain influence over conditions and simultaneously resisting structures that restrict subjective agency in the spheres of love, achievement and rights. We will use this combined macro- and micro-level theoretical framework to analyse subjective reasoning for expansive agency embedded in an institutional and political context that reflects the work pathology diagnosis and produces its own dilemmas that need further understanding. Combining critical theory, more specifically Axel Honneth’s work on recognition with critical psychology, allows us to move beyond deterministic holds and to improve our understanding of agentic potential in society. Improving our understanding of how young unemployed people work within and against the system helps us better understand how individuals navigate the complex relations between societal structures and the self.","Eschweiler, Jennifer; Pultz, Sabina",Hu Arenas,263,27

In Japan, despite the declaration of a “state of emergency”, no lockdown was implemented, and a request for self-restraint and avoidance of non-essential trips was instead issued. After a month, the state of emergency was lifted. Because patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were forced to stay during the state of emergency, resulting in a lack of physical activity, concerns about their glycemic control were raised. Therefore, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels during different time periods were compared (May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019, May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020). We analyzed 165 patients with DM. The mean age of subjects was 67.8 + 11.5 years. Male comprised 67.3% of the participants. The mean body weight was 65.6 + 14.6 kg on July 2019 and 66.1 + 15.2 kg on July 2020. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.4 + 3.6 kg/m(2) on July 2019 and 24.4 + 3.6 on July 2020. Patients with Type 2 DM (T2DM) comprised 90% of the participants, while the rest had T1DM. Mean duration of DM was 12.0 + 7.4 years. In order to assess the effect of the self-restraint on plasma glucose control, HbA1c levels during these periods were compared: May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019 (one year before COVID-19 pandemic.), and May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020 (The last three months during COVID-19). March 2020 is corresponded to a period before the request for self-restraint, while June and July 2020 corresponded to the periods right after the end of self-restraint. We also compared HbA1c levels between May 2019 and July 2020 using the Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) to assess whether SMBG affected plasma glucose control during the period of self-restraint. HbA1c levels in May 2018, March 2019, June 2019, July 2019, May 2019, March 2020, June 2020, July 2020, were 7.32 + 1.23, 7.44 + 1.20, 7.16 + 1.06, 7.01 + 1.05, 7.23 + 1.06, 7.45 + 1.18, 7.15 + 10.7, and 7.11 + 1.17, respectively. Similarly, HbA1c levels between May 2019 without SMBG and May 2019 with SMBG were not statistically different. In this clinical study, we found that the request to avoid non-essential trips as a form of self-restraint during the country’s state of emergency did not affect plasma glucose control of patients with DM. We noted that the patients did not have signs of insulin resistance as their BMI on July 2019 and July 2020 were 24.4 + 3.6 and 24.4 + 3.6, respectively. Unexpectedly, the HbA1c levels were not affected by the absence or presence of SMBG. This could explain why HbA1c levels were not elevated, despite a temporarily sedentary lifestyle and a lack of exercise for a month. In addition, due to the self-restraint, the frequency of dining outside the house decreased, which could have contributed to the non-elevation of HbA1c levels.","Watanabe, Takuya; Takamizawa, Tetsuya; Okada, Junichi; Yamada, Eijiro; Saito, Tsugumichi; Okada, Kazuya; Nakajima, Yasuyo; Ozawa, Atsushi; Temma, Yuichi; Okada, Shuichi; Yamada, Masanobu; Horigome, Mitsuaki",J Endocr Soc,263,1

It frames the dynamics of living systems as if they were solving an inference problem. This rests upon their flow towards some (non-equilibrium) steady state—or equivalently, their maximisation of the Bayesian model evidence for an implicit probabilistic model. For many models, these self-evidencing dynamics manifest as messages passed among elements of a system. Such messages resemble synaptic communication at a neuronal network level but could also apply to other network structures. This paper attempts to apply the same formulation to biochemical networks. The chemical computation that occurs in regulation of metabolism relies upon sparse interactions between coupled reactions, where enzymes induce conditional dependencies between reactants. We will see that these reactions may be viewed as the movement of probability mass between alternative categorical states. When framed in this way, the master equations describing such systems can be reformulated in terms of their steady-state distribution. This distribution plays the role of a generative model, affording an inferential interpretation of the underlying biochemistry. Finally, we see that—in analogy with computational neurology and psychiatry—metabolic disorders may be characterized as false inference under aberrant prior beliefs.","Parr, Thomas",Entropy (Basel),263,8

A total of 984,311 geo-referenced tweets with negative basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame) were collected and assigned to the census tracts within NYC boroughs between 8 October and 18 November 2012. Global and local univariate and bivariate Moran’s I statistics were used to analyze the data. We found local spatial clusters of all negative emotions over all disaster periods. Socioeconomic status and infrastructural damage were predominantly correlated with disgust, fear, and shame post-disaster. We identified spatial clusters of emotional reactions during and in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster that could help provide guidance about where immediate and long-term relief measures are needed the most, if transferred to similar events and on comparable data worldwide.","Garske, Sonja I.; Elayan, Suzanne; Sykora, Martin; Edry, Tamar; Grabenhenrich, Linus B.; Galea, Sandro; Lowe, Sarah R.; Gruebner, Oliver",Int J Environ Res Public Health,263,1

Perioperative blood loss and rate of re-exploration are variable among centers and surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To present our experience of low rate of re-exploration based on adopting checklist for hemostasis and algorithm for management. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted for 565 adult patients who underwent surgical treatment of congenital and acquired heart disease and were complicated by postoperative bleeding from Feb 2006 to May 2019. Demographics of patients, operative characteristics, perioperative risk factors, blood loss, requirements of blood transfusion, morbidity and mortality were recorded. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of re-exploration and determinants of adverse outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (1.14%) were reexplored for bleeding. An identifiable source of bleeding was found in 11 (84.6%) patients. Risk factors for re-exploration were high body mass index, high Euro SCORE, operative priority (urgent/emergent), elevated serum creatinine and low platelets count. Re-exploration was significantly associated with increased requirements of blood transfusion, adverse effects on cardiorespiratory state (low ejection fraction, increased s. lactate, and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation), longer intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, increased incidence of SWI, and higher mortality (15.4% versus 2.53% for non-reexplored patients). We managed 285 patients with severe or massive bleeding conservatively by hemostatic agents according to our protocol with no added risk of morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: Low rate of re-exploration for bleeding can be achieved by strict preoperative preparation, intraoperative checklist for hemostasis implemented by senior surgeons and adopting an algorithm for management.","Elassal, Ahmed Abdelrahman; Al-Ebrahim, Khalid Ebrahim; Debis, Ragab Shehata; Ragab, Ehab Sobhy; Faden, Mazen Shamsaldeen; Fatani, Mazin Adel; Allam, Amr Ragab; Abdulla, Ahmed Hasan; Bukhary, Auhood Mohammednoor; Noaman, Nada Ahmed; Eldib, Osama Saber",J Cardiothorac Surg,263,1

Mean HBI improved from 8.13 at baseline to 4.64 at 6 months and 4.10 at last follow up (both P<0.0001). Treatment persistence rate was 61.4% (N=43) and 36 (51.4%) were steroid-free. Reasons for discontinuation were primary non-response (42%), adverse event (32%), secondary loss of response (10%), malignancy (10%) and lack of funding (5%). CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab was safe and effective in a cohort of elderly CD patients. Infections were mostly mild, not resulting in therapy discontinuation. The risk of serious infection was low at 0.107 per patient year of treatment.","Fiske, J; Liu, E; Limdi, J; Conley, T E; Townsend, T; Davies, M; Brockwell, R; Baig, D; Abdelbadiee, S; Uney, A; Liaros, A; Gaba, W; Smith, P J; Subramanian, S",J Crohns Colitis,263,1

Immune-mediated diseases (IMID), as inflammatory arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have some special implications due to their pathogenesis and treatments. Some treatments employed in IMID are now being used in the treatment of severe COVID-19. There still exists controversy about IMID behavior and its complications. Our aim was to assess COVID-19 severity in IMID patients and its prognosis predictors. METHODS: An observational retrospective multicenter study was performed in two Spanish Hospitals (University Clinical Hospital in Santiago de Compostela and Gregorio Marañón Hospital). Patients were selected if they were diagnosed of an IMID (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, espondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) and had COVID-19 infection between February and April 2020. Demographic, clinical, analytical and treatment data were collected. Stata 15.1 was used to perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: 91 patients were included. 55 suffered from a rheumatic disease and 36 suffered IBD. Univariable analysis reached age, comorbidity, female gender, flu vaccine, arthropathy, basal csDMARD, pneumonia and basal CRP as potential predictors of non-severe (absence of death, respiratory insufficiency, intensive care unit admission or sepsis) COVID-19 disease (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only female gender (OR 4.60 [CI95% 1.00, 21.2] p=0.050), lower age (OR 0.94 [CI95% 0.88, 1.00] p=0.042) and lower basal levels of CRP (OR 0.87 [CI95% 0.77, 0.97] p=0.010) were predictors for non-severe disease (p < 0.005). Mean time of healing (symptoms solved in outpatient and hospital discharge in admitted) from COVID-19 was 13.8 days (SD 16.3). Univariable analysis showed arthropathy, COVID-19 symptomatic and basal GC dose as potential predictors of higher time-to-healing from COVID-19 disease (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only lower GC basal dose predicts higher time-to-healing (OR -1.83 [CI95% -2.81, -0.84] p=0.001).11 patients deceased because of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Univariable analysis reached age, basal csDMARD, pneumonia and basal CRP as potential predictors of COVID-19 mortality (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only higher age was a predictor for mortality (OR 1.14 [CI95% 1.04,1.25] p=0.006). CONCLUSION: IMID patients showed similar predictors of mortality than general population involving COVID-19. Immune-modulating agents did not seem to overshadow the prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Female gender, lower age and lower basal CRP is associated with mild COVID-19 disease as well higher age points out the worst prognosis. Even that, each case should be individualized.","Calviño Suárez, C; Dos-Santos, R; Baston-Rey, I; Montero, F J; Ferreiro-Iglesias, R; Marin-Jimenez, I; Gonzalez, C M; Perez-Pampin, E; Barreiro-de Acosta, M",J Crohns Colitis,263,1

Patients are often suspicious of the infectious risks vis-à-vis immunosuppressants and in particular biotherapies. METHODS: Analysis of the treatment adherence and the level of anxiety of IBD patients treated by immunosuppressants during the first French COVID-19 lockdown. Monocentric prospective observational study. Teleconsultations were made by the same gastroenterologist not usually involved in patient care, using randomly an active file of 96 IBD patients monitored in a database (Focus MICI®). Treatments: Corticosteroids n = 0; Azathioprine n = 2; Adalimumab n = 9; Infliximab n= 44 (53%); Golimumab n = 1; Vedolizumab n = 11; Tofacitinib n = 0; Methotrexate n = 3; Ustekinumab n = 5; Combotherapy n = 20. RESULTS: Calls from 09/4 to 07/5 2020. 13/96 (13.5%) unreachable patients (answering machine, wrong number, no answer, working, etc.). No call was refused when patients were reached. Analysis on 83 patients. Average age: 41.7 years; M / F (55/41) [20-80]. Crohn / RCH: 72/24. Call duration: 5 to 22 minutes. Clinical remission estimated by the patient: Yes / No: 73/10 (88%). Clinical signs possibly linked to Covid: 9/86 (10.4%); discontinuation of treatment: 2/9 (22%). Finally, the treatment was stopped for 11/83 (13%) patients in this IBD population, most of them were in remission. Only 2/9 (22%) with potential Covid symptoms had stopped their treatment. On an anxiety scale from 1 to 10, 41% of patients were moderately to very worried. Among the main fears: increased risk of Covid-19 infection during treatment and fear of coming to the hospital during the epidemic (nosocomial risk). None of the patients spontaneously took the initiative to call first their referent gastroenterologist to discuss the situation. For the others (87%), continuation of treatment with an adherence estimated between 8 and 10 on a scale from 1 to 10. RESULTS OF THE CALL: the phone call was generally much appreciated by IBD patients. Most of the patients were reassured and convinced to continue their treatment and to contact their referent gastroenterologist. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the first Covid-19 lockdown was responsible for a high level of anxiety among patients (41%) and a negative effect on patient compliance (not necessarily potential Covid + patients). Advantages of teleconsultation: good acceptability, excellent effectiveness in terms of reassurance and treatment adherence. The cessation of the treatment was in most cases hidden to the doctor. We think that there is a subsequent interest in maintaining tele/visio consultations in addition to face-to-face consultations.","Paupard, T; Richez, C; Verlynde, J; Zaharia, O; Quartier, G; Hudziak, H; Delhoustal, L",J Crohns Colitis,263,24

Our model proposes differential moderating effects for both leader autocratic-democratic power orientation and leader agentic-communal orientation. Particularly, we contend that democratic and communal leadership orientations may lead to fewer perceptions of bullying in the workplace. We conclude with a discussion of our model’s practical implications and suggestions for future research on this subject.","Houghton, Jeffery D.; Oxarart, Richard A.; Heames, Joyce Thompson; Buckley, M.

Several changes on aircraft propulsion will occur in the next 30 years, following the aircraft market demand and environmental regulations. Two commercial areas are in evolution, electrical urban air mobility (UAM) and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. The first one is expected to come into service in the next 10 years with small devices. The last one will gradually come into service, starting with small aircraft according to developments in energy storage, fuel cells, aircraft design and hybrid architectures integration. All-electric architecture seems to be more adapted to UAM. Turbo-electric hybrid architecture combined with distributed propulsion and boundary layer ingestion seems to have more success for regional aircraft, attaining environmental goals for 2030 and 2050. Computational models supported by powerful simulation tools will be a key to support research and aircraft HEP design in the coming years.

Cancer cells engage various cells or mechanisms to resist anti-cancer therapeutics, which results in metastasis and the recurrence of disease. Considering the cellular heterogeneity of cancer stroma, the involvement of stem cells is reported to affect the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma. Hence, the duo (osteosarcoma: Saos 2 and human adipose-derived stem cells: ASCs) is co-cultured in present study to investigate the therapeutic response using a nonadherent, concave surface. Staining with a cell tracker allows real-time microscopic monitoring of the cell arrangement within the sphere. Cell–cell interaction is investigated by means of E-cadherin expression. Comparatively high expression of E-cadherin and compact organization is observed in heterotypic tumorspheres (Saos 2–ASCs) compared to homotypic ones (ASCs), limiting the infiltration of chemotherapeutic compound doxorubicin into the heterotypic tumorsphere, which in turn protects cells from the toxic effect of the chemotherapeutic. In addition, genes known to be associated with drug resistance, such as SOX2, OCT4, and CD44 are overexpressed in heterotypic tumorspheres post-chemotherapy, indicating that the duo collectively repels the effect of doxorubicin. The interaction between ASCs and Saos 2 in the present study points toward the growing oncological risk of using ASC-based regenerative therapy in cancer patients and warrants further investigation.","Kundu, Banani; Brancato, Virginia; Oliveira, Joaquim; Correlo, Vitor M.; Reis, Rui L.; Kundu, Subhas C.",Bioengineering (Basel),263,3

This could be implemented using the biosensor principle based on peptide aptamers for spatial recognition of corresponding protein markers of diseases in biological fluids. In this paper, a low-cost label-free principle of biomarker detection using a biosensor system based on fluorometric registration of the target proteins bound to peptide aptamers was investigated. The main detection principle considered includes the re-emission of the natural fluorescence of selectively bound protein markers into a longer-wavelength radiation easily detectable by common charge-coupled devices (CCD) using a specific luminophore. Implementation of this type of detection system demands the reduction of all types of stray light and background fluorescence of construction materials and aptamers. The latter was achieved by careful selection of materials and design of peptide aptamers with substituted aromatic amino acid residues and considering troponin T, troponin I, and bovine serum albumin as an example. The peptide aptamers for troponin T were designed in silico using the «Protein 3D» (SPB ETU, St. Petersburg, Russia) software. The luminophore was selected from the line of ZnS-based solid-state compounds. The test microfluidic system was arranged as a flow through a massive of four working chambers for immobilization of peptide aptamers, coupled with the optical detection system, based on thick film technology. The planar optical setup of the biosensor registration system was arranged as an excitation-emission cascade including 280 nm ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diode (LED), polypropylene (PP) UV transparent film, proteins layer, glass filter, luminophore layer, and CCD sensor.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which these additional burdens impacted student performance. We hypothesized that students in high‐risk categories would suffer larger decrements in academic performance compared to students in low‐risk categories. To address this hypothesis we collected midterm data from fall 2020 and compared it to midterm data from fall 2015‐2019. Midterms are assigned to students earning a C‐ or below midway through the semester. Letter grades were tallied for each term and then converted to a numerical score using a five‐point scale (C‐ = 1, F = 5) and summed across all midterm grades within a term to allow quantitation and statistical comparison. The number of midterms issued per student did not differ in 2020 compared to 2015‐2019 for most demographics. However, when we considered ethnicity we found that Caucasian students had slightly more midterms reported per student in 2020 when compared to the comparison group (p<0.008). Midterm grades were more severe in 2020 (by 0.101‐0.657 points) than in 2015‐2019 for females, males, first generation students (FGS), non‐FGS, and students directly admitted from high school (direct admits) (p<0.001). In addition, Caucasian (p<0.0001), Hispanic (p<0.017), and people of multiple races (p<0.032) had midterms of greater severity in 2020 compared to the comparison group. Interestingly, the number and severity of midterm grades issued to transfer students (TS) were similar between 2020 and the comparison group. When we considered the impact of COVID‐19‐related changes on midterms/student within paired groups in 2020 we discovered that FG students and minority students had more midterms/student than non‐FG (p<0.001) and Caucasian students (p<003), respectively, while males/females and TS/direct admits were similar between groups. Likewise, COVID‐19‐related changes increased the severity of the midterms for males, FG students, and minority students compared to females (p<0.002), non‐FG (p<0.0003), and Caucasian students (p<0.0004), respectively, but TS and direct admits were similar between groups. Collectively, these data indicate a disproportionately negative impact of COVID‐19 in some, but not all high‐risk populations. It is reasonable to suggest that these negative outcomes may jeopardize retention and graduation rates within these populations.","Selsby, Joshua; Bundy, Jennifer",FASEB J,263,1

When testing resources are scarce, an important managerial decision is who to test. This decision is compounded by the fact that potential testing subjects are heterogeneous in multiple dimensions that are important to consider, including their likelihood of being disease‐positive, and how much potential harm would be averted through testing and the subsequent interventions. To increase testing coverage, pooled testing can be utilized, but this comes at a cost of increased false‐negatives when the test is imperfect. Then, the decision problem is to partition the heterogeneous testing population into three mutually exclusive sets: those to be individually tested, those to be pool tested, and those not to be tested. Additionally, the subjects to be pool tested must be further partitioned into testing pools, potentially containing different numbers of subjects. The objectives include the minimization of harm (through detection and mitigation) or maximization of testing coverage. We develop data‐driven optimization models and algorithms to design pooled testing strategies, and show, via a COVID‐19 contact tracing case study, that the proposed testing strategies can substantially outperform the current practice used for COVID‐19 contact tracing (individually testing those contacts with symptoms). Our results demonstrate the substantial benefits of optimizing the testing design, while considering the multiple dimensions of population heterogeneity and the limited testing capacity.","El Hajj, Hussein; Bish, Douglas R.; Bish, Ebru K.; Aprahamian, Hrayer",,263,16

Species studied were Albizia coriaria, Cassine buchananii, Combretum molle, Erythrina abyssinica, Ficus saussureana, Harungana madagascariensis, Leucas calostachys, Microgramma lycopodioides, Morella kandtiana, Plectranthus hadiensis, Securidaca longipedunculata, Sesamum calycinum subsp. angustifolium, Solanum aculeastrum, Toddalia asiatica, Warburgia ugandensis, and Zanthoxylum chalybeum. In addition, the traditional healers indicated that P. hadiensis is used as a ritual plant to boost fertility and prepare young women and teenagers for motherhood in some Ugandan communities where a high incidence of rapidly growing large breast masses in young female patients was observed (not necessarily breast cancer). We present results from various in vitro experiments performed with 56 different plant extracts, namely, 1) an initial assessment of the 16 species regarding their traditional use in the treatment of malaria by identifying promising plant extract candidates using a heme biocrystallization inhibition library screen; 2) follow-up investigations of antiprotozoal effects of the most bioactive crude extracts against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum K1; 3) a cytotoxicity counterscreen against human MRC-5(SV2) lung fibroblasts; 4) a genotoxicity evaluation of the extract library without and with metabolic bioactivation with human S9 liver fraction; and 5) an assessment of the mutagenicity of the ritual plant P. hadiensis. A total of seven extracts from five plant species were selected for antiplasmodial follow-up investigations based on their hemozoin formation inhibition activity in the heme biocrystallization assay. Among other extracts, an ethyl acetate extract of L. calostachys leaves exhibited antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum K1 (IC(50) value: 5.7 µg/ml), which was further characterized with a selectivity index of 2.6 (CC(50) value: 14.7 µg/ml). The experiments for assessment of potential procarcinogenic properties of plant extracts via evaluation of in vitro mutagenicity and genotoxicity indicated that few extracts cause mutations. The species T. asiatica showed the most significant genotoxic effects on both bacterial test strains (without metabolic bioactivation at a concentration of 500 µg/plate). However, none of the mutagenic extracts from the experiments without metabolic bioactivation retained their genotoxic activity after metabolic bioactivation of the plant extract library through pre-incubation with human S9 liver fraction. While this study did not show that P. hadiensis has genotoxic properties, it did provide early stage support for the therapeutic use of the medicinal plants from the Greater Mpigi region.","Schultz, Fabien; Osuji, Ogechi Favour; Nguyen, Anh; Anywar, Godwin; Scheel, John R.; Caljon, Guy; Pieters, Luc; Garbe, Leif-Alexander",Front Pharmacol,263,11

We, therefore, analyzed the influence of age, amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP), and the clinically approved, bioavailable sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) on the expression of synaptic proteins. RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to real-time PCR. Expression of mutant (V717I) AβPP led to few changes at 3 months of age but reduced multiple mRNA coding for synaptic proteins in a 12-month-old mouse brain. Complexin 1 (Cplx1), SNAP25 (Snap25), syntaxin 1A (Stx1a), neurexin 1 (Nrxn1), neurofilament light (Nefl), and synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) in the hippocampus, and VAMP1 (Vamp1) and neurexin 1 (Nrxn1) in the cortex were all significantly reduced in 12-month-old mice. Post mortem AD samples from the human hippocampus and cortex displayed lower expression of VAMP, synapsin, neurofilament light (NF-L) and synaptophysin. The potentially neuroprotective FTY720 reversed most AβPP-induced changes in gene expression (Cplx1, Stx1a, Snap25, and Nrxn1) in the 12-month-old hippocampus, which is thought to be most sensitive to early neurotoxic insults, but it only restored Vamp1 in the cortex and had no influence in 3-month-old brains. Further study may reveal the potential usefulness of FTY720 in the modulation of deregulated neuronal phenotype in AD brains.","Jęśko, Henryk; Wieczorek, Iga; Wencel, Przemysław Leonard; Gąssowska-Dobrowolska, Magdalena; Lukiw, Walter J.; Strosznajder, Robert Piotr",Front Mol Neurosci,263,1

Even though encountering many challenges ahead, China is positioning itself to take over the global innovation leadership in the next few decades. Here in this article, we introduce a serious yet underexplored question: could China go beyond catch-up and become the global innovation powerhouse? Specifically, drawing from the holistic innovation perspective, which is an original theoretical paradigm for the mission-oriented innovation policy change, this article critically reviews, both qualitatively and quantitatively, China’s remarkable innovation progress and main drivers in comparison with G7 countries plus South Korea and India, trying to provide a comprehensive and critical view of state-of-the-art research on China’s innovation catch-up. We further explore the five major challenges that China must take seriously when marching toward the global innovation powerhouse. Finally, we propose a mission-oriented holistic STI policy design framework for both China and other emerging economies to go beyond catch-up in a competitive dynamic world. This article provides a new and holistic perspective to access China’s innovation progress and challenges, also generates novel insights for scholars and public agencies to contribute to global innovation development, with a shared goal of achieving global sustainable development in the post-COVID-19 pandemic world.","Chen, Jin; Yin, Ximing; Fu, Xiaolan; McKern, Bruce",,263,27

Knowledge about the lung injury effects of current clinical bacterial strains is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of representative pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients to cause ALI/ARDS in mice and identify the major virulence factor. METHODS: Seven major bacterial species were isolated from clinical sputum and unilaterally instilled into the mouse airway. A histology study was performed to determine the lung injury effect. Virulence genes were examined by PCR. Sequence types of P. aeruginosa strains were identified by MLST. LC-MS/MS was used to analysis the bacterial exoproducts proteome. LasB was purified through a DEAE-cellulose column, and its toxicity was tested both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were randomly separated and tested 3 times. Among them, gram-negative bacteria have much more potential to cause acute lung injury than gram-positive bacteria. However, P. aeruginosa is the only pathogen that induces diffuse alveolar damage, hemorrhage and hyaline membranes in the lungs of mice. The lung injury effect is associated with the excreted LasB elastase. Purified LasB recapitulated lung injury similar to P. aeruginosa infection in vivo. We found that this was due to the powerful degradation effect of LasB on the extracellular matrix of the lung and key proteins in the coagulation cascade without inducing obvious cellular apoptosis. We also report for the first time that LasB could induce DIC-like coagulopathy in vitro. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa strains are most capable of inducing ALI/ARDS in mice among major clinical pathogenic bacteria tested, and this ability is specifically attributed to their LasB production.","Zhu, Yajie; Ge, Xiaoli; Xie, Di; Wang, Shangyuan; Chen, Feng; Pan, Shuming",J Inflamm Res,263,1

OBJECTIVE: In this study, sensorimotor and executive function performance was examined in a group of children (n = 40; 8–12 years), adolescents (n = 39; 13–17 years), and young adults (n = 83; 18–24 years) to investigate maturation of these functions, and how the relationships between these functions differ between groups. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents outperformed children on all sensorimotor and executive functions. Adults and adolescents exhibited similar levels of executive functioning, but adults outperformed adolescents on two sensorimotor functioning measures (eye-hand coordination spatial precision and proprioceptive variability). Regression analysis demonstrated that executive functions contribute to children’s sensorimotor performance, but do not contribute to adolescent’s sensorimotor performance. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the key role that developmental stage plays in the relationship between sensorimotor and executive functions. Specifically, executive functions appear to contribute to more successful sensorimotor function performance in childhood, but not during adolescence. It is likely that sensorimotor functions begin to develop independently from executive functions during adolescence, and therefore do not contribute to successful sensorimotor performance. The change in the relationship between sensorimotor and executive functions is important to take into consideration when developing sensorimotor and executive function interventions.","Gordon-Murer, Chloe; Stöckel, Tino; Sera, Michael; Hughes, Charmayne M.

We apply ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression to explain the achievement rate of monthly sales. The results of the OLS estimation suggest that formal support has negative effects on the achievement rate, whereas informal support has positive effects. From the results of the quantile regression analysis, the estimated coefficients by quantiles indicate that high-performing enterprises are not affected significantly by formal and informal supports in positive or negative directions, whereas low-performing enterprises are affected strongly in positive or negative directions. These results imply that encouraging the start-ups through formal/informal supports has negative/positive effects on achieving their expected performance. Although it is difficult to predict whether entrepreneurs will perform well before they start an enterprise, informal support has little effect on high-performing enterprises.","Sakai, Tomohiro; Fukushige, Mototsugu",SN Bus Econ,263,4

Challenges were identified related to the changes from face-to-face to web-based meetings, including internet connectivity, inadequate technology and distractions in the online environment, which led to questions about how meetings that use web-based platforms may contribute to overall stress and well-being during the pandemic. The research related to the use of web-based meeting platforms is limited. However, some anecdotal evidence suggests that impacts from web-based meeting platforms could include frustration, sleep issues and fatigue, which contribute to overall well-being. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between a number of potentially related web-based meeting factors including the frequency and length of the meetings and comfort level with the platform and overall well-being. This study involved (N = 164) male, female and nonbinary participants over 18 years of age who worked as tenured, tenure-track, or nontenure track faculty, staff and administrators at colleges/universities in the United States during the global pandemic. The participants were recruited via both social media and email and were provided with a link to the survey tool, which included demographic and web-based meeting questions (e.g., frequency, length, and comfort) along with scales to measure perceived stress, subjective well-being, mental fatigue and sleep quality. The current study did not find a relationship between the frequency of meetings and overall well-being (p = 0.294). However, statistically significant relationships were found between meeting length and overall well-being (p = 0.003) and between comfort with the web-based meeting platform and overall well-being (p = 0.030).

Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis is crucial for decreasing its transmission. Various diagnostic techniques like microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and PCR-based methods are used to detect leishmaniasis infection. More recently, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has emerged as an ideal diagnostic measure for leishmaniasis, primarily due to its accuracy, speed and simplicity. However, point-of-care diagnosis is still not been tested with the LAMP assay. We have developed a portable LAMP device for the monitoring of Leishmania infection. The LAMP assay performed using our device can detect and amplify as little as 100 femtograms of L. donovani DNA. In a preliminary study, we have shown that the device can also amplify L. donovani DNA present in VL and PKDL patient samples with high sensitivity (100%), specificity (98%) and accuracy (99%), and can be used both for diagnostic and prognostic analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the development and application of a portable LAMP device which has the potential to evolve as a point-of-care diagnostic and prognostic tool for Leishmania infections in future.

Thus, improving the quality of life of older people is a priority. Centenarians reach extreme longevity in a relatively good health status, escaping or delaying fatal or strongly invalidating diseases. Therefore, studying processes involved in longevity is important to explain the biological mechanisms of health and well-being, since knowledge born from this approach can provide valuable information on how to slow aging. We performed the present study in a well characterized very homogeneous sample of 173 people from Western Sicily, to update existing literature on some phenotypic aspects of aging and longevity and to propose a range of values for older people. We classified 5 age groups, from young adults to centenarians, to understand the age and gender-related variations of the different parameters under study. We collected anamnestic data and performed anthropometric, bioimpedance, molecular, haematological, oxidative, and hematochemical tests, adopting a multidimensional analysis approach. An important evidence of the present study is that there are differences related to both age and gender in several biomarkers. Indeed, gender differences seem to be still poorly considered and inadequately investigated in aging as well as in other medical studies. Moreover, we often observed comparable parameters between young and centenarians rather than non-agenarians and centenarians, hypothesizing a sort of slowdown, almost followed by a reversal trend, in the decay of systemic deterioration. The study of centenarians provides important indications on how to slow aging, with benefits for those who are more vulnerable to disease and disability. The identification of the factors that predispose to a long and healthy life is of enormous interest for translational medicine in an aging world.","Aiello, Anna; Accardi, Giulia; Aprile, Stefano; Caldarella, Rosalia; Carru, Ciriaco; Ciaccio, Marcello; De Vivo, Immaculata; Gambino, Caterina Maria; Ligotti, Mattia Emanuela; Vasto, Sonya; Zinellu, Angelo; Caruso, Calogero; Bono, Filippa; Candore, Giuseppina",Aging Dis,263,29

Remote, technology-based tools have shown recent promise in assessing changes in older adults’ daily activities and mood, which may serve as indicators of underlying health-related changes (e.g., cognitive decline). This study examined changes in older adults’ driving, computer use, mood, and travel events prior to and following the COVID-19 emergency declaration using unobtrusive monitoring technologies and remote online surveys. As an exploratory aim, the impact of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on these changes was assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 59 older adults (41 Cognitively Intact, 18 MCI) enrolled in a longitudinal aging study. Participants had their driving and computer use behaviors recorded over a five-month period (75 days pre- and 76 days post-COVID emergency declaration) using unobtrusive technologies. Measures of mood, overnight guests, and frequency of overnight travel were also collected weekly via remote online survey. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and education, participants showed a significant decrease in daily driving distance, number of driving trips, highway driving, and nighttime driving, post-COVID-19 as compared to pre-COVID-19 (p <0.001) based on generalized estimating equation models. Further, participants spent more time on the computer per day post-COVID-19 (p = 0.03).

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: From pre- to post-COVID-19 emergency declaration, participants drove and traveled less, used their computer more, had fewer overnight visitors and reported greater psychological distress. These results highlight the behavioral and psychological effects of stay-at-home orders on older adults who are cognitively intact and those with MCI.","Leese, Mira I; Bernstein, John P K; Dorociak, Katherine E; Mattek, Nora; Wu, Chao-Yi; Beattie, Zachary; Dodge, Hiroko H; Kaye, Jeffrey; Hughes, Adriana M",Innov Aging,263,1

On this occasion, a scientific study of five paintings from the artist’s time in Paris (1948–1953) revealed her pioneering use of solvent-based acrylic paints in post-war Europe. This article presents a second phase of research into Herrera’s work aiming to shed light on her studio practice and ascertain the possible presence of other early acrylic paints in her pre-1963 artistic production. A selection of four paintings, namely Iberia #25 (1948), Iberic (1949), Flights of Colors #16 (1949), and Early Dynasty (1953), was subjected to an analytical campaign that relied on both non-invasive and micro-invasive techniques. Results confirmed the use of both oil and solvent-based acrylic paints, supporting our primary research and uncovering the first-known occurrence of acrylic binders in Herrera’s Iberia #25. In all cases, the ground layer consists of a mixture of titanium white in its tetragonal form of rutile, anhydrite, and talc, while the color palette was found to be based on both traditional and modern pigments. In most areas, several paint layers appeared to be overlaid on top of one another, revealing a creative process that developed through subsequent compositions. Remnants of earlier paint layers, which appeared to have been scraped off before new ones were applied, were observed directly above the ground in some of the samples examined. In addition, Iberia #25 and Iberic, with analogous geometric and chromatic schemes, underwent technical imaging, which exposed pencil lines and notes underneath the paint layers likely indicative of the intended design and polychromy. Besides corroborating a major alteration in the current scholarship on the availability and use of acrylic-based artists’ paints in post-war Europe, this research provides new insights into Herrera’s materials, techniques, and studio practice. In addition, the results of this scientific study assisted the development of a suitable treatment plan for Iberic in preparation for its display in The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s galleries as part of the museum’s 150th anniversary exhibition Making The Met, 1870–2020.

Membrane reshaping is accomplished by the expression of specific membrane-associated viral proteins that interact with host proteins involved in membrane trafficking processes. Plant virus-induced membranous structures are motile, and this intracellular motility is required for the transport of viral RNA from sites of synthesis to plasmodesmata, which are used to move viral RNA from cell to cell. Cellular movement of these virus-induced bodies requires myosin motor activity and is dependent on the secretory pathway.

Therapies that intervene early in the disease continuum are a priority for the many candidates in the drug development pipeline. There is a paucity of sensitive and objective, yet clinically interpretable, measures that can capture meaningful aspects of the disease. This poses a major challenge for the development of new therapies and is compounded by the considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations across patients and the fluctuating nature of many signs and symptoms of PD. Digital health technologies (DHT), such as smartphone applications, wearable sensors, and digital diaries, have the potential to address many of these gaps by enabling the objective, remote, and frequent measurement of PD signs and symptoms in natural living environments. The current climate of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened sense of urgency for effective implementation of such strategies. In order for these technologies to be adopted in drug development studies, a regulatory-aligned consensus on best practices in implementing appropriate technologies, including the collection, processing, and interpretation of digital sensor data, is required. A growing number of collaborative initiatives are being launched to identify effective ways to advance the use of DHT in PD clinical trials. The Critical Path for Parkinson's Consortium of the Critical Path Institute is highlighted as a case example where stakeholders collectively engaged regulatory agencies on the effective use of DHT in PD clinical trials. Global regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, are encouraging the efficiencies of data-driven engagements through multistakeholder consortia. To this end, we review how the advancement of DHT can be most effectively achieved by aligning knowledge, expertise, and data sharing in ways that maximize efficiencies.","Stephenson, Diane; Alexander, Robert; Aggarwal, Varun; Badawy, Reham; Bain, Lisa; Bhatnagar, Roopal; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Boroojerdi, Babak; Burton, Jackson; Cedarbaum, Jesse M; Cosman, Josh; Dexter, David T; Dockendorf, Marissa; Dorsey, E Ray; Dowling, Ariel V; Evers, Luc J W; Fisher, Katherine; Frasier, Mark; Garcia-Gancedo, Luis; Goldsack, Jennifer C; Hill, Derek; Hitchcock, Janice; Hu, Michele T; Lawton, Michael P; Lee, Susan J; Lindemann, Michael; Marek, Ken; Mehrotra, Nitin; Meinders, Marjan J; Minchik, Michael; Oliva, Lauren; Romero, Klaus; Roussos, George; Rubens, Robert; Sadar, Sakshi; Scheeren, Joseph; Sengoku, Eiichi; Simuni, Tanya; Stebbins, Glenn; Taylor, Kirsten I; Yang, Beatrice; Zach, Neta",Digital biomarkers,263,1

The main complication of HA is the development of neutralizing alloantibodies which inhibit FVIII activity (inhibitors). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the first FVIII infusions on immunological biomarkers in previously untreated patients with HA. Plasma samples were collected at enrollment before any FVIII infusion (T0) and at inhibitor development (INB +/T1) or up to 35 exposure days without inhibitors (INB -/T1). Anti-FVIII antibodies (immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G [IgG] 1, IgG3, and IgG4), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10), and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-17) were assessed. A total of 71 children with severe HA were included, of whom 28 (39.4%) developed inhibitors. Plasma levels of anti-FVIII IgG4, IL-6, and CXCL8 were higher at INB +/T1 when compared with INB -/T1. This group presented a mixed cytokine profile and higher plasma levels of CXCL9 and CXL10 when compared with INB +/T1. We conclude that exposure to FVIII triggers a proinflammatory response mediated by IL-6 and CXCL8 in patients with HA who developed inhibitors. Regardless of inhibitor status, the immune system of all HA patients is stimulated after infusions of FVIII.","de Oliveira, Larissa Maira Moura; Jardim, Letícia Lemos; Santana, Marcio Antônio Portugal; Cerqueira, Mônica Hermida; Lorenzato, Claudia Santos; Franco, Vivian Karla Brognoli; Zuccherato, Luciana Werneck; Rezende, Suely Meireles; Chaves, Daniel Gonçalves",Thrombosis and haemostasis,263,26

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of single-stage endovascular treatment of multiple aneurysms with a combination of various endovascular techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three consecutive patients with multiple intracranial aneurysms who underwent single-stage endovascular treatment for ≥2 aneurysms from June 2011 to May 2016 were included in the study. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, complications, clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS 125 of 128 aneurysms (97.6%) were treated by the following endovascular techniques: simple coiling in 19, balloon-assisted coiling in 27, stent-assisted coiling in 33, flow diverters in 43, intrasaccular flow modifiers in 2, and a neck-bridging device in 1. Overall mortality and mortality directly related to the single-stage treatment was 15% (8/53) and 3.7% (2/53), respectively. Clinical and angiographic follow-up was available in 44 (83%) patients for 104 (83.2%) aneurysms for a mean duration of 16.2 months (range 3-51 months). According to the last angiographic follow-up, overall occlusion rates were complete in 85 (81.7%), near complete in 8 (7.6%), and incomplete in 11 (10.5%) aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Single-stage endovascular treatment of multiple aneurysms with combined endovascular techniques is technically feasible and increases the treatment possibility of all detected aneurysms. However, the safety of the procedure is controversial due to relatively high complication rates. In particular, in patients with bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms, staged therapy may be used instead of simultaneous treatment with flow diverters to avoid thromboembolic events.","Andic, Cagatay; Aydemir, Fatih; Kardes, Ozgur; Gedikoglu, Murat; Akin, Sule",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,263,1

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. De-identified case logs, divided by institution and post graduate year (PGY) level, were obtained from the general surgery training programs at three academic hospitals. Total cases logged were calculated over the pandemic period (start: beginning of residency, end: May 31st, 2020) and the control period (start: beginning of residency, end: May 31st, 2019). SETTING Three academic tertiary hospitals (Mayo Clinic - Arizona, Mayo Clinic - Florida, and Mayo Clinic - Rochester) PARTICIPANTS: All general surgery residents at these three hospitals, including 25 residents at Mayo Clinic - Arizona in both the pandemic and control period, 16 and 15 residents at Mayo Clinic - Florida in the control and pandemic period, respectively, and 81 and 77 residents at Mayo Clinic - Rochester in the control and pandemic period, respectively. RESULTS Only PGY 4 general surgery residents at Mayo Clinic - Rochester had a decrease in operative cases logged in the pandemic period (759 cases on average compared to 1010 cases, p = 0.005), with no other changes in operative cases logged noted.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed including all consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic resection for ileocecal Crohn's disease from November 2006 to November 2015. Patients were divided according to body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 in order to study influence of obesity in the short-term outcomes. The following variables were studied: characteristics of patients, surgical technique and postoperative results (complications, reintervention, readmission and mortality) during first 30 postoperative days. RESULTS A total of 100 patients were included (42 males) with a mean age of 39.7±15.2 years (range 18-83). The overall complication rate was 20% and only 3 patients had an anastomotic leak. Seven patients needed reoperation in the first 30 days postop (7%). The median postoperative length of hospitalization was 5.0 days. Operative time was significantly longer in patients with obesity (130 vs. 165minutes, P=.007) but there were no significant differences among the postoperative results in patients with and without obesity. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that laparoscopic approach for ileocecal Cohn's disease is a safety and feasible technique in patients with obesity. In this last group of patients we only have to expect a longer operative time.","Parés, David; Shamali, Awad; Flashman, Karen; O'Leary, Daniel; Senapati, Asha; Conti, John; Parvaiz, Amjad; Khan, Jim",Cirugia espanola,263,1

This is based on extensive evidence demonstrating the safety and benefits of prenatal exercise. However, certain medical conditions or contraindications warrant a reduction, modification or cessation of activity due to potential health risks. AIM To review and evaluate the evidence related to medical disorders which may warrant contraindication to prenatal exercise. METHODS Online databases were searched up to 5 April 2019. Forty-four unique studies that reported data on our Population (pregnant women with contraindication to exercise), Intervention (subjective/objective measures of acute or chronic exercise), Comparator (not essential) and Outcomes (adverse maternal or fetal outcomes) were included in the review. KEY FINDINGS We found that the majority of medical conditions listed as contraindications were based on expert opinion; there is minimal empirical evidence to demonstrate harm of exercise and benefit of activity restriction. We identified 11 complications (eg, gestational hypertension, twin pregnancy) previously classified as contraindications where women may in fact benefit from regular prenatal physical activity with or without modifications. However, the evidence suggests that severe cardiorespiratory disease, placental abruption, vasa previa, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, active preterm labour, severe pre-eclampsia and cervical insufficiency are associated with strong potential for maternal/fetal harm and warrant classification as absolute contraindications. CONCLUSION Based on empirical evidence, we provide a call to re-evaluate clinical guidelines related to medical disorders that have previously been considered contraindications to prenatal exercise. Removing barriers to physical activity during pregnancy for women with certain medical conditions may in fact be beneficial for maternal-fetal health outcomes.","Meah, Victoria L; Davies, Gregory A; Davenport, Margie H",British journal of sports medicine,263,1

Recently we could demonstrate that ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is able to identify Influenza-A infections in patients' breath. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we proceeded further and analysed patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, nasal breath of 75 patients (34m, 41f, aged 64.4 ± 15.4 years) was investgated by MCC-IMS for viral infections. 14 were positively diagnosed for Influenza-A infection and 16 for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but initially inconclusive. The remaining 44 patients served as controls. Breath fingerprints for specific infections were assessed by a combination of cluster analysis and multivariate statistics. There was no significant difference in gender or age according to the groups. In the cross validation of the discriminant analysis 72 of the 74 patients could be correctly classified to the respective group. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination functions. Conclusion: MCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath in this pilot study.

We recently constructed a simple 55-gene classifier (55GC) system to risk stratify colon cancer (CC). OBJECTIVE Here, we validate the 55GC specifically for stage II CC and compare it with CMS categories. METHODS Tissue sections from 232 stage II CC patients who underwent curative surgery without adjuvant chemotherapy between 2009 and 2012 were subjected to DNA microarray analysis. RESULTS Based on the 55GC, patients were classified into microsatellite instability-like (27%), chromosomal instability-like (41%), and stromal (32%) subtypes with 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of 88.5, 83.3, and 71.2%, respectively (stromal vs. others: p = 0.0049). Multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model revealed that the stromal subtype, pT4, and the number of lymph nodes examined (<12) were independent poor prognostic factors. The overall concordance rate between 55GC and CMS was 72%, and 5-year RFS rates of patients with CMS1, CMS2, CMS3, and CMS4 cancers were 100, 85.5, 92.3, and 73.0%, respectively (p = 0.0113).

Highly conserved VP1 proteins from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40), which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1. Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1 binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, and evolution.","Magaldi, Thomas G; Buch, Michael H C; Murata, Haruhiko; Erickson, Kimberly D; Neu, Ursula; Garcea, Robert L; Peden, Keith; Stehle, Thilo; DiMaio, Daniel",Journal of virology,263,1

Pulse pressure waves are typically very small or even absent at the onset of ECMO therapy, and will reappear with the improvement of cardiac function. A low pulse pressure may indicate low cardiac output due to heart failure during sustained ECMO support. A sudden loss of pulse pressure during ECMO therapy, however, may reveal complications like pericardial tamponade, hemothorax or pneumothorax. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to be useful in detecting cerebral and lower limb ischemic events during ECMO therapy and could furthermore improve differential diagnosis in the event pulsatility of the arterial pressure trace is lost. METHODS We are reporting on 3 different complications of ECMO and their impact on arterial pulse pressure, arterial oxygen tension and regional tissue oxygenation measured by NIRS. RESULTS Pericardial hematoma, overinflation of the lung, and tension pneumothorax may impede cardiac output during VA-ECMO and cause a loss of pulse pressure. Monitoring of regional tissue oxygenation using NIRS, in addition to arterial and mixed venous oxygen tension, may allow early recognition and treatment of ECMO complications. CONCLUSIONS Together with the appearance of a flat, non pulsatile arterial pressure trace as well as a reduction in mixed venous oxygen saturation the improvement of upper body rSO2 measured by NIRS enables timely recognition of complications that interfere with natural cardiac output during VA-ECMO.","Hofer, Anna; Leitner, Sylvia; Kreuzer, Michaela; Meier, Jens",The International journal of artificial organs,263,28

Though classically associated to pathology, reports on novel functional roles of these proteins have increasingly emerged in the past decade. Moreover, the recent discovery that amyloids formed with rationally designed small peptides can exhibit catalytic reactivity has opened up new opportunities in both biology and biotechnology. The observed activities typically require the binding of divalent metals, giving rise to active metal-amyloid complexes. METHODS Peptide (SDIDVFI) was aggregated in vitro. The structure of the self-assembled species was analyzed using fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism and computational modeling. A kinetic characterization of the emerging catalytic activity was performed. RESULTS The peptide self-assembled into canonical amyloids that exhibited catalytic activity towards hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), partially mimicking an ATPase-like enzyme. Both amyloid formation and activity are shown to depend on manganese (Mn2+) binding. The activity was not restricted to ATP but also affected all other ribonucleotides (GTP, CTP and UTP). Peptides carrying a single aspartate exhibited a similar activity. CONCLUSIONS The phosphoanhydride bonds appear as the main specificity target of the Mn2+-amyloid complex. A single aspartate per peptide is sufficient to enable the hydrolytic activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE Catalytic amyloids are shown for the first time to catalyze the hydrolysis of all four ribonucleotides. Our results should contribute towards understanding the biological implications of amyloid-mediated reactivity as well as in the design of future catalytic amyloids for biotechnological applications.","Castillo-Caceres, Claudio; Duran-Meza, Eva; Nova, Esteban; Araya-Secchi, Raul; Monasterio, Octavio; Diaz-Espinoza, Rodrigo",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The shortage of diagnostic tests limited monitoring of the first wave of the pandemic. This study estimates and describes the wave in Navarre (Spain). METHODS Enhanced epidemiological surveillance, seroepidemiological survey estimates and mortality registries were used to characterise the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from February to June 2020 in Navarre. RESULTS A total of 10,358 persons (1.6?% of population) were confirmed with COVID-19, 1,943 cases were hospitalized (3 per 1,000 inhabitants), 139 were admitted to the ICU (21 per 100,000 inhabitants), and 529 people died from confirmed COVID-19 (80 per 100,000). Mortality increased exponentially with age, exceeding 1?% in people over 85 years. 58?% of deaths occurred amongst nursing home residents. The mortality registry received reporting of 733 confirmed or probable COVID-19 deaths, while the excess deaths during this period were 613 (20.9?%) concentrated from mid-March to the end of April. It is estimated that, at the end of June, 6.7?% (n?=?44,000) of the population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 10.3?% had had the infection. The estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence increased sharply in the first half of March and decreased quickly during the home lockdown in the second half of March. CONCLUSIONS The first wave of the pandemic produced a high number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Navarre in a few weeks. The pronounced decrease of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the home lockdown suggests considerable efficacy and impact of this measure for transmission control.","Castilla, J; Moreno-Iribas, C; Ibero Esparza, C; Martínez-Baz, I; Trobajo-Sanmartín, C; Ezpeleta, C; Guevara, M; En Navarra, Grupo Para El Estudio de Covid-",Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra,263,1

Their combination might result in additive effects. Using MRI and SPECT/CT, we studied tumour characteristics and therapeutic responses after different (combined) administration schemes in a murine tumour model in order to identify the optimal treatment schedule for PRRT plus TMZ. METHODS We performed molecular imaging studies in mice bearing SSTR-expressing H69 (humane small cell lung cancer) tumours after single intravenous (i.v.) administration of 30 MBq (177)Lu-TATE or TMZ (oral 50 mg/kg daily for 14 days). Tumour perfusion was evaluated weekly by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), whereas tumour uptake of (111)In-octreotide was quantified using SPECT/CT until day 39 after treatment. Based on these results, seven different (177)Lu-octreotate and TMZ combination schemes were evaluated for therapy response, varying the order and time interval of the two therapies and compared with single treatments. RESULTS PRRT and TMZ both resulted in tumour size reduction, accompanied by significant changes in MRI characteristics such as an enhanced tumour perfusion. Moreover, TMZ treatment also resulted in increased uptake of the SST analogue (111)In-octreotide until day 13. In the subsequent therapy study, 90 % of animals receiving (177)Lu-TATE at day 14 after TMZ treatment showed complete response, being the best anti-tumour results among groups. CONCLUSIONS Molecular imaging studies indicated that PRRT after TMZ treatment could induce optimal therapeutic effects because of enhanced tumour uptake of radioactivity after TMZ, which was confirmed by therapy responses. Therefore, clinical translation of TMZ treatment prior to PRRT might increase tumour responses in NET patients as well.","Bison, Sander M; Haeck, Joost C; Bol, K; Koelewijn, S J; Groen, H C; Melis, M; Veenland, J F; Bernsen, M R; de Jong, M",EJNMMI research,263,16

In addition, in order to better understand the experiences of poverty, open questions regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the participants' lives and their means of coping with the pandemic were employed. The study was conducted in May 2020, just after the first lockdown, through online media and through social workers who personally went to disadvantaged neighborhoods to reach out to participants who are vulnerable to digital illiteracy. The analysis points to major differences between the groups, with people in poverty suffering more in terms of their economic and employment situation and mental distress. In addition, we found that people in poverty needed and received more support.

We isolated a set of H5N1 NA-specific single-domain antibodies (N1-VHHm) and evaluated their in vitro and in vivo antiviral potential. Two of them inhibited the NA activity and in vitro replication of clade 1 and 2 H5N1 viruses. We then generated bivalent derivatives of N1-VHHm by two methods. First, we made N1-VHHb by genetically joining two N1-VHHm moieties with a flexible linker. Second, bivalent N1-VHH-Fc proteins were obtained by genetic fusion of the N1-VHHm moiety with the crystallizable region of mouse IgG2a (Fc). The in vitro antiviral potency against H5N1 of both bivalent N1-VHHb formats was 30- to 240-fold higher than that of their monovalent counterparts, with 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Moreover, single-dose prophylactic treatment with bivalent N1-VHHb or N1-VHH-Fc protected BALB/c mice against a lethal challenge with H5N1 virus, including an oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 variant. Surprisingly, an N1-VHH-Fc fusion without in vitro NA-inhibitory or antiviral activity also protected mice against an H5N1 challenge. Virus escape selection experiments indicated that one amino acid residue close to the catalytic site is required for N1-VHHm binding. We conclude that single-domain antibodies directed against influenza virus NA protect against H5N1 virus infection, and when engineered with a conventional Fc domain, they can do so in the absence of detectable NA-inhibitory activity. IMPORTANCE Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses are a zoonotic threat. Outbreaks of avian influenza caused by these viruses occur in many parts of the world and are associated with tremendous economic loss, and these viruses can cause very severe disease in humans. In such cases, small-molecule inhibitors of the viral NA are among the few treatment options for patients. However, treatment with such drugs often results in the emergence of resistant viruses. Here we show that single-domain antibody fragments that are specific for NA can bind and inhibit H5N1 viruses in vitro and can protect laboratory mice against a challenge with an H5N1 virus, including an oseltamivir-resistant virus. In addition, plant-produced VHH fused to a conventional Fc domain can protect in vivo even in the absence of NA-inhibitory activity. Thus, NA of influenza virus can be effectively targeted by single-domain antibody fragments, which are amenable to further engineering.","Cardoso, Francisco Miguel; Ibañez, Lorena Itatí; Van den Hoecke, Silvie; De Baets, Sarah; Smet, Anouk; Roose, Kenny; Schepens, Bert; Descamps, Francis J; Fiers, Walter; Muyldermans, Serge; Depicker, Ann; Saelens, Xavier",Journal of virology,263,27

OBJECTIVE The current study aims to test whether the blood flow within the contused spinal cord can be assessed in a rodent model via the acoustic window of the laminectomy utilizing transcutaneous ultrasound. SETTING Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle WA. METHODS Long-Evans rats (n = 12) were subjected to a traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Three days and 10 weeks after injury, animals underwent imaging of the contused spinal cord using ultrafast contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a Vantage ultrasound research system in combination with a 15 MHz transducer. Lesion size and signal-to-noise ratios were estimated via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, or epidural ultrasound acquisition through the acoustic window created by the original laminectomy. RESULTS Following laminectomy, transcutaneous and subcutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging allowed for assessment of perfusion and vascular flow in the contused rodent spinal cord. An average loss of 7.2 dB from transcutaneous to subcutaneous and the loss of 5.1 dB from subcutaneous to epidural imaging in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was observed. The hypoperfused injury center was measured transcutaneously, subcutaneously and epidurally (5.78 ± 0.86, 5.91 ± 0.53, 5.65 ± 1.07 mm2) at 3 days post injury. The same animals were reimaged again at 10 weeks following SCI, and the area of hypoperfusion had decreased significantly compared with the 3-day measurements detected via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, and epidural imaging respectively (0.69 ± 0.05, 1.09 ± 0.11, 0.95 ± 0.11 mm2, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Transcutaneous ultrasound allows for measurements and longitudinal monitoring of local hemodynamic changes in a rodent SCI model.","Khaing, Zin Z; Cates, Lindsay N; Hyde, Jeffrey E; Hammond, Ryan; Bruce, Matthew; Hofstetter, Christoph P",Spinal cord,263,16

Midwives' influence in advising expectant parents on early-childhood vaccinations is unquestioned, yet they remain an understudied group. The literature on midwives' attitudes towards vaccinations is also inconclusive. We therefore conducted an explorative qualitative study on midwives' vaccine-hesitant attitudes towards MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations in Austria. METHODS We conducted 12 in-depth interviews on their knowledge, concerns, and beliefs with midwives who self-identified as hesitant or resistant towards early-childhood MMR vaccinations. We analyzed the data using a grounded theory approach to distill common themes and meanings. RESULTS Healthcare workers' stewardship to address vaccine hesitancy is commonly framed in terms of the ""information deficit model"": disseminate the right information and remedy publics' information deficits. Our findings suggest that this approach is too simplistic: Midwives' professional self-understanding, their notions of ""good care"" and ""good parenthood"" inflect how they engage with vaccine information and how they address it to their clients. Midwives' model of care prioritized good counseling rather than sharing scientific information in a ""right the wrong""-manner. They saw themselves as critical consumers of that information and as promoting ""empowered patients"" who were free, and affluent enough, to make their own choices about vaccinations. In so doing, they also often promoted traditional notions of motherhood. CONCLUSIONS Research shows that, for parents, vaccine decision-making builds on trust and dialogue with healthcare professionals and is more than a technical issue. In order to foster these interactions, understanding healthcare professionals' means of engaging with information is key to understanding how they engage with their constituents. Healthcare workers are more than neutral resources; their daily praxis influenced by their professional standing in the healthcare system. Similarly, healthcare professionals' views on vaccinations cannot be remedied with more information either. Building better and more diverse curricula for different groups of healthcare workers must attend to their respective roles, ethics of care, and professional beliefs. Taken together, better models for addressing vaccine hesitancy can only be developed by espousing a multi-faceted view of decision-making processes and interactions of healthcare workers with constituents.","Lehner, Lisa; Gribi, Janna; Hoffmann, Kathryn; Paul, Katharina T; Kutalek, Ruth",BMC public health,263,24

ASBT inhibition has been shown to improve aspects of the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here we investigated the effect of ASBT inhibition on the uptake of specific fatty acids and its consequences for diet-induced obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS Intestinal fat absorption was determined in mice receiving an ASBT inhibitor and in Asbt-/- mice. Metabolic disease development was determined in Asbt-/- mice receiving a low fat control diet or high fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or PUFAs. RESULTS Both ASBT inhibition and Asbt gene inactivation reduced total fat absorption, particularly of SFAs. Asbt gene inactivation lowered bodyweight gain, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased the NAFLD activity score upon feeding a HFD rich in SFAs but not in PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS The beneficial metabolic effects of ASBT inactivation on diet-induced obesity depend on decreased intestinal absorption of SFAs, and thus on the dietary fatty acid composition. These findings highlight the importance of dietary fatty acid composition in the therapeutic effects of ASBT inhibition. This article is protected by copyright.

Consequently, amygdala lesions cause a heterogeneous array of social and non-social deficits. Social behaviours are not localized to subdivisions of the amygdala even though the inputs and outputs that carry social signals are anatomically restricted to distinct subnuclear regions. This observation may be explained by the multidimensional response properties of the component neurons. Indeed, the multitudes of circuits that converge in the amygdala enlist the same subset of neurons into different ensembles that combine social and non-social elements into high-dimensional representations. These representations may enable flexible, context-dependent social decisions. As such, multidimensional processing may operate in parallel with subcircuits of genetically identical neurons that serve specialized and functionally dissociable functions. When combined, the activity of specialized circuits may grant specificity to social behaviours, whereas multidimensional processing facilitates the flexibility and nuance needed for complex social behaviour.","Gothard, Katalin M",Nature reviews.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study in a cohort of 326 women who underwent POP repair and had a standardized preoperative POP assessment using the Baden-Walker classification. The distribution of POP grade was described for each vaginal compartment. The association between the involvement of each specific compartment and predictors was evaluated with a logistic regression model. RESULTS The frequency of significant POP (grade ≥ 2) was 79% in the anterior compartment, 49% in the middle/apical compartment and 31% in the posterior compartment. Combined significant anterior and apical defects were present in 25% of women. Increasing age was a significant risk factor for apical defect (between 60 and 70 years OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6; > 70 years OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.6). Previous hysterectomy (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.6) was a significant risk factor for posterior defect. CONCLUSIONS In a population undergoing POP surgery, anterior compartment involvement is the most common and serious defect and can often be associated with an apical defect, especially in older women. In case of previous hysterectomy, the posterior compartment may be weakened. These findings may help surgeons to select the appropriate POP reconstructive surgery, which often should address both anterior and apical defects.","Payebto Zoua, Emmanuel; Boulvain, Michel; Dällenbach, Patrick",International urogynecology journal,263,1

On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to both the public health and the durability of our healthcare systems and will profoundly affect the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The objective of this paper is to provide a natural history of COVID-19 - including virology, epidemiology and transmission patterns - and a guide for plastic surgeons regarding patient and resource management. METHODS The authors reviewed existing literature regarding COVID-19, both primary research and secondary reviews, via PubMed queries, and recommendations from relevant professional organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons and American Society of Plastic Surgeons). The literature and recommendations were summarized to provide a specific guide for plastic surgeons. RESULTS Internationally, over 5.7 million cases and 357,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at time of writing. No pharmacological treatments have been identified, but epidemiological strategies were identified to prevent viral spread, preserve healthcare resources, and protect patients and surgeons globally. Specific recommendations for plastic and reconstructive surgeons include postponing elective cases and transitioning to telecommunication platforms for patient consultations and education. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to the public health and the durability of healthcare systems in the contemporary era. While plastic and reconstructive surgery may seem relatively remote from the pandemic in direct patient care and exposure, our field can significantly enhance healthcare resource management.","Mackenzie, Ethan L; Poore, Samuel O",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,263,1

Studies have reported improvement in the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) score, whereas others showed no effect on the PCSS score. PURPOSE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of physical exercise on different outcomes in patients with a concussion. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A search of 5 databases from the earliest available date to September 30, 2016, and a hand search of a few articles were performed. Trial registries were reviewed, and authors of multiple studies were contacted to find additional published or unpublished studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and before and after (pre-post) studies evaluating the effect of physical exercise, compared with control, in patients with a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury were included. RESULTS The search generated 1096 studies. Of these, 14 studies (5 RCTs, 1 propensity score matching study, 3 cohort studies, and 5 before and after studies) met our inclusion criteria. Exercise significantly decreased the PCSS score (mean difference, -13.06; 95% CI, -16.57 to -9.55; P < .00001; I2 = 44%), percentage of patients with symptoms of a concussion (risk ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.86; P = .0001; I2 = 0%), and days off work (17.7 days vs 32.2 days, respectively; P < .05) compared with control.

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) scores were moderate for the PCSS, symptoms, ImPACT, BESS, and neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSION Physical exercise appears to improve the PCSS score and symptoms in patients with a concussion. A high-quality RCT evaluating different intensities of exercise at different time points, for different durations after a concussion, for different races/ethnicities, and for sex needs to be conducted to evaluate a clear effect of exercise in patients with a concussion.","Lal, Avtar; Kolakowsky-Hayner, Stephanie A; Ghajar, Jamshid; Balamane, Maya",The American journal of sports medicine,263,28

The full-length EV71 genome was amplified in one step by long-distance PCR with a T7 promoter at the 5' end, and the T7 polymerase gene was cloned into a lentivirus vector for construction of a stable cell line expressing T7 polymerase. The infectious virus was rapidly and efficiently rescued by single transfection of cells with the infectious cDNA clone. Further experiments showed that the rescued virus had characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. This method circumvented the difficulty in performing in vitro transcription of a long linear DNA to obtain high-quality RNA.

METHODS All patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer with curative intent in 2013 and 2014 were prospectively included. Primary outcomes were costs regarding surgery and hospital stay. RESULTS Laparoscopic gastrectomy was used in 52 patients [mean age 68 years (± 9, range 50 to 87)] and open gastrectomy was used in 25 patients [mean age 70 years (± 10, range 46 to 85)]. Mean costs (in euro's) of surgical instrumentation were significantly higher for laparoscopic surgery: 2270 ± 670 vs 1181 ± 680 in the open approach (P < 0.001). Costs of theatre use were higher in the laparoscopic group: mean 3819 ± 865 vs 2545 ± 1268 in the open surgery (P < 0.001). Total costs of hospitalization (i.e., costs of surgery and admission) were not different between laparoscopic and open surgery, 8187 ± 4864 and 7673 ± 8064 respectively (P = 0.729). Mean length of hospital stay was 9 ± 12 d in the laparoscopic group vs 14 ± 14 d in the open group (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION The introduction of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer coincided with higher costs for theatre use and surgical instrumentation compared to the open technique. Total costs were not significantly different due to shorter length of stay and less intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and shorter ICU stay in the laparoscopic group.","Tegels, Juul J; Silvius, Charlotte E; Spauwen, Frederique E; Hulsewé, Karel W; Hoofwijk, Anton G; Stoot, Jan H",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,263,29

Such complications commonly occur during the initial trocar insertion, making this a procedural step of critical importance. Methods In 2002, we experienced, upon initial trocar insertion, a serious major vascular injury (MVI) that led to hemorrhagic shock, and we thus modified the conventional closed entry method to an approach that we have found to be safe. We began developing the method by first measuring, in a patient undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy, the distance between the inner surface of the abdominal wall and the anterior spine when the abdominal wall was lifted manually for trocar insertion and when it was lifted by other methods, and we determined which method provided the greatest distance. We then devised a new approach, summarized as follows: The umbilical ring is elevated with Kocher forceps. The umbilicus is everted, and the base is incised longitudinally. This allows penetration of the abdominal wall at its thinnest point, and it shortens the distance to the abdominal cavity. A bladeless trocar (Step trocar) is used to allow insertion of the Veress needle. We began applying the new entry technique in July 2002, and by December 2014, we had applied it to 9676 patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecology surgery. Results All entries were performed successfully, and no MVI occurred. The umbilical incision often resulted in an umbilical deformity, but in a questionnaire-based survey, patients generally reported satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome. Conclusion A current new approach provides safe outcome with a minor cosmetic problem.","Sakamoto, Aiko; Kikuchi, Iwaho; Shimanuki, Hiroto; Tejima, Kaoru; Saito, Juichiro; Sakai, Kano; Kumakiri, Jun; Kitade, Mari; Takeda, Satoru",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,263,5

METHODS Retrospective study of all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and ISHPs in England that provided NHS-funded elective surgery. We used data from the England-wide Hospital Episode Statistics to study 18 common surgical procedures performed between 2006 and 2019. In-hospital outcomes included length of stay, emergency transfers to another hospital or death. Posthospital outcomes included readmission or death within 28 days. Outcomes were compared for each operation type by propensity score matching and survival analysis. RESULTS The data set included 3 203 331 operations in 734 NHS hospitals and 468 259 operations in 274 ISHPs.In-hospital outcomes: Across all 18 included operation types, length of stay was significantly longer for patients treated in NHS hospitals compared with ISHPs. Effect sizes ranged from a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.15 (95% CI 1.72 to 2.68) for total hip replacement to 1.07 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.09) for wisdom tooth removal; a mean difference of 2.49 and 0.02 days, respectively.Postdischarge outcomes: Treatment at an ISHP was associated with a lower risk of emergency readmission compared with NHS treatment. HRs ranged from 0.36 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.46) for lumbar decompression to 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.85) for cholecystectomy; absolute risk differences of 1.5 and 1.3 percentage points. There was no difference in mortality. CONCLUSION Elective surgery in an ISHP is associated with shorter lengths of stay and lower readmission rates than treatment in NHS hospitals across 18 operation types.

One crucial component of civilian-military relations is defining the role of the military. This paper evaluates the role of Nigerian military during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic. METHODS Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted throughout three states in North East region of Nigeria: Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Participants were identified through mapping of stakeholder involvement in Nigerian epidemic response. English-translated transcripts of each key informant interview and focus group discussion were then coded and key themes were elucidated and analysed. RESULTS Major themes elucidated include developing inclusive coordination plans between civilian and military entities, facilitating human rights reporting mechanisms and distributing military resources more equitably across geographical catchment areas. The Nigerian Military served numerous functions: 37% (22/59) of respondents indicated 'security/peace' as the military's primary function, while 42% (25/59) cited health services. Variations across geographic settings were also noted: 35% (7/20) of participants in Borno stated the military primarily provided transportation, while 73% (11/15) in Adamawa and 29% (7/24) in Yobe listed health services. CONCLUSIONS Robust civilian-military relations require an appropriately defined role of the military and clear civilian-military communication. Important considerations to contextualise civilian-military relations include military cultural-linguistic understanding, human rights promotion, and community-based needs assessments; such foci can facilitate the military's understanding of community norms and civilian cooperation with military aims. In turn, more robust civilian-military relations can promote overall epidemic response and reduce the global burden of disease.","Kwaja, Chris M A; Olivieri, D J; Boland, S; Henwood, P C; Card, B; Polatty, D P; Levine, A C",BMJ military health,263,16

Reducing or avoiding adhesions will curb these sequelae. (2) ""Adhesions"" is a monolithic entity to be tackled without regard to any other condition. Evidence is discussed to validate the first assumption. We reviewed progress in the field by examining hospital data. We found a growing trend in the number and cost of discharges for just two adhesion-related diagnoses, and the low usage of adhesion barriers appears in at most 5% of appropriate procedures. Data from an Internet-based survey suggested that the problem may be partly due to ignorance among patients and physicians about adhesions and their prevention. Two other surveys of patients visiting the adhesions.org Web site defined more fully adhesion-related disorder (ARD). The first survey ( N = 466) described a patient with chronic pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, an average of nine bowel obstructions, and an inability to work or maintain family or social relationships. The second survey (687 U.S. women) found a high (co-) prevalence of abdominal or pelvic adhesions (85%), chronic abdominal or pelvic pain (69%), irritable bowel syndrome (55%), recurrent bowel obstruction (44%), endometriosis (40%), and interstitial cystitis (29%). This pattern suggests that although ""adhesions"" may start out as a monolithic entity, an adhesions patient may develop related conditions (ARD) until they merge into an independent entity where they are practically indistinguishable from patients with multiple symptoms originating from other abdominopelvic conditions such as pelvic or bladder pain. Rather than use terms that constrain the required multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach to these patients by the paradigms of the specialty related to the patient's initial symptom set, the term complex abdominopelvic and pain syndrome (CAPPS) is proposed. It is essential to understand not only the pathogenesis of the ""initiating"" conditions but also how they progress to CAPPS. In our ARD sample, not only was the frequency of women with hysterectomies (56%) higher than expected (21 to 33%), but also the rates of the ""initiating"" conditions was 40 to 400% higher in patients with hysterectomies than in those without. This may represent increased surgical trauma or the loss of protection against oxidative stress. Related was the higher frequency of ARD patients reporting hemochromatosis (HC; 5%) than expected (~0.5%) and the higher rates (20 to 700%) of initiating conditions in patients with HC than in those without HC. Together with findings related to the toxicity of Intergel, these findings raise the possibility that heterozygotes for genes regulating oxidative stress are at greater risk of developing surgical complications as well as more severe and progressive conditions such as CAPPS.","Wiseman, David M",Seminars in reproductive medicine,263,1

In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic, studies based on KAP theory have been useful to better understand certain behaviors, such as adherence to prevention measures and control of the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE To describe the process of cross-cultural adaptation of two complementary instruments for assessing KAP regarding the COVID‑19 pandemic in the Brazilian population. METHODS Two independent translators proposed a first Brazilian Portuguese version of the scales. The cultural adaptation and pre-test of the Brazilian Portuguese versions occurred at different stages, using a panel of specialists and a subsample of the target population, respectively. RESULTS The pre-test of the adapted instruments involved 30 Brazilian adults (mean age = 41.8 years; standard deviation = 4.24) and was carried out to assess instrument understanding and applicability. The participants informed they did not have difficulties to self-complete the instruments and reported a high level of clarity and understanding.

In line with contemporary trends for theoretical integration, this systematic review aims to evaluate the association between multidimensional motivational constructs and endocrine-related responses to determine which theories are commonly used and what inferences can be made. Forty-one studies were identified incorporating five distinct motivation theories and multiple endocrine-related responses. There was evidence across several theories that high-quality motivation attenuated the cortisol response in evaluative environments. There was also evidence that motivational needs for power and affiliation were associated with lower and higher levels of salivary immunoglobulin A, respectively.

The 40-year-old participant had a 3-phase training: V1: isometric stimulation, V2: FES-cycling for 3 sessions/week, and V3: FES-cycling for 2 to 4 sessions/week. Data on general and physical tolerance, health impact and performance were collected. Borg score relating to fatigue was 10.1 before training and 11.8 after training. The average score for satisfaction at the end of sessions was 8.7. Lean leg mass increased more than 29%, although total bone mineral density dropped by 1.6%. The ventilatory thresholds increased from 19.5 to 29% and VEmax increased by 9.5%. Rosenberg's self-esteem score returned to its highest level by the end of training. For the only track event on a competition bike, the pilot covered a distance of 1607.8 m in 17'49"". When FES cycling training is based on a clear and structured protocol, it offers the person with paraplegia the opportunity to practice this activity recreationally and athletically. In times of crisis, this training has proven to be very relevant.","Fattal, Charles; Schmoll, Martin; Le Guillou, Ronan; Raoult, Berengère; Frey, Alain; Carlier, Robert; Azevedo-Coste, Christine",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,263,11

PPG is included in the quickly evolving and very popular landscape of wearables but has specific interesting properties, particularly the ability to capture the modulation of the autonomic nervous system during sleep. Recent advances have been made in PPG signal acquisition and processing, including coupling it with accelerometry in order to construct hypnograms in normal and pathologic sleep and also to detect sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The limitations of PPG (e.g., oxymetry signal failure, motion artefacts, signal processing) are reviewed as well as technical solutions to overcome these issues. The potential medical applications of PPG are numerous, including home-based detection of SDB (for triage purposes), and long-term monitoring of insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (to assess treatment effects), and treated SDB (to ensure disease control). New contact sensor combinations to improve future wearables seem promising, particularly tools that allow for the assessment of brain activity. In this way, in-ear EEG combined with PPG and actigraphy could be an interesting focus for future research.","Vulcan, Ramona S; André, Stephanie; Bruyneel, Marie",Sensors,263,17

It is unclear how vaccine-induced antibody levels quantitatively compare to the wide spectrum induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine response kinetics and magnitudes in persons with prior COVID-19 compared to virus-naı̈ve persons are not well-defined. The relative stability of vaccine-induced versus infection-induced antibody levels is unclear. We addressed these issues with longitudinal assessments of vaccinees with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of anti-RBD antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-naı̈ve individuals achieved levels similar to mild natural infection after the first vaccination; a second dose generated levels approaching severe natural infection. In persons with prior COVID-19, one dose boosted levels to the high end of severe natural infection even in those who never had robust responses from infection, increasing no further after the second dose. Antiviral neutralizing assessments using a spike-pseudovirus assay revealed that virus-naı̈ve vaccinees did not develop physiologic neutralizing potency until the second dose, while previously infected persons exhibited maximal neutralization after one dose. Finally, antibodies from vaccination waned similarly to natural infection, resulting in an average of ∼90% loss within 90 days. In summary, our findings suggest that two doses are important for quantity and quality of humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2-naı̈ve persons, while a single dose has maximal effects in those with past infection. Antibodies from vaccination wane with kinetics very similar to that seen after mild natural infection; booster vaccinations will likely be required.","Ibarrondo, F Javier; Hofmann, Christian; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Goodman-Meza, David; Mu, William; Hausner, Mary Ann; Ali, Ayub; Balamurugan, Arumugam; Taus, Ellie; Elliott, Julie; Krogstad, Paul; Tobin, Nicole H; Ferbas, Kathie G; Kitchen, Scott G; Aldrovandi, Grace M; Rimoin, Anne W; Yang, Otto O",ACS nano,263,24

This tumor graft rapidly grows within the liver of recipient rabbits into an angiographically identifiable tumor characterized by a necrotic core surrounded by a viable hypervascular capsule. The physical size of the rabbit anatomy is sufficient to facilitate vascular instrumentation allowing for the application and testing of various interventional techniques. Despite these benefits, there exists a paucity of technical resources to act as a concrete reference for researchers working with the model.

RESULTS The observed seroprevalence level was 7.9% for the WSHT/Abbott cohort versus 13% for the BSUH/Roche cohort. Based on a previous positive PCR, we find that the false-negative rate of the Abbott and Roche assays were 60.2% and 19% respectively, implying sensitivity levels of 39.8% and 81%. Within these cohorts, seropositivity was most strongly associated with those of South Asian ethnicity, allied health professionals and male sex (p<0.0001).

We evaluated efficacy of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) verapamil (VER) with fluconazole (FLC) against FLC-resistant (CaR) and -susceptible C. albicans (CaS). The susceptibility of both strains to VER and FLC was determined, as well as the synergism of VER with FLC. Experiments were performed in vitro for planktonic cultures and biofilms and in vivo using Galleria mellonella. Larval survival and fungal recovery were evaluated after treatment with VER and FLC. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Kaplan-Meier tests. The combination of VER with FLC at sub-lethal concentrations reduced fungal growth. VER inhibited the efflux of rhodamine 123 and showed synergism with FLC against CaR. For biofilms, FLC and VER alone reduced fungal viability. The combination of VER with FLC at sub-lethal concentrations also reduced biofilm viability. In the in vivo assays, VER and FLC used alone or in combination increased the survival of larvae infected with CaR. Reduction of fungal recovery was observed only for larvae infected with CaR and treated with VER with FLC. VER reverted the FLC-resistance of C. albicans. Based on the results obtained, VER reverted the FLC-resistance of C. albicans and showed synergism with FLC against CaR.

There are many in vivo and in vitro methods for testing the binding of a known protein to a promoter, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, for these experiments, one must have a protein candidate to test and is not able to identify unknown proteins bound to a particular promoter. Thus, the promoter pull-down assay was developed to fill this void. This method uses DNA as bait to capture proteins that bind to a specific promoter, such as transcription factors, from cellular lysates.

A knowledge gap remains in the key elements of integrated care approaches used in health and social care delivery systems for older populations. The objective of this review was to identify and describe the key elements of integrated care models for elderly people reported in the literature. DESIGN Review of reviews using a systematic search method. METHODS A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and the Cochrane database in June 2017. Reviews of interventions aimed at care integration at the clinical (micro), organisational/service (meso) or health system (macro) levels for people aged ≥60 years were included. Non-Cochrane reviews published before 2015 were excluded. Reviews were assessed for quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 1 tool. RESULTS Fifteen reviews (11 systematic reviews, of which six were Cochrane reviews) were included, representing 219 primary studies. Three reviews (20%) included only randomised controlled trials (RCT), while 10 reviews (65%) included both RCTs and non-RCTs. The region where the largest number of primary studies originated was North America (n=89, 47.6%), followed by Europe (n=60, 32.1%) and Oceania (n=31, 16.6%). Eleven (73%) reviews focused on clinical 'micro' and organisational 'meso' care integration strategies. The most commonly reported elements of integrated care models were multidisciplinary teams, comprehensive assessment and case management. Nurses, physiotherapists, general practitioners and social workers were the most commonly reported service providers. Methodological quality was variable (AMSTAR scores: 1-11). Seven (47%) reviews were scored as high quality (AMSTAR score ≥8). CONCLUSION Evidence of elements of integrated care for older people focuses particularly on micro clinical care integration processes, while there is a relative lack of information regarding the meso organisational and macro system-level care integration strategies.","Briggs, Andrew M; Valentijn, Pim P; Thiyagarajan, Jotheeswaran A; Araujo de Carvalho, Islene",BMJ open,263,5

A total of 20 patients were included in this study who received photon therapy (12 with rectal spacer (DuraSeal™ gel) and 8 without). Two PBS treatment plans were retrospectively created for each patient using the following beam arrangements: (1) lateral-opposed (LAT) fields and (2) left and right anterior oblique (LAO/RAO) fields. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were generated for the prostate, rectum, bladder, and right and left femoral heads. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model and compared between patients with and without the rectal spacer. A significantly lower mean rectal DVH was achieved in patients with rectal spacer compared to those without. For LAT plans, the mean rectal V70 with and without rectal spacer was 4.19 and 13.5%, respectively. For LAO/RAO plans, the mean rectal V70 with and without rectal spacer was 5.07 and 13.5%, respectively. No significant differences were found in any rectal dosimetric parameters between the LAT and the LAO/RAO plans generated with the rectal spacers. We found that ≥ 9 mm space resulted in a significant decrease in NTCP modeled for ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity. Rectal spacers can significantly decrease modeled rectal dose and predicted ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated in silico with PBS. A minimum of 9 mm separation between the prostate and anterior rectal wall yields the largest benefit.","Chung, Heeteak; Polf, Jerimy; Badiyan, Shahed; Biagioli, Matthew; Fernandez, Daniel; Latifi, Kujtim; Wilder, Richard; Mehta, Minesh; Chuong, Michael",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,263,11

Design & data sources An electronic literature search was conducted using the EBSCOhost platform searching MEDLINE, Education Research Complete, ERIC, CINAHL Plus and SPORTDiscus databases. Eligibility criteria Included studies sampled children with ID and/or autism aged between 1 and 18 yrs, used field-based gross motor competence assessments, reported measurement properties, and were published in English. The utility of assessments were appraised for validity, reliability, responsiveness and feasibility. Results The initial search produced 3182 results, with 291 full text articles screened. 13 articles including 10 assessments of motor competence were included in this systematic review. There was limited reporting across measurement properties, mostly for responsiveness and some aspects of validity. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 followed by The Test of Gross Motor Development-2 demonstrated the greatest levels of evidence for validity and reliability. Feasibility results were varied, most instruments required little additional equipment (n=8) and were suitable for a school setting, but, additional training (n=7) was needed to score and interpret the results. Conclusion This review found the BOT-2 followed by the TGMD-2 to be the most psychometrically appropriate motor competency assessments for children with ID and/or autism in field-based settings.

REIMS-based classification of liver parenchyma (LP), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and metastatic adenocarcinoma (MAC) reached an accuracy of 98.3%. Lipid patterns of LP were more similar to those of HCC than to those of MAC and allowed clear distinction between primary and metastatic liver tumors. HCC lipid patterns were more heterogeneous than those of MAC, which is consistent with the variation seen in the histopathological phenotype. A common ceramide pattern discriminated necrotic from viable tumor in MAC with 92.9% accuracy and in other human tumors. Targeted analysis of ceramide and related sphingolipid mass features in necrotic tissues may provide a new classification of tumor cell death based on metabolic shifts.

They provide information related to poor outcomes when considered together, however their collective behavior across time has not been characterized. METHODS We have developed the Triple Variable Index (TVI), a composite variable representing the sum of z-scores from MAP, BIS, and MAC values that occur together during surgery. We generated a TVI expression profile, defined as the sequential TVI values expressed across time, for each surgery where concurrent MAP, BIS, and MAC monitoring occurred in an adult patient (≥18 years) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between January and July 2014 (n = 5296). Patterns of TVI expression were identified using k-means clustering and compared across numerous patient, procedure, and outcome characteristics. TVI and the triple low state were compared as prediction models for 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS The median frequency MAP, BIS, and MAC were recorded was one measurement every 3, 5, and 5 min. Three expression patterns were identified: elevated, mixed, and depressed. The elevated pattern displayed the highest average MAP, BIS, and MAC values (86.5 mmHg, 45.3, and 0.98, respectively), while the depressed pattern displayed the lowest values (76.6 mmHg, 38.0, 0.66).

Perioperative clinical data were compared with patients who underwent open surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASES From 2009 to 2012, we performed laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy for the treatment of gastric varices in eight patients. The patients included four males and four females. Peri-gastric vessels were divided using electrical coagulating devices or other devices according to the diameter of the vessels. Two patients underwent conversion to open surgery due to intraoperative bleeding. DISCUSSION Intraoperative blood loss in patients who accomplished laparoscopic devascularization was very small (mean 76ml). However, once bleeding occurs, there is a risk of causing massive bleeding. CONCLUSION With further improvement of laparoscopic devices, laparoscopic gastric devascularization without splenectomy must be an effective and less-invasive surgical procedure in the treatment of gastric varices.","Zuiki, Toru; Hosoya, Yoshinori; Sakuma, Yasunaru; Hyodo, Masanobu; Lefor, Alan T; Sata, Naohiro; Nagamine, Nobuhiko; Isoda, Norio; Sugano, Kentaro; Yasuda, Yoshikazu",International journal of surgery case reports,263,24

The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.","Tian, H Y",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],263,31

METHODS A dual center study included 135 symptomatic patients (mean age 71 years; 76 men) who underwent endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal ISR between 2006 and 2013. Of these, 54 (40%) were treated with laser atherectomy and the remaining 81 patients with balloon angioplasty alone. Angiographic images were reviewed for lesion morphology and characteristics, TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) II classification, and distal runoff. Class I ISR was defined as focal lesions ≤50 mm, class II ISR as lesions >50 mm, and class III ISR as stent total occlusion. Recurrent ISR was determined by a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4 by duplex ultrasound. RESULTS Patients treated with laser atherectomy had longer mean ISR lesion length (222 vs 114 mm, p<0.001) and more class III ISR (69% vs 20%, p=0.001). There was no association between laser atherectomy and rates of recurrent restenosis or occlusion for patients with class I/II ISR, but there was a significantly lower rate of target lesion revascularization at 2 years among patients treated with laser atherectomy (14% vs 44%, p=0.05). In comparison, patients with class III ISR treated with laser atherectomy had lower rates of recurrent restenosis at 1 year (54% vs 91%, p=0.05) and 2 years (69% vs 100%, p=0.05). Patients with class III ISR treated with laser atherectomy also had lower rates of recurrent in-stent occlusion at 2-year follow-up (33% vs 71%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION When used to treat complex ISR, including in-stent occlusions, laser atherectomy with adjunctive balloon angioplasty may be associated with improved patency.","Armstrong, Ehrin J; Thiruvoipati, Thejasvi; Tanganyika, Kundai; Singh, Gagan D; Laird, John R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,263,5

CXCL12 is a key chemokine for leukocyte recruitment. However, the role of CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in ischemia-induced inflammatory response is unclear. Here we use the pharmacological antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, to investigate the function of CXCL12/CXCR4 in regulating inflammatory response during acute ischemia. METHODS Adult male CD-1 mice (n=184) underwent permanent suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). AMD3100 was injected for 3 days (1 mg/kg/day) after MCAO. Brain water content, infarct volume, neurological score, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression and activity were examined at 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO. Proinflammatory cytokine RNA and protein levels in brain tissue were measured by RT-PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Neurological score was greatly improved in AMD3100-treated mice compared with the control mice 3 days after MCAO (P<0.05). Brain edema-induced change of water content, IgG protein leakage, Evans blue extravasation, occludin, and ZO-1 expression in ipsilateral hemisphere were alleviated by acute treatment of AMD3100. MPO expression and activity revealed that AMD3100 profoundly reduced the number of MPO-positive cells in the ischemic region (P<0.05). It also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon γ; their mRNA and protein levels changed accordingly compared with the controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 significantly suppressed inflammatory response and reduced blood-brain barrier disruption after MCAO. AMD3100 attenuated ischemia-induced acute inflammation by suppressing leukocyte migration and infiltration, in addition to reducing proinflammatory cytokine expression in the ischemic region.","Huang, Jun; Li, Yaning; Tang, Yaohui; Tang, Guanghui; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Wang, Yongting",Stroke,263,27

This is due to a combination of true emergence of new pathogens and the advance of new technologies making rapid detection and characterisation possible. While molecular approaches will continue to lead the way in virus discovery, other technological platforms are required to increase the chance of success.

However, studies on patient selection in daily practice are sparse. METHODS Here, we analyzed consecutive patients from 01/2014 to 12/2018 within the supraregional stroke network ""Neurovascular Network of Southwest Bavaria"" (NEVAS) in terms of diagnoses after consultation, inter-hospital transfer and predictors for performing MT. Degree of disability was rated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), good outcome was defined as mRS ≤ 2. Successful reperfusion was assumed when the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) was 2b-3. RESULTS Of 5722 telemedicine consultations, in 14.1% inter-hospital transfer was performed, mostly because of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. A total of n = 350 patients with LVO were shipped via NEVAS to our center for MT. While n = 52 recanalized spontaneously, MT-treatment was performed in n = 178 patients. MT-treated patients had more severe strokes according to the median National institute of health stroke scale (NIHSS) (16 vs. 13, p < 0.001), were more often treated with intravenous thrombolysis (64.5% vs. 51.7%, p = 0.026) and arrived significantly earlier in our center (184.5 versus 228.0 min, p < 0.001). Good outcome (27.5% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.35) and mortality (32.6% versus 23.5%, p = 0.79) were comparable in MT-treated versus no-MT-treated patients. In patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion in the M1 segment or carotid artery occlusion good outcome was twice as often in the MT-group (21.8% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.184). Independent predictors for performing MT were higher NIHSS (OR 1.096), higher ASPECTS (OR 1.28), and earlier time window (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION Within a telemedicine network stroke care can successfully be organized as only a minority of patients has to be transferred. Our data provide clinical evidence that all MT-eligible patients should be shipped with the fastest transportation modality as possible.","Feil, Katharina; Rémi, Jan; Küpper, Clemens; Herzberg, Moriz; Dorn, Franziska; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Reidler, Paul; Levin, Johannes; Hüttemann, Katrin; Tiedt, Steffen; Heidger, Wanja; Müller, Katharina; Thunstedt, Dennis C; Dabitz, Rainer; Müller, Robert; Pfefferkorn, Thomas; Hamann, Gerhard F; Liebig, Thomas; Dieterich, Marianne; Kellert, Lars",Journal of neurology,263,1

This study assesses the prevalence and incidence of burnout symptoms and moral distress in ICU professionals before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. DESIGN This is a longitudinal open cohort study. SETTING Five ICUs based in a single university medical center plus another adult ICU based on a separate teaching hospital in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS All ICU professionals were sent a baseline survey in October-December 2019 (252 respondents, response rate: 53%), and a follow-up survey was sent in May-June 2020 (233 respondents, response rate: 50%). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Burnout symptoms and moral distress measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Moral Distress Scale, respectively. The prevalence of burnout symptoms was 23.0% before coronavirus disease 2019 and 36.1% at postpeak time, with higher rates in nurses (38.0%) than in physicians (28.6%). Reversely, the incidence rate of new burnout cases among physicians was higher (26.7%) than nurses (21.9%). Higher prevalence of burnout symptoms was observed in the postpeak coronavirus disease 2019 period (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32-2.53), for nurses (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.04), for professionals working overtime (odds ratio 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02), and for professionals directly engaged with care for coronavirus disease 2019 patients (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60). Physicians were more likely than nurses to develop burnout symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.06-12.21). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that overburdening of ICU professionals during an extended period of time leads to symptoms of burnout. Working long hours and under conditions of scarcity of staff, time, and resources comes at the prize of ICU professionals' mental health.","Kok, Niek; van Gurp, Jelle; Teerenstra, Steven; van der Hoeven, Hans; Fuchs, Malaika; Hoedemaekers, Cornelia; Zegers, Marieke",Critical care medicine,263,1

RECENT FINDINGS Many mental health services remain too hospital-centric, often without adequate outreach services. On the basis of outcome evidence, we need to shift the balance of mental health services from hospital-centered with community outreach when convenient for staff, to community-centered and mobile, with in-reach to hospital only when necessary. Too few training programs those with emphasize the macroskills of public advocacy, working with service users, families, social movements, and the media to improve mental health and wellbeing of regional and local communities. SUMMARY We should adopt a health ecosystems approach to mental healthcare and training, encompassing nano to macrolevels of service in every region. Catchment mental health services should be rebuilt as community-centric mental health services, integrating all community and inpatient components, but led and integrated from community sites. Community psychiatrists and mental health professionals of the future will need to be well trained in the nano to macroskills required to take responsibility for the mental health and wellbeing of their catchment communities and to provide leadership in service-planning, management, and continuing revision on the basis of rigorous evaluation. These approaches should be the core of all training in psychiatry and all mental health professions prior to any subspecialization.","Rosen, Alan; Gill, Neeraj S; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",Current opinion in psychiatry,263,1

Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are responsible for approximately 80% of all UTI, which most commonly affect the bladder. UPEC colonise the urinary tract by ascension of the urethra, followed by cell invasion, and proliferation inside and outside urothelial cells, thereby causing symptomatic infections and quiescent intracellular reservoirs that may lead to recurrence. Sugars or glycans are key molecules for host-pathogen interactions, and UTI are no exception. Surface glycans regulate many of the events associated with UPEC adhesion and infection, as well as induction of the host immune response. Whilst the bacterial protein FimH binds mannose-containing host glycoproteins to initiate infection and UPEC-secreted polysaccharides block immune mechanisms to favour intracellular replication, host glycans on the urothelial surface and on secreted glycoproteins prevent or limit infection by inhibiting UPEC adhesion. Given the importance of glycans during UTI, here we review the glycobiology of UPEC infection to highlight fundamental sugar-mediated processes of immunological interest for their potential clinical applications. Interdisciplinary approaches incorporating glycomics and infection biology may help to develop novel non-antibiotic based therapeutic strategies for bacterial infections as the spread of antimicrobial resistant uropathogens is currently threatening modern health care systems.","Lupo, Federico; Ingersoll, Molly A; Pineda, Miguel",Immunology,263,1

IBV is responsible for causing severe losses to the commercial poultry sector globally. The objectives of this study were to identify the viruses that were causing outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in chickens in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) and to characterize the strains. Swab samples were collected from birds showing severe respiratory signs in five farms on the island of Trinidad. Samples were tested for the presence of IBV, as well as Avian Influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All samples from the five farms tested negative for AIV, NDV and aMPV; however samples from clinically affected birds in all five of the farms tested positive for IBV. Genetic data revealed the presence of TCoV in chickens on two of the farms. Interestingly, these two farms had never reared turkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IBV S1 sequences formed two distinct clusters. Two sequences grouped with vaccine strains within the GI-1 lineage, whereas three sequences grouped together, but separately from other defined lineages, forming a likely new lineage of IBV. Pairwise comparison revealed that the three unique variant strains within the new lineage of IBV were significantly different in their S1 nucleotide coding regions from viruses in the closest lineage (16% difference) and locally used vaccine strains (>20% difference). Results also suggested that one of the samples was a recombinant virus, generated from a recombination event between a Trinidad virus of the GI-1 lineage and a Trinidad virus of the newly defined lineage. Many amino acid differences were also observed between the S1 coding regions of the circulating field and vaccine strains, indicating that the IBV vaccines may not be protective. Vaccine-challenge studies are however needed to prove this.","Brown Jordan, Arianne; Fusaro, Alice; Blake, Lemar; Milani, Adelaide; Zamperin, Gianpiero; Brown, Gabriel; Carrington, Christine V F; Monne, Isabella; Oura, Christopher A L",Transboundary and emerging diseases,263,0

Vulnerable populations, such as racial/ethnic minorities and low-income, veteran, and rural populations, exhibit lower screening uptake. This systematic review summarizes the existing literature on vulnerable patient populations' preferences regarding CRC screening. Methods We searched the CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2017. We screened studies for eligibility and systematically abstracted and compared study designs and outcomes. Results A total of 43 articles met the inclusion criteria, out of 2,106 articles found in our search. These 43 articles were organized by the primary sub-population(s) whose preferences were reported: 27 report on preferences among racial/ethnic minorities, eight among low-income groups, six among veterans, and two among rural populations. The majority of studies (n=34) focused on preferences related to test modality. No single test modality was overwhelmingly supported by all sub-populations, although veterans seemed to prefer colonoscopy. Test attributes such as accuracy, sensitivity, cost, and convenience were also noted as important features. Furthermore, a preference for shared decision-making between vulnerable patients and providers was found. Conclusion The heterogeneity in study design, populations, and outcomes of the selected studies revealed a wide spectrum of CRC screening preferences within vulnerable populations. More decision aids and discrete choice experiments that focus on vulnerable populations are needed to gain a more nuanced understanding of how vulnerable populations weigh particular features of screening methods. Improved CRC screening rates may be achieved through the alignment of vulnerable populations' preferences with screening program design and provider practices. Collaborative decision-making between providers and vulnerable patients in preventive care decisions may also be important.","Lee, Samuel J; O'Leary, Meghan C; Umble, Karl E; Wheeler, Stephanie B",Patient preference and adherence,263,1

Here, we investigated whether G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was involved in regulating diabetic mechanical hyperalgesia (DMH). METHODS The adeno-associated viral vectors containing the GRK2 gene (AAV-GRK2) were used to upregulate GRK2 protein expression. The expression of GRK2 and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate 1 (Epac1) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of lumbar 4-6 was detected via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, and the transfection of the GRK2 gene was detected by immunofluorescence. RESULTS Low levels of GRK2 were able to sustain STZ-induced pain in DMH rats. Intrathecal injection of AAV-GRK2 vector upregulated GRK2 expression, providing pain rain to rats with DMH. With an increase in DMH duration, there was a decrease in paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) value, aggravating the pain, resulting in a decreasing pattern in GRK2 protein expression over time, whereas Epac1 protein expression showed an opposite trend. CONCLUSION GRK2 expression regulated DMH progression and is expected to play a role in the development of targeted therapy for DMH. GRK2 and Epac1 expressions play a vital role in maintaining pain in DMH rats.","Xu, Xiu-Hua; Du, Rui-Qin; Li, Lin; Yang, Lin-Lin; Zhang, Yi; Li, Quan-Min",European journal of pain,263,24

However, our understanding of the limitations, potential, and strength of these techniques has enhanced, raising expectations. Areas covered: Based on a survey of reports in the past five years, we assess whether VS: (1) predicts binding poses in agreement with crystallographic data (when available); (2) is a superior screening tool, as often claimed; (3) is successful in identifying chemical scaffolds that can be starting points for subsequent lead optimization cycles. Data shows that knowledge of the target and its chemotypes in postprocessing lead to viable hits in early drug discovery endeavors. Expert opinion: VS is capable of accurate placements in the pocket for the most part, but does not consistently score screening collections accurately. What matters is capitalization on available resources to get closer to a viable lead or optimizable series.

The investigation of pulmonary nodules is time-consuming and often leads to protracted follow-up with ongoing radiological surveillance, however, clinical calculators that assess the risk of the nodule being malignant exist to help in the stratification of patients. Furthermore recent advances in interventional pulmonology include the ability to both navigate to nodules and also to perform autofluorescence endomicroscopy. In this study we assessed the efficacy of incorporating additional information from label-free fibre-based optical endomicrosopy of the nodule on assessing risk of malignancy. Using image analysis and machine learning approaches, we find that this information does not yield any gain in predictive performance in a cohort of patients. Further advances with pulmonary endomicroscopy will require the addition of molecular tracers to improve information from this procedure.","Seth, Sohan; Akram, Ahsan R; McCool, Paul; Westerfeld, Jody; Wilson, David; McLaughlin, Stephen; Dhaliwal, Kevin; Williams, Christopher K I",Scientific reports,263,1

Studies on the prevalence and epidemiological pattern of allergic skin disorders in Indian scenario are not much available. The present study was designed to assess the epidemiological pattern of contact dermatitis in rural and urban areas in a peripheral district in eastern India. Aims and Objectives This study was undertaken to find the prevalence of contact dermatitis and to assess the epidemiological pattern of contact dermatitis both in rural and urban community. Materials and Methods The study was conducted in a medical college located at a semi-urban area in eastern India with written informed consent obtained from each participant. This hospital-based cross-sectional study was done from May 2017 to April 2018. Study population consisted of patients attending the dermatology OPD and having lesions clinically suggestive of contact dermatitis and there were 268 such patients. Patients attending the OPD were divided into urban and rural as per their address. Data analysis was done using suitable, standard, and appropriate statistical methods. Results The prevalence of contact dermatitis was 4.38% among the dermatology OPD attendees. Urban prevalence was statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher than rural prevalence. Contact dermatitis was common in the age group of 41-50 years. In urban areas, females were more affected than those in rural areas. Occupationally, the difference between urban and rural patients of contact dermatitis was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Cosmetic history in the urban group was significantly more (P < 0.05). Conclusions Contact dermatitis prevalence and patient profile in certain factors showed a statistically significant difference between urban and rural patients.","Ghosh, Shinjini; Kundu, Saurav; Ghosh, Sanjay",Indian journal of dermatology,263,1

METHODS A total of 74 hypertensive older adults residing in two different nursing homes were randomized to the intervention group (n = 37) or control group (n = 37). The intervention group participated in a training program consisting of 20 weeks of health education and motivational meetings. Data were collected using a hypertension management knowledge and behavior questionnaire, quality of life scale, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and measurements of blood pressure and anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Data were analyzed using the χ2 -test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS Post-test systolic (118.64 ± 10.04 mmHg) and diastolic (77.83 ± 5.34 mmHg) blood pressures, and total cholesterol levels (178.43 ± 25.59 mg/dL) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (130.54 ± 15.08 mmHg, 82.70 ± 7.69 mmHg, 200.7 ± 34.57 mg/dL, respectively).

We describe in detail, the methodology of a single pulse TMS protocol that was performed in a large cohort of people (n = 110) with multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim was to establish and validate a core-set of TMS variables that predicted typical MS clinical outcomes: walking speed, hand dexterity, fatigue, and cognitive processing speed. We provide a brief and simple methodological pipeline to examine excitatory and inhibitory corticospinal mechanisms in MS that map to clinical status. Delayed and longer ipsilateral silent period (a measure of transcallosal inhibition; the influence of one brain hemisphere's activity over the other), longer cortical silent period (suggestive of greater corticospinal inhibition via GABA) and higher resting motor threshold (lower corticospinal excitability) most strongly related to clinical outcomes, especially when measured in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand. Greater interhemispheric asymmetry (imbalance between hemispheres) correlated with poorer performance in the greatest number of clinical outcomes. We also show, not surprisingly, that TMS variables related more strongly to motor outcomes than non-motor outcomes. As it was validated in a large sample of patients with varying severities of central nervous system dysfunction, the protocol described herein can be used by investigators and clinicians alike to investigate the role of TMS as a biomarker in MS and other central nervous system disorders.","Chaves, Arthur R; Snow, Nicholas J; Alcock, Lynsey R; Ploughman, Michelle",Brain sciences,263,1

The age and body mass index (BMI) are important predictors of clinical outcome after surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures. In this study, we investigate whether these also influence the outcome of patients after Achilles tendon reconstruction using the ALT-FL flap. METHODS Twenty patients (mean age: 55.9 ± 8.7 years) with complex tissue defects involving the Achilles tendon underwent reconstruction with the ALT-FL flap. Both the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score were assessed preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. In addition, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and measurements of the ankle range of motion were performed and results compared with existing literature. RESULTS All flaps survived and MRI studies confirmed complete anatomical integration of the fascia lata as ""neotendon"" at the recipient site. In our patient cohort, the age did not correlate with the outcome measurements, whereas the BMI showed significant negative correlation with the postoperative ATRS (p < 0.001) and AOFAS scores (p < 0.05). The ATRS and AOFAS scores of all patients improved significantly (p < 0.001). However, obese patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 achieved significant lower ATRS (p < 0.001) and AOFAS scores (p < 0.01), as well as patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) (p < 0.05). The mean ankle range of motion after ALT-FL flap reconstruction remained statistical insignificant compared with previous avascular or vascularized tendon repairs of the Achilles tendon. CONCLUSION The ALT-FL flap enables reconstruction of complex tissue defects involving the Achilles tendon with good functional results. However, the presence of an increased BMI or PAD, but not necessarily the age, proves to be a predictor of poor clinical outcome and therefore should be subject to scrutiny during patient selection.","Jandali, Zaher; Lam, Martin C; Merwart, Benedikt; Möhring, Bernd; Geil, Stephanie; Müller, Klaus; Ionac, Mihai; Jiga, Lucian P",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,263,7

Controversy continues to exist regarding optimal treatment and rehabilitation protocols. The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal effects of surgical repair and immobilization or activity on Achilles tendon healing and limb function after complete transection in rodents. METHODS Injured tendons were repaired (n = 64) or left nonrepaired (n = 64). The animals in both cohorts were further randomized into groups immobilized in plantar flexion for 1, 3, or 6 weeks that later resumed cage and treadmill activity for 5, 3, or 0 weeks, respectively (n = 36 for each regimen), which were euthanized at 6 weeks after injury, or into groups immobilized for 1 week and then euthanized (n = 20). RESULTS At 6 weeks after injury, the groups that had 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity had increased range of motion and decreased ankle joint toe stiffness compared with the groups that had 3 weeks of immobilization and 3 weeks of activity. The groups with 6 weeks of immobilization and no activity period had decreased tendon cross-sectional area but increased tendon echogenicity and collagen alignment. Surgical treatment dramatically decreased fatigue cycles to failure in repaired tendons from groups with 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity. Normalized comparisons between 1-week and 6-week postinjury data demonstrated that changes in tendon healing properties (area, alignment, and echogenicity) were maximized by 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity, compared with 6 weeks of immobilization and no activity period. DISCUSSION This study builds on an earlier study of Achilles tendon fatigue mechanics and functional outcomes during early healing by examining the temporal effects of different immobilization and/or activity regimens after initial postinjury immobilization. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates how the temporal postinjury healing response of rodent Achilles tendons depends on both surgical treatment and the timing of immobilization/activity timing. The different pattern of healing and qualities of repaired and nonrepaired tendons suggest that two very different healing processes may occur, depending on the chosen immobilization/activity regimen.","Freedman, Benjamin R; Salka, Nabeel S; Morris, Tyler R; Bhatt, Pankti R; Pardes, Adam M; Gordon, Joshua A; Nuss, Courtney A; Riggin, Corinne N; Fryhofer, George W; Farber, Daniel C; Soslowsky, Louis",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,263,1
147779,147779,147779,From the Editor.,14.71361,3.5459595,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND For focal radiofrequency ablation of Barrett's oesophagus, a simplified regimen (3 × 15 J/cm2, without cleaning) has proven to be as effective as the standard regimen (2 × 15 J/cm2, followed by cleaning, followed by 2 × 15 J/cm2). However, this simplified regimen seemed to be associated with a higher stenosis rate. Therefore, we lowered the radiofrequency energy and hypothesised that this new simplified regimen would be as effective and safe as the standard regimen. METHODS This randomised non-inferiority trial included patients with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus or residual Barrett's oesophagus after endoscopic resection or circumferential radiofrequency ablation, in five European tertiary referral centres. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the new simplified regimen (3 × 12 J/cm2, without cleaning) or the standard regimen, with variable block sizes of four, six, and eight patients, stratified by participating hospital. Focal radiofrequency ablation was done every 3 months, up to a maximum of three treatments, until all Barrett's oesophagus was eradicated. The primary outcome was complete endoscopic and histological regression of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia after two focal radiofrequency ablation treatments, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Non-inferiority was assessed on the basis of the difference between groups in the median percentage of Barrett's oesophagus surface regression, with a non-inferiority margin of -15%. This study is registered with www.trialregister.nl, number NTR4994, and is completed. FINDINGS Between March 25, 2015, and July 25, 2016, 84 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 44 to receive the simplified regimen and 40 to receive the standard regimen. One patient assigned to the simplified regimen and four assigned to the standard regimen were excluded because they weree found not to be eligible; therefore the final intention-to-treat population consisted of 43 patients in the simplified ablation group and 36 in the standard ablation group. Complete endoscopic and histological regression of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia after two focal radiofrequency ablation treatments was achieved in 32 (74%, 95% CI 59-87) patients treated with the simplified protocol, versus 30 (83%, 95% CI 67-94) patients treated with the standard protocol (p=0·34). Median Barrett's oesophagus surface regression after two focal radiofrequency ablation sessions was 98% (IQR 95-100) in the simplified regimen group and 100% (97-100) in the standard regimen group. The difference between medians was 2% (95% CI -0·562 to 3·162); thus the simplified regimen was deemed non-inferior to the standard regimen. Stenoses requiring dilatation were observed in four (9%) of 43 patients in the simplified regimen group and four (11%) of 36 in the standard regimen group. Post-procedural bleeding requiring repeat endoscopy occurred in one (2%) patient in the simplified ablation group and three (8%) patients in the standard ablation group. One patient (2%) in the simplified treatment group died 36 days after the second radiofrequency ablation procedure, due to an unknown cause. INTERPRETATION Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the simplified regimen is the preferred regimen for focal radiofrequency ablation of Barrett's oesophagus.

METHODS We assessed the effect of sex on mortality, length of stay (LOS) and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with ARDS who underwent IMV, adjusting for plausible clinical and geographic confounders. FINDINGS Of 2377 patients with ARDS, 905 (38%) were female while 1472 (62%) were male. There were no sex differences in clinician recognition of ARDS, or critical illness severity profile. Females received higher tidal volumes (8.2±2.1 versus 7.2±1.6 mL·kg-1, p<0.0001), and higher plateau and driving pressures compared to males. Lower tidal volume ventilation was received by 50% of females compared to 74% of males p<0.0001). In shorter patients (≤1.69 m) females were significantly less likely to receive lower tidal volumes. Surviving females had a shorter duration of IMV and reduced LOS compared to males. Overall hospital mortality was similar in females (40.2%) versus males (40.2%). However, female sex was associated with higher mortality in patients with severe confirmed ARDS (odds ratio for sex (male versus female) 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.83). INTERPRETATION Shorter females with ARDS are less likely to receive lower tidal volume ventilation, while females with severe confirmed ARDS have a higher mortality risk. These data highlight the need for better ventilatory management in females to improve their outcomes from ARDS.","McNicholas, Bairbre A; Madotto, Fabiana; Pham, Tài; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Masterson, Claire H; Horie, Shahd; Bellani, Giacomo; Brochard, Laurent; Laffey, John G",The European respiratory journal,263,1

This single-center, a prospective-survey study was enrolled consecutively 468 patients aged 13 years and older. The patients were asked about their attitudes towards teledermatology. After the dermatological examinations, the diagnosis and management of the diseases, and classification of diseases according to lesion locations were recorded. The physician’s and the patient’s opinions on whether it was possible to manage properly the current medical condition through teledermatology were recorded. The patients stated that 81.2% have been keen to use teledermatology for any complaints during the pandemic. 53.7% of the patients who are positive to use teledermatology expressed that they would never use this method unless it is fully reimbursed. Although it was thought that 49.8% of the current complaints according to the patients and 56.6% to the dermatologists could be resolved appropriately by teledermatology, for 24.8% either the patient’s or the physician’s opinion was contrary. Being woman, high-income level, and the presence of facial dermatosis favorably affected the patients’ and physicians’ evaluations regarding the suitability of the complaint to teledermatology. Factors such as low education level, insufficient technical skills to be examined alone, and the necessity of undressing for examination caused patients to consider teledermatology unsuitable for their current complaints. Priority should be given to the development of an appropriate reimbursement system and reducing potential medicolegal risks to encourage patients to participate in high-quality teledermatology.

In this work, we focus on an important nBSS instance, known as hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. HU is a matrix factorization problem aimed at factoring the so-called endmember matrix, holding the material hyperspectral signatures, and the abundance matrix, holding the material fractions at each image pixel. The hyperspectral signatures are usually highly correlated, leading to a fast decay of the singular values (and, hence, high condition number) of the endmember matrix, so HU often introduces an ill-conditioned nBSS scenario. We introduce a new theoretical framework to attack such tough scenarios via the John ellipsoid (JE) in functional analysis. The idea is to identify the maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the data convex hull, followed by affinely mapping such ellipsoid into a Euclidean ball. By applying the same affine mapping to the data mixtures, we prove that the endmember matrix associated with the mapped data has condition number 1, the lowest possible, and that these (preconditioned) endmembers form a regular simplex. Exploiting this regular structure, we design a novel nBSS criterion with a provable identifiability guarantee and devise an algorithm to realize the criterion. Moreover, for the first time, the optimization problem for computing JE is exactly solved for a large-scale instance; our solver employs a split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm with all proximal operators solved by closed-form solutions. The competitiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations and real data experiments.","Lin, Chia-Hsiang; Bioucas-Dias, Jose M",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,263,1

Of these, 13 patients were women (86.7%) with a mean age of 41.4 years (range 22-61) and mean BMI of 43.2 kg/m2 (range 34.8-57.1). The leaks occurred after 7.4 days (±2.3) postoperatively. Only one gastric leak was recorded for the last 800 cases in which absorbable staple line reinforcement was used. Mean intra-hospital cost was 34398 € (range 7543-91,632 €). Prolonged hospitalization in ICU accounted for the majority of hospital costs (58.9%). Mean additional outpatient costs for leaks were 41,284 € (range 14,148-75,684€). CONCLUSIONS Leaks after LSG are an expensive complication. It is therefore important to take all necessary measures to reduce their incidence. Our data should be considered when analyzing the cost effectiveness of staple line reinforcement usage.","Nedelcu, Marius; Manos, Thierry; Gagner, Michel; Eddbali, Imane; Ahmed, Ahmed; Noel, Patrick",Surgical endoscopy,263,22

DESIGN Double-blinded, prospective, interventional study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS A population of 47 consecutive male cats with UO not associated with urinary tract calculi >2 mm in diameter. INTERVENTIONS Cats were randomized to receive either prazosin (0.25 mg/cat PO q 12 h, n = 27) or placebo (n = 20) for 1 month following UO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Cats were monitored for rUO, severity of lower urinary tract signs, and medication adverse effects during hospitalization and through weekly conversations with the owner during the 1- month study period and once more at 6 months following discharge. There was no difference in the rUO rate among cats that received prazosin or placebo prior to hospital discharge (2/26 (7%) versus 1/19 (5%), P = 1.00), during the 1- month medication period (4/26 (15%) versus 3/18 (17%), P = 0.776), or at 6 months following treatment for UO (7/19 (37%) versus 4/13 (31%), P = 0.811). There was no difference in the severity of lower urinary tract signs reported by the owners at the 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-week follow-up periods among the cats in either group (P = 0.62, 0.68, 0.33, 1.00, respectively). Reported adverse effects from prazosin administration included lethargy, ptyalism, diarrhea, anorexia, and malodorous stool. CONCLUSIONS Although our study results failed to find a difference in the incidence of rUO and severity of lower urinary tract signs among cats receiving prazosin and those receiving placebo, these study results should be interpreted cautiously as our study was underpowered to identify such differences. Larger placebo-controlled, prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of prazosin in prevention of rUO.","Reineke, Erica L; Thomas, Emily K; Syring, Rebecca S; Savini, Jennifer; Drobatz, Kenneth J",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,263,5

MATERIAL AND METHODS Design: Retrospective cohort analysis. Design classification: Canadian Task Force Classification II-2. SETTING Tertiary-care university-based teaching hospital and academic affiliated private hospital. PATIENTS All consecutive patients who underwent for TLH between January 2014 and June 2017. All operations were performed by two expert endoscopic surgeons using one of the following uterine manipulators depending on surgeon preferences: Clermont-Ferrand (CF) or Vectec (VT) MAUT60. Patients were excluded if additional surgeries such as urogynecological procedures were performed, TLH was converted to laparotomy prior to colpotomy, and when their operation records could not be obtained. A total of 169 patients were added to final analysis. Operation time, colpotomy time and the subjective performance of manipulators such as movement of the uterus, visualization of the vaginal fornices, and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were evaluated by watching un-edited operation videos. RESULTS A total of 169 patients (83 patients in CF group; 86 patients in VT group) were included in the final analysis. Patients' baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Operation time and time required for colpotomy were significantly shorter in the VT group. Lateral movements of the manipulators and elevation of the uterus were better with VT compared to CF (p = .001 for both). Compared to the CF, VT was superior for visualization of the vaginal fornices (p = .004) and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum (p < .001). Both surgeons had perfect agreement on the performance grading of manipulators (p < .001, Kappa values were between 0.86-0.92). There was no difference between groups in estimated blood loss and duration of hospital stay. Reinsertion or the need to change the manipulator was not required in either group. No pelvic or vaginal abscess, cuff cellulitis, dehiscence, or hematoma formations were noted. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic hysterectomy assisted with the VT uterine manipulator is associated with shorter operation and colpotomy time. Furthermore, the movements of uterus, visualization of the vaginal fornices, and maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were significantly better with VT compared to the CF manipulator.","Misirlioglu, Selim; Boza, Aysen; Urman, Bulent; Taskiran, Cagatay",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,263,1

The effectiveness of this intervention has not been established in a natural setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hand disinfection on RV infection and RV-associated common cold illness in a natural setting. METHODS A controlled clinical trial was done in young adult volunteers during 9 weeks of the fall 2009 RV season. Volunteers were randomized to either an antiviral hand treatment containing 2% citric acid and 2% malic acid in 62% ethanol (n = 116) or to a no-treatment control group (n = 96). The hand treatment was applied every 3 hours while the subjects were awake. All volunteers kept a daily diary of symptoms and had a nasal lavage for polymerase chain reaction once each week and 2 additional lavages around the time of each common cold illness. The primary endpoint was the number of RV-associated illnesses. The incidence of RV infection and of common cold illnesses were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS The hand treatment did not significantly reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses. The total number of common cold illnesses was significantly reduced in the intent-to-treat analysis, but this effect was not seen in the per protocol analysis.

The association of OSA with increased perioperative risk has raised the question of whether patients with OSA are at higher risk for opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) compared to the general population. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize current evidence with respect to perioperative OIRD, changes in sleep-disordered breathing, and alterations in pain and opioid sensitivity in patients with OSA. A systematic literature search of studies published between 1946 and October 2017 was performed utilizing the following databases: Medline, ePub Ahead of Print/Medline In-process, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed-NOT-Medline and ClinicalTrials.Gov. Of 4321 initial studies, 40 met the inclusion criteria. The Oxford level of evidence was assessed. Overall, high-quality evidence on the comparative impact of acute opioid analgesia in OSA versus non-OSA patients is lacking. The current body of evidence is burdened by significant limitations including risk of bias and large heterogeneity among studies with regard to OSA severity, perioperative settings, outcome definitions, and the presence or absence of various perioperative drivers. These factors complicate an accurate interpretation and robust analysis of the true complication risk. Nevertheless, there is some consistency among studies with regard to a detrimental effect of opioids in the presence of OSA. Notably, the initial 24 hours after opioid administration appear to be most critical with regard to life-threatening OIRD. Further, OSA-related increased pain perception and enhanced opioid sensitivity could predispose patients with OSA to a higher risk for OIRD without overdosing. While high-quality evidence is needed, retrospective analyses indicate that critical, life-threatening OIRD may be preventable with a more cautious approach to opioid use, including adequate monitoring.","Cozowicz, Crispiana; Chung, Frances; Doufas, Anthony G; Nagappa, Mahesh; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Anesthesia and analgesia,263,6

Menkes disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7A gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type Atpase. To develop therapeutic approaches in affected patients, we have identified a zebrafish model of Menkes disease termed calamity that results from splicing defects in the zebrafish orthologue of the ATP7A gene. Embryonic-recessive lethal mutants have impaired copper homeostasis that results in absent melanin pigmentation, impaired notochord formation, and hindbrain neurodegeneration. In this current study, we have attempted to rescue these striking phenotypic alterations by using a series of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides directed against the splice-site junctions of two mutant calamity alleles. Our findings reveal a robust and complete correction of the copper-deficient defects of calamity in association with the generation of the WT Menkes protein in all rescued mutants. Interestingly, a quantitative analysis of atp7a-specific transcripts suggests that competitive translational regulation may account for the synthesis of WT protein in these embryos. This in vivo correction of Menkes disease through the rescue of aberrant splicing may provide therapeutic options in this fatal disease and illustrates the potential for zebrafish models of human genetic disease in the development of treatments based on the principles of interactions of synthetic oligonucleotide analogues with mRNA.","Madsen, Erik C; Morcos, Paul A; Mendelsohn, Bryce A; Gitlin, Jonathan D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,263,1

We wondered whether miR-30b could promote primary sensory neuron (PSN) axon growth in inhibitory microenvironment. The neurite growth was promoted by miR-30b agomir and inhibited by antagomir. MiR-30b targeted and degraded sema3A mRNA. MiR-30b regulated the formation of sema3A-NRP-1-PlexinA1 complex via targeting sema3A. The neurite length was induced by the miR-30b agomir, and the application of sema3A protein could reverse the effect of agomir. GTP-RhoA and ROCK expression were down-regulated by miR-30b. Neurite outgrowth that inhibited by sema3A and the miR-30b antagomir was increased by Y-27632. Agomir promoted neurite growth in NogoA inhibitory conditions, which indicated miR-30b could both enhance neuronal intrinsic regenerative ability and promote neurite growth against inhibitory microenvironment via Sema3A/NRP-1/PlexinA1/RhoA/ROCK axis. The agomir could also regulate Sema3A/NRP-1/PlexinA1/RhoA/ROCK axis in vivo and restore spinal cord sensory conductive function.

The range of illness severity among children is variable. This study aims to assess the characteristics of newborns born to SARS-CoV-2-positive women compared with those mothers who tested negative. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study performed at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in New York City from March to May 2020. Electronic medical records of mother-baby dyads were reviewed. RESULTS Seventy-nine mothers tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included, out of which 18.98% of mothers tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. We found a significant association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 status. We observed a significant association between newborns of SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers regarding skin-to-skin contact (p < 0.001). Both groups showed significant differences regarding isolation (p < 0.001). Interestingly, regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in newborns, only one newborn tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and was unstable in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). With the multivariable logistic regression model, babies of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers were three times as likely to have desaturations in comparison to newborns from negative mothers. Also, newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were four times more likely to have poor feeding, compared with newborns of SARS-CoV-2-negative mothers. Finally, babies of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were ten times more likely to be symptomatic at the 2-week follow-up. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has caused major morbidity and mortality worldwide. Neonates born to mothers with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 are most of the time asymptomatic. However, neonatal critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 is still a possibility; thus, isolation precautions (such as avoiding skin-to-skin contact and direct breastfeeding) and vertical transmission should be studied thoroughly. In addition, testing these newborns by nasopharyngeal swab at least at 24 hours after birth and monitoring them for the development of symptoms for 14 days after birth is needed. KEY POINTS · For SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers, reducing transmission of infection to newborns is crucial.. · Newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers are usually asymptomatic and may not be easily infected.. · Critical illness in the newborn may still happen, so monitoring is needed..","Farghaly, Mohsen A A; Kupferman, Fernanda; Castillo, Fiorella; Kim, Roger M",American journal of perinatology,263,1

To explore the effects of message framing tailored to specific audiences, we investigated relationships between one form of cultural cognition-political ideology-and perceptions about the zoonotic origins of the COVID-19 pandemic using a nationally representative Qualtrics XM panel (n = 1,554) during August 2020. First, we examined differences in attitudes towards science (in general) and COVID-19 (specifically) based on political ideology. We found that, compared to conservatives and moderates, liberals trusted science more, were less skeptical of science, perceived greater risk from COVID-19, were more likely to believe in a wildlife origin of COVID-19, and were more likely to support restrictions on wildlife trade. Second, we examined the influence of cultural framing on the perceived validity of science related to COVID-19. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) a technocratic framing that highlighted feats of human ingenuity to overcome zoonoses;2) a regulatory framing that highlighted regulations and expansions of protected areas for wildlife as a means to prevent zoonoses, and 3) a control article about traffic lights with no cultural framing. After reading the initial framing article, all three groups read the same fictional, yet factually accurate, 'Nature Science study' generated by the authors. An OLS regression model revealed a significant interaction between the technocratic framing and political ideology. Relative to the control group, the technocratic framing slightly increased perceived validity of the Nature Science study for conservatives, significantly lowered perceived validity for liberals, and had no impact on moderates. We did not detect any significant interaction between framing and political ideology for the regulatory framing. Findings of this study highlight the need to account for cultural cognitions when communicating about COVID-19 and other zoonotic diseases. Communication strategies carefully designed to resonate with ideologically diverse audiences may ultimately lead to bipartisan support for actions required to promote ""One Health"" approaches that reduce the impacts of zoonoses on human and environmental health.","Beall, J.

With limited institutional and departmental support, the GSIs struggled to transform their face-to-face assessments to leverage technology but leaned on their professional judgment to prioritize traditional discussion and participation structures. Findings inform our understanding of how universities might prioritize professional learning networks on online teaching at differing institutional levels to increase GSIs' access to online teaching information and knowledgeable role models.","Byrne, Virginia L.; Hogan, Erin Dhingra Neil Anthony Monica Gannon Colleen",Distance Education,263,16

Here we tested 411 sequential plasma samples collected up to 480 days post symptoms onset (d.a.o) from 214 convalescents of COVID-19 across clinical spectrum without re-exposure history after recovery and vaccination of SARS-CoV-2, using authentic SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization (MN) assays. COVID-19 convalescents free of re-exposure and vaccination could maintain relatively stable anti-RBD IgG and MN titers during 400~480 d.a.o after the peak at around 120 d.a.o and the subsequent decrease. Undetectable neutralizing activity started to occur in mild and asymptomatic infections during 330 to 480 d.a.o with an overall rate of 14.29% and up to 50% for the asymptomatic infections. Significant decline in MN titers was found in 91.67% COVID-19 convalescents with [≥] 50% decrease in MN titers when comparing the available peak and current MN titers ([≥] 300 d.a.o). Antibody-dependent immunity could also provide protection against most of circulating variants after one year, while significantly decreased neutralizing activities against the Beta, Delta and Lambda variants were found in most of individuals. In summary, our results indicated that neutralizing antibody responses could last at least 480 days in most COVID-19 convalescents despite of the obvious decline of neutralizing activity, while the up to 50% undetectable neutralizing activity in the asymptomatic infections is of great concern.","Yang, Y.; Yang, M.; Peng, Y.; Liang, Y.; Wei, J.; Xing, L.; Guo, L.; Li, X.; Li, J.; Wang, J.; Li, M.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, M.; Wang, F.; Shi, Y.; Yuan, J.; Liu, Y.",,263,25

This article discusses the inclusion of features in the webgis to ensure that their activities can be promoted in a totally asynchronous way, especially when they aim at popular participation. The discussion was developed within the Geodesign Brazil project, which promoted 12 similar workshops, between March and April 2021, each in a metropolitan region of Brazilian capitals. The project focused on the use of Geodesign supported by Giscolab (Brazilian online platform for Geodesign) to identify problems and create territorial proposals on 10 themes (water infrastructure, agriculture, green infrastructure, energy infrastructure, transport infrastructure, industry and commerce, institutional, residential, tourism and culture, carbon storage). Specifically, this article reports the experience that took place in the Recife metropolitan region’s workshop, capital of Pernambuco, state of Northeast Brazil. Since it was decided to apply asynchronous dynamics, adjustments and additions of resources were necessary to make it viable, mostly to ensure users’ interest, participation and linkage to the project. The asynchronous mode in webgis is a challenge, as it requires resources for greater clarity in the definition of activities;forms of feedback and personification of users’ paths and to incentivize the users to complete the activities proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","PortoCarreiro, P.; Trinta, P.

This study determines the volatility spillovers in these two asset classes and the performance of bivariate portfolios based on net pairwise spillovers. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses two Islamic and four conventional gold-backed cryptocurrencies and gold as variables. GJR-GARCH method under corrected DCC (cDCC) of Aielli (2013) evaluates the dynamic connectedness. Additionally, the spillovers are created using the dynamic connectedness of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). A network-based spillover of Diebold and Yılmaz, (2014) is also made. A dynamic optimal weights strategy optimized with DCC-t-Copula determines bivariate portfolios’ performances. In general, there are 21 bivariate portfolios. Findings: The outbreak of COVID-19 increases the dynamic connectedness of gold and gold-backed cryptocurrencies, which indicates a contagion effect. The results show that gold is the net volatility receiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a portfolio composed of gold and gold-backed cryptocurrency provides high profitability performance but zero hedge effectiveness under optimal weights strategy. Practical implications: According to bivariate portfolios based on net pairwise spillovers, gold-backed cryptocurrencies' investors should not add gold to their portfolio during the pandemic because it is a net receiver of risk from the cryptocurrencies. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper to create bivariate portfolios composed of gold-backed cryptocurrencies and their underlying asset using DCC-t-Copula. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nugroho, B.

Moreover, in large countries, these consequences can vary from region to region. Therefore, authorities and experts lack the models to predict these various impacts at the regional level. This paper presents deep neural network models to do a mid-term forecast of the COVID-19 effect in the Russian regions. The models are based on the various recurrent and sliding-window architectures and utilize the attention mechanism to consider the indicators of the neighbor regions. These models are trained on various data, including daily cases and deaths, the diseased age structure, transport availability of the regions, and the unemployment rate. The experimental evaluation of the models shows that the demographic and healthcare indicators can significantly improve mid-term economic impact prediction accuracy. We also revealed that the neighboring regions' data helps predict the pandemic's healthcare and demographical impact.

As one of the first pilot cities of waste classification in China, Hangzhou took the lead in promoting the classification and recycling of rural domestic waste. Based on the probability sampling procedure, this study focuses on the influencing factors of residents’ awareness and behaviors toward RDWC in Hangzhou rural areas. The results of the questionnaire survey show that the perception of the importance of RDWC is weak in rural areas of China. Moreover, regression analyses show that the public’s RDWC awareness is positively influenced by the cleanliness of waste rooms, age, and educational level. And their RDWC behaviors are negatively influenced by human supervision but positively influenced by the attitude to waste classification, satisfaction with the situation of RDWC and environment. Besides, exploring the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the waste classification performance shows cities with better waste classification performance have fewer confirmed cases. These results imply that the proper waste classification methods and supporting infrastructure facilities could be fitted to other rural areas. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

Objective: The present study was designed aiming to evaluate electrocardiographic changes and their correlation with the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This Prospective cohort study was carried out on COVID-19 cases admitted to the emergency department of an educational hospital, during late February and March 2020. Electrocardiographic characteristics of patients and their association with in-hospital mortality were investigated. Results: One hundred and nineteen cases with the mean age of 60.52±13.45 (range: 29-89) years were studied (65.5% male). Dysrhythmia was detected in 22 (18.4%) cases. T-wave inversion (28.6%), pulmonale P-wave (19.3%), left axis deviation (19.3%), and ST-segment depression (16.8%) were among the most frequently detected electrocardiographic abnormalities, respectively. Twelve (10.1%) cases died. There was a significant correlation between in-hospital mortality and history of diabetes mellitus (p=0.007), quick SOFA score > 2 (p<0.0001), premature ventricular contraction (PVC) (p=0.003), left axis deviation (LAD) (p=0.039), pulmonale P-wave (p<0.001), biphasic P-wave (p<0.001), inverted T-wave (p=0.002), ST-depression (p=0.027), and atrioventricular (AV) node block (p=0.002). Multivariate cox regression showed that history of diabetes mellitus, and presence of PVC and pulmonale P-wave were independent prognostic factors of mortality. Conclusions: Based on the findings of the present study, 18.4% of COVID-19 patients had presented with some kind of dysrhythmia and in addition to history of diabetes, presence of PVC and pulmonale P-wave were among the independent prognostic factors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Pishgahi, M.; Yousefifard, M.; Safari, S.; Ghorbanpouryami, F.",Frontiers in Emergency Medicine,263,2

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) represents a clinical opportunity against MBM; however, the MBM tumor microenvironment (TME) has not been fully elucidated in the context of ICI. To dissect unique MBM-TME elements and correlates of MBM-ICI response, we collected 32 fresh MBM and performed single cell RNA sequencing of the MBM-TME and T cell receptor clonotyping on T cells from MBM and matched blood and extracranial lesions. We observed myeloid phenotypic heterogeneity, most notably multiple distinct neutrophil states including an IL-8 expressing population that correlated with malignant cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, we observe significant relationships between intracranial T cell phenotypes and the distribution of T cell clonotypes intracranially and peripherally. We found that the phenotype, clonotype, and overall number of MBM-infiltrating T cells were associated with response to ICI, suggesting that ICI-responsive MBMs interact with peripheral blood in a manner similar to extracranial lesions.

Hence, it is crucial to monitor and ensure that people are keeping a safe distance in densely populated areas. Current human distance measuring systems rely on sensors to achieving such a task. However, the sensors that are handed out might act as a medium for the virus to spread. In this paper, a stereo vision enabled contactless human distance measuring system is presented. The developed system uses a stereo camera to detect people and measure the distance between each person. The system is capable of measuring the distance between multiple people with a precision of around 10cm in real-time (15FPS). Depending on the social distancing rules, the system can send out warnings or alerts if the distance between two people is smaller than the threshold value. © 2021 IEEE.","Ziran, H.; Dahnoun, N.","10th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing, MECO 2021",263,1

In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group.","Grundel, S. M.; Heyder, S.; Hotz, T.; Ritschel, T. K.

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversion in students and staff when secondary schools reopened in March 2021. Methods Public Health England initiated SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in 18 secondary schools across six regions in September 2020. Participants provided nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term and at the start of the spring term (March 2021). Findings In March 2021, 1895 participants (1100 students, 795 staff) were tested; 5.6% (61/1094) students and 4.4% (35/792) staff had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 2020 and March 2021. Nucleoprotein antibody seroprevalence was 36.3% (370/1018) in students and 31.9% (245/769) in staff, while spike protein antibody prevalence was 39.5% (402/1018) and 59.8% (459/769), respectively, similar to regional community seroprevalence. Between December 2020 and March 2021 (median 15.9 weeks), 14.8% (97/656; 95% CI: 12.2-17.7) students and 10.0% (59/590; 95% CI: 7.7-12.7) staff seroconverted.

Faculty members' pedagogical experiences were examined by following the approach of the technology acceptance model (TAM) framework presented by Davis in 1986 and 1989. Background The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected educational activities and disrupted the traditional norms of education at colleges and universities in the world, and, as a result, teaching and learning have shifted to online. Accordingly, the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic has unexpectedly forced educators and educational leaders to analyze pedagogical measures to offer quality education to students and make changes to their curriculum and instruction. Methodology This study used a mixed-method research design with closed-ended surveys and interviews. The researchers distributed online questionnaires and conducted phone call interviews, followed by simple random sampling approach to strengthen data collection and analysis. The research data were analyzed through descriptive statistical tests, including mean, standard deviation, and Pearson correlation, and thematic analysis. Contribution By examining the challenges faculty members face with online teaching prac tices, this study contributes to the literature knowledge to advance the Practical-Knowledge gap (the lack of empirical studies in the context of practice and theoretical perspective) by knowing faculty members' experiences and attitudes regarding online teaching in public universities in Karachi, Pakistan. The adopted framework of the technology acceptance model provides confirmation of reliability in the context of higher education institutions, which can help explore pedagogical challenges and practices of teachers who teach online in other provinces in Pakistan, cultures, and countries. This study provides suggestions to online teachers in Pakistan to sort out their challenges. Findings The findings highlight a favorable attitude of faculty members' usage of vir tual platforms for teaching. Likewise, faculty members encountered several challenges that caused restrictions in accomplishing competent teaching and learning. Furthermore, faculty members lacked sound experience in conducting online classes and were not given adequate technical assistance or ICT infrastructure to cope with the technical challenges. Recommendations It is recommended by this study that teachers should be given adequate profor Practitioners fessional development opportunities to develop technical and ICT infra structure competencies to facilitate them to successfully teach online. Recommendations Another study should be conducted at the national level to reinforce the un-for Researchers derstanding and generalization of this study's results. Furthermore, this study assessed public universities faculty members' experiences through selfreported surveys and interviews. However, future researchers should employ other means and methods of examination such as private universities, public universities, primary schools, middle schools, secondary schools, and observations or focus group discussions to broaden the understanding of online teaching practices and challenges in Pakistan. Impact on Society By examining faculty members' experiences and challenges of teaching online, this study will help educators and educational leaders to raise the quality of online teaching in Pakistan by knowing the appropriate solutions and recommendations. Future Research This study examined the adoption of three ICT indicators through pedagogical practices such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude to use. For future studies, researchers and practitioners should evaluate other indicators such as students' learning outcomes. © 2021.

Several studies report on the importance of peoples’ sense of coherence (SOC) or control over work for dealing with burnout. SOC implicates a stress-coping capacity involving comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. However, little is known on how SOC cognitively modulates burnout experiences.ObjectivesTo investigate neurocognitive mechanisms of SOC and burnout in medical professionals.MethodsForty-one registered nurses were enrolled. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured resting-state brain activity. We identified brain regions associated with SOC and burnout levels by correlating these trait scores to regional fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). Subsequently, we investigated whether participants’ levels of SOC impacted their fALFF-burnout association by mediation analysis.ResultsSOC and depersonalization dimension of burnout were negatively correlated (p < 0.01). The fALFF in the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) correlated positively with SOC scores, and negatively with depersonalization dimension of burnout (p < 0.05). Furthermore, SOC mediated the negative relationship between DLPFC activity and burnout severity (p < 0.05).ConclusionsOur data suggested that SOC alleviates burnout experience and supports prefrontal activity to prompt cognitive control;they may facilitate flexible shifting of perspective and optimistic reappraisal of work-stress. In effect, workplace-stressors may be acknowledged as being more meaningful than distressing. Without sufficient SOC, frequent exposures to stressors can lead to maladaptive coping to exhibit emotional numbing or depersonalization.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Tei, S.; Fujino, J.",European Psychiatry,263,24
168117,168117,168117,Evidence for Complex Fixed Points in Pandemic Data,14.725534,3.2903235,2021,"Background: The androgen theory on COVID-19 is based on the fact that males, in particular when affected by androgenetic alopecia, and females with hyperandrogenic states are more severely affected by COVID-19, while chronic users of antiandrogens experiment lower rates of COVID-19 complications. The theory finds plausibility on the androgen-mediated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS-2), a key protein for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We demonstrated reduction of hospitalization rate using a potent non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), proxalutamide, in both females and males COVID-19 outpatients. In this joint exploratory analysis, we aimed to demonstrate whether the efficacy of proxalutamide on mild-to-moderate COVID-19 could be justified by improvements in inflammatory, immunologic, and thrombogenic responses. Materials and methods: This is a joint post-hoc analysis of two double-blind, placebo-controlled two-arm randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on proxalutamide 200mg/day for seven days for female and male COVID-19 outpatients, respectively, compared to standard of care (SOC), of hematocrit, neutrophils lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (usCRP) lactate 1-hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1hESR), total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), oxygen saturation and heart rate measured on days 0, 1 and 7. Results: A total of 445 subjects were enrolled (268 males and 177 females) between October 21th 2020 and February 28th 2021, with similar baseline characteristics. Neutrophils were lower in proxalutamide group in Day 1 (p = 0.005) and Day 7 (p < 0.0001). Lymphocytes were higher in the proxalutamide group in Day 7 (p = 0.0001). Eosinophils were higher in the proxalutamide arm in Day 1 (p = 0.04) and Day 7 (p < 0.00010. In Day 7, platelets were higher in proxalutamide arm (p = 0.03). Ferritin levels were lower in proxalutamide arm in Day 7 (p = 0.03) Fibrinogen levels were lower in proxalutamide group in Days 1 and 7 (p < 0.0001 for both days). D-dimer levels were lower in proxalutamide group in Days 1 and 7 (p < 0.0001 for both days). UsCRP levels were reduced in proxalutamide group in Day 7 (p < 0.0001). 1hESR) was reduced in proxalutamide arm in Day 1 (p = 0.0009) and Day 7 (p < 0.0001). In males, testosterone levels were higher in proxalutamide group in Day 1 (p = 0.048) and Day 7 (p = 0.0001). In females, testosterone levels were higher in proxalutamide group in Day 7 (p = 0.018), and estradiol levels were higher in proxalutamide arm in Day 1 (p = 0.044). Oxygen saturation was higher in proxalutamide in Day 1 (p = 0.0006) and Day 7 (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The substantial improvements observed in immunologic, inflammatory, thrombotic and oxygen markers with proxalutamide may support the reduction of hospitalization rate observed in both females and males with COVID-19 using proxalutamide, compared to standard of care.","Cadegiani, F.

Consequently, it has forced the countries to follow immediate strategies to alleviate this crisis's impacts. The lockdown and social distance were the most applied precautionary procedures. This situation has devastating consequences for both economic and social life. The construction sector is affected by this temporary paralysis, especially the public-private partnerships (PPP) infrastructure projects with a long-term contract and different stakeholders. Some earlier researches have analyzed the consequences and suggested options to alleviate the negative impacts, but potential positive risks are still spotting. Therefore, there is a need to follow proactive behavior to maximize the potentiality of opportunities. This research is exploring the positive risks for PPP infrastructure projects during COVID 19. This objective has been attained by a literature survey for allocated risks for PPP projects, factors affecting successful PPP projects, and the current practices as a response strategy to COVID -19. The research findings will contribute to building a known base of resilience plans for pandemic through two scenarios of negative and positive impacts to support PPP projects with leading practices. The revealed opportunities have been revealed based on exploring the common concepts between four main areas: 1) Positive Impacts of COVID-19, 2) Principles of resilient infrastructure, 3) Critical success factors of PPP projects, and 4) Current practices to respond to COVID-19. It was found that besides the tremendous burden on project stakeholders, users, the private corporate sector, and the public sector for the short and long term, some opportunities could be attained for PPP infrastructure projects. These revealed opportunities have been summarized as follows: 1) The need for implementing the resilience strategy and long term thinking, 2) Available time for maintenance work and updating operating systems for completed projects, 3) Priority to support and invest in innovative smart infrastructure projects that adopt artificial intelligence and smart systems that reduce human resource interferences and control the social distance, and 4) exploring the need to simplify or remedy the procurement processes of PPP. The concluded opportunities will help investors and public partners react positively during the pandemic and reduce the negative impacts and maximize positive impacts. This attitude will help PPP projects to survive in order to complete successfully after the crisis and integrate resilience into infrastructure projects. © 2021 IEEE.","Hasan, S.; Elwakil, E.; Hegab, M.","8th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability, SusTech 2021",263,5

We conducted this study to describe the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens, their potential interactions and risk factors for possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms (LRTI) among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj. Pilgrims from Marseille who were participating in the Hajj were recruited. Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. Polymicrobial carriage was observed in 73.8% samples. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22, 95%CI [2.04-19.01]). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria. Author summary Despite the recommendation to take individual preventive measures to prevent respiratory tract infections, these infections remain common among Hajj pilgrims. Respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj are usually studied individually, although in their natural environment they often compete or coexist with multiple microbial species. A better understanding of polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx among Hajj pilgrims is important. Our study describes the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens and their potential interactions among pilgrims during the Hajj. We found that polymicrobial carriage was observed in most individuals and that some pathogens associated positively while other did not. Some pathogen associations correlated with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections.","Hoang, Van-Thuan; Dao, Thi-Loi; Ly, Tran Duc Anh; Belhouchat, Khadidja; Chaht, Kamel Larbi; Gaudart, Jean; Mrenda, Bakridine Mmadi; Drali, Tassadit; Yezli, Saber; Alotaibi, Badriah; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier; Parola, Philippe; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Gautret, Philippe",bioRxiv,263,1

Design Retrospective review of appointments scheduled over a 11-week period between March 17th and May 29th, 2020, in the MIGS division of an academic obstetrics and gynecology department. During this period, the office was closed except for emergency visits due to the restrictions secondary to COVID-19. Successful conversion from in-person to televisits was defined as appointments rescheduled within 2 months of the initial in-person visit. Setting N/A. Patients or Participants All patients scheduled for in-person visits during this time were included. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were seen emergently in person or newly scheduled as a televisit. Interventions N/A. Measurements and Main Results Data extracted included age, race/ethnicity, primary language, insurance type, appointment type, reason for visit, and time to rescheduled visit. 132 patients were originally scheduled during 11 weeks. 32 (24.2%) appointments were newly scheduled televisits and 20 (15.2%) were emergent in-person visits, leaving 87 visits. 21 (24%) appointments were rescheduled as televisits; 14 (66.7%) via telephone and 7 (33.3)% of these as video. There were no significant differences between age, race, primary language. insurance type, appointment type and the reason seen between the converted and non-converted groups. Median time to rescheduled appointments was sooner in successful conversions (16 days (-7 to 73) versus 96 days (8-234), p<.001). Conclusion Conversion to televisits was reasonable for a telemedicine naïve practice, despite having an overall low conversion rate to televisits. Utilizing telemedicine allowed patients to receive care sooner when compared to the non-converted group. The lack of difference in demographic/clinical factors between the two groups provides hope that technology can be utilized by diverse groups of MIGS patients.","Toaff, M.

We tested a novel approach in the Florida panther, hypothesizing that apathogenic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) transmission could predict transmission dynamics for pathogenic feline leukemia virus (FeLV). We derived a transmission network using FIV whole genome sequences, and used exponential random graph models to determine drivers structuring this network. We used these drivers to predict FeLV transmission pathways among panthers and compared predicted outbreak dynamics against empirical FeLV outbreak data. FIV transmission was primarily driven by panther age class and distances between panther home range centroids. Prospective FIV-based modeling predicted FeLV dynamics at least as well as simpler, often retrospective approaches, with evidence that FIV-based predictions captured the spatial structuring of the observed FeLV outbreak. Our finding that an apathogenic agent can predict transmission of an analogously transmitted pathogen is an innovative approach that warrants testing in other host-pathogen systems to determine generalizability. Use of such apathogenic agents holds promise for improving predictions of pathogen transmission in novel host populations, and could thereby provide new strategies for proactive pathogen management in human and animal systems.","Gilbertson, Marie L.J.; Fountain-Jones, Nicholas M.; Malmberg, Jennifer L.; Gagne, Roderick B.; Lee, Justin S.; Kraberger, Simona; Kechejian, Sarah; Petch, Raegan; Chiu, Elliott; Onorato, Dave; Cunningham, Mark W.; Crooks, Kevin R.; Funk, W.

Here, we show that exposure to a single mild stressful event induces maladaptive memory, which recapitulates all features of PTSD, and is associated with the broad dysfunction of the prefrontal-hippocampo-amygdalar network. Using optogenetics, we demonstrate that prefrontal cortex hyperactivation triggers this PTSD-like memory. Finally, we show that recontextualization of the traumatic event normalizes maladaptive memory in ASD conditions. Overall, this study provides the first direct demonstration that ASD represents a risk factor for PTSD and uncovers new mechanisms that underlie pathological memory formation.","Al Abed, A.S.; Sellami, A.; Marighetto, A.; Desmedt, A.; Dehorter, N.",bioRxiv,263,1

Therefore, early detection of infected people is essential to fight this pandemic and one of the main screening methods is radiological testing. The goal of this study is the usage of chest x-ray images (CXRs) to effectively identify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To achieve an efficient model, we combined three methods named: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), transfer learning, and the focal loss function which is used for imbalanced classes to build 3 binary classifiers, namely COVID-19 vs Normal, COVID-19 vs pneumonia and COVID-19 vs Normal Pneumonia (Normal and Pneumonia). A comparative study has been made between our proposed classifiers with well-known classifiers and provided enhanced results in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision.

With its rapid spread, many cases were reported from other countries resulting in more than 2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Health care workers (HCWs) are the frontline warriors of any outbreak response and as such are exposed to hazards that put them at risk of infections, here with the coronavirus. Aim and Objective: Incidences of morbidity and mortality among HCWs have also been reported in many countries. Despite these isolated reports, a comparative data among the majorly affected countries were not available. In this article, an attempt has been made to review the effect of COVID-19 on the health of the HCWs. Materials and Methods: This is an observational study where data regarding morbidity and mortality among HCWs were collected by online search until April 30, 2020. Data were collected from the World Health Organization website and government and health-care websites. Various online newspaper articles were also checked and relevant information was collected. To evaluate and analyze, a data collection sheet was prepared. Results: In our study, the number of affected HCWs was highest in Spain, followed by Italy, the United States of America, China, and the UK. Till April 2020, the total number of affected HCWs in India although very less, the correlation between infection and death in HCWs due to COVID-19 was found statistically significant. Conclusion: The HCWs being the frontline warriors in the fight against COVID-19, they should be provided with adequate protective measures to minimize morbidity and mortality in them.","Yadav, D.

SARS-CoV-2 shows similarity with SARS-CoV. Previous studies have proven that RH121 and indigo are effective in inhibiting 3CLpro from SARS-CoV, but no research has been done to test the two inhibitors on 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2. This study investigates if RH121 and indigo are still effective in inhibiting 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2, and compares the two inhibitors in terms of their inhibitory efficiency. Method: For the cell-free assay, substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA will be used, and pNA will be released. The absorbance of pNA will be measured using a microplate reader. The cell-based assay will use vero cell lines, vector, plasmid pcDNA3.1-3CLpro-S-Luc, luciferin, and luminometer. The luciferase activity will be tested by Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Possible results: There are seven possible results: (1) RH121 failed to inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV2, but Indigo successfully inhibits 3CLpro from SARS-CoV2. (2) Indigo failed to inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV2, but RH121 successfully inhibits 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2. (3) Both Indigo and RH121 failed to inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2. (4) Indigo has a higher IC50 value than RH121 in cell-based assay, but has a lesser IC50 value than RH121 in cell-free assay. (5) RH121 has a higher IC50 value than Indigo in cell-based assay, but has a lesser IC50 value than Indigo in cell-free assay. (6) Indigo has a higher IC50 value than RH121 in both cell-based assay and cell-free assay. (7) RH121 has a higher IC50 value than Indigo in both cell-based assay and cell-free assay. Conclusion: The result of this study would provide valuable information regarding which inhibitor best inhibits the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 for future trials. Further studies should be done regarding the bioavailability of the two inhibitors and their competitive/uncompetitive nature. The ED50 and TD50 of the two inhibitors should also be investigated in future trials to obtain the therapeutic index and the therapeutic window of RH121 and indigo. © 2021 ACM.","Lan, Y.","11th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Technology, ICBET 2021",263,20

Several of these successful vaccines are based on the adenoviral vector platform. The mass manufacturing of these vaccines poses great challenges, especially in the context of a pandemic where extremely large quantities must be produced quickly at an affordable cost. In this work, two baseline processes for the production of a COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccine, B1 and P1, were designed, simulated and economically evaluated with the aid of the software SuperPro Designer. B1 used a batch cell culture viral production step, with a viral titer of 5 × 1010 viral particles (VP)/mL in both stainless-steel and disposable equipment. P1 used a perfusion cell culture viral production step, with a viral titer of 1 × 1012 VP/mL in exclusively disposable equipment. Both processes were sized to produce 400 M/yr vaccine doses. P1 led to a smaller cost per dose than B1 ($0.15 vs. $0.23) and required a much smaller capital investment ($126 M vs. $299 M). The media and facility-dependent expenses were found to be the main contributors to the operating cost. The results indicate that adenoviral vector vaccines can be practically manufactured at large scale and low cost.","Ferreira, Rafael G.; Gordon, Neal F.; Stock, Rick Petrides Demetri",Processes,263,13

Our measure of self-interest includes objective indicators for and subjective perceptions of individual threat from containment measures in the economic sphere and in the family and health domains. We also analyze whether the role of self-interest changes as the pandemic proceeds in its course. Our results show that self-interest plays a limited role in explaining attitudes about containment measures. More important are broader political predispositions such as trust in institutions, including the government. Attitudes are unrelated to local rates of infection or death. This pattern has remained stable over the course of the pandemic. We discuss the relevance of these findings with respect to the general enforceability of public policies that serve collective goals, such as efforts to limit climate change. Parts of the population may be reluctant to comply with these public policies even if the associated costs to the individual are small.

However, there are concerns regarding insufficient supply of ventilators to handle the impending surge due to the high cost, and slow production and deliveries. Thus, the development of a low-cost portable ventilator becomes essential. The mechanical ventilator requires two main components including an active airbag and its venting control system. We developed a reliable active airbag designed with mechanically tunable 3D origami structures. The 3D origami structure based active airbag demonstrates reliable and reconfigurable characteristics. The active airbag's volume can be tuned by controlling the triangular angles in the 3D origami-folding plates. Moreover, its volumetric ratio before and after compression is around 85%. Also, the rotating behavior of 3D origami tube under the compressive force allows more functionalities in the airbag such as the architectured pressure sensing. The 3D printed origami sensor measures the compressed angle to confirm the accuracy of detected pressure in the ventilator circuit. We achieved accurate delivery of targeted air volume with specific airflow rate by 3D printed reconfigurable origami tubes.","Kim, T. H.; Min, X.; Baker, D.; Lee, W.; Kim, W.

Due to the extraordinary demands of the pandemic, burnout has emerged as a public health crisis that warrants immediate attention to preserve the wellbeing of healthcare staff. At the onset of the pandemic, The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Jefferson, an urban NCI-designated cancer center, translated its support offerings to virtual events. Initially, healthcare providers (HP) sought support by attending patient programs. In response, SKCC initiated virtual programming to support the well-being and needs of the HP team. Methods:Within weeks of the state shutdown due to the pandemic, programs were initiated to address HP self-reported distress: Coping Effectively and Mindfulness Moments Each 30-minute session was facilitated by a licensed psychologist and social worker. Coping Effectively offers strategies from evidence based treatment including Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, to cope with distress and burnout. Mindful Moments draws from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction practices including observing breath and guided meditations. These programs have been offered consistently throughout the pandemic. Schwartz Rounds, geared towards supporting the human side of healthcare, provided 'hot' topic moderated discussions, four of which focused on the pandemic These discussions allow for HP to come together to discuss difficult topics and emotions impacting a variety of professionals. All programming was evaluated with a single question to measure the impact of the session on reducing distress. Each program began and ended with a poll asking, 'How distressed do you currently feel?' Attendees respond on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, in which10 indicated the highest level of distress. Results: Since March 31 , 340 staff have attended Mindful Moments and 236 staff have attended Coping Effectively. From March 2020- February 2021, 382 attendees measured their distress before and after attending a staff program. Schwartz Rounds hosted 471 HP from a variety of disciplines. Participants were asked to complete an evaluation following rounds. 31% of program participants' completed an evaluation form and 89% rated the program exceptional/very good. Conclusions: Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the pivot to virtually create programs to support staff during the pandemic was swift and thoughtful. The increased attendance and the feedback from evaluations are promising indicators of decreasing burnout amongst HP. How Distressed do you Currently Feel? (Average Score scale 1-10).","Lopez, A.

In Mongolia, one in five children needs but do not have access to spectacles. This cost-benefit analysis aims to estimate the net benefits of a children's spectacles reimbursement scheme in Mongolia. Methods: A willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey using the contingent valuation method was administered to rural and urban Mongolia respondents. The survey assessed WTP in additional annual taxes for any child with refractive error to be provided government-subsidised spectacles. Net benefits were then calculated based on mean WTP (i.e. benefit) and cost of spectacles. Results: The survey recruited 50 respondents (mean age 40.2 +/- 9.86 years; 78.0% women; 100% response rate) from rural and urban Mongolia. Mean WTP was US$24.00 +/- 5.15 (95% CI US$22.55 to 25.35). The average cost of a pair of spectacles in Mongolia is US$15.00. Subtracting the average cost of spectacles from mean WTP yielded a mean positive net benefit of US$9.00. Conclusion: A spectacle reimbursement scheme is a potentially cost-effective intervention to address childhood vision impairment due to URE in Mongolia.

As the pandemic continues to evolve, so does our understanding of its implications on ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We sought to describe a single center STEMI experience at one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study which included consecutive suspected STEMI patients from March 1 through August 31, 2019, (Cohort 1) compared to the same time period in 2020 (Cohort 2), at a tertiary referral center in Nassau County, New York. Results: Cohort 2 (n=93) saw a similar number of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) team activations compared to cohort 1 (n=90) (Figure 1). Infection control measures and additional investigation were required to clarify the diagnosis in cohort 2, resulting in longer door-to-balloon times (95.9 minutes vs. 74.4 minutes, p=0.0587). We observed similar inpatient length of stay (LOS) (3.6 days vs. 5.0 days, p=0.0901) and mortality (13.2% vs. 9.2%, p=0.5876). Conclusions: Our single-center study, located at one of the epicenters of the pandemic, demonstrated a similar number of AMI team activations, mimicking the seasonal variability seen in 2019, but with longer door-to-balloon times. Despite this, inpatient LOS and mortality remained unchanged. [Formula presented]","Medranda, G. A.; Brahmbhatt, K.; Alawneh, B.; Marzo, K. P.; Schwartz, R. K.; Green, S.

A psychological intervention for medical staff is the provision of a group where emotions and feelings are shared. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experiences of front-line medical staff about virtual Balint group. Methods: Eight sessions of virtual Balint group were held through Skype. Participants were the frontline medical staff involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The group leader was a psychiatrist and an analytical psychotherapist. The group had two coleaders, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist. They were both experienced conductors who had a background of participation in Balint groups. Finally, eight in-depth semi-structured interviews were performed. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was carried out to analyze the obtained data. Results: Three themes were extracted, including the effects of Balint group, Balint group structure, and virtuality of Balint group. Each theme included several categories, and each category had some codes. Conclusions: Leaders in the Balint group were active and had a supportive role. Some participants did not share their faces, and this made others feel insecure.

While the biomechanical properties of the liver parenchyma (normal liver tissue) are known to affect tumor cell behavior in primary and metastatic tumors, the role of these properties in driving or inhibiting metastatic inception remains poorly understood, as are the longer-term multicellular dynamics. This study adopts a multi-model approach to study the dynamics of tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions during metastatic seeding and growth. We employ a detailed poroviscoelastic (PVE) model of a liver lobule to study how micrometastases disrupt flow and pressure on short time scales. Results from short-time simulations in detailed single hepatic lobules motivate constitutive relations and biological hypotheses for a minimal agent-based model of metastatic growth in centimeter-scale tissue over months-long time scales. After a parameter space investigation, we find that the balance of basic tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions on shorter time scales (adhesion, repulsion, and elastic tissue deformation over minutes) and longer time scales (plastic tissue relaxation over hours) can explain a broad range of behaviors of micrometastases, without the need for complex molecular-scale signaling. These interactions may arrest the growth of micrometastases in a dormant state and prevent newly arriving cancer cells from establishing successful metastatic foci. Moreover, the simulations indicate ways in which dormant tumors could “reawaken” after changes in parenchymal tissue mechanical properties, as may arise during aging or following acute liver illness or injury. We conclude that the proposed modeling approach yields insight into the role of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics in promoting liver metastatic growth, and advances the longer term goal of identifying conditions to clinically arrest and reverse the course of late-stage cancer.","Wang, Yafei; Brodin, Erik; Nishii, Kenichiro; Frieboes, Hermann B.; Mumenthaler, Shannon; Sparks, Jessica L.; Macklin, Paul",bioRxiv,263,20

Research has shown that employees differ in how they desire to be shown appreciation. The purpose of this paper is to examine how working remotely (vs onsite), the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and employees’ age group impacted the ways employees want to be shown appreciation at work.Design/methodology/approachUsing the five Languages of Appreciation as a framework (Chapman and White, 2019), over 200,000 individuals’ results from the Motivating By Appreciation Inventory were compared across various groups. The dependent variable: (Primary Language of Appreciation) was examined in light of three independent variables: work setting (onsite vs remote), timeframe (pre-COVID-19 vs during COVID-19) and age range of the employee.FindingsPreferences for how to be shown appreciation were quite stable across work setting, timeframe and age range, suggesting that one’s preferred ways of being shown appreciation is largely an internal characteristic that is only mildly influenced by external factors. Minor trends were found when comparing various age groups and remote vs onsite employees.Originality/valueUnderstanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees’ desires for appreciation is critical for organizational leaders. With vast numbers of new remote employees in the workforce, understanding how they are similar to and vary from onsite employees is paramount for addressing the needs of all team members.

The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting global markets for agricultural produce, making short-term forecasting highly uncertain. Meanwhile climate-related risk continues for agricultural businesses. Farmers and their accountants need to plan and make estimates about the potential effect of COVID-19 and ongoing climate risks to their natural and financial capital and so they need accounting-integrated biophysical and socio-economic data streams.Design/methodology/approachThis research note reviews the current state of scenario-based planning for COVID-19 and other risks for Australian businesses generally, in addition to planning for farming businesses more specifically. Discussion of the authors’ current research in integrating accounting and farming data for water-related risk caused by climate and other challenges is presented as an analogous case.FindingsReview and analogous case comparison demonstrate the need for farm data to be integrated more efficiently and effectively with accounting data for accurate scenario planning for COVID-19 and other risks, including those posed by climate.Practical implicationsWhile not strangers to the need for scenario analysis, given exposure to ever-increasing natural resource and climate variability, this research note highlights how primary producers and their accountants require increased accounting-integrated farm data and systems to make judgements, assumptions and estimates about the potential effect of COVID-19 and ongoing climate risks to their business.Social implicationsThe sustainability of the agricultural sector is of great relevance to all of us and so the development of tools and resources that can assist food producers in times of ongoing climate pressures and new crises, such as COVID-19, is important. Better understanding of such risks can help farm businesses develop effective strategies which minimise the potential loss of agricultural value resulting in improved flows of greater capital value for society.Originality/valueThrough application to the analogous case of water-related risk and decision-making, the research note demonstrates that linking of biophysical and accounting data streams will be essential for evidence-backed numbers included in scenario plans with enough legitimacy to be interrogated inside and outside of the business. The “best estimate of the directors” is no longer enough in challenging socio-economic and biophysical times ahead for primary producers.","Tingey-Holyoak, Joanne Louise Pisaniello John Dean","Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal",263,2

We use a realistic epidemic model which accounts for progressive stages of infection, stochastic effects and a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. Innovatively, we explicitly include changes in testing capacity over time, as well as the evolving sensitivity of PCR testing at different stages of infection. We conduct rigorous statistical inference using iterative particle filtering to fit the model to the observed patient data and validate this methodology using simulation. We provide estimates for R0 across the entire hospital (2.6) and in individual wards (from 3 to 15), possibly reflecting heterogeneity in contact patterns or control measures.

The effects of the pandemic encourage e-collaboration to accelerate the recovery of tourism. This study explores the opportunities, strategies and barriers to e-collaboration in tourism business activities. Systematic literature studies were carried out by the PRISMA approach and analyzed with the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Meta-analysis results are mapped in a matrix combination of SWOT and Porter’s Diamond Model. This matrix was discussed with experts selected based on their experience in IT-based collaborative activities through FDG. This study’s driving factors are management commitment, culture, trust, citizens, and local community involvement. Inhibiting factors are a lack of IT, the risk of conflict, and particular parties’ domination. Several strategies to increase e-collaboration opportunities are empowering local entrepreneurship, encouraging continuous innovation, and sharing knowledge. Conflict management and increasing trust between members need to be considered to overcome barriers to e-collaboration. This study provides a novel overview of the main issues discussed in previous tourism research regarding the importance of IT to accelerate economic recovery in the face of disruption, such as a pandemic.

Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts.

Bio-NanoThings are generally tiny, non-intrusive, and concealable devices that can be used for in-vivo applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, where the use of artificial devices can be detrimental. Such (nano-scale) devices can be used in various healthcare settings such as continuous health monitoring, targeted drug delivery, and nano-surgeries. These services can also be grouped to form a collaborative network (i.e., nanonetwork), whose performance can potentially be improved when connected to higher bandwidth external networks such as the Internet, say via 5G.

Many of the rapid detection tests currently in use are based on antibodies that bind viral proteins. However, newly appearing virus variants accumulate mutations in their RNA sequence and produce proteins, such as Spike, that may show reduced binding affinity to these diagnostic antibodies, resulting in less reliable tests and in the need for continuous update of the sensing systems. Here we propose a graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) biosensor which exploits the key interaction between the Spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. This interaction is one of the determinants of host infections and indeed recently evolved Spike variants were shown to increase affinity for this receptor. Through extensive computational analyses we show that a chimeric ACE2-Fc construct mimics the ACE2 dimer, normally present on host cells membranes, better than its soluble truncated form. We demonstrate that ACE2-Fc functionalized gFET is effective for in vitro detection of Spike and outperforms the same chip functionalized with either a diagnostic antibody or the soluble ACE2. Our sensor is implemented in a portable, wireless, point-of-care device and successfully detected both alpha and gamma virus variants in patient clinical samples. As incomplete immunization, due to vaccine roll-out, may offer new selective grounds for antibody-escaping virus variants, our biosensor opens to a class of highly sensitive and variant-robust SARS-CoV-2 detection systems.","D'Agostino, M.; Pavoni, E.; Romagnoli, A.; Ardiccioni, C.; Motta, S.; Crippa, P.; Biagetti, G.; Notarstefano, V.; Barocci, S.; Costabile, B.

Molecular dynamics simulation on the S protein with a focus on the function of its N-terminal domains (NTDs) is performed. The study reveals that the NTD acts as a ?wedge? and plays a crucial regulatory role in the conformational changes of the S protein. The complete RBD structural transition is allowed only when the neighboring NTD that typically prohibits the RBD's movements as a wedge detaches and swings away.

Those comments are closely related to people's lives and blend with each other. Novel coronavirus pneumonia affects people's lives, and they publish comments on social networks and media, and the underlying information from social networks and Internet media in turn affects people's attitude to the epidemic and the measures, and strategies taken to fight coronavirus in life. We collect the comments from various social network platforms and network media such as Weibo, WeChat, Chinanews, Sina News, NetEase News, Sohu News, and analyze the overall situation of public opinion on the novel coronavirus pneumonia. We explore the interaction between online public opinion and real life using a variety of algorithms in different stages of the epidemic. We can obtain public attention and key nodes in the dissemination of public opinion by detecting hot events and calculating user's influence. The analysis of information dissemination path is conducive to the rapid propagation of healthy comments, curbing the spread of bad information. Event-specific details and topics are mined from large amounts of comments by thematic clustering and association relationship detecting, which helps to provide technical support for government response measures. The emotional analysis of Internet users' groups helps to guide the direction of public opinion. The situation analysis shows the deep blending and mutual influence between the online public opinion and the real world.","Liu, X.; Zheng, L.; Jia, X. F.; Qi, H. W.; Yu, S.

The research question is: How do the stories of 11 South African musicians explain the role that musicking plays in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic? There have been studies on how music helps in therapeutic and everyday settings, but there has been limited research on the role musicking plays in coping with pandemics. The 11 author-participants in the study have lived through this pandemic, and their stories served as the data. We used a narrative coding scheme to enable co-coding. Our findings are a collaborative interpretation of our analyses and are represented as a fictionalized dialogue. This dialogue revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a range of psychological effects on the participant researchers. Musicking contributed to proactive and reactive coping strategies, including listening to music actively, making music with others virtually and in their homes, finding solidarity through engaging with musical icons, allowing them to connect with others, escape, focus, relax, and find hedonic well-being and hope. Further research will be needed to understand the roles musicking may play in coping with pandemics.","van der Merwe, Liesl Erasmus Ewie Morelli Janelize Potgieter Hetta Modise Julia Viviers Etienne Meyer Joy Engelbrecht Christelle Jacobs Daniel Shongwe Sibusiso Lerumo Kagiso",Psychology of Music,263,16

I argue that these creative responses did two things. First, they demonstrated the rich agency that ordinary people have in shaping and sharing their experience of lonely isolation. Second, through the creative works generated and circulated, a critical lens was placed on the way that the pandemic carried forward the inequalities inherent in modern systems of governance. The article is divided into two main sections: the first looks at a range of creative works made by ordinary people to reconnect them to the social world. The second section looks at the creative works that were explicitly politicized and activist in nature, turning loneliness into a political project.

Modeling CoVID-19 pandemic data became a predictive tool instead of an afterwards analysis. How early CoVID-19 model predictions impacted US Government policies and practices is first reviewed here as an important part of the pandemic history. It spurred independent modeling efforts, such as this, to help develop a better understanding of CoVID-19 spread, and to provide a substitute for the IHME (Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation, U. Washington) 4-month predictions for the expected pandemic evolution, which they had to revise every couple of weeks. Our alternative model, which was developed over the course of several earlier medrxiv.org preprints, is shown here to provide a good description for the entire USA CoVID-19 pandemic to date, covering: (1) the original CoVID-19 wave [3/21/20-6/07/20], (2) the Summer 2020 Resurgence [6/07/20-9/25/20], (3) the large Winter 2020 Resurgence [9/25/20-3/19/21], (4) a small Spring 2021 ""Fourth Wave"", [3/19/21-6/07/21], and (5) the present-day Summer 2021 ""Fifth Wave"" [6/07/21-present], which the USA is now in the midst of.

To this end, many methods and procedures have been proposed to guide the arrangement of the LED sources, as well as to guide the design of ad-hoc lenses. Nevertheless, there are many applications in which it is important to be able to consider other aspects as well as the uniformity of the irradiance.

Methods: The performance of a whole blood interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) release assay (IGRA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was evaluated in COVID-19 convalescents tested serially up to 10 months post-infection and in healthy blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 IGRA was applied in contacts of households with index cases. Freshly collected blood in the lithium heparin tube was left unstimulated, stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool, and stimulated with mitogen. Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of IGRA were 84.5% (153/181; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.0-89.0) and 86.6% (123/142; 95% CI;80.0-91.2), respectively. The sensitivity declined from 100% (16/16; 95% CI 80.6-100) at 0.5-month post-infection to 79.5% (31/39; 95% CI 64.4-89.2) at 10 months post-infection (P<0.01). The IFN-{gamma} response remained relatively robust at 10 months post-infection (3.8 vs. 1.3 IU/mL, respectively). In 14 households, IGRA showed a positivity rate of 100% (12/12) and 65.2% (15/23), and IgG of 50.0% (6/12) and 43.5% (10/23) in index cases and contacts, respectively, exhibiting a difference of +50% (95% CI +25.4-+74.6) and +21.7% (95% CI, +9.23-+42.3), respectively. Either IGRA or IgG was positive in 100% (12/12) of index cases and 73.9% (17/23) of contacts. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 IGRA is a useful clinical diagnostic tool for assessing cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Murugesan, K.; Jagannathan, P.; Altamirano, J.; Maldonado, Y.

Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among FL and SL nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was conducted in June-September 2020. Participants were 146 FL nurses and 206 SL nurses who were in direct contact with COVID-19 patients in two hospitals in Sirjan, Iran. They were recruited to the study through a census. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Data analysis was done through the Shapiro-Wilk, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and independent-sample t tests. Results: The mean scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were, respectively, 15.87 +/- 4.32, 8.35 +/- 4.74, and 13.4 +/- 4.39 among FL nurses and 9.91 +/- 5.96, 6.91 +/- 5.48, and 7.38 +/- 3.95 among SL nurses. The between-group differences regarding these mean scores were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Depression, anxiety, and stress are highly prevalent among both FL and SL nurses who provide care to patients with COVID-19.

Methods: We examined data on patients and their disease-related characteristics entered into the COVID-19 GRA provider registry from Ireland (24th March 2020 to 31st August 2020). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with hospitalisation. Results: Of 105 patients, 47 (45.6%) were hospitalised and 10 (9.5%) died. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed age (OR=1.06, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.10), number of comorbidities (OR=1.93, 95%CI 1.11 to 3.35), and glucocorticoid use (OR=15.01, 95%CI 1.77 to 127.16) were significantly associated with hospitalisation. A diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis was associated with a lower odds of hospitalisation (OR=0.09, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.32). Conclusion: Increasing age, comorbidity burden, and glucocorticoid use were associated with hospitalisation, while a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis was associated with lower odds of hospitalization.","Conway, R.; Nikiphorou, E.; Demetriou, C.; Low, C.; Leamy, K.; Ryan, J.; Kavanagh, R.; Fraser, A.; Carey, J.; O'Connell, P.; Flood, R.; Mullan, R.; Kane, D.; Robinson, P.; Liew, J.; Grainger, R.; McCarthy, G.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,263,1

Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, the increasing pace of life encouraged the investigation of individual and organisational aspects of WLB. Physically and mentally healthy people help society develop and grow. Health issues caused by work and life imbalance lead to dissatisfaction with both work and life, which, in turn, leads to higher stress and stress-related illnesses, for instance, burnout. From the organisational point of view, WLB is a factor in analysing the efficiency of an enterprise. The consequences of a work-life imbalance are intentional or unintentional absence, high employee turnover, low productivity, higher insurance costs, low job satisfaction, and others. WLB has been examined recently as part of employer branding since a shortage of labour prompts organisations to look for strategies to attract and retain employees. In this paper, content analysis is carried out to provide a theoretical framework for WLB and job satisfaction issues. Special attention is paid to the literature on WLB factors affecting the organisation and the individual. It is concluded that critical factors include both individual and organisational ones. Among them are job involvement, tenure, workload and scheduling, organisational culture (leadership, recreational opportunities, flexibility, supervisor support, autonomy, boundary management, alternative working methods etc.), occupational stress, and salary. These factors differ in their significance, particularly when viewed across several fields. © Apsīte, A., 2021","Apsīte, A.",Baltic Region,263,12

Introduction The Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) or stubble disease is one of the most frequent endemic zoonoses. Restricted to the farming areas of the Central West region of Argentina, it is produced by the Junín virus and it is transmitted by a rodent, the corn-mouse (Calomys musculinus). Objectives To recognize the neurological signs and symptoms of AHF that appear in the first 24-48hours of the onset of the disease. To describe the sequence of neurological manifestations in its common and severe clinical forms. Also, of the sequelae and late neurological complications Content Early diagnosis and timely intervention define the clinical evolution and prognosis. Attention must be paid to previously healthy adult patients undergoing “acute nonspecific febrile syndrome” of an unknown cause for less than a week of evolution. Differential diagnosis should be made with other endemic infectious diseases, and the emerging infectious disease COVID 19, appraising epidemiological surveillance. Conclusions Clinical examination, laboratory tests, serological diagnosis and images allow the early diagnosis. In Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, immune plasma therapy within the 5 days of the onset of the disease prevents progression towards severe clinical forms with high mortality rates. The fatality rate for FHA without treatment is 30%.

In the TOGETHER randomized platform clinical trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine vs. placebo in preventing either extended emergency room observation or hospitalization due to COVID-19. Herein, we report the preliminary findings. Methods This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. Results The study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval [95% BCI]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. We found no significant relative effects between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups on viral clearance at day 7 (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI]: 0.53 - 1.07), mortality (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.30), time to death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58 - 1.08), days hospitalized (Mean Difference (MD) 1.22 days; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.53), number of days ventilated (MD 1.10; 95% CI: 0.70 - 1.73) or other secondary outcomes.

However, many of the current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limitations, such as reliance on a single reference dataset or marker gene set, or excessive run times for large datasets. Acquiring high-quality labeled data to use as a reference can be challenging. With CITE-seq, surface protein expression of cells can be directly measured in addition to the RNA expression, facilitating cell type annotation. Here, we compiled and annotated a collection of 16 publicly available CITE-seq datasets. This data was then used as training data to develop Superscan, a supervised machine learning-based prediction model. Using our 16 reference datasets, we benchmarked Superscan and showed that it performs better in terms of both accuracy and speed when compared to other state-of-the-art cell annotation methods. Superscan is pre-trained on a collection of primarily PBMC immune datasets; however, additional data and cell types can be easily added to the training data for further improvement. Finally, we used Superscan to reanalyze a previously published dataset, demonstrating its applicability even when the dataset includes cell types that are missing from the training set.","Shasha, Carolyn; Tian, Yuan; Mair, Florian; Miller, Helen E.R.; Gottardo, Raphael",bioRxiv,263,16

What seems to be lacking, however, is a return to investor behaviour in terms of how it inspires inter-city spillovers. We thus propose the price-to-rent (P/R) ratio as a quantitative anchor in regard to how investor sentiment affects future housing values. By utilising a time-varying spillover approach based on monthly housing prices and rents across first-tier cities in China, it becomes clear that the characteristics of investment-driven diffusions are short-lived and more sensitive to economic policy changes in 2014 (the new normal initiative) and 2018 (strict housing control measures). Finally, in addition to good and bad perspectives, there is asymmetric evidence to show that negative outlooks such as a great fear of loss generally play a dominant role in the information transmission process, while a strong repercussion of good news in 2019 has subsequently been dampened by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chiang, Shu-hen Hui Eddie C.

We, therefore, expected that applying the computational approach, particularly machine learning (ML) with the genome neighborhood-based feature should facilitate the photosynthetic function assignment. Our results revealed a functional relationship between photosynthetic genes and their genomic neighbors, indicating the possibility to assign functions from their genome neighborhood profile. Therefore, we created a new method for extracting the patterns based on genome neighborhood network (GNN) and applied for the photosynthetic protein classification using ML algorithms.

In this study, the filtration ability of different cloth masks was compared. Materials and Methods: We examined the filtration ability of different cloth masks in ""Touch Screen Aerosol Photometer""DOP3500 machine by testing 0,3-0,5 μm diameter standart ""aerosol""particle at mask factory (MAKSAM) of Mechanical and Chemical Industry Company located in Ankara. In order to show the difference in filtration ability of the cloth maskes clearly, particule size was defined as 0,3-0,5 μm. Pure silk 100%, 80% silk + 20% polyester, 100% satin, 100% polyester, 100% cotton, 100% bamboo and 50% cotton + 50% polyester were compared. Cloth masks made from these materials were tested three times;before washing, after ten times washing and combined using with a medical mask. Results: N95/FFP-2 respirator was used as a ""positive control""with a filtration ability of 99.7%. Measurable filtration ability of total particle counts was 18.2% of three layered medical mask. When we tested double medical mask, reduction of total particle counts reached to 31.6%. According to our result, we conclude that wearing double medical mask is more protective than wearing a single medical mask. Measureable reduction of total particle counts were different for all tested cloth masks. Cloth masks were tested second time after 10 times washing. Un-washed cloth mask made from 80% silk + 20% polyester was found to be protective, however after ten times washing particle counts of the same mask reduced markedly. Measurable reduction of total particle counts were also reduced after ten times washing of cloth masks made from 100% satin and 100% polyester. The most efficient cloth mask for blocking particules was 100% cotton after ten times washing. Conclusion: Our study offers evidence in favor of synthetic and polyester materials are not suitable for cloth masks since their filtration ability is reduced after multiple washing. Instead, use of cotton masks is more preventive than the others because of its increased filtration ability after washing. Combined wearing of medical mask and cloth mask together resulted in increased efficacy of filtration ability of both masks. We conclude that, wearing double mask is more effective than wearing a single mask when we consider the actual status of the pandemic with widespread distribution of mutant viruses and the high number of infected individuals in the public.","Kalkanci, A.; Güzel Tunçcan, Ö Baş S.; Bostan, B.; Bay, F.; Metin, amp; Uuml,; AysertYildiz, P.; Özger, S.; Dizbay, M.; Ilhan, M.

We utilized this unique opportunity to assess the impact of restrictions on the air quality of Indian cities. We conducted comprehensive statistical assessments for the air quality index (AQI) and criteria pollutant concentrations for 91 cities during the lockdown phases relative to the preceding seven days (prelockdown phase of 18–24 March 2020) and to corresponding values from the same days of the year in 2019. Both comparisons show statistically significant countrywide mean decrease in AQI (33%), PM2.5 (36%), PM10 (40%), NO2 (58%), O3 (5%), SO2 (25%), NH3 (28%), and CO (60%). These reductions represent a background or the lower bound of air quality burden of industrial and transportation sectors. The northern region was most impacted by the first two phases of the lockdown, whereas the southern region was most affected in the last phase. The northeastern region was least affected, followed by the eastern region, which also showed an increase in O3 during the lockdown. Analysis of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) shows that effects of restrictions on particulate pollution were variable—locally confined in some areas or having a broader impact in other regions. Anomalous behavior over the eastern region suggests a differing role of regional societal response or meteorological conditions.

We aimed to study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air surrounding infected healthcare workers (HCW) in their homes versus infected patients who were undergoing potential aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP). We also studied the effect of different face masks worn bij infected persons on spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the air. Methods. We developed a high-volume air sampler method that uses a household vacuum cleaner with a surgical mask serving as a sample filter. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was harvested from these sample filters and analyzed on the presence of RNA by polymerase chain reaction. We acquired air samples in close aproximity of HCWs wearing different facemasks. Also, we obtained free air samples away from the infected HCWs and samples near intensive care unit (ICU) patients undergoing AGMP. Fog experiments were performed to visualize the airflow around our air sampler. Results. Aerosols were visibly suctioned into the vacuum cleaner when there was no face mask, whereas wearing a face mask resulted in a delayed and reduced flow of aerosols into the vacuum cleaner. The face masks that were worn by the HCWs were positive in 54-83% of cases. The proportion of positive air samples was higher in household settings of recently infected HCWs (29/41; 70.7%) compared to ICU settings (4/17; 23.5%) (p<0.01). Conclusion. This high-volume air sampler method was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples. Air samples in the household environment of recently infected HCWs more frequently contained SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to those obtained in patient rooms during potential AGMP.","de Man, P.; Ortiz Sanchez, M.; Bluyssen, P.; de Man, S.; Rentmeester, M.-J.; van der Vliet, M.; Wils, E.-J.; Ong, D.",,263,15

In this context, in this research, the professional responsibility area of the architect was evaluated with these criteria and the role of the architect in relation to the ""disaster management phases"" was questioned. The place and the importance of earthquake in the architectural education which is based on the foundations of the profession was evaluated as through comparative global agenda (USA, Japan, Turkey) by quantitative and qualitative dimensions. In addition to this general framework, the local context of the subject was questioned in terms of the ""educational dimension of the earthquake"". The data was obtained through program, curriculum and course contents shared online and by reaching the institutions through correspondence in case where digital access is not possible. Turkey context, compared to the international agenda, was questioned by a slightly wider frame. A situation assessment has been made in terms of undergraduate programs, graduate programs and supportive learning environments. These data also provided the basis for the holistic assessment carried out in terms of education. The proposals developed have been classified in a very broad scope under different headings due to the multifaceted relations of the phenomenon of disaster / earthquake with architectural education and architectural professional practice. Thus, suggestions have been developed in various scopes including ""Regarding General Responsibility"", ""Regarding Planning Decisions"", ""Regarding Interdisciplinary Relations"", ""Regarding Undergraduate Curriculum, Architectural Design Studio Courses"",""Regarding Supportive Learning Environments"" for architectural education. The results show that, in terms of architectural education practices (undergraduate / graduate / supportive learning environments) and the requirements of the mechanism which the training is based (structure design / production / inspection system and related legislation), the 1999 Marmara Earthquake directly triggered some developments in terms of ""learning from disasters"", ""the educational dimension of earthquake"" in its early years, but this acceleration has not been permanent in the past 20-year period. In this context, the proposals are about the necessity of providing a multidimensional set of relationships in terms of issues such as an integrated system organization. In this context, in relation to disaster / earthquake phenomenon, together with the self-criticism provided on qualitative and quantitative determinations, it is thought that the research will contribute to ""the architectural education"", ""architectural profession field"" and therefore the country's ""architectural practice and policy"". The Marmara Sea (Silivri) earthquake (September 26, 2019) that occurred during the evaluation process of this article was felt in the entire Marmara Region. This earthquake, which took place in the 20th year of the 1999 Marmara Earthquake, is important in terms of social memory and reminding the disaster reality, as it was felt in a large, populated area. On the other hand, the Coronavirus Pandemic, which emerged in the evaluation process of this article and declared as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, is within the scope of epidemiological disaster risks. Due to its global effects occurring simultaneously all over the world, Pandemic is an important milestone and breaking point in terms of being prepared for all kinds of disasters because of its vital - economic - sociological - psychological dimensions. It is thought that the pandemic is important in terms of re-questioning the period, which can be described as the ""Anthropocene Age"", when the human being was at the center and nature was interpreted as an ""unlimited resource"" to meet human needs. This questioning may have the potential to alter - transform general trends all over the globe. It is possible that these changes will have an intense effect on architectural education and architectural professional practice. It is among the promising predictions that the young generation at the education stage, who faced the earthquake disaster -without painful consequences- through the Silivri Earthquake and experienced the effects of the pandemic -an epidemiological disaster- will have a more sensitive and conscious base for the ethical, global, social responsibilities of the architectural professional practice.","Ayyildiz Potur, A.; Metin, H.",Megaron,263,20

Despite the challenges, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust ""temporary"" solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine. OBJECTIVES The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education, continuing medical education (CME) activities, residency and fellowship programs, specialty society meetings, and telemedicine, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to ""business as usual"" in the health-care sector. METHODS This is a commentary is based on the limited available literature, online information, and the front-line experiences of the authors. RESULTS COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients, virtual meetings with colleagues, and online interviews have been introduced, and many trainees are ""techno-omnivores"" who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now, and their use, practicality, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-to-face experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe, secure, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling, informed consent, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy, although it is likely that after the crisis, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits. LIMITATIONS The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed. CONCLUSIONS Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era.","Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Kohan, Lynn; Rosenblum, David; Gharibo, Christopher; Soin, Amol; Sulindro, Adrian; Nguyen, Quinn; Provenzano, David A",Pain physician,263,16

The coexistence of these disorders has been documented in literature and a central dysfunction related to digoxin and the isoprenoid pathway may underlie all these disorders. A family with a high prevalence of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, neoplasms, syndrome X, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy has been described. The psychological behavioral patterns of the family were: creativity and high IQ, hypersexual behavior, reduced appetite and eating behavior, insomnia and reduced sleep patterns, increased tendency for spirituality, increased tendency for addiction, less bonding and affectionate behavior, and left handedness/right hemispheric dominance. Digoxin, an endogenous Na(+)-K+ ATPase inhibitor secreted by the hypothalamus, was found to be elevated and red blood cell (RBC) membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity was found to be reduced in all the disorders and in the indexed family studied. Hypothalamic digoxin can modulate conscious perception and its dysfunction may lead to schizophrenia. Digoxin can also preferentially upregulate tryptophan transport over tyrosine, resulting in increased levels of depolarizng tryptophan catabolites, serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine, and nicotine, and decreased levels of hyperpolarizing tyrosine catabolites, dopamine, noradrenaline, and morphine, contributing to membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase inhibition in all the above disorders and the indexed family. Digoxin-induced membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase inhibition can result in increased intracellular Ca2+ and reduced Mg2+ levels, leading on to glutamate excitotoxicity, oncogene activation, and immune activation. Digoxin-induced altered Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios, reduced ubiquinone, and increased dolichol can affect glycoconjugate metabolism, membrane formation and structure, and mitochondrial function, leading to the diverse disorders described above, including those in the indexed family. The isoprenoid pathway and neurotransmitter patterns were compared in right-handed/LH dominant and left-handed/RH dominant individuals. The left-handed/RH dominant individuals compared to right-handed/LH dominant individuals had elevated hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase activity, with increased serum digoxin and dolichol levels. The serum ubiquinone, serum Mg2+ and RBC Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity were reduced in left-handed/RH dominant individuals. The left-handed/RH dominant individuals compared to right-handed/LH dominant individuals had elevated levels of serum tryptophan, quinolinic acid, serotonin, nicotine, and strychnine. The levels of tyrosine, dopamine, noradrenaline, and morphine were low in left-handed/RH dominant compared to right-handed/LH dominant individuals.

Further investigations of target antigen included reviews of phage display technique, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, protein expression and purification, Western blotting validation, serological and immunohistochemical staining in postmortem tissue. RESULTS A type of medium or low titer anti-lung tissue antibodies were found in the sera of SARS patients at the early stage of the disease. Human long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) gene endonuclease (EN) domain protein was one of the target autoantigens and it was aberrantly expressed in the lung tissue of SARS patients. Anti-EN antibody was positive in the sera of 40.9% of SARS patients. CONCLUSIONS Human LINE1 endonuclease domain was identified as a putative target of SARS-associated autoantibodies, which were presented in the serum of SARS patients and may be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.","He, Wei-ping; Shu, Cui-li; Li, Bo-an; Zhao, Jun; Cheng, Yun",Chinese medical journal,263,1

We investigated the immunomodulating effects of an innovative TCM regimen derived from two herbal formulas (Sang Ju Yin and Yu Ping Feng San) for treating febrile diseases. Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were given the oral TCM regimen daily for 14 days. Peripheral venous blood samples were taken on days 0, 15 and 29 for hematology, biochemistry and immunology tests, including the measurement of blood lymphocyte subsets and plasma T-helper lymphocyte types 1 and 2 cytokines and receptor. After 3 months, 23 of the volunteers participated in a control study without TCM treatment for the same time course of blood tests. Two volunteers withdrew on day 2, due to headache and dizziness. All others remained well without any side effects. No participants showed significant changes in their blood test results, except that the T-lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio increased significantly from 1.31 +/- 0.50 (mean +/- SD) on day 0 to 1.41 +/- 0.63 on day 15 (p < 0.02), and reduced to 1.32 +/- 0.47 on day 29 (p < 0.05). In the control study, there were no changes in the CD4/CD8 ratio. The transient increase in CD4/CD8 ratio was likely due to the TCM intake. We postulate that the administration of the innovative TCM may have beneficial immunomodulatory effects for preventing viral infections including SARS.","Poon, P M K; Wong, C K; Fung, K P; Fong, C Y S; Wong, E L Y; Lau, J T F; Leung, P C; Tsui, S K W; Wan, D C C; Waye, M M Y; Au, S W N; Lau, C B S; Lam, C W K",The American journal of Chinese medicine,263,28

Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. Results The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively.

Addition of the cap analogue 7-methylGTP to in vitro translations had no effect on the translation of FCV RNA, suggesting that FCV RNA is translated by a cap-independent mechanism. Further evidence that FCV RNA is translated by an unusual mechanism was obtained by translating FCV RNA in vitro at a range of K+ concentrations.

As suburbanization and the popularity of outdoor recreational activities increases, so do human-wildlife and companion animal-wildlife interfaces. Florida offers a tropical climate favorable for outdoor activities and a semirural landscape that sustains an abundant feral hog population. Because no survey ofleptospirosis in feral hogs (Sus scrofa) in Florida has been published to our knowledge, we sought to establish preliminary seroprevalence ofleptospirosis exposure in feral hogs in Florida. Blood samples were collected opportunistically from 158 male and 166 female feral hogs taken at managed hunts and by permitted trappers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Florida. Samples were then analyzed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibody titers to 20 Leptospira serovars representing 17 serogroups. A titer of > 1:100 was considered positive; 33% (107/324 total samples) were positive to at least one serovar, and 46% of those were positive to multiple serovars. Antibodies to L. interrogans serovar Bratislava strain Jez Bratislava (serogroup Australis) was the most common, with 18% (58/324) testing positive for antibodies. These initial data indicate that there is a significant possibility of feral hogs having a larger role in the complex etiology of leptospirosis in Florida than historically estimated and that further investigation is warranted.","Chatfield, Jenifer; Milleson, Michael; Stoddard, Robyn; Bui, Duy M; Galloway, Renee",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,263,7

Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been identified as a public health threat worldwide. Previous studies, however, have reported contradictory results of COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms in severe and mild forms. Methods A search of Medline, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for articles published up to May 2020. Data from each study was combined using the random-effects model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity was examined by sequentially excluding one study in each turn. Publication bias was evaluated using the Egger's and Begg's tests. Results Twenty studies (4,265 patients) were reviewed. It was found that the prevalence of diarrhea [OR (0.40), (95% CI 0.91, -2.16), p = 0.03, I2 = 88.1%, PHeterogenity = 0.00)] and nausea and vomiting [OR (0.27), (95% CI 0.07, 1.01), p = 0.05, I2 = 89.3%, PHeterogenity = 0.00)] increased significantly in the severe form compared to the mild form of COVID-19, while abdominal pain and anorexia had no significant increased prevalence in admitted and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in higher rates in males [OR (1.42), (95% CI 1.23, 1.65), p < 0.05, I2= 18.4%, PHeterogenity = 0.23] than in females. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar effect size while reducing the heterogeneity. Conclusion The data provides valuable information for the discovery of prognosis biomarkers to diagnosis more severe disease in the early stages of COVID-19.","Arjmand, Babak; Ghorbani, Fatemeh; Koushki, Mehdi; Rezai-Tavirani, Mostafa",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,263,1

Ron Daniels,14.539254,3.5242567,2020,"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has recently been identified as a causative agent of acute respiratory tract illnesses in infants and young children. The HCoV-NL63 spike (S) protein mediates virion attachment to cells and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. This viral entry process is a primary target for vaccine and drug development. HCoV-NL63 S is expressed as a single-chain glycoprotein and consists of an N-terminal receptor-binding domain (S1) and a C-terminal transmembrane fusion domain (S2). The latter contains two highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) sequences that are each extended by 14 amino acids relative to those of the SARS coronavirus or the prototypic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus. Limited proteolysis studies of the HCoV-NL63 S2 fusion core identify an alpha-helical domain composed of a trimer of the HR segments N57 and C42. The crystal structure of this complex reveals three C42 helices entwined in an oblique and antiparallel manner around a central triple-stranded coiled coil formed by three N57 helices. The overall geometry comprises distinctive high-affinity conformations of interacting cross-sectional layers of the six helices. As a result, this structure is unusually stable, with an apparent melting temperature of 78 degrees C in the presence of the denaturant guanidine hydrochloride at 5 M concentration. The extended HR regions may therefore be required to prime the group 1 S glycoproteins for their fusion-activating conformational changes during viral entry. Our results provide an initial basis for understanding an intriguing interplay between the presence or absence of proteolytic maturation among the coronavirus groups and the membrane fusion activity of their S glycoproteins. This study also suggests a potential strategy for the development of improved HCoV-NL63 fusion inhibitors.","Zheng, Qi; Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; van der Hoek, Lia; Berkhout, Ben; Lu, Min",Biochemistry,263,23

We describe the symptoms and signs of the first 2,184 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at COVID-19 treatment centers in Lagos State. We also assessed the relationship between patients' presenting symptoms, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 deaths.. METHODS: Medical records of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted and analyzed for their symptoms, symptom severity, presence of comorbidities and outcome. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 4 days to 98 years with a mean of 43.0(16.0) years. Of the patients who presented with symptoms, cough (19.3%) was the most common presenting symptom. This was followed by fever (13.7%) and difficulty in breathing, (10.9%). The most significant clinical predictor of death was the severity of symptoms and signs at presentation. Difficulty in breathing was the most significant symptom predictor of COVID-19 death (OR:19.26 95% CI 10.95-33.88). The case fatality rate was 4.3%. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians and COVID-19 frontline workers should maintain a high index of suspicion and prioritize the care of patients presenting with these symptoms. Community members should be educated on such predictors and ensure that patients with these symptoms seek care early to reduce the risk of deaths associated with COVID-19.","Abayomi, Akin; Odukoya, Oluwakemi; Osibogun, Akin; Wright, Ololade; Adebayo, Bisola; Balogun, Mobolanle; Abdus-Salam, Ismael; Bowale, Abimbola; Mutiu, Bamidele; Saka, Babatunde; Adejumo, Moyosore; Yenyi, Sam; Agbolagorite, Rotimi; Onasanya, Oluwatosin; Erinosho, Eniola; Obasanya, Joshua; Adejumo, Olu; Adesola, Sunday; Oshodi, Yewande; Akase, Iorhen E; Ogunbiyi, Shina; Lajide, Dayo; Erinoso, Femi; Abdur-Razzaq, Hussein",Int J Infect Dis,263,16

Additionally, an online questionnaire (Spanish population, n = 362) studied changes in food shopping habits during the lockdown, motivations behind the changes, and perceived reliability of the information received from media. Results showed initial trending searches and most watched YouTube videos were about understanding what COVID-19 is and how the illness can progress and spread.

Data retrieved from Twitter also showed an evolution from shopping concerns to the feeling of uncertainty for the oncoming crisis. The answers to the online questionnaire showed reduction of shopping frequency but no changes in shopping location. Products purchased with higher frequency were pasta and vegetables (health motivations), others were purchased to improve their mood (nuts, cheese, and chocolates). Reduced purchasing was attributed to products with a short shelf-life (fish, seafood) or because they were unhealthy and contributed to gained body weight (sugary bakery goods) or mood (desserts).

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted ""stay in place"" or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection. This review speculates the importance of nutrition as a mitigation strategy to support immune function amid the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying food groups and key nutrients of importance that may affect the outcomes of respiratory infections.","Zabetakis, Ioannis; Lordan, Ronan; Norton, Catherine; Tsoupras, Alexandros",Nutrients,263,1

These changes have occurred in parallel with systemic and structural changes in health care and higher education, both of which have experienced challenges with improving access and controlling costs, and have become a centerpiece of legislative and political discourse. At the same time, advances in technology have introduced new possibilities in education, with the emergence of online, blended, and ""flipped"" learning models that supplement or replace face-to-face instruction with distance learning. Hybrid education is a type of blended learning, utilizing both face-to-face and online instructional strategies. In a hybrid learning environment, online content may be delivered synchronously or asynchronously, replacing traditional face-to-face instructional time and reducing ""seat time"" for students. Recent attention has been brought to online and hybrid/blended learning in physical therapist education in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as programs have been required to abruptly move from face-to-face to remote instruction. Hybrid and other forms of blended learning strategies have been described at the physical therapist education course level.

We provide new analyses to estimate the likelihood of reaching or remaining in a phenotype under dynamic, physiologically likely perturbations of stimuli (""phenotype stability""). We show that higher stability values of the motile phenotype (Go) are associated with reduced patient survival. Moreover, induced motile states are capable of driving GBM recurrence. We found that the Dormancy and Go phenotypes are equally represented in advanced GBM samples, with natural transitioning between the two. Furthermore, Go and Grow phenotype transitions are mostly driven by tumor-brain stimuli. These are difficult to regulate directly, but could be modulated by reprogramming tumor-associated cell types. Our framework provides a foundation for designing targeted perturbations of the tumor-brain environment, by assessing their impact on GBM phenotypic plasticity, and is corroborated by analyses of patient data.","Rajapakse, Vinodh N; Herrada, Sylvia; Lavi, Orit",Sci.

We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection. METHODS: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing.","Colaneri, Marta; Novelli, Viola; Cutti, Sara; Muzzi, Alba; Resani, Guido; Monti, Maria Cristina; Rona, Claudia; Grugnetti, Anna Maria; Rettani, Marco; Rovida, Francesca; Zuccaro, Valentina; Triarico, Antonio; Marena, Carlo",J. public health (Oxf),263,4

Genres covered include essays and critiques within the Arts and Humanities, case studies and problem questions within the Social Sciences, explanations and methodology recounts within the Life Sciences, and design specifications and exercises within the Physical Sciences following Gardner and Nesi’s (2013) genre families taxonomy. We explore students’ end-of-course reflections of the value of annotating genre features for understanding disciplinary academic writing practices under a blended approach, the affordances of annotating disciplinary exemplar texts using the CIRRUS annotation platform, and any remaining challenges for future iterations. Using both questionnaire (n=62) and interview (n=10) methods, the results suggest students appreciated the value of annotating exemplar texts for genre features, while annotating in CIRRUS was advantageous over previous practice in improving students’ understanding of text structure, organisation, generation of ideas, and knowledge of genre/disciplinary rhetorical features.","Crosthwaite, Peter Sanhueza Alicia Gazmuri Schweinberger Martin",Journal of English for Academic Purposes,263,21

Across African Americans and whites, we found bidirectional associations between subjective and objective memory such that greater self-reported forgetting at baseline predicted faster subsequent verbal episodic memory declines, and higher baseline objective memory scores predicted less increase in self-reported forgetting over time. However, rates of change in self-reported frequency of forgetting were correlated with rates of change in verbal episodic memory in whites, but not in African Americans. Subjective memory complaints may be a harbinger of future memory declines across African Americans and whites but may not track with objective memory in the same way across these racial groups.

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.","Bono, Hidemasa",,263,13

We tested whether TE in ALL and TE in the general adult population have a shared genetic etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively registered TE events and collected germline DNA in patients 1.0-45.9 years in the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 study (7/2008-7/2016). Based on summary statistics from two large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on venous TE in adults (the International Network of VENous Thromboembolism Clinical Research Networks (INVENT) consortium and the UK Biobank), we performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis on TE development in the NOPHO cohort, progressively expanding the PRS by increasing the p-value threshold of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) inclusion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Eighty-nine of 1252 patients with ALL developed TE, 2.5 year cumulative incidence 7.2%. PRS of genome-wide significant SNPs from the INVENT and UK Biobank data were not significantly associated with TE, HR 1.16 (p 0.14) and 1.02 (p 0.86), respectively. Expanding PRS by increasing p-value threshold did not reveal polygenic overlap. However, subgroup analysis of adolescents 10.0-17.9 years (n = 231), revealed significant polygenic overlap with the INVENT GWAS. The best fit PRS, including 16,144 SNPs, was associated with TE with HR 1.76 (95% CI 1.23-2.52, empirical p-value 0.02). Our results support an underlying genetic predisposition for TE in adolescents with ALL and should be explored further in future TE risk prediction models.","Jarvis, Kirsten Brunsvig; Nielsen, Rikke Linnemann; Gupta, Ramneek; Hede, Freja Dahl; Huttunen, Pasi; Jónsson, Ólafur Gisli; Rank, Cecilie Utke; Ranta, Susanna; Saks, Kadri; Trakymiene, Sonata Saulyte; Tuckuviene, Ruta; Tulstrup, Morten; Ruud, Ellen; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; LeBlanc, Marissa",Thromb Res,263,10

Our model disentangles bias from truthfulness of an article and examines the relationship between these two parameters and a reader's own beliefs. Using the model, we create policy recommendations for both social media platforms and individual social media users to reduce the spread of untruthful or highly biased news. We recommend that platforms sponsor unbiased truthful news, focus fact-checking efforts on mild to moderately biased news, recommend friend suggestions across the political spectrum, and provide users with reports about the political alignment of their feed. We recommend that individual social media users fact check news that strongly aligns with their political bias and read articles of opposing political bias.","Behzad, Banafsheh; Bheem, Bhavana; Elizondo, Daniela; Marsh, Deyana; Martonosi, Susan",,263,26

To understand the possible change in the behaviour of consumers of dairy products (at home) during the pandemic COVID-19 in Brazil, the responses of various people through an online questionnaire sent by social networks were analyzed. Materials and Methods: To assess the consumer profile, age, sex, residence and family income were asked. It was also asked if the consumer was aware of the benefits of eating milk and if it was common practice to encourage the consumption of dairy products. The questionnaire was disseminated throughout all five Brazilian regions and to the most diverse audiences, accounting for a total of 1,002 respondents. Results: Dairy products are commonly purchased, being consumed and valued by most respondents (&gt;80%). The most observed requirement when purchasing these products was the price factor, followed by physical and hygienic conditions and the product brand.

The study objective was to describe the incidence and characteristics of MS patients with COVID-19, to identify susceptibility and severity risk factors and to assess the proportion of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologies according to disease-modifying treatments. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of an MS cohort analysing data collected between February and May 2020. Cases were identified through an email survey and clinical visits. The relationship of demographic and MS characteristics with COVID-19 and of the disease-modifying treatments with SARS-CoV-2 serostatus were examined. RESULTS: Data from 48 suspected cases out of 758 valid respondents and from 45 COVID-19 cases identified through clinical visits were collected. Incidence was 6.3%. Nineteen (20.3%) patients were hospitalized and two (2.2%) died. Multivariable models determined that age (odds ratio [OR] per 10 years 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.85), contact with a confirmed case (OR 197.02, 95% CI 56.36-688.79), residence in Barcelona (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.03-4.80), MS duration (OR per 5 years 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83) and time on anti-CD20 treatment (OR per 2 years 3.48, 95% CI 1.44-8.45) were independent factors for presenting COVID-19 and age (OR per 10 years 2.71, 95% CI 1.13-6.53) for a severe COVID-19. Out of the 79 (84.9%) with serological test, 45.6% generated antibodies, but only 17.6% of those on anti-CD20 therapies. Lymphopaenia or immunoglobulin levels did not relate to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sclerosis patients present similar incidence, risk factors and outcomes for COVID-19 as the general population. Patients treated with an anti-CD20 therapy for a longer period of time might be at a higher risk of COVID-19 and less than 20% generate an antibody response. Only age was related to severity.","Zabalza, Ana; Cárdenas-Robledo, Simón; Tagliani, Paula; Arrambide, Georgina; Otero-Romero, Susana; Carbonell-Mirabent, Pere; Rodriguez-Barranco, Marta; Rodríguez-Acevedo, Breogán; Restrepo Vera, Juan Luis; Resina-Salles, Mireia; Midaglia, Luciana; Vidal-Jordana, Angela; Río, Jordi; Galan, Ingrid; Castillo, Joaquin; Cobo-Calvo, Álvaro; Comabella, Manuel; Nos, Carlos; Sastre-Garriga, Jaume; Tintore, Mar; Montalban, Xavier",Eur. j. neurol,263,1

The biggest complication is pneumonia, which has a serious inflammatory component, with no standardized treatment. Low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) is non-invasive and has anti-inflammatory effects that can interfere with the inflammatory cascade, thus reducing the severity of associated cytokine release and might be useful in the treatment of respiratory complications caused by COVID-19. Study design and methods: This multicentric prospective clinical trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral lung LD-RT therapy as a treatment for interstitial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 for improving respiratory function. This prospective study will have 2 phases: I) an exploratory phase enrolling 10 patients, which will assess the feasibility and efficacy of low-dose lung irradiation, evaluated according to an increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio of at least 20% at 48–72 h with respect to the pre-irradiation value. If a minimum efficiency of 30% of the patients is not achieved, the study will not be continued. II) Non-randomized comparative phase in two groups: a control group, which will only receive pharmacological treatment, and an experimental arm with pharmacological treatment and LD-RT. It will include 96 patients, the allocation will be 1: 2, that is, 32 in the control arm and 64 in the experimental arm. The primary end-point will be the efficacy of LD-RT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia according to an improvement in PaO2/FiO2. Secondary objectives will include the safety of bilateral lung LD-RT, an improvement in the radiology image, overall mortality rates at 15 and 30 days after irradiation and characterizing anti-inflammatory mechanisms of LD-RT by measuring the level of expression of adhesion molecules, anti-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress mediators.

The present study was conducted on search of the published studies available in NCBI;PubMed, MEDLINE, Scielo and Google Scholar for all kind of articles using keywords related to coronavirus and central nervous system. In addition to the most common symptoms of COVID-19 that are fever, cough, dyspnea and myalgia, anosmia and ageusia also have a high incidence in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Brain invasion by coronavirus, that had previously been related with glial cells, has been reported, as well as evidence that confirm the frequency and three times higher prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases in patients affected by COVID-19. Understanding the effects that the coronavirus may have on the central nervous system is essential to learn more about the possible consequences of COVID-19. It is known that the disease can cause neurological complications and the understanding of these processes may help in the detection of viral presence and in the appropriate treatment for these patients.

To date, five patients have been described with pathogenic variants in MRPL44, encoding the ml44 protein which is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). Three presented as infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mild lactic acidosis, and easy fatigue and muscle weakness, whereas two presented in adolescence with myopathy and neurological symptoms. We describe two infants who presented with cardiomyopathy from the neonatal period, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia and in one infant lactic acidosis. A decompensation of the cardiac function in the first year resulted in demise. Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the MRPL44 gene including the known pathogenic variant c.467 T > G and two novel pathogenic variants. We document a combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiency with emphasis on complex I and IV, affecting heart muscle tissue more than skeletal muscle or fibroblasts. We show this to be caused by reduced mitochondrial DNA encoded protein synthesis affecting all subunits, and resulting in dysfunction of complex I and IV assembly. The degree of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction correlated with the impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis due to different pathogenic variants. These functional studies allow for improved understanding of the pathogenesis of MRPL44-associated mitochondrial disorder.","Friederich, Marisa W; Geddes, Gabrielle C; Wortmann, Saskia B; Punnoose, Ann; Wartchow, Eric; Knight, Kaz M; Prokisch, Holger; Creadon-Swindell, Geralyn; Mayr, Johannes A; Van Hove, Johan L K",Mol. genet. metab,263,2

What is inescapable is that COVID-19 has an age-related risk component and the latest data shows that risks start to rise for people from midlife onwards. As governance agencies, professional practice, and academia work towards assessing, communicating, and addressing this risk, we ask: are existing gerontological conceptualisations of ageism appropriate for this exceptional situation and what is being (re)produced in terms of an aged subjectivity? Following van Dyk's (2016) critique of gerontology's 'othering' through both 'glorification' (third age) and 'abjection' (fourth age), a content analysis of statements and policy documents issued in response to COVID-19 provides evidence of well-meaning and inadvertent ageism through homogenizing language, the abjection/glorification binary within 'old age', and the power binary constructed between age and an age-neutral midlife.

However, the impact of this immune dysregulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and CoV disease of 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown. This Perspective outlines why individuals with Down syndrome should be considered an at-risk population for severe COVID-19.

This method was validated using clinical records from the general practitioners (GPs). Face validity of the case ascertainment was tested for three etiological factors (smoking, sex and family history of PD). In total 54825 participants were included from the cohorts AMIGO and EPIC-NL. Sources of PD information included self-reported PD, self-reported PD medication, a 9 item screening questionnaire (Tanner), electronical medical records, hospital discharge data and mortality records. Based on these sources we developed a likelihood score with 4 categories (no PD, unlikely PD, possible PD, likely PD). For the different sources of PD information and for the likelihood score we present the agreement with GP-validated cases. Risk of PD for established factors was studied by logistic regression as exact diagnose dates were not always available. Based on the algorithm, we assigned 346 participants to the likely PD category. GP validation confirmed 67% of these participants in EPIC-NL, but only 12% in AMIGO. PD was confirmed in only 3% of the participants with a possible PD classification. PD case ascertainment by mortality records (91%), EMR ICPC (82%) and self-reported information (62-69%) had the highest confirmation rates. The Tanner PD screening questionnaire had a lower agreement (18%). Risk estimates for smoking, family history and sex using all likely PD cases were comparable to the literature for EPIC-NL, but not for smoking in AMIGO. Using multiple sources of PD evidence in cohorts remains important but challenging as performance of sources varied in validity.","Reedijk, Marije; Huss, Anke; Verheij, Robert A; Peeters, Petra H; Vermeulen, Roel C H",PLoS One,263,33

Recent evidence identified XYP as a potential inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, implying XYP as a possible treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label and randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of XYP injection in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We consecutively recruited 130 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms from five study sites, and randomized them in 1:1 ratio to receive XYP injection in combination with standard therapy or receive standard supportive therapy alone. We found that XYP injection significantly reduced the time to cough relief, fever resolution and virus clearance. Less patients receiving XYP injection experienced disease progression to the severe stage during the treatment process. No severe adverse events were reported during the study. Taken together, XYP injection is safe and effective in improving the recovery of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of XYP in an expanded cohort comprising COVID-19 patients at different disease stages.","Zhang, Xin-Yi; Lv, Lang; Zhou, Yu-Long; Xie, Liang-Dong; Xu, Qin; Zou, Xiao-Fan; Ding, Yan; Tian, Jie; Fan, Jia-Liang; Fan, Hai-Wei; Yang, Yi-Xi; Ye, Xiao-Qun",Phytother. res,263,1

These public health policy decisions were informed by statistical models for infection rates in national populations. In this work, we are interested in modelling the temporal evolution of national-level infection counts for the United Kingdom (UK-Wales, England, Scotland), Germany (GM), Italy (IT), Spain (SP), Japan (JP), Australia (AU) and the United States (US). We model the national-level infection counts for the period January 2020 to January 2021, thus covering both the pre- and post-vaccine roll-out periods, in order to better understand the most reliable model structure for the COVID-19 epidemic growth curve. We achieve this by exploring a variety of stochastic population growth models and comparing their calibration, with respect to in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, both with and without exposure adjustment, to the most widely used and reported growth model, the Gompertz population model, often referred to in the public health policy discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Model risk as we explore it in this work manifests in the inability to adequately capture the behaviour of the disease progression growth rate curve. Therefore, our concept of model risk is formed relative to the standard reference Gompertz model used by decision-makers, and then we can characterise model risk mathematically as having two components: the dispersion of the observation distribution, and the structure of the intensity function over time for cumulative counts of new infections daily (i.e. the force of infection) attributed directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explore how to incorporate in these population models the effect that governmental interventions have had on the number of infected cases. This is achieved through the development of an exposure adjustment to the force of infection comprised of a purpose-built sentiment index, which we construct from various authoritative public health news reporting. The news reporting media we employed were the New York Times, the Guardian, the Telegraph, Reuters global blog, as well as national and international health authorities: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organisation.

Boyarsky et al recently reported that, only 17% of transplant recipients who received a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed detectable anti-spike antibody (compared to 100% of the nonimmunocompromised subjects in the pivotal trials) and after 2 doses response increased to 54% in transplant recipients.1,2. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 14 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 despite completion of vaccination series. RESULTS: Fourteen SOT recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 a median of 23.5 days from completion of vaccination. One patient died, 2 remain hospitalized and 11 are recovered at home. Fifty percent of patients infected required hospitalization for treatment of disease. CONCLUSIONS: With this report of 14 patients who developed COVID-19 infection after completion of vaccination, we believe there is sufficient evidence to issue warnings that immunoincompetent populations should continue to practice strict COVID-19 precautions postvaccination. Transplant centers should reinforce that guidance given to the general population may not be applicable to the transplant population. A centralized transplant registry of fully vaccinated solid organ transplant patients who develop COVID-19 infections is vital. Further studies are critically needed to optimize COVID-19 vaccination protocols in transplant recipients.","Ali, Nicole M; Alnazari, Nasser; Mehta, Sapna A; Boyarsky, Brian; Avery, Robin K; Segev, Dorry L; Montgomery, Robert A; Stewart, Zoe A",Transplantation,263,21

Here, we compared intraspecies sensitivity to toxicants for Mesocyclops leuckarti of which toxicity data was obtained from published literatures, and zebrafish Danio rerio of which toxicity data was done in this study). Due to the internal concentration of chemicals not measured, simplified toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models were used, and we investigated whether TK-TD parameters estimated by Bayesian method might represent the differences in sensitivity between life-stages of 2 species. The results demonstrated that the difference in TK-TD parameters (background mortality m0, no effect concentration NEC, the killing rate ks, and the dominant rate kd) could represent the toxicity difference between life-stages of individual species. The TK-TD model could predict toxicity in individual species (Cyprinus carpio L., Enchytraeus crypticus, Folsomia candida, Hyalella Azteca) exposed to different chemical concentrations and successfully extrapolate toxicity between different life stages of Mesocyclops leuckarti and Danio rerio by scaling several TK-TD parameters.

METHODS: Design: Case report Setting: Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in an academic hospital Participant: 17-yearold female with MIS-C and BVHF RESULTS: A 17-year-old overweight female with asthma was admitted to the PICU with MIS-C. A history of SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed with positive nasopharyngeal swab and IgG antibody and borderline IgM antibody. She presented with hypotension, fevers, abdominal pain, myalgias, and headache, but no chest pain. Initial diagnostic studies were notable for troponin I 2.572 ng/ml, BNP 386 pg/mL, ECG with sinus tachycardia, and echocardiogram with normal function. Over two days her hypotension worsened despite increasing vasoactive therapy. Repeat echocardiogram revealed LVEF 30% and moderate right systolic dysfunction consistent with acute heart failure. She received intravenous immune globulin (400 mg/kg) once, dexamethasone (6 mg daily), and Tocilizumab. Within 48 hours of these treatments she was weaned off all vasoactive therapies and extubated.

Resources otherwise used for influenza could support caring for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program serves 30 million people annually by providing comprehensive primary health care, including influenza vaccination, to demographically diverse and historically underserved communities. As racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, the objective of this analysis was to assess disparities in influenza vaccination at HRSA-funded health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HRSA analyzed cross-sectional data on influenza vaccinations from a weekly, voluntary Health Center COVID-19 survey after addition of an influenza-related question covering November 7-27, 2020. RESULTS: During the three-week period, 1,126 (81%) of 1385 health centers responded to the survey. Most of the 811,738 influenza vaccinations took place in urban areas and in the Western US Region. There were disproportionately more health center influenza vaccinations among racial and ethnic minorities in comparison with county demographics, except among Non-Hispanic Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives. CONCLUSIONS: HRSA-funded health centers were able to quickly vaccinate large numbers of mostly racial or ethnic minority populations, disproportionately more than county demographics. However, additional efforts might be needed to reach specific racial populations and persons in rural areas. Success in influenza vaccination efforts can support success in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts.","Marks, Suzanne M; Clara, Alexey; Fiebelkorn, Amy Parker; Le, Xuan; Armstrong, Paige A; Campbell, Stephanie; Van Alstyne, Judith Mendel; Price, Sarah; Bolton, Joshua; Sandhu, Paramjit K; Bombard, Jennifer M; Strona, F V",Clin. infect. dis,263,20

A many-objective model with five objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance of algorithms is verified via experiments.

All nonessential businesses were closed during this time, and health care services were reorganized. On March 11, the Stoma Care Center started providing telehealth services for patients with a stoma. PURPOSE: This retrospective observational study describes the experience of the Stoma Care Center of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples, Italy, before and during the lockdown. METHODS: Consultation records from January 1 through April 29 were retrieved, patient demographics and reasons for consultation abstracted, and pre-lockdown (January 1 to February 29) and lockdown (March 1 to April 29) information was compared. Patients who used telehealth services were also asked to rate their satisfaction with these services on a scale of 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 4 (extremely satisfied). The authors analyzed all consultations provided from January to April 2020 and evaluated the use of telemedicine services for patients with an ostomy. Consultations were divided into 2 groups. Group A included consultations provided from January 1 to February 29. Group B included consultations provided from March 1 to April 29, which included the lockdown period. Group B included both in-person and telemedicine consultations. RESULTS: During the pre-lockdown period, 240 in-person consultations were provided. During the lockdown period, 181 in-person and 99 telemedicine consultations were provided. The number of in-person consultations for mechanical bowel preparation and transanal irrigation system training was lower (12.5% vs 6.6% [P = .046] and 3.3% vs 0% [P = .03]), whereas the number of consults for stoma care follow-up and stoma complications was higher (202 [84.1%] vs 266 [95%]). Of the 65 patients who completed the questionnaire, 82% indicated being extremely satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: The reorganization of stoma care services, including the availability of telemedicine, did not result in a decrease in the number of consultations provided. The results suggest that stoma care services using telemedicine may provide valid support for patients with an ostomy in the future.","Dinuzzi, Vincenza Paola; Palomba, Giuseppe; Minischetti, Maria; Amendola, Alfonso; Aprea, Pierluigi; Luglio, Gaetano; De Palma, Giovanni Domenico; Aprea, Giovanni",Wound Manag Prev,263,16

Intern-nursing students face challenges in providing care for suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to explore the mental strain and changes in the psychological health hub among the intern-nursing students during COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 150 intern-nursing students from 13 pediatric and medical-surgical units at Alexandria University Hospitals completed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 Staff Questionnaire and rated their psychological distress on the General Health Questionnaire. Study results revealed that the most stressful factors were related to possibility of getting COVID-19 infection (2.89 ± 0.39) and transmitting it to their families (2.72 ± 0.62). Moreover, the availability of cure or vaccine for the disease was the most important motivational factor to participate in future outbreaks (2.64 ± 0.77). Regarding intern-nursing students' psychological health hub, 77.3% of them felt under strain, worthless and depressed (64.7%, 62.7%) since the influx of COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression indicated that students' age (23-24), clinical experience (8 months) and clinical placement in adults' units served as risk factor for developing psychological distress while, male gender and training in pediatric units were protective factors. Designating an emergency psychiatric unit for ongoing monitoring and providing psychological first aids to the vulnerable health care providers is recommended.","Eweida, Rasha Salah; Rashwan, Zohour Ibrahim; Desoky, Gehan Mohamed; Khonji, Leena Mohammad",Nurse Educ Pract,263,24

It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan.

We define N domains important for oligomerization and RNA binding and show that N oligomerization provides a high affinity RNA binding platform. We also map the RNA binding interface, showing protection in the N-terminal domain and linker region. In addition, phosphorylation causes reduction of RNA binding and redistribution of N from liquid droplets to loose-coils, showing how N/RNA accessibility and assembly may be regulated by phosphorylation. Finally, we find that the C-terminal domain of N is the most immunogenic, based upon antibody binding to patient samples. Together, we provide a biochemical description of SARS-CoV-2 N and highlight the value of using N domains as highly specific and sensitive diagnostic markers.","Wu, Chao; Qavi, Abraham J; Hachim, Asmaa; Kavian, Niloufar; Cole, Aidan R; Moyle, Austin B; Wagner, Nicole D; Sweeney-Gibbons, Joyce; Rohrs, Henry W; Gross, Michael L; Peiris, J S Malik; Basler, Christopher F; Farnsworth, Christopher W; Valkenburg, Sophie A; Amarasinghe, Gaya K; Leung, Daisy W",iScience,263,1

Data from 2019 for standard plasma/platelet apheresis (SA) and whole blood (WB) donor demographics and SA donations including product disposition and reactions were used for comparison. RESULTS: Of almost 59K donors registering on the website, 75% reported an existing COVID-19 diagnostic PCR or an antibody test. The majority (56.2%) of 10,231 CCP donors were first-time donors in contrast to SA or WB donor populations, which were only 3.0 and 30.6%, respectively, first-time donors.

Our survey estimates that most U.S. patient-visits during the early COVID-19 pandemic period were conducted via telehealth. Given this magnitude and potential benefits/challenges of telehealth for U.S. healthcare, we obtain, summarize, and analyze telehealth views/experiences of U.S. practicing-physicians. OBJECTIVE: From the U.S. practicing-physician perspective, we examine extent of shift toward telehealth training and care provision during the early-pandemic. We seek to determine the shift's short- and long-term implications upon quality, access, and mode of U.S. healthcare delivery. METHODS: A purposive, snowball-sampled survey of 148 U.S. practicing-physicians. Data was collected from July 17, 2020 through September 4, 2020. RESULTS: Sample training intensity scaled 21-fold during the early-pandemic period; patient-care visits conducted via telehealth rose from 13.1%, on average, directly before pandemic to 59.7%, on average, during early-pandemic. Physicians feel that telehealth patient-visits and face-to-face patient-visits are comparable in quality; the difference is not statistically significant in a non-parametric sign test (P = 0.11). Physicians feel that telehealth care should continue to play a larger role (44.9% of visits) in U.S. healthcare post-pandemic. Survey findings suggest high market-concentration in telehealth softwares, a market-structural characteristic that may have implications upon cost and access. Results vary markedly by physician employer-type. CONCLUSIONS: During the shift toward telehealth, there has been considerable discovery among physicians regarding U.S. telehealth physicians. Physicians are now better-prepared to undertake telehealth care from a training perspective. They are favorable toward a permanently-expanded telehealth role, with potential for enhanced healthcare access; realization of enhanced access may depend upon market-structural characteristics of telehealth software platforms.

One of the unknowns to be solved is whether there is a vertical transmission of the infection during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, the possible presence of this germ in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid was investigated in four pregnant Caucasian patients affected by mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 during the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no laboratory evidence to suggest a possible passage of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected mother to the amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to expand the investigation of COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy to clarify the real influence that SARS-CoV-2 has on pregnant women and their offspring, as well as those factors that modulate the disease.","Hijona Elósegui, J J; Carballo García, A L; Fernández Risquez, A C; Bermúdez Quintana, M; Expósito Montes, J F",Rev. clin. esp.

The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.","Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Shin, Hye-Jin; Kim, Mi-Hwa; Lee, Sunhee; Kim, Hae-Soo; Myoung, Jinjong; Kim, Bum-Tae; Kim, Seong-Jun",J Microbiol Biotechnol,263,25

When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. METHODS: Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, P-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. RESULTS: Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; P = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Barrios, Alanna; Agadi, Kuchalambal; Thevuthasan, Sindhu; Pandav, Krunal; Kc, Manish; Sarfraz, Muzna; Rad, Pedram; Michel, George",J Prim Care Community Health,263,17

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of GBS in which SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the CSF, further strengthening the role of the virus as a trigger. In conclusion, our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies need to be searched in the serum and CSF in patients with GBS living in endemic areas, even in the absence of a clinically severe COVID-19 infection, and that IL-8 pathway can be relevant in Si-GBS pathogenesis.

To achieve this, we collected data samples in a simulation environment which were labelled according to the optimal control command determined by a path planning algorithm. Based on these data samples, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that maps low resolution image and sensor input to high-level control commands. We have observed promising results in both obstructed and non-obstructed simulation environments, showing that our model is capable of successfully navigating a MAV towards a landing platform.

Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L –1air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable (‘live’), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA.

SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence is difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S-insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","Bagdonaite, Ieva; Thompson, Andrew J; Wang, Xiaoning; Søgaard, Max; Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Frank, Martin; Diedrich, Jolene K; Yates, John R; Salanti, Ali; Vakhrushev, Sergey Y; Paulson, James C; Wandall, Hans H",Viruses,263,1

Such discrimination technologies would not only be useful in protecting health care centers from becoming overwhelmed but would also provide a powerful tool to better control possible future pandemics with a less social and economic burden.","Mahmoudi, Morteza",Mol. pharm,263,16

METHODS: We developed a multidisciplinary steering committee to uncover barriers to palliative care referral and developed a pilot program, called the Warm Handoff. Through ongoing collaboration and midpilot feedback sessions, we identified several additional barriers and opportunities to increase access to palliative care. RESULTS: Clinicians used the initial Warm Handoff process only 20 times over a period of 7 months. Of those calls, 10 were for issues outside of those that the Warm Handoff pilot was intended to address. During the pilot, we identified lack of access to urgent visits and clinician telephone availability for clinical case discussion as additional barriers to access. Increased collaboration led to the creation of a clinical provider of the day (CPOD) care model, which allowed for a notable increase in the capacity to see urgent consults. After this intervention, we observed an average of 19 patients seen urgently per month. In addition, there was a trend toward increasing referrals from breast oncology after the initiation of the CPOD. CONCLUSION: A CPOD model, developed via close oncology/palliative care collaboration, resulted in increased utilization of palliative care services.","Lally, Kate; Chua, Isaac S; Lin, Nancy U; Siegel, Jocelyn; Bernacki, Rachelle",JCO Oncol Pract,263,24

In our experiment, broad bracketing is so simple to implement that narrow bracketing cannot possibly be due to optimal conservation of cognitive resources, so it must be suboptimal.

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.

Data sources: Electronic databases PubMed Central and PubMed were searched from January 2020 to June 2020 for published studies about ECMO and/or invasive mechanical ventilation use in COVID-19 patients. Data Extraction and Study Selection: The search strategy retrieved 766 articles, of which 19 studies consisting of 204 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Data synthesis: Primary outcomes evaluated were discharge and/or clinical improvement and mortality rate. Secondary outcomes evaluated included reported complications and the mean number of days of hospitalization for survivors. Weighted averages of included studies were calculated, and data were pooled in forest plots. Nearly, 68.1% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation without ECMO support, and 31.9% were placed on ECMO. Also, 22.5% of the patients were discharged and/or clinically improved and 51.5% died. Twenty-six percent of the study population deteriorated but remained alive or experienced no improvement in clinical condition. And 75.2% of those who died belonged to the non-ECMO group and 24.8% to the ECMO group. The mortality rate in the non-ECMO group was 56.8% compared to 40% in the ECMO group. Conclusion: The utility of ECMO during a pandemic is uncertain as it is a resource-intensive modality, especially when the mortality rate in severely ill patients infected with COVID-19 virus is already known to be high.","Nagraj, S.; Karia, R.; Hassanain, S.; Ghosh, P.; Shah, V.

Yet, how do professionals know when research scope, relevance, transparency, and quality are ready for real‐world application? There remain questions as to exactly how these core concepts of evidence‐based practices (EBPs) are realized. A discussion on whether psychological science can be relied on to deliver real‐world practices related to the coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic led IJzerman and colleagues to develop a rubric to evaluate research for real‐world application called evidence readiness level. This model is adapted for school psychologists' use in evaluating and implementing research for clinical practice. Clinical readiness level is a rubric that is designed to narrow the research‐to‐practice gap, provide criteria for EBPs, and specify the value of a scientist‐practitioner model of school psychology.

There is growing evidence that the reasons for this difference are multi-factorial and need further exploration. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not. Improving local information provision and communication pathways during times of the pandemic, could aid understanding of risk and promote adherence to social distancing restrictions.","Hassan, Shaima M; Ring, Adele; Tahir, Naheed; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,263,1

For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and future are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so severe, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease spread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all of these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to facilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we report results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated real-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for COVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available data from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the pandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses.

This measure aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus and the resulting severe respira-tory condition that frequently besets older adults. However, this measure can also affect the support networks of these isolated people. Objectives: To explore the emerging needs related to the mental health of isolated older adults in this period and to identify the main support networks they have and the emerging coping strategies in the face of the situation. Methodology: We carried out an exploratory qualitative study, summoning participants over 60 years of age. Using snowball sampling, a group of researchers contacted them by phone to collect data. The analysis of the findings was triangulated among researchers with different academic backgrounds (medicine, psychology, and sociology). The concepts emerging from the interviews were linked in conceptual networks using an inductive methodology and were mapped into conceptual frameworks available to researchers. Atlas.ti 8 software was used for coding. Results: Thirty-nine participants belonging to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were interviewed between April and July 2020. For greater clarity, the main themes were described in five cross-sectional axes: network configurations, resources and coping strategies, affective states and emo-tions, perceptions and reflections on the future, and actions emerging from the participatory approach. Participants reported distress, anxiety, anger, uncertainty, exhaustion, and expressed fear of contagion from themselves and their loved ones. We identify greater vulnerability in people living alone, in small and closed environments, with weak linkages and networks, or limited access to technologies. We also found vari-ous coping strategies and technology was a fundamental factor in maintaining the bonds. Conclusions: The findings of this research have implications for decision-making at the individual level, health systems, professional care, and policy devel-opment. Future research may elucidate the regional, temporal, and socioeconomic variations of the phenomena explored in our research.","Pisula, Pedro; Salas Apaza, Julieta Aldana; Baez, Germán Nicolás; Loza, Candela Agustina; Valverdi, Rodrigo; Discacciati, Vilda; Granero, Mariano; Pizzorno Santoro, Ximena Salomé; Franco, Juan Víctor Ariel",Medwave,263,16

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who underwent psychiatric consultations. The medical records of 892 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the 89 among them who requested psychiatric consultations were analyzed retrospectively. After the psychiatric consultations, patients were most frequently diagnosed with delirium (38.2 %), adjustment disorder (27.0 %), depressive disorder (19.1 %) and anxiety disorder (11.2 %). Patients with delirium had longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), were transferred more frequently to intensive care units (p < 0.001), and had higher mortality rates during their hospital stays (p < 0.001), than all other patients. The need for oxygen (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) was also significantly higher in delirium patients, as well as in patients who received other psychiatric diagnoses. Neuropsychiatric disorders develop in patients receiving inpatient treatments in COVID-19 wards, and these disorders negatively affect the prognosis of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders in in-patients with COVID-19 might be associated with the negative outcomes of the disease.","Turan, Senol; Poyraz, Burç Çagri; Aksoy Poyraz, Cana; Demirel, Ömer Faruk; Tanriöver Aydin, Ezgi; Uçar Bostan, Büsra; Demirel, Öznur; Ali, Ritvan Kara",Asian J Psychiatr,263,16

The rapid increase in the number of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 and the lack of experienced radiologists can cause diagnostic errors in the interpretation of the images along with the exceptional workload occurring in this process. Therefore, the urgent development of automated diagnostic systems that can scan radiological images quickly and accurately is important in combating the pandemic. With this motivation, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model that can automatically detect patterns related to lesions caused by COVID-19 from chest computed tomography (CT) images is proposed in this study. In this context, the image ground-truth regarding the COVID-19 lesions scanned by the radiologist was evaluated as the main criteria of the segmentation process. A total of 16 040 CT image segments were obtained by applying segmentation to the raw 102 CT images. Then, 10 420 CT image segments related to healthy lung regions were labeled as COVID-negative, and 5620 CT image segments, in which the findings related to the lesions were detected in various forms, were labeled as COVID-positive. With the proposed CNN architecture, 93.26% diagnostic accuracy performance was achieved. The sensitivity and specificity performance metrics for the proposed automatic diagnosis model were 93.27% and 93.24%, respectively. Additionally, it has been shown that by scanning the small regions of the lungs, COVID-19 pneumonia can be localized automatically with high resolution and the lesion densities can be successfully evaluated quantitatively.","Polat, Hasan; Özerdem, Mehmet Siraç; Ekici, Faysal; Akpolat, Veysi",,263,23

Based on recent laboratory and epidemiological studies, a growing list of mutations in the virus has the potential to enhance its transmission or help it evade the immune response. To further compound the problems, there are considerable challenges to the availability of effective, affordable, safe vaccines on a mass scale. These impediments have led some to explore additional options available in traditional medicines, especially immune-boosting natural products. Saffron has been used for centuries to treat fever, bronchitis, cold and other immune, respiratory disorders. Herein, we discuss the potential role of saffron during and after COVID-19 infection, focusing on immunomodulation, respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular functions. As a nutraceutical or drug supplement, it can alleviate the magnitude of COVID-19 symptoms in patients. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other medicinal properties attributed to saffron bioactive compounds can help in both pre-and post- infection management strategies. The abnormalities associated with COVID-19 survivors include anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Saffron can help manage these post-hospitalization abnormalities (sub-acute and chronic) too, owing to its anti-depressant property. It can help common people boost immunity and manage depression, stress and anxiety caused due to prolonged lockdown, isolation or quarantine.","Husaini, Amjad M; Jan, Khan Nadiya; Wani, Gowher A",Heliyon,263,1

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6â¯days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.","Wang, Lishi; Li, Jing; Guo, Sumin; Xie, Ning; Yao, Lan; Cao, Yanhong; Day, Sara W; Howard, Scott C; Graff, J Carolyn; Gu, Tianshu; Ji, Jiafu; Gu, Weikuan; Sun, Dianjun",Sci Total Environ,263,23

However, there appears to be no well-established medication treatment available that can do this reliably at the present time. Anti-malarials currently being evaluated, i.e., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are not yet established as effective medications, and antiviral agents, including remdesivir, are only weakly active. This position paper report is focused on the modulation of the cytokine storm since it appears to be a major cause of the multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Whereas corticosteroids are not recommended in patients not on mechanical ventilation, immunotherapy with convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been used with some success in COVID-19. There is emerging new evidence that polyvalent immunoglobulins (PVIG) from bovine colostrum given orally can also modulate the immune response. Research using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients (a so called micro-cytokine storm) has shown that PVIG block the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We have been able to confirm these results in a similar model using mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and could demonstrate that the modulations produced by PVIG are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those obtained using human immunoglobulin (IVIG). Both immunoglobulins reduce the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-) 12/23p40 (-90%), IL-6 (-75%) and TNF-&#945; (-60%) and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (+75%). Evidence is presented that PVIG can produce anti-inflammatory effects similar to these after oral application in patients. Its use is contraindicated in patients with lactose intolerance but is otherwise safe and free of complications in clinical studies including the treatment of infants with gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: PVIG appears to be a potential and safe anti-inflammatory agent and can be recommended as a candidate medication for studies in COVID-19 patients.","Sly, Laura M; Braun, Peter; Woodcock, Barry G",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,263,16

For this purpose, paper-based assays and microfluidic platforms are currently being extensively studied, and much focus is being directed towards simplifying their design while simultaneously improving multiplexing and automation capabilities. Signal amplification strategies are being applied to improve the performance of assays with respect to both sensitivity and selectivity, while smartphones are being integrated to expand the analytical power of the technology and promote its accessibility.

During 2020, a total of 7,163 TB cases were provisionally reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) by the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC), a relative reduction of 20%, compared with the number of cases reported during 2019.* TB incidence per 100,000 persons was 2.2 during 2020, compared with 2.7 during 2019. Since 2010, TB incidence has decreased by an average of 2%-3% annually (1). Pandemic mitigation efforts and reduced travel might have contributed to the reported decrease. The magnitude and breadth of the decrease suggest potentially missed or delayed TB diagnoses. Health care providers should consider TB disease when evaluating patients with signs and symptoms consistent with TB (e.g., cough of >2 weeks in duration, unintentional weight loss, and hemoptysis), especially when diagnostic tests are negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, members of the public should be encouraged to follow up with their health care providers for any respiratory illness that persists or returns after initial treatment. The steep, unexpected decline in TB cases raises concerns of missed cases, and further work is in progress to better understand factors associated with the decline.","Deutsch-Feldman, Molly; Pratt, Robert H; Price, Sandy F; Tsang, Clarisse A; Self, Julie L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,263,16

After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e. COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO. As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO. (Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83). It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China. A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals. Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan. They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2. This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people. Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults. This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts. The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries. Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up. The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections. A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic. However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.","Kaul, Dinesh",,263,24

Multiple approaches have been applied to relieve pressure on and support existing healthcare. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the national healthcare system. Since 5 June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics have been established nationwide. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 2733 patients subjected to the MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine) and followed up for 3-7 days after initiation. Data were collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality Committee. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty patients (8.8%) discontinued treatment because of side effects (4.1%) and non-clinical reasons (4.7%). Adverse effects were reported among 6.7% of all participants, including mainly cardiovascular symptoms (2.5%; 0.15% with corrected QT prolongation) and gastrointestinal symptoms (2.4%). No intensive care unit admission or death was reported among these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results show that hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms in an outpatient setting with the recommended protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria is safe, is highly tolerable and has minimal side effects.","Mohana, Abdulrhman; Sulaiman, Tarek; Mahmoud, Nagla; Hassanein, Mustafa; Alfaifi, Amel; Alenazi, Eissa; Radwan, Nashwa; AlKhalifah, Nasser; Elkady, Ehab; Almohaizeie, Abdullah; AboGazalah, Fouad; AlabdulKareem, Khaled; AlGhofaili, Fahad; Jokhdar, Hani; Alrabiah, Fahad",Int J Infect Dis,263,32

If this matrix is enhanced by being interpreted as a probabilistic Universe of Discourse, it still suffers from two inter-related shortcomings, arising from lack of length/area proportionality and a potential misconception concerning a false assumption of independence between the two underlying events. This paper remedies these two shortcomings by modifying this matrix into a new Karnaugh-map-like diagram that resembles an eikosogram. Furthermore, the paper suggests the use of a pair of functionally complementary versions of this diagram to handle any ternary problem of conditional probability. The two diagrams split the unknowns and equations between themselves in a fashion that allows the use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle such a problem. The method of solution is demonstrated via four examples, in which the solution might be arithmetic or algebraic, and independently might be numerical or symbolic. In particular, we provide a symbolic arithmetic derivation of the well-known formulas that express the predictive values in terms of prevalence, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we prove a virtually unknown interdependence among the two predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. In fact, we employ a method of symbolic algebraic derivation to express any one of these four indicators in terms of the other three. The contribution of this paper to the diagnostic testing aspects of mathematical epidemiology culminates in a timely application to the estimation of the true prevalence of the contemporary world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. It turns out that this estimation is hindered more by the lack of global testing world-wide rather than by the unavoidable imperfection of the available testing methods.","Rushdi, Ali Muhammad Ali; Serag, Hamzah Abdul Majid",Int.

A previous cross-sectional study in middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort demonstrated that 45% of participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 77% of whom were symptomatic. Here, we assessed the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the above-mentioned rural population. One month after baseline testing, 362 of 370 initially seronegative individuals were re-tested to assess incidence of seroconversion and associated risk factors. Twenty-eight of them (7.7%) became seropositive. The overall incidence rate ratio was 7.4 per 100 person months of potential virus exposure (95% C.I.: 4.7-10.2). Six seroconverted individuals (21.4%) developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptomatology. The only covariate significantly associated with seroconversion was the use of an open latrine. Predictive margins showed that these individuals were 2.5 times more likely to be infected (95% C.I.: 1.03-6.1) than those using a flushing toilet. Therefore, along one month, approximately 8% of seronegative individuals became infected, even after almost half of the population was already seropositive. Nevertheless, a smaller proportion of incident cases were symptomatic (21% versus 77% of the earlier cases), and no deaths were recorded. Whether this decreased clinical expression resulted from a lower viral load in new infections cannot be determined. Increased seroconversion in individuals using latrines is consistent with a contributory role of fecal-oral transmission, although we cannot rule out the possibility that latrines are acting as a proxy for poverty or other unknown interacting variables.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Costa, Aldo F; Mera, Robertino M; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Bustos, Javier A; García, Héctor H",Pathog Glob Health,263,20

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation (&#8804; 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (&#8805; 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen (&#8805; 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine (&#8805; 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","Bertsimas, Dimitris; Lukin, Galit; Mingardi, Luca; Nohadani, Omid; Orfanoudaki, Agni; Stellato, Bartolomeo; Wiberg, Holly; Gonzalez-Garcia, Sara; Parra-Calderón, Carlos Luis; Robinson, Kenneth; Schneider, Michelle; Stein, Barry; Estirado, Alberto; A Beccara, Lia; Canino, Rosario; Dal Bello, Martina; Pezzetti, Federica; Pan, Angelo",PLoS One,263,21

This paper treats mainstream news about the current pandemic as a valuable entry point for analyzing the relationship between science and politics in the public sphere, where the outbreak must be both understood and confronted through appropriate public-health policy decisions. In doing so, the paper aims to examine which actors, institutions, and experts dominate the SARS-CoV-2 media narratives, with particular attention to the roles of political, medical, and scientific actors and institutions within the pandemic crisis. The study relies on a large dataset consisting of all SARS-CoV-2 articles published by eight major Italian national newspapers between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. These articles underwent a quantitative analysis based on a topic modeling technique. The topic modeling outputs were further analyzed by innovatively combining ad-hoc metrics and a classifier based on the stacking ensemble method (combining regularized logistic regression and linear stochastic gradient descent) for quantifying scientific salience. This enabled the identification of relevant topics and the analysis of the roles that different actors and institutions engaged in making sense of the pandemic. The results show how the health emergency has been addressed primarily in terms of political regulation and concerns and only marginally as a scientific matter. Hence, science has been overwhelmed by politics, which, in media narratives, exerts a moral as well as regulatory authority. Media narratives exclude neither scientific issues nor scientific experts; rather, they configure them as a subsidiary body of knowledge and expertise to be mobilized as an ancillary, impersonal institution useful for legitimizing the expansion of political jurisdiction over the governance of the emergency.","Crabu, Stefano; Giardullo, Paolo; Sciandra, Andrea; Neresini, Federico",PLoS One,263,24

Recently, vaccines from various companies have been urgently approved to control SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, any specific antiviral drug has not been confirmed so far for regular treatment. An important target is the main protease (Mpro ), which plays a major role in replication of the virus. In this study, Gaussian and residue network models are employed to reveal two distinct potential allosteric sites on Mpro that can be evaluated as drug targets besides the active site. Then, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs are docked to three distinct sites with flexible docking using AutoDock Vina to identify potential drug candidates. Fourteen best molecule hits for the active site of Mpro are determined. Six of these also exhibit high docking scores for the potential allosteric regions. Full-atom molecular dynamics simulations with MM-GBSA method indicate that compounds docked to active and potential allosteric sites form stable interactions with high binding free energy (&#8710;Gbind ) values. &#8710;Gbind values reach -52.06 kcal/mol for the active site, -51.08 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 1, and - 42.93 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 2. Energy decomposition calculations per residue elucidate key binding residues stabilizing the ligands that can further serve to design pharmacophores. This systematic and efficient computational analysis successfully determines ivermectine, diosmin, and selinexor currently subjected to clinical trials, and further proposes bromocriptine, elbasvir as Mpro inhibitor candidates to be evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Yuce, Merve; Cicek, Erdem; Inan, Tugce; Dag, Aslihan Basak; Kurkcuoglu, Ozge; Sungur, Fethiye Aylin",Proteins,263,20

We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID 19. The patients' history, physical examination, CT findings, RT PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID 19 or non-COVID 19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID 19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen's kappa analysis was used. RESULTS: Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID 19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID 19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 S CT classification system may meet the needs of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies and help optimize patient management and disease control in this pandemic by the use of structured reporting.","Gezer, Naciye Sinem; Ergan, Begüm; Baris, Mustafa Mahmut; Appak, Özgür; Sayiner, Ayça Arzu; Balci, Pinar; Kuruüzüm, Ziya; Çavus, Sema Alp; Kilinç, Oguz",Diagn Interv Radiol,263,17

Results: Patients with previous tonsillectomy showed a greater risk of fever, temperature higher than 39°C, chills and malaise. No significant differences in hospital admissions were found. Conclusions: A previous history of tonsillectomy, as a surrogate indicator of immunological dysfunction of the pharyngeal associated lymphoid tissue, could predict a more intense systemic manifestation of COVID-19.

But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the ""loss from anarchy"" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.","Holtz, David; Zhao, Michael; Benzell, Seth G; Cao, Cathy Y; Rahimian, Mohammad Amin; Yang, Jeremy; Allen, Jennifer; Collis, Avinash; Moehring, Alex; Sowrirajan, Tara; Ghosh, Dipayan; Zhang, Yunhao; Dhillon, Paramveer S; Nicolaides, Christos; Eckles, Dean; Aral, Sinan",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,263,25

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the key factors that may enhance the adoption of health-protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco and India. A theoretical framework derived from the health belief model (HBM) was used for this research. Data was collected from a sample of 444 adult individuals split across Morocco (n = 215) and India (n = 229). Data analysis was carried out using two-stage multiple-analytic techniques. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to rank the significant independent variables obtained from SEM analysis. The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy. For the Indian sample, both SEM analysis and the ANN model revealed that the impact of perceived susceptibility on the adoption of the protective measure is stronger than that of cues to action. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are also discussed toward the end.","Jadil, Yassine; Ouzir, Mounir",Environ Res,263,2

Since virus incidences are still on rise, infectivity and mortality may also rise in the near future, natural products are highly considered to be valuable sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. This present review aims to comprehensively summarize the up-to-date scientific literatures on biological activities of plant- and mushroom-derived compounds relevant to mechanistic targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory-associated pathogenesis, including viral entry, replication and release, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Experimental procedure: Data were retrieved from a literature search available on PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases and collected until the end of May 2020. The findings from in vitro cell and non-cell based studies were considered, while the results of in silico studies were excluded. Results and conclusion: Based on the previous findings in SARS-CoV studies, except in silico molecular docking analysis, herein, we provide a total of 150 natural compounds as potential candidates for development of new anti-COVID-19 drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the existing therapeutic agents. Several natural compounds have showed their promising actions on multiple therapeutic targets, which should be further explored. Among them, quercetin, one of the most abundant of plant flavonoids, is proposed as a lead candidate with its ability on the virus side to inhibit SARS-CoV spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, viral protease and helicase activities, as well as on the host cell side to inhibit ACE activity and increase intracellular zinc level.","Prasansuklab, Anchalee; Theerasri, Atsadang; Rangsinth, Panthakarn; Sillapachaiyaporn, Chanin; Chuchawankul, Siriporn; Tencomnao, Tewin",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,263,10

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, severity and risk factors of the more severe COVID-19 course among MS and NMOSD patients. METHODS: From March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, 12 MS centres, representing 70% of the Czech MS and NMOSD population, reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases via the Czech nationwide register of MS and NMOSD patients (ReMuS). The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on an 8-point scale with a cut-off at 4 (radiologically confirmed pneumonia) according to the World Health Organisation´s (WHO) COVID-19 severity assessment. RESULTS: We identified 958 MS and 13 NMOSD patients, 50 MS and 4 NMOSD patients had pneumonia, 3 MS and 2 NMOSD patients died. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with MS seems to be similar to the general Czech population. A multivariate logistic regression determined that higher body mass index (BMI [OR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.14]), older age (OR per 10 years 2.01, 95% CI, 1.41-2.91), high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset (OR 2.83, 95% CI, 0.10-7.48) and anti-CD20 therapy (OR 7.04, 95% CI, 3.10-15.87) were independent variables associated with pneumonia in MS patients. Increase odds of pneumonia in anti-CD20 treated MS patients compared to patients with other disease-modifying therapy (same age, sex, BMI, high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset, presence of pulmonary comorbidity) were confirmed by propensity score matching (OR 8.90, 95% CI, 3.04-33.24). Reports on COVID-19 infection in patients with NMOSD are scarce, however, data available up to now suggest a high risk of a more severe COVID-19 course as well as a higher mortality rate among NMOSD patients. In our cohort, 4 NMOSD patients (30.77%) had the more severe COVID-19 course and 2 patients (15.39%) died. CONCLUSION: The majority of MS patients had a mild COVID-19 course contrary to NMOSD patients, however, higher BMI and age, anti-CD20 therapy and high-dose glucocorticoid treatment during the 2 months before COVID-19 onset were associated with pneumonia. Based on this study, we have already started an early administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and preferential vaccination in the risk group of patients.","Stastna, Dominika; Menkyova, Ingrid; Drahota, Jiri; Mazouchova, Aneta; Adamkova, Jana; Ampapa, Radek; Grunermelova, Marketa; Peterka, Marek; Recmanova, Eva; Rockova, Petra; Rous, Matous; Stetkarova, Ivana; Valis, Martin; Vachova, Marta; Woznicova, Ivana; Horakova, Dana",Mult Scler Relat Disord,263,1

The existence of superspreading implies a fat-tailed distribution of infectiousness (new secondary infections caused per day) among different individuals. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the variation in infectiousness by examining the variation in early-time growth rates of new cases among different subpopulations. We use this method to estimate the mean and variance in the infectiousness, ß, for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early stages of the pandemic within the United States. We find that &#963;ß/µß â³ 3.2, where µß is the mean infectiousness and &#963;ß its standard deviation, which implies pervasive superspreading.

Here, we combine several instantiations of this (epidemic) model to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunityand the exchange of people between regionsand how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium. © 2021 Friston KJ et al.","Razi, A.; Friston, K.

They are typically assessed using validated, self-completed questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are used in healthcare settings to support care planning, clinical decision-making, patient-practitioner communication and quality improvement. PROMs have a potential role in the delivery of social care where people often have multiple and complex long-term health conditions. However, the use of PROMs in this context is currently unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the evidence relating to the use of PROMs in adult social care. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The electronic databases Medline (Ovid), PsychInfo (Ovid), ASSIA (ProQuest), Social Care Online (SCIE), Web of Science and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched on 29 September 2020 to identify eligible studies and other publically available documents published since 2010. A grey literature search and hand searching of citations and reference lists of the included studies will also be undertaken. No restrictions on study design or language of publication will be applied. Screening and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Quality appraisal of the included documents will use the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and AACODS (Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance) checklists. A customised data charting table will be used for data extraction, with analysis of qualitative data using the framework method. The review findings will be presented as tables and in a narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical review is not required as scoping reviews are a form of secondary data analysis that synthesise data from publically available sources. Review findings will be shared with service users and other relevant stakeholders and disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

It is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in China lately, they have increased exponentially in other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran. In India, the COVID-19 trajectory appears assured to change modes. While the number of incidents grew slowly in February, they doubled in just five days in mid-March from 100 to more than 236, and now at the end of April, the cases reported are 29,435. These numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing. . The Indian government declared a countrywide shutdown for a period of 3 weeks from 24th of March to help prevent the spread of the virus. Most of the affected people had connection with flyers from covid-19 affected countries; some of them had no such interaction, indicating that community transmission could have started in several parts of India. Thus, an important collective goal is to reduce the outbreak and to flatten the peak of the outbreak curve. Cooperation is a crucial tool in the COVID-19 battle. There is a need to identify and find a way around the particular threats, the overarching cultural and social patterns in our area.

Elevated levels of troponin have been noted to predict worse prognosis for COVID-19 patients, regardless the physiology of insult. We report a case of a 65-year old man who was admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 disease that rapidly decompensated and required mechanical ventilation. He responded well with medical treatment and was successfully extubated. Interestingly, his serum troponin T levels remained negative (<0.01 ng/mL) until day 10, when it was noted to be elevated despite him being completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed new left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggestive of reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, he suffered from a pulseless electrical arrest less than 24 hours later and eventually expired. This case shows that a policy of trending troponin levels may be valuable as a screening tool for critically ill COVID-19 patients and may be beneficial for early silent validation of cardiovascular involvement in these patients, who could otherwise be asymptomatic yet presage adverse clinical events.

This study highlights the level of compliance with infection control measures among dental students; and linked this to their knowledge and attitudes regarding infection control measures and proper vaccinations. The study is a multi-centre analytical cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 969 clinical years' students from governmental and private dental colleges in Sudan and Saudi Arabia. A pre-coded, pre-tested, and anonymous questionnaire consisted of seven categories of knowledge, attitude, awareness, and practices, including 40 questions, was answered. The study has linked knowledge, attitude, and practice in dental clinics with possible COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. The results showed that the use of some Personal Protective Equipment was low in Sudan and moderate in Saudi Arabia (statistically significant, p < 0.001). Moderate percentage of Hepatitis B vaccination status, with low percentage of Post HBV serology, was reported (p < 0.001). The percentages of major causes of percutaneous and/or eye exposure/injury, for examples, were as follows: anesthesia (33.3-62.7%, p 0.006) and suture needle (17.5-39.4%, p 0.037). In conclusion, dental students in the present study had good knowledge and positive attitudes regarding infection control in general, but showed moderate compliance with the recommended infection control guidelines.","Elagib, Mohamed F A; Baldo, Sara M H; Tawfig, Ahmed; Alqarni, Mohammed A; Ghandour, I A; Idris, Abubakr M",Arch Environ Occup Health,263,19

In this research, data has been collected from 70 cities/provinces of different countries around the world that are affected by COVID-19. In this research, environmental data such as temperatures, humidity, air quality and population density and socio-economic data such as GDP (PPP) per capita, per capita health expenditure, life expectancy and total test in each of these cities/provinces are considered. This data has been analyzed using statistical models such as Poisson and negative binomial models. It is found that a negative binomial regression model is the best fit for our data. Our results reveal that higher population density found to be an important factor for the quick spreading of COVID-19 where it is quite impossible to maintain the social distance and the virus can spread easily. Moreover, GDP (PPP) and PM2.5 are linked with the fewer of COVID-19 whereas PM10, and total number of tests are strongly associated with the increase of COVID-19.","Ahmed, Jishan; Jaman, Md Hasnat; Saha, Goutam; Ghosh, Pratyya",Heliyon,263,16

It has been studied primarily among military personnel and Veterans and has been found to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric symptoms. Recently, research has begun to investigate MI and its potential risk factors. Difficulties with emotion regulation (ER), which refers to difficulties with managing and moderating emotions, is a transdiagnostic factor associated with several psychiatric conditions, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relations among MI;symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress;and difficulties with ER in a sample of Canadian military personnel and Veterans. A secondary aim was to discuss the potential relevance of these relations for military personnel, Veterans, and front-line health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Assessments of MI, PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress, and difficulties with ER were administered to Canadian military personnel and Veterans. Correlational analyses were used to assess the relation of MI to these symptoms. Results: Increased levels of MI were associated with avoidance and alterations in mood and cognition symptom clusters of PTSD. Perceived betrayals were also significantly correlated with PTSD-related alterations in mood and cognition symptoms. Symptoms of PTSD were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Difficulties with ER were significantly correlated with symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress, but not with MI (p = 0.07). Discussion: These results reveal an association between MI and specific symptom clusters of PTSD, and they highlight the association between difficulties with ER and symptoms of psychiatric illness among Canadian military personnel and Veterans. The potential implications of these findings and future work examining MI in military personnel, Veterans, and front-line health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Defence, (2020).","Protopopescu, A.; Boyd, J.

METHODS: A record-based case-series study conducted from March 23 to June 15, 2020 in King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, complications, and in-hospital outcome of COVID-19 patients collected with analysis of the clinical characteristics for survivors and deceased. RESULTS: A total of 768 patients were included. The mean age was 46.36±13.7 years and 76.7% were men. Approximately 96.3% reported more than one comorbidity; diabetes mellitus was the most frequent (46.4%). Fever (84.5%), cough (82.3%), and shortness of breath (79.8%) were the main presenting symptoms. During the follow-up, pneumonia reported in 68.6%, acute respiratory distress syndrome in 32.7%, septic shock in 20.7%, respiratory failure in 20.3%, and acute kidney injury in 19.3%.

To understand the behavior of the newly emerging MERS-CoV requires knowledge at different levels (epidemiologic, antigenic, and pathogenic), and this knowledge can be generated from the most related viruses. In this study, we aimed to compare between 3 species of Coronavirus, namely Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and NeoCoV regarding whole genomes and 6 similar proteins (E, M, N, S, ORF1a, and ORF1ab) using different bioinformatics tools to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the 3 viruses at the nucleotide and amino acids levels. All sequences have been retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Regards to target genomes’ phylogenetic analysis showed that MERS and SARS-CoVs were closer to each other compared with NeoCoV, and the last has the longest relative time. We found that all phylogenetic methods in addition to all parameters (physical and chemical properties of amino acids such as the number of amino acid, molecular weight, atomic composition, theoretical pI, and structural formula) indicated that NeoCoV proteins were the most related to MERS-CoV one. All phylogenetic trees (by both maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining methods) indicated that NeoCoV proteins have less evolutionary changes except for ORF1a by just maximum-likelihood method. Our results indicated high similarity between viral structural proteins which are responsible for viral infectivity; therefore, we expect that NeoCoV sooner may appear in human-related infection.","Hassan, Mohamed M; Hussain, Mohamed A; Kambal, Sumaya; Elshikh, Ahmed A; Gendeel, Osama R; Ahmed, Siddig A; Altayeb, Rami A; Muhajir, Abdelhafiz MA; Mohamed, Sofia B",Infect.

METHODS: This is a multicenter, international survey among practicing ophthalmologists across different countries. The survey was conducted from September 9th to October 24th, 2020. It included a total of 23 questions that navigated through the currently adopted recommendations in different clinical situations. The survey also assessed the convenience of using various PPE in ophthalmic practice and addressed the clarity of the examination field while using various PPE during clinical or surgical procedures. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two ophthalmologists completed the survey (101 from Egypt, 50 from the USA, and 21 from four other countries). The analysis of the responses showed that most ophthalmologists use face masks without significant problems during their examinations, while face shields followed by protective goggles were the most inconvenient PPE in the current ophthalmic practice. Moreover, most of the participants (133, 77.3%) noticed an increase in their examination time when using PPE. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of the respondents (70, 40.7%) stopped using one or more of the PPE due to inconvenience or discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the unique nature of the ophthalmic examination, certain PPE are not ophthalmologist-friendly. Innovative PPE should be tailored for prompt, more convenient, and clearer ophthalmological practice.","Ashour, Doaa Maamoun; Elkitkat, Rania Serag; Gabr, Hesham; Yosef, Mostafa; Singh Grewal, Dilraj; Saleh, Mohamed Ibrahim",Eur J Ophthalmol,263,20

The dynamics of this pandemic is quite complicated and prediction of pandemic states often fails. In this work, we study and correlate the SIR epidemiological model with the ongoing pandemic and found that pandemic dynamics and states are quite sensitively dependent on model parameters. The analysis of the exact parametric solution of the deterministic SIR model shows that the fixed points ($g^*$) depend on the SIR parameters, where, if $g^*\langle\frac{\gamma}{\beta x_0}$ then $g^*$ is stable and the pandemic can be controlled, whereas, if $g^*\rangle\frac{\gamma}{\beta x_0}$ then $g^*$ is unstable indicating active pandemic state, and $g^*=0$ corresponds to an endemic state. The dynamics show asymptotic stability bifurcation. The analytical solution of the stochastic SIR model allows to predict endemic time $t_E\propto\frac{1}{\gamma}$ and mean infected population becomes constant for small values of $\gamma$. The noise in the system even can modulate pandemic dynamics. Hence, we estimated the values of these parameters during lockdown periods using the ABC SSA algorithm and found strong dependence on control strategy, namely, lockdown and follows power-law behaviors. The numerical results show strong agreement with the real data and have the positive effect of social distancing or lockdown in the pandemic control.","Bhadana, Jyoti; Singh, R. K. Brojen",,263,26

Nevertheless, data on this novel infection in patients with a diagnosis of cancer receiving active treatment are scarce and it is unknown if these recommendations could have repercussions on future progress of the disease. The main objective of this study is to learn the COVID-19 incidence rate in outpatients with cancer receiving active treatment. METHODS: This work is a retrospective cohort study that included all patients with a diagnosis of cancer who received active cancer treatment in two Andalusian hospitals between February 26 and May 13, 2020. Variables regarding the patient, tumor, and development of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in these patients was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 673 patients were included. The median age was 62 years. There was a low rate of comorbidity and 12.1% had an ECOG >2. Breast cancer was the most common cancer (41%), followed by colorectal and lung cancer. Stage IV cancer was reported in 52.7% of patients. The most common treatment was chemotherapy (53.9%). Treatment was delayed or suspended in 6% of patients. Only three patients developed COVID-19. The cumulative incidence was 0.44% and one person died due to infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective cohort study we found a low incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer receiving active treatment in an outpatient setting. The sociodemographic factors of Andalusia may explain why these results differ from those presented by other colleagues in Spain, but raise questions about whether universal recommendations may put the benefits of antineoplastic therapy at risk.","Martín-Bravo, Celia; Quirós, Raúl; Blancas, Isabel; Villatoro-Roldán, Rosa; Robles, Marta; Alcaide, Julia; Navarro, Víctor; Pérez, Diego; Zarcos, Irene; Rivas-Ruiz, Francisco; Pérez-Ruiz, Elisabeth; Quero, Cristina",Semin. oncol,263,1

High doses of UV-C required for high-level disinfection were found to cause oxidation and photodegradation of endogenous species. Lower UV-C doses maintaining inactivation of clinically relevant pathogens to a level of increased operator safety were found to be less destructive to the tissue metabolome and xenobiotics. These doses caused less alterations of the tissue metabolome and allowed elucidation of the biodistribution of the endogenous metabolites.

RESULTS: The differences between the results of the two tests were not significant for both the olfaction (P =.201) and the taste (P =.180). CONCLUSION: The olfactory and gustatory evaluation by self-administered test can be considered a valid tool, fundamental for obtaining objective qualitative and quantitative data on the extent of chemosensitive disorders in home-quarantined COVID-19 patients.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo; Salzano, Giovanni; Petrocelli, Marzia; Deiana, Giovanna; Salzano, Francesco Antonio; De Riu, Giacomo",Head Neck,263,26

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment. KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531-56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850-85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income ($10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89, 0.96), p < 0.001).

The office term is 2 years. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to learn and inform about the results of MIRAI's activities. METHODS: We surveyed the trends in new obstetrician-gynecologists and also matched each seminar participant with them. RESULT: The number of new memberships has been increasing since the nadir in 2016. In particular, there are over 100 more new physicians specializing in the field in 2020 than there were at the nadir in 2016. It was revealed that approximately 50% of the participants in the summer school specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, approximately 70% of POP2 participants specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, which shows that these two recruitment seminars are extraordinarily effective events that result in an increase in the number of new obstetricians and gynecologists. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the activities of this MIRAI Committee and JTOG have been effective. With the spread of COVID-19 and the inability of obstetrician-gynecologists and students/clinical trainees to perform social distancing, it is currently difficult to hold hands-on seminars.

Here, we examine the role of CD8+PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (Tils) in the tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Tumor tissue samples of a total of 378 patients from two NSCLC cohorts were collected retrospectively. Tumor genetic variations were measured by targeted next-generation sequencing of 543 oncogenes. Tils were assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry assay. Correlations among Tils, tumor genetic variations, and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of CD8+PD-L1+ Tils varied in NSCLC tumor tissues. Tumor samples with high CD8+PD-L1+ Tils had higher levels of CD8+ Tils, CD68+ macrophages, PD-L1+ tumor cells, PD-1+ Tils, and CD163+ M2-type macrophages, and also had a higher tumor mutation burden, all of which collectively constituted a typically hot but immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in a non-immunotherapy cohort, we observed that the higher the CD8+PD-L1+ Tils level in the tumor tissue, the worse the prognosis (progression-free survival; cohort A, stage I-II tumor; p=0.005). Contrarily, in an immunotherapy cohort, where the immune suppression was blocked by anti-PD-1 treatment, the higher the CD8+PD-L1+ Tils level, the better the response to the anti-PD-1 treatment (complete response/partial response vs stable disease/progressive disease; cohort B; p=0.0337). CONCLUSIONS: CD8+PD-L1+ Tils may be an indicator of the hot but immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment which is related to a high tumor mutation burden. PD-1 pathway blockade therapy can help to mitigate this immunosuppression and obtain better curative effects.","Zhang, Libin; Chen, Yanhui; Wang, Han; Xu, Zheyuan; Wang, Yang; Li, Sixing; Liu, Jun; Chen, Yun; Luo, Hongli; Wu, Lijia; Yang, Ying; Zhang, Henghui; Peng, Hao",J. immunotherap. cancer,263,16

The salt recrystallization following aerosol exposure was characterized over time on sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) powders and coatings, which revealed that NaCl and KCl start to recrystallize within 5 min and K2SO4 within 15 min. The inactivation kinetics observed for the H1N1 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae matched the salt recrystallization well, which was identified as the main destabilizing mechanism. Additionally, the salt-coated filters were prepared with different methods (with and without a vacuum process), which led to salt coatings with different morphologies for diverse applications. Finally, the salt-coated filters caused a loss of pathogen viability independent of transmission mode (aerosols or droplets), against both DI water and artificial saliva suspensions. Overall, these findings increase our understanding of the salt-recrystallization-based technology to develop highly versatile antimicrobial filters.","Rubino, Ilaria; Han, Sumin; Oh, Euna; Kumaran, Surjith; Lawson, Matthew; Jung, Yu-Jin; Kim, Ki-Hye; Bhatnagar, Noopur; Lee, Su-Hwa; Kang, Hae-Ji; Lee, Dong-Hun; Chu, Ki-Back; Kang, Sang-Moo; Quan, Fu-Shi; Choi, Hyo-Jick",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,263,22

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, â¼30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to predict regions of high base pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hotspots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of sgRNA from gRNA, is a unique advantage of our in-silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology, and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets.Importance The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, and yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. Here we show that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we develop a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we find that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","Tavares, Rafael de Cesaris Araujo; Mahadeshwar, Gandhar; Wan, Han; Huston, Nicholas C; Pyle, Anna Marie",J. virol,263,23

We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses. METHODS: We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, symptom checking, and test cost on outcomes including case reduction and false positives. FINDINGS: Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32. INTERPRETATION: A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance.","Lyng, Gregory D; Sheils, Natalie E; Kennedy, Caleb J; Griffin, Daniel O; Berke, Ethan M",PLoS One,263,16

In particular, we focus on the peak number of critically infected nodes (PCIN), determining the maximum workload of intensive healthcare units that should be kept low when managing an epidemic. As a realistic model and simulation method, we developed a continuous-time Markov chain model, and an open-source available efficient simulation software based on Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). Virus propagation is compared on random graph models featuring a selected range of complex network topologies: Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, Barabási-Albert and complete graph (Clique). Continuous-time Markov chains are used to simulate the infection process. The simulation was performed in networks with 200 nodes and different numbers of edges. In addition, we study age- and gender-determined and weighted characteristics of nodes on the PCIN as well as the correlation of macroscopic graph characteristics such as the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. The analysis used the data of the demographic distribution of Ukraine as of 2020 and data on mortality from COVID-19 in Ukraine, as of December 16, 2020. It is proved that the deterministic characteristics slightly lower values of critically infected, in small networks for the used dataset. The simulations show that the increase of the average shortest path length is significant on the reduction of the PCIN, whereas other characteristics such as clustering and age distribution, are of lesser importance. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of ""a compromised immune system"" (n = 854, 7.6%). We adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults to others using &#967;2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression and estimated conditional odds ratios (cOR) with 95% CIs. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors, including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%, &#967;2 <0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%, &#967;2 <0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%, &#967;2 <0.001). Hispanic immunocompromised adults (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to non-Hispanic White immunocompromised adults and men, respectively. Immunocompromised adults reported higher odds of feeling nervous/anxious/on edge (cOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44-2.51), depressed (cOR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.17-3.64), lonely (cOR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.74-2.98), and hopeless (cOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.21-3.69) 3-7 days in the last week. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to cancel their doctor's appointments and report COVID19-related mental health symptoms. The continuity of care of immunocompromised adults should be prioritized through alternative interventions, such as telehealth.","Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise Christina; Havanur, Amoghvarsha; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,263,20

We aimed to assess characteristics of journal articles, preprint articles, and registered trial protocols about COVID-19 and its causal agent SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of journal articles with original data indexed by March 19, 2020, in World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 collection, articles published on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv by April 3, 2010. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of clinical trials indexed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) by April 7, 2020. RESULTS: Among the first 2118 articles on COVID-19 published in scholarly journals, 533 (25%) contained original data. The majority was published by authors from China (75%) and funded by Chinese sponsors (75%); a quarter was published in the Chinese language. Among 312 articles that self-reported study design, the most frequent were retrospective studies (N = 88; 28%) and case reports (N = 86; 28%), analyzing patients' characteristics (38%). Median Journal Impact Factor of journals where articles were published was 5.099. Among 1088 analyzed preprint articles, the majority came from authors affiliated in China (51%) and were funded by sources in China (46%). Less than half reported study design; the majority were modeling studies (62%), and analyzed transmission/risk/prevalence (43%). Of the 927 analyzed registered trials, the majority were interventional (58%). Half were already recruiting participants. The location for the conduct of the trial in the majority was China (N = 522; 63%). The median number of planned participants was 140 (range: 1 to 15,000,000). Registered intervention trials used highly heterogeneous primary outcomes and tested highly heterogeneous interventions; the most frequently studied interventions were hydroxychloroquine (N = 39; 7.2%) and chloroquine (N = 16; 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Early articles on COVID-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modeling studies. The diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for COVID-19 research. Chinese scholars had a head start in reporting about the new disease, but publishing articles in Chinese may limit their global reach. Mapping publications with original data can help finding gaps that will help us respond better to the new public health emergency.","Fidahic, Mahir; Nujic, Danijela; Runjic, Renata; Civljak, Marta; Markotic, Filipa; Lovric Makaric, Zvjezdana; Puljak, Livia",BMC Med Res Methodol,263,24

There have been many social and economic benefits to this digital disruption, but it has also largely contributed to the digital destruction of mental model alignment and shared situational awareness through the propagation of mis-information i.e. reinforcement of dissonant mental models by recommender algorithms, bots and trusted individual platform users (influencers). To mitigate this process of digital destruction, new methods and approaches to the centralized management of these platforms are needed to build on and encourage trust in the actors that use them (and by association trust in their mental models).

METHODS: COVID-19-positive cases of Istanbul Morgue Department were retrospectively analyzed. Sampling indications for PCR tests in suspicious deaths, macroscopic and microscopic findings obtained in cases with positive PCR tests were evaluated. RESULTS: In the morgue department, 345(25.8%) of overall 1336 autopsy cases were tested for COVID-19. PCR test was found positive in 26 cases. Limited autopsy procedure was performed in 7 cases, while the cause of death was determined by external examination in the remaining 19 cases. Male-to-female ratio was found 3.3:1 and mean age was 60.0 ± 13.6 among all PCR-positive cases. Cause of death was determined as viral pneumonia in fully autopsied cases. Most common findings were sticky gelatinous fluid in cavities and firm and swollen lungs, varying degrees of consolidation. In microscopy, diffuse alveolar epithelial damage, type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, fibrinous exudate, and fibrinous plaques in the alveoli were the most common findings. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 autopsies, pulmonary findings were found to be prominent and the main pathology was pneumonia.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted between April 15, 2020, and May 5, 2020, included 6209 physicians working in KSA. An electronic questionnaire was designed and validated for the assessment of 3 categorical outcome variables, namely, attitudes, confidence, and knowledge levels. Pearson's chi-square test was used for comparing the distribution of the proportions of these 3 categorical variables. RESULTS: Most participants (63.2%) were willing and prepared to treat COVID-19 patients. A significantly large proportion of participants specializing in anesthesiology (78.2%) had higher knowledge levels, followed by those from plastic surgery (71.1%), pediatrics (69.7%), and obstetrics and gynecology (69.1%) (P < 0.0001). Lower confidence levels were found for airway management skills (38.1%), particularly among dermatologists and radiologists. CONCLUSION: Higher knowledge levels about personal protective equipment (PPE) use and confidence in airway management skills were proportionally related to the level of willingness to participate in COVID-19 patient management. There is an urgent need to train doctors from certain specialties on PPE use and airway management to enable their frontline support of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Malaekah, Haifaa; Aljahany, Muna; Alassaf, Wajdan; Alotaibi, Malak; Alsaffar, Mashael",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,263,1

DESIGN: Pilot cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Thirty-four men were distributed as: 1) patients in convalescence (patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pharyngeal swab according to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] or antibodies); 2) negative control group (no antibodies); and 3) patients with an acute infection (detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab). INTERVENTION: Semen and a blood sample were collected from each individual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Analysis of semen quality according to the World Health Organization standards. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the native semen sample and after density gradient preparation. Confirmation of immunoglobulin (Ig) A und IgG antibodies in the blood. RESULT(S): Eighteen semen samples from recovered men were obtained 8-54 days after absence of symptoms, 14 from control subjects, and 2 from patients with an active COVID-19 infection. No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen, including semen samples from two patients with an acute COVID-19 infection. Subjects with a moderate infection showed an impairment of sperm quality. CONCLUSION(S): A mild COVID-19 infection is not likely to affect testis and epididymis function, whereas semen parameters did seem impaired after a moderate infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be detected in semen of recovered and acute COVID-19-positive men. This suggests no viral transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproductive techniques, although further data need to be obtained.","Holtmann, Nora; Edimiris, Philippos; Andree, Marcel; Doehmen, Cornelius; Baston-Buest, Dunja; Adams, Ortwin; Kruessel, Jan-Steffen; Bielfeld, Alexandra Petra",Fertil Steril,263,23

It is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in both of these groups. The authors developed a survey to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among MS and DS. METHODS: The authors conducted the study at 3 US dental schools and 1 US medical school using an online survey that assessed previous immunization behavior, attitudes about and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines, and personal experience with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 248 DS and 167 MS completed the survey. Forty-five percent of DS and 23% of MS were hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Results of bivariate analyses found that MS were 2.7 times more likely than DS to receive the vaccine (odds ratio, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.76 to 4.31; P = .0001). Although DS were more likely than MS (P < .05) to have had COVID-19 and to personally know someone who had COVID-19, MS were more likely to agree with mandates and trust information about the vaccines. In multivariable analyses, after controlling for demographic variables, experience with COVID-19, and personal vaccination behaviors, being a MS or DS was no longer predictive of willingness to get the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the need for profession-specific curricula designed to enhance student knowledge about the vaccines and vaccine counseling skills. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The American Dental Association supports dentists administering vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines. Dentists and DS should be willing to receive the vaccines themselves. Education about the vaccines is needed to improve uptake.","Kelekar, Arati K; Lucia, Victoria C; Afonso, Nelia M; Mascarenhas, Ana Karina",J Am Dent Assoc,263,1

Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the""COVID-19 Disorder Tracker""initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.","Campedelli, Gian Maria; D'Orsogna, Maria Rita",,263,1

We aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and different volumes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on changes in circulating IL-22. Methods: This was a sub-study of the ""Exercise in the prevention of Metabolic Syndrome"" (EX-MET) a multi-center, randomized trial. This study used data collected at the Brisbane site. Thirty-nine individuals with MetS were randomized to one of three 16-wk interventions: 1) MICT (n=10, 30min at 60-70% HR peak, 5x/wk); 2) 4HIIT (n=13, 4x4min at 85-95% HR peak, interspersed with 3min of active recovery at 50-70% HR peak, 3x/wk); or 3) 1HIIT (n=16, 1x4min at 85-95% HR peak, 3x/wk). Serum IL-22 concentration was measured following a 12-hr fast via an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, before and after the intervention. MetS severity, insulin resistance (IR), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were also measured via MetS z-score, HOMA-IR, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and indirect calorimetry (maximal exercise test), respectively. Results: The median (IQR) IL-22% changes from pre- to post-intervention in the MICT, 4HIIT, and 1HIIT groups were -17% (-43.0% to 31.3%), +16.5% (-18.9% to 154.9%), and +15.9% (-28.7% to 46.1%), respectively. Although there were no significant between-group differences in IL-22 concentration change, there was a medium-to-large group × time interaction effect [F(2,35)=2.08, p=0.14, Î·2=0.14]. Conclusion: Although there was no statistically significant between-group difference in IL-22 change, the study suggests that different exercise intensities may have opposing effects on IL-22 concentration in individuals with MetS.","Ramos, Joyce S; Dalleck, Lance C; Stennett, Rebecca C; Mielke, Gregore I; Keating, Shelley E; Murray, Lydia; Hasnain, Sumaira Z; Fassett, Robert G; McGuckin, Michael; Croci, Ilaria; Coombes, Jeff S",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,263,4

Thus, we sought to analyze the temporal profiles of specific antibodies, as well as the correlations between the antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines, and survival of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 1830 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. The temporal profiles of the virus, antibodies, and cytokines of the patients until 12 weeks since illness onset were fitted by the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) method. The mediation effect of cytokines on the associations between antibody responses and survival were explored by mediation analysis. Of the 1830 patients, 1435 were detectable for SARS-CoV-2, while 395 were positive in specific antibodies only. Of the 1435 patients, 2.4% presented seroconversion for neither immunoglobulin G (IgG) nor immunoglobulin M (IgM) during hospitalization. The seropositive rates of IgG and IgM were 29.6% and 48.1%, respectively, in the first week, and plateaued within five weeks. For the patients discharged from the hospital, the IgM decreased slowly, while high levels of IgG were maintained at around 188 AU·mL-1 for the 12 weeks since illness onset. In contrast, in the patients who subsequently died, IgM declined rapidly and IgG dropped to 87 AU·mL-1 at the twelfth week.

The aim of this study was to determine whether different muscle adipose tissue depots are associated with mortality and muscle damage in patients affected by COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Methods: CT images were obtained in 153 ICU patients with COVID-19 (121 males and 32 females). Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, Creatine PhosphoKinase (CPK), muscle density, and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured. Results: Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle had the shorter 28-day survival from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the first tertile. Estimates derived from the Cox proportional hazard models, after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR 3.94, 95% CI: 1.03-15.09). Participants in the lowest tertile of muscle density had the shorter survival at 28 days from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the highest tertile (HR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.18-4.61), but the relationship was no longer significant when age was included in the model. Subjects in the second muscle density tertile did not show an increased risk. Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle and those in the lowest tertile of muscle density showed both significantly higher CPK adjusted for weight values as evaluated during the first 8 days of hospitalization. Conclusion: Our data seem to suggest that higher levels of IMAT/muscle and low muscle density are both associated with higher risk of ICU mortality and muscle injury as evaluated with CPK level.","Rossi, A.

On January the 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared spread of this virus as an epidemic and a public health emergency. With its highly contagious characteristic and long incubation time, confinement of SARS-CoV-2 requires drastic lock-down measures to be taken and therefore early diagnosis is crucial. We analysed transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells, compared it with mock-infected cells, used network-based reporter metabolite approach and integrated the transcriptome data with protein-protein interaction network to elucidate the early cellular response. Significantly affected metabolites have the potential to be used in diagnostics while pathways of protein clusters have the potential to be used as targets for supportive or novel therapeutic approaches. Our results are in accordance with the literature on response of IL6 family of cytokines and their importance, in addition, we find that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) with keratan sulfate synthesis pathway may play a key role in the infection.

The current study explored a series of structurally related glyceride and phospholipid mimetic prodrugs of MPA in an attempt to enhance lymph targeting and to better elucidate the design criteria for lipid mimetic prodrugs. MPA was conjugated to a glyceride or phospholipid backbone at various positions using different spacers employing ester, ether, carbonate and amide bonds. Patterns of prodrug hydrolysis were evaluated in rat digestive fluid, and lymphatic transport and plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed in lymph duct cannulated rats. Prodrugs with different spacers between MPA and the glyceride backbone resulted in up to 70-fold differences in gastrointestinal stability. MPA conjugation at the 2 position of the glyceride backbone and via an ester bond were most effective in promoting lymphatic transport.

Recently, the synthetic pure glucocorticoid dexamethasone was identified as an effective compound for treatment of severe COVID-19. However, glucocorticoids are generally harmful for infectious diseases, such as bacterial sepsis and severe influenza pneumonia, which can develop respiratory failure and systemic inflammation similar to COVID-19. This apparent inconsistency suggests the presence of pathologic mechanism(s) unique to COVID-19 that renders this steroid effective. We review plausible mechanisms and advance the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by infected cell-specific glucocorticoid insensitivity as reported for some other viruses. This alteration in local glucocorticoid actions interferes with undesired glucocorticoid to facilitate viral replication but does not affect desired anti-inflammatory properties in non-infected organs/tissues. We postulate that the virus coincidentally causes glucocorticoid insensitivity in the process of modulating host cell activities for promoting its replication in infected cells. We explore this tenet focusing on SARS-CoV-2-encoding proteins and potential molecular mechanisms supporting this hypothetical glucocorticoid insensitivity unique to COVID-19 but not characteristic of other life-threatening viral diseases, probably due to a difference in specific virally-encoded molecules and host cell activities modulated by them.","Kino, Tomoshige; Burd, Irina; Segars, James H",Int. j. mol. sci.

The influence of the global pandemic could change the way suicide cases are analyzed; in the future, it is necessary to reconsider and analyze the various risk groups by population but above all to evaluate new methods of intervention for avoiding the increase in fatal events related to the current emergency whose duration is still unknown.

Even if non-transplant critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) have serious CA-RVI, comparison between these groups remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and mortality of CA-RVI except seasonal influenza A/B in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. METHODS: We collected 37,777 CA-RVs multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results of individuals aged &#8805;18 years from November 2012 to November 2017. The CA-RVs tests included adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. RESULTS: We found 286 CA-RVI cases, including 85 solid organ transplantation recipients (G1), 61 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (G2), and 140 non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (G3), excluding those with repeated isolation within 30 days. Adenovirus positive rate and infection cases were most prominent in G2 (p < 0.001). The median time interval between transplantation and CA-RVI was 30 and 20 months in G1 and G2, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in G3 than in G1 or G2 (51.4% vs. 28.2% or 39.3%, p = 0.002, respectively). The mechanical ventilation (MV) was the independent risk factor associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality in all three groups (hazard ratio, 3.37, 95% confidence interval, 2.04-5.56, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of CA-RVs diagnosis in transplant recipients even in long-term posttransplant period, and in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU with MV.","Lee, Kyoung Hwa; Yoo, Seul Gi; Cho, Yonggeun; Kwon, Da Eun; La, Yeonju; Han, Sang Hoon; Kim, Myoung Soo; Choi, Jin Sub; Kim, Soon Il; Kim, Yu Seun; Min, Yoo Hong; Cheong, June-Won; Kim, Jin Seok; Song, Yong Goo",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,263,16

This study examined how the sense of control influences people's perception of sensorimotor input under the framework of categorical perception. Twenty human participants (18 males, two females) took part in both experiments. Experiment 1 showed that the sensitivity (d') of detecting a 20% change in control from no change was higher when the changes occurred at the control-category boundary than within each category. Experiment 2 showed that the control categories greatly affected early attention allocation, even when the judgment of control was unnecessary to the task. Taken together, these results showed that our perceptual and cognitive systems are highly sensitive to small changes in control that build up to a determinant change in the control category within a relatively narrow boundary zone between categories, compared to a continuous, gradual physical change in control.Significance Statement Categorical perception is an important cognitive function that connects human low-level perceptual systems with high-level conceptual systems. Categorical perception has been intensively studied with sensory features (e.g., color and faces), but little is known about sensorimotor information, despite its importance for interacting with the external world. This is the first study to show that individuals perceive their control in meaningful categories rather than via linear encoding. The categorical perception of control diminishes sensitivity to differences within control categories, while increasing sensitivity to sensorimotor inputs at the control-category boundaries. The findings broaden our understanding on how human action influences the perception of action consequences, and how humans organize the external world according to the consequences of their actions.","Wen, Wen; Shimazaki, Naoto; Ohata, Ryu; Yamashita, Atsushi; Asama, Hajime; Imamizu, Hiroshi",ENeuro,263,24

New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected. INTERPRETATION: We established relevant preclinical infection models that will be pivotal to assess the efficacy of current and future vaccine(s) (candidates) as well as therapeutics (small molecules and antibodies) against two important SARS-CoV-2 VoC.

Decision-makers in multinational enterprises have undertaken various types of actions to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic. In most cases these actions relate in some way to managing distance and to rethinking boundaries, whether at the macro- or firm-levels. Managing distance and rethinking boundaries have been the primary focus of much IB research since the IB field was established as a legitimate area of academic inquiry. The pandemic has led to increased cross-border distance problems (e.g., as the result of travel bans and reduced international mobility), and often also to new intra-firm distancing challenges imposed upon previously co-located employees. Prior IHRM research has highlighted the difficulties presented by distance, in terms of employee selection, training, support, health and safety, as well as leadership and virtual collaboration. Much of this thinking is applicable to solve pandemic-related distance challenges. The present, extreme cases of requisite physical distancing need not imply equivalent increases in psychological distance, and also offer firms some insight into the unanticipated benefits of a virtual workforce - a type of workforce that, quite possibly, will influence the 'new normal' of the post-COVID world. Extant IHRM research does offer actionable insight for today, but outstanding knowledge gaps remain. Looking ahead, we offer three domains for future IHRM research: managing under uncertainty, facilitating international and even global work, and redefining organizational performance.","Caligiuri, Paula; De Cieri, Helen; Minbaeva, Dana; Verbeke, Alain; Zimmermann, Angelika",J Int Bus Stud,263,1

It is unknown how this feature-specific wiring of circuitry develops before eye opening. Here, we suggest that LHCs in V1 may originate from spatio-temporally structured feedforward activities generated from spontaneous retinal waves. Using model simulations based on the anatomy and observed activity patterns of the retina, we show that waves propagating in retinal mosaics can initialize the wiring of LHCs by co-activating neurons of similar tuning, whereas equivalent random activities cannot induce such organizations. Simulations showed that emerged LHCs can produce the patterned activities observed in V1, matching the topography of the underlying orientation map. The model can also reproduce feature-specific microcircuits in the salt-and-pepper organizations found in rodents. Our results imply that early peripheral activities contribute significantly to cortical development of functional circuits.Significance statementLong-range horizontal connections (LHCs) in the primary visual cortex (V1) are observed to emerge before the onset of visual experience, thereby selectively connecting iso-domains of orientation map. However, it is unknown how such feature-specific wirings develop before eye-opening. Here, we show that LHCs in V1 may originate from the feature-specific activation of cortical neurons by spontaneous retinal waves during early developmental stages. Our simulations of a visual cortex model show that feedforward activities from the retina initialize the spatial organization of activity patterns in V1, which induces visual feature-specific wirings in the V1 neurons.

Recent studies described a substantial prevalence of COVID-19 and also a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in men afflicted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Women were also more likely to expect a new lockdown or virus outbreak by the end of 2020, and were more pessimistic about the contemporaneous and future state of the UK economy, as measured by their forecasted contemporaneous and future unemployment rates. We also show that between earlier in 2020 before the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic and June 2020, women had increased childcare and housework more than men. Neither the gender gaps in COVID-19-related health and economic concerns nor the gender gaps in the increase in hours of childcare and housework can be accounted for by a rich set of control variables. Instead, we find that the gender gap in mental health can be partially accounted for by the difference in COVID-19-related health concerns between men and women.","Oreffice, Sonia Quintana-Domeque Climent",Journal of Demographic Economics,263,1

As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care services have adopted new digital solutions, which rely on phone and internet connectivity. However, persons who are digitally inaccessible, such as those experiencing poverty or homelessness, are often unable to use these services. In response to this newly highlighted social disparity known as ""digital health inequity,"" emergency physicians at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, initiated a program called PHONE-CONNECT (Phones for Healthier Ontarians iN EDs - COvid NEeds met by Cellular Telephone). This novel approach attempts to improve patients' access to health care, information, and social services, as well as improve their ability to adhere to public health directives (social isolation and contact tracing). Although similar programs addressing the same emerging issues have been recently described in the media, this is the first time phones have been provided as a health care intervention in an emergency department. This innovative emergency department point-of-care intervention may have a significant impact on improving health outcomes for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Kazevman, Gill; Mercado, Marck; Hulme, Jennifer; Somers, Andrea",J Med Internet Res,263,30

There is a need to evaluate how this global shift has impacted patient care, healthcare providers, patient and carer experience, and health systems. ObjectiveWe explored GPs perspectives on the main benefits and challenges of using digital remote care. MethodsGPs across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June - September 2020. GPs perceptions on main barriers and challenges were explored using free-text questions. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results1,605 respondents participated in our survey. The benefits identified included reducing COVID-19 transmission risks, guaranteeing access and continuity of care, improved efficiency, faster access to care, improved convenience and communication with patients, greater work flexibility for providers, and hastening the digital transformation of primary care and the accompanying legal frameworks. Main challenges included patients preference for face-to-face consultations, digital exclusion, lack of physical examinations, clinical uncertainty, delays in diagnosis and treatment, overuse and misuse of digital remote care, and unsuitability for certain types of consultations. Other challenges include the lack of formal guidance, higher workloads, remuneration issues, organisational culture, technical difficulties, implementation and financial issues, and regulatory weaknesses. ConclusionAt the frontline of care delivery, GPs can provide important insights on what worked well, why, and how. Lessons learned during the emergency phase can be used to inform the stable adoption of virtual care solutions, and co-design processes and platforms that are technologically robust, secure, and supported by a strategic long-term plan.","Li, Edmond C; Tsopra, Rosy; Gimenez, Geronimo Larrain; Serafini, Alice; Gusso, Gustavo; Lingner, Heidrun; Fernandez, Maria Jose; Irving, Greg; Patek, Davorina; Hoffman, Robert; Lazic, Vanja; Memarian, Ensieh; Koskela, Tuomas; Collins, Claire; Espitia, Sandra Milena; Claveria, Ana; Nessler, Katarzyna; O039, Braden Gregory; Neill,; Hoedebecke, Kyle; Ungan, Mehmet; Laranjo, Liliana; Ghafur, Saira; Fontana, Gianluca; Majeed, Azeem; Car, Josip; Darzi, Ara; Neves, Ana Luisa",,263,10

Although they involve separate legal areas, patent and copyright, the common thread linking the two is intellectual property's difficult relationship with access in the public interest. This paper examines the tensions caused by access barriers, the tools used to reduce them and their effectiveness. It is clear that the access barriers magnified by COVID-19 are not restricted to narrow or specific contexts but are widespread. They are created by, and are a feature of, our existing IPR frameworks. Open movements provide limited remedies because they are not designed to, nor can adequately address the wide range of access barriers necessary to promote the public interest. Existing legislative mechanisms designed to remove access barriers similarly fail to effectively remedy access needs. These existing options are premised on the assumption that there is a singular ""public"" motivated by homogenous ""interests"", which fails to reflect the plurality and cross-border reality of the public(s) interest(s) underpinning the welfare goals of IPR. We conclude that a systemic re-evaluation is required and call for positive and equitable legal measures protective of the public(s) interest(s) to be built within IPR frameworks that also address non-IPR barriers. The current pandemic and development of a ""new normal"" provides a crucial opportunity to comprehensively consider the public(s) interest(s), not just during a global health crisis, but on an ongoing basis.","Walsh, Karen; Wallace, Andrea; Pavis, Mathilde; Olszowy, Natalie; Griffin, James; Hawkins, Naomi",IIC Int Rev Ind Prop Copyr Law,263,16

A technique of obtaining portable chest radiographs (pCXR) through glass doors or windows to minimize technologist-patient contact and conserve PPE has gained popularity, but remains incompletely evaluated in the literature. Our goal was to quickly implement this technique and evaluate image quality and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An infographic and video were developed to educate nurses and technologists on the through-glass pCXR technique. Imaging parameters were optimized using a phantom and scatter radiation was measured. Three reviewers independently evaluated 100 conventionally obtained and 100 through-glass pCXRs from March 13, 2020 to April 30, 2020 on patients with suspected COVID-19, using criteria for positioning and sharpness/contrast on a 1 (confident criteria not met) to 5 (confident criteria met) scale. Imaging parameters, including deviation index (DI) were recorded for all radiographs. RESULTS: The through-glass method was rapidly adopted and conserved one isolation gown per interaction. Although there was a statistically significant difference in the positioning (P value 0.018) and sharpness/contrast (P value 0.016), the difference in mean ratings was small: 4.82 vs 4.65 for positioning and 4.67 vs 4.50 (conventional vs modified) for sharpness/contrast. Scatter radiation was measured using a thorax phantom and found to be acceptable for the patient and nearby personnel. Standard deviation was higher for the DI for the through-glass technique (2.8) compared to the conventional technique (1.8), although the means were similar. CONCLUSION: The through-glass technique was quickly implemented, producing diagnostic quality chest radiographs while conserving PPE and reducing risks to radiology staff. There was more variability with imaging technique and DI using the through-glass technique, likely due to technologist uncertainty regarding technical modifications. Further work to reduce this variation is necessary to optimize quality and dose.","Chan, Jessica; Auffermann, William; Jenkins, Peter; Streitmatter, Seth; Duong, Phuong-Anh",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,263,6

Publication of ACOSOG Z0011 in 2010 changed this standard for patients undergoing lumpectomy. Clinicians have since expanded this practice to mastectomy patients, and ongoing prospective studies are seeking to validate this practice. Here, we evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that led surgeons to forego a second surgery for CALND in cN0 mastectomy patients with positive SLNB. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single institution, retrospective review of cN0 patients with invasive primary breast cancer and positive SLNB from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Patients with T4 disease, positive preoperative axillary biopsy, prior neoadjuvant therapy or axillary surgery were excluded. Patients with positive SLNB undergoing CALND were compared with patients for whom CALND was omitted. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and &#967;2 tests or Fischer exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS: Of 259 patients with positive SLNB, 180 (69.4%) patients underwent mastectomy. CALND was performed at the time of mastectomy in 54 (30%) patients, at time of second operation in 22 (12.2%) patients, and not performed in 104 (57%) patients. Delayed CALND was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumors, increased number of positive sentinel nodes, invasive lobular carcinoma, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The management of cN0 patients with positive SLNB that do not meet ACOSOG Z0011 criteria is evolving and is influenced by tumor and patient characteristics in an attempt to balance the morbidity of CALND with the low rate of local regional recurrence.","Mathias, Brittany J; Sun, James; Sun, Weihong; Zhou, Jun-Min; Fulp, William J; Laronga, Christine; Lee, M Catherine; Kiluk, John V",,263,33

For this purpose, the correlation coefficients between the variables and clustering analysis were used to expose the possible effects. Results revealed the comparatively strong relationships between some independent variables (e.g., total greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 emissions, nitrous oxide emissions, and urban population) and confirmed cases (R from 0.619 to 0.695), demonstrating the possible effective role of urbanization and its induced GHG emissions on the COVID-19 outbreak in the country level of the MECA region. Therefore, the results significantly confirmed the strong relationships between some independent variables (e.g., total population, urban population, fuel consumption, NO2-CO2 emissions, energy use, and total intra-changed travels) and confirmed cases (R from 0.724 to 0.945), explaining an explicit relationship between urbanization processes and the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Besides, the HCA results revealed the substantial role of the urban population and urban-induced energy use and gas emission in clustering locations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in both the MECA region and Iran.

As a network modifier, Na+ cations modify the structural distributions and create nonbridging oxygens. As a charge compensator, Na+ cations provide imbalanced charge for oxygen that is linked between two network-forming tetrahedra. However, the factors controlling the mobility of Na+ ions in glasses, which in turn affects the ionic conductivity, remain unclear. In the current work, using high-fidelity experiments and atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that the ionic conductivity of the Na3Al2P3O12 (Si0) glass material is dependent not only on the concentration of Na+ charge carriers but also on the number of charge-compensated oxygens within its first coordination sphere. To investigate, we chose a series of glasses formulated by the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass based on the hypothesis that Si substitution in the presence of Na+ cations increases the number of Si-O-Al bonds, which enhances the role of Na as a charge compensator. The structural and conductivity properties of bulk glass materials are evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. We observe that the increasing number of charge-imbalanced bridging oxygens (BOs) with the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass enhances the ionic conductivity by an order of magnitude-from 3.7 × 10-8 S.cm-1 to 3.3 × 10-7 S.cm-1 at 100 °C. By rigorously quantifying the channel regions in the glass structure, using MD simulations, we demonstrate that the enhanced ionic conductivity can be attributed to the increased connectivity of Na-rich channels because of the increased charge-compensated BOs around the Na atoms. Overall, this study provides new insights for designing next-generation glass-based electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity for Na-ion batteries.","Keshri, Shweta R; Ganisetti, Sudheer; Kumar, Rajesh; Gaddam, Anuraag; Illath, Kavya; Ajithkumar, Thalasseril G; Balaji, Sathravada; Annapurna, K; Nasani, Narendar; Krishnan, N M Anoop; Allu, Amarnath R",Inorg. chem,263,21

METHODS: All consecutive patients who were admitted at healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province (located in the south of Iran with a population of 4,851,000 people) from 19 February 2020 to 20 November 2020 were included. For every patient with DS, three age- and sex-matched patients with COVID-19 and without any underlying medical conditions were selected as controls. RESULTS: During the study period, 37,968 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Eighteen patients had DS. Patients with DS were significantly more likely to be intubated [7 patients (39%)] compared with those without DS [3 patients (6%)]; p = 0.002. Patients with DS significantly more often died of COVID-19 compared with the controls [8 (44.4%) vs. 1 (1.9%); odds ratio: 24.37; 95% confidence interval 2.39-247.94; p = 0.007].

The aim of this study was to examine the functional and morphological features of COVID-19-associated ARDS and to compare these with the characteristics of ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective observational study was done at seven hospitals in Italy. We enrolled consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and who met Berlin criteria for ARDS, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between March 9 and March 22, 2020. All patients were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated in volume-control mode with standard ICU ventilators. Static respiratory system compliance, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air, ventilatory ratio (a surrogate of dead space), and D-dimer concentrations were measured within 24 h of ICU admission. Lung CT scans and CT angiograms were done when clinically indicated. A dataset for ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 was created from previous ARDS studies. Survival to day 28 was assessed. FINDINGS: Between March 9 and March 22, 2020, 301 patients with COVID-19 met the Berlin criteria for ARDS at participating hospitals. Median static compliance was 41 mL/cm H2O (33-52), which was 28% higher than in the cohort of patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (32 mL/cm H2O [25-43]; p<0·0001). 17 (6%) of 297 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS had compliances greater than the 95th percentile of the classical ARDS cohort. Total lung weight did not differ between the two cohorts. CT pulmonary angiograms (obtained in 23 [8%] patients with COVID-19-related ARDS) showed that 15 (94%) of 16 patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had bilateral areas of hypoperfusion, consistent with thromboembolic disease. Patients with D-dimer concentrations equal to or less than the median had ventilatory ratios lower than those of patients with D-dimer concentrations greater than the median (1·66 [1·32-1·95] vs 1·90 [1·50-2·33]; p=0·0001). Patients with static compliance equal to or less than the median and D-dimer concentrations greater than the median had markedly increased 28-day mortality compared with other patient subgroups (40 [56%] of 71 with high D-dimers and low compliance vs 18 [27%] of 67 with low D-dimers and high compliance, 13 [22%] of 60 with low D-dimers and low compliance, and 22 [35%] of 63 with high D-dimers and high compliance, all p=0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have a form of injury that, in many aspects, is similar to that of those with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who have a reduction in respiratory system compliance together with increased D-dimer concentrations have high mortality rates.

MethodsWe describe the analytical and clinical performance of an in-house fluorescent multiplex immunoassay (FMIA) for simultaneous quantification of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, we calibrated IgG-FMIA against World Health Organisation (WHO) International Standard and compared FMIA results to an in-house enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a microneutralisation test (MNT). We also compared the MNT results of two laboratories. ResultsIgG-FMIA displayed 100% specificity and sensitivity for samples collected 13-150 days post-onset of symptoms (DPO). For IgA- and IgM-FMIA 100% specificity and sensitivity were obtained for a shorter time window (13-36 and 13-28 DPO for IgA- and IgM-FMIA, respectively). FMIA and EIA results displayed moderate to strong correlation, but FMIA was overall more specific and sensitive. IgG-FMIA identified 100% of samples with neutralising antibodies (NAbs). Anti-spike IgG concentrations correlated strongly ({rho}=0.77-0.84, P<2.2x10-16) with NAb titers. The NAb titers of the two laboratories displayed a very strong correlation ({rho}=0.95, P<2.2x10-16).

These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO2 and O3 levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010-2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO2 (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O3 (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO2 changed by -51% (intercity range -65.7 to -30.9%) and -36.4% (-53.7 to -11.6%), and O3 by -1.1% (-20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (-12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO2 changes of -119 (95% CI: -273 to -24) deaths over the lockdown, and of -53 (-114 to -10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (-72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (-27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O3 levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions. Our study shows that the potential trade-offs between multiple air pollutants should be taken into account when evaluating the health impacts of environmental exposures.","Achebak, Hicham; Petetin, Hervé; Quijal-Zamorano, Marcos; Bowdalo, Dene; Pérez García-Pando, Carlos; Ballester, Joan",Environ Pollut,263,24

This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor-binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all of the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols.

Driven by population growth, migration, economic decline in rural areas, political instabilities, and even more recently, the Covid-19 pandemic, urban systems and spaces are changing to accommodate moving people and new functions. In many cases, these trends contribute to increased levels of inequality, poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment, while the warnings about the impact of climate change continue to raise concerns. Though some have called this a new urban revolution, others have referred to, in a more apocalyptic turn, the end of cities. In response, many writers are encouraging smarter cities, whereas others are promoting a post-urban context and a return to small communities. High levels of uncertainty are characteristic, along with increased intensities of complexity, rapid fluctuation and unbounded experimentation. This raises many questions about the nature and implication of change in different cities situated in vastly contrasting contexts. This thematic issue of Urban Planning focuses on five narratives from cities across the world to illustrate various drivers of change and their implications for urban design and planning. The editorial introduces these narratives, as well as commentaries from leading academics/practitioners and highlights several divergent experiences and common threats. It argues that to deal with the rapid and often large-scale changes, planners need to view human settlements as socio-ecological systems and plan for change and uncertainty to facilitate the co-evolution of humans and nature.","Landman, K.",Urban Planning,263,11

METHODS: We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from adult and pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and from their contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Manitoba between March and December 2020. We compared viral growth in cell culture, cycle threshold values from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50/mL) between adults and children. RESULTS: Among 305 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, 97 samples were from children aged 10 years or younger, 78 were from children aged 11-17 years and 130 were from adults (≥ 18 yr). Viral growth in culture was present in 31% of samples, including 18 (19%) samples from children 10 years or younger, 18 (23%) from children aged 11-17 years and 57 (44%) from adults (children v. adults, odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.72).

Neurological examination was normal. Chest CT findings consist of bilateral interstitial pneumonia (visual score extension: 30%). The patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care. Seven days after admission to Covid-19 Unit, the patient rapidly developed worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She suddenly developed partial left hemispheric syndrome. A new HRCT scan of her thorax revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs (visual score extension: 90%). Brain CT performed 2 h after sudden-onset left-sided weakness showed subtle low attenuation within the right insular ribbon and frontal lobe (ASPECT Score 8). Multiphasic CT angiography (MCTA) demonstrated occlusion of both the dominant inferior division of the right middle cerebral artery and the A2 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. After 24 h, her pupils became dilated and unreactive, and brain CT demonstrated large bilateral infarctions of both the cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres. She had a rapid progression of interstitial pneumonia from COVID-19, developed multiple strokes, and died 1 day later.

We previously discovered a 3866T>C mutation within the gene for the ND1 subunit of complex I as possibly amplifying disease progression for patients bearing the disease-causing 11778G>A mutation, within the gene for the ND4 subunit of Complex I. However, whether and how the ND1 mutation exacerbates the ND4 mutation were unknown. In this report, we showed that four Chinese families bearing both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited higher penetrances of LHON than 6 Chinese pedigrees carrying only the m.3866T>C mutation or families harboring only the m.11778G>A mutation. The protein structure analysis revealed that the m.3866T>C (I187T) and m.11778G>A (R340H) mutations destabilized the specific interactions with other residues of ND1 and ND4, thereby altering the structure and function of complex I, respectively. Cellular data obtained using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from the Chinese families into mtDNA-less (ro) cells demonstrated that the mutations perturbed the stability, assembly and activity of complex I, leading to changes in mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential, and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. These mitochondrial dysfunctions promoted the apoptotic sensitivity of cells and decreased mitophagy. Cybrids bearing only m.3866T>C mutation displayed mild mitochondrial dysfunctions while those harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited greater mitochondrial dysfunctions. These suggested that the m.3866T>C mutation acted as the synergy with m.11778G>A mutation, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunctions contributing to higher penetrance of LHON in these families carrying both mtDNA mutations.","Ji, Yanchun; Zhang, Juanjuan; Lu, Yuanyuan; Yi, Qiuzi; Chen, Mengquan; Xie, Shipeng; Mao, Xiaoting; Xiao, Yun; Meng, Feilong; Zhang, Minlian; Yang, Rulai; Guan, Min-Xin",J. biol. chem,263,1

Resistance training has been considered one of the most useful tools for patients with pulmonary disease, improving their quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resistance training (RT) on the prevention of thickening of the right ventricle wall of rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control (C), Smoker (S), Exercised (E) and Exercised Smoker (ES). The smoker groups were exposed to the smoke of four cigarettes for 30 min, twice daily, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The exercised groups climbed on a vertical ladder with progressive load, once a day, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The heart, trachea, lung, liver and gastrocnemius muscle were removed for histopathological analysis. Pulmonary emphysema (S and ES vs C and E, P < 0.0001) and pulmonary artery thickness enlargement (S vs C and E, P = 0.003, ES vs C, P = 0.003) were detected in the smoking groups. There was an increase in the right ventricle thickness in the S group compared with all other groups (P < 0.0001). An increase in resident macrophages in the liver was detected in both smoking groups compared with the C group (P = 0.002). Additionally, a relevant reduction of the diameter of the muscle fibers was detected only in ES compared with the C, S and E groups (P = 0.0002), impairing, at least in part, the muscle mass in exercised smoking rats. Therefore, it was concluded that resistance training prevented the increase of thickness of the right ventricle in rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke, but it may be not so beneficial for the skeletal muscle of smoking rats.","Moreno, Ana Caroline Rippi; Nai, Gisele Alborghetti; Laurindo, Caroline Pancera; Gregorio, Karen Cristina Rego; Olean-Oliveira, Tiago; Teixeira, Marcos Fernando Souza; Seraphim, Patricia Monteiro",PLoS One,263,25

We have developed a dual optical/chemiluminescence format of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) immunosensor for IgA in serum and saliva. A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H2O2/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease. This IgA-LFIA immunosensor could be useful for noninvasively monitoring early immune responses to COVID-19 and for investigating the diagnostic/prognostic utility of salivary IgA in the context of large-scale screening to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Roda, Aldo; Cavalera, Simone; Di Nardo, Fabio; Calabria, Donato; Rosati, Sergio; Simoni, Patrizia; Colitti, Barbara; Baggiani, Claudio; Roda, Matilde; Anfossi, Laura",Biosens Bioelectron,263,26

Our study aimed at evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of screening patients with cancer for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: All oncology patients receiving care at Department of Oncology at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh were screened using the acute respiratory infection (ARI) survey. Nasopharyngeal and throat swap for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed on patients who have high ARI score (i.e. &#8805; 4), or any patient requiring elective/emergency hospitalization, undergoing a procedure as well as screening asymptomatic patients receiving chemotherapy between April 1st and July 30, 2020. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Descriptive and inferential analyses were done and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated considering the COVID-19 PCR as the gold standard. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 473 patients were included with a median age was 56 years (14-104), 51% were female, 73% had solid tumors, and 66% received treatment within the last 3 months. These patients underwent 688 PCR tests along with ARI survey screening. Testing was done in the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department setting in 41%, 40% and 19% of the patients, respectively. Majority of tests were screening of asymptomatic patients and only 23% were tested for suspected infections with ARI &#8805; 4. A total of 54 patients (8%) had positive PCR for COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of infection varied from month to month ranging from 1.09% in April up to 19.70% in June and correlated with the average daily and active case load at a national level. The diagnostic yield of the ARI score also correlated with infection burden nationally. The PPV and NPV of the ARI as a screening tool was 18.24% (0-31.8) and 95.6% (86.36-98.86%) with the PPN fluctuating considerably in parallel with the prevalence of COVID-19 result. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of the ARI were 55.77% (0-70.59) and 79.4 (69.19-92), respectively. CONCLUSION: The yield of screening asymptomatic patients with cancer varies based on the community burden of COVID-19 infection. As universal screening can cause delays to patient care, it should be tailored based on the individual patient risks and infection burden in the region.","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Alghamdi, Majed; Alkaiyat, Mohammad; Al Johani, Sameera M; Damlaj, Moussab",J Infect Public Health,263,16

High throughput genotyping of BC samples has led to the identification and characterization of biomarkers for the diagnosis of BC. The most common genetic variants studied are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) that determine susceptibility to an array of diseases thus serving as a potential tool for identifying the underlying causes of breast carcinogenesis. METHODS: SNP genotyping employing the Agena MassARRAY offers a robust, sensitive, cost-effective method to assess multiple SNPs and samples simultaneously. In this present study, we analyzed 15 SNPs of 14 genes in 550 samples (150 cases and 400 controls). We identified four SNPs of genes TCF21, SLC19A1, DCC, and ERCC1 showing significant association with BC in the population under study. RESULTS: The SNPs were rs12190287 (TCF21) having OR 1.713 (1.08-2.716 at 95% CI) p-value 0.022 (dominant), rs1051266 (SLC19A1) having OR 3.461 (2.136-5.609 at 95% CI) p-value 0.000000466 (dominant), rs2229080 (DCC) having OR 0.6867 (0.5123-0.9205 at 95% CI) p-value 0.0116 (allelic) and rs2298881 (ERCC1) having OR 0.669 (0.46-0.973 at 95% CI), p-value 0.035 (additive) respectively. The in-silico analysis was further used to fortify the above findings.

The Infected Patient Ratio (IPR) tool was developed to measure the number of patients resulting from 1 infector during the incubation period. Both IPR and TRA were used together to forecast inflection points, plateau phases, intensive care units' and ventilators' breakpoints, and the Total Fatality Ratio. RESULTS: In Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United States, an inflection point is predicted within the first 15 d of April, to arrive at a plateau after another 30 to 80 d. Variations in IPR drop are expected due to variations in lockdown timing by each country, the extent of adherence to it, and the number of performed tests in each.

Our study included all confirmed cases, from March 8 until April 28, 2020, collected from the official website that reports the situation of COVID-19 infections in Brazil. The Boltzmann function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding different states. The model data were well fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999. Up to April 28, 20,665 cases were confirmed in the region. The state of Ceará has the highest rate of accumulated cases per 100,000 inhabitants (75.75), followed by Pernambuco. We estimated that the states of Ceará, Sergipe and Paraíba will experience a dramatic increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 31. Maranhão, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí showed a more discreet increase in the model. For Bahia and Alagoas, a 4.7 and 6.6-fold increase in the rate was estimated, respectively. We estimate a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the region within three months, especially for Ceará, Sergipe and Paraíba.

Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability. This engineered ACE2 could be exploited as a novel therapeutic agent against COVID-19 after necessary evaluations.","Payandeh, Zahra; Rahbar, Mohammad Reza; Jahangiri, Abolfazl; Hashemi, Zahra Sadat; Zakeri, Alireza; Jafarisani, Moslem; Rasaee, Mohammad Javad; Khalili, Saeed",J Theor Biol,263,16

The rapid spread of the pandemic and the strong human to human infection rate of COVID-19 poses a great prevention challenge. There has been an explosion in the number of confirmed cases in several cities near Wuhan, including the highest in Honghu, Jinzhou. Owing to the limited admission capacity and medical resources, increasing numbers of suspected cases of COVID-19 infection were difficult to confirm or treat. CASE PRESENTATION: Following the arrival of the Guangdong medical aid team on 11 February, 2020, COVID-19 care in Honghu saw changes after a series of solutions were implemented based on the 'Four-Early' and 'Four-centralization' management measures. The 'Four-Early' measures are: early detection, early reporting, early quarantine, and early treatment for meeting an urgent need like the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Four-centralization' refers to the way in which recruited medical teams can make full use of medical resources to give patients the best treatment. These solutions successfully increased the recovery rate and reduced mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Honghu. CONCLUSIONS: This management strategy is called the 'Honghu Model' which can be generalized to enable the prevention and management of COVID-19 worldwide.","Wang, He-Ran; Gong, Meng-Chun; Sun, Jing-Yuan; Sun, Jian; Guo, Yi; Liu, Li; Zhu, Hong",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,263,22

We conducted an online survey in a sample representative for the German population (N = 3092) to study the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions on Germans’ daily and travel mode choices and on their wishes for future mobility. Furthermore, we examined the moderating effects of Germans’ personal norms to protect the climate on changes in their mobility behavior toward sustainable mobility, both within and beyond the corona pandemic. In line with previous research, the present study shows an overall reduction of mobility across almost all modes of transport for daily and travel mobility during time periods of COVID-19 restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19-times, with different transport modes being affected differently. Our findings additionally point out the relevance of personal norms to protect the climate for the transition toward sustainable mobility behavior.

METHODS: To investigate the difference of vaccination status between different genotypes in the circulating B. pertussis after 10 years of acellular pertussis vaccine (aPV) used in China. The nasopharyngeal swabs and isolates of B. pertussis from these patients were used to perform genotyping of antigen genes. We use antibiotic susceptibility test against erythromycin and sequencing methods for site 2047 of 23S rRNA to determine the resistance status. RESULTS: The ptxP1 allele with erythromycin resistant (ER) B. pertussis infection (total of 449 subjects) consisted of 84.70 to 96.70% from 2012 to 2016 in this study. Vaccinated with co-purified aPV was found in 133(133/403,33.0%), 1(1/9,11.1%) and 2(2/21,9.5%) in ptxP1/fhaB3-ER, ptxP1/fhaB2-ES and ptxP3/fhaB2-ES B. pertussis infected children each, which showed a significant difference (&#967;2 = 6.87, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The ptxP3-ES B. pertussis was rare while the ptxP1-ER B. pertussis was steadily increased in Xi'an, China from 2012 to 2016, where co-purified aPV was prevalent used. This pose a hypothesis that the co-purified aPV might protect against ptxP3 strains more efficient, which generated a rare chance for ptxP3 strains to be under the antibiotic pressure and further developed to be erythromycin resistance. A further cohort study and the mechanisms of the additional antigen proteins of co-purified aPV protected against B. pertussis should be consideration.","Wang, Zengguo; Luan, Yang; Du, Quanli; Shu, Chang; Peng, Xiaokang; Wei, Huijing; Hou, Tiejun; Liu, Ying; Liu, Xiaoguai; Li, Yarong",BMC Infect Dis,263,20

METHODS: A level II hospital was deployed in Wau, South Sudan, as the regional referral centre of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). It had a total strength of 63 personnel with 47 medical staff (average age 38.3±8.0 years, 33 men). A new 'appointment-triage-disinfection' work pattern was adopted to cope with the COVID-19 outbreak in the mission. Data on medical service statistics and workload before/after the outbreak were collected and compared. The mental health of staff was analysed from the quarterly psychological survey, including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-10, Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9. RESULTS: The number of outpatients decreased slightly after the COVID-19 outbreak (41.9±11.9 to 37.6±11.8 per week, p=0.49), whereas the weekly hospital length of stay of inpatients increased significantly (0.4±1.0 to 3.1±3.9 days, p=0.02). Total weekly working hours increased from 1884.9±34.1 to 2023.5±67.3 hours (p<0.001). Elevated mental stress (PSS-10: 4.3±2.4 in February to 7.5±3.9 in May, p<0.001; GAD-7: 4.0±2.3 to 9.4±4.0, p<0.001; PHQ-9: 2.1±1.2 to 3.2±2.4, p<0.001) was documented among healthcare providers after the outbreak. The threat of COVID-19 infection, delay in rotation and family-related concerns constituted the main stressors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 imposes a huge pressure on peacekeeping field hospitals. Increased workload and mental stress among frontline healthcare providers deserve the attention of UNMISS officials. Facilitating the rotation of the medical staff might potentially improve the operational readiness of the hospital by bringing in well-trained personnel and sufficient medical supplies.","Zhang, Yongxue; Xiang, D; Alejok, N",,263,20

IFN-&#954; inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2; and TFF2 is a small secreted polypeptide that promotes the repair of mucosal injury and reduces the inflammatory responses. We used the synergistic effect of both proteins to treat COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, clinical trial involving patients with moderate COVID-19. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN-&#954; and TFF2 every 24 h for six consecutive dosages in addition to standard care (experimental group) or standard care alone (control group). The primary endpoint was the time until a viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all clinical samples. The secondary clinical endpoint was the time of CT imaging improvement. Data analysis was performed per protocol. This study was registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. Findings: Between March 23 and May 23 of 2020, 86 COVID-19 patients with symptoms of moderate illness were recruited, and 6 patients were excluded due to not matching the inclusion criteria (patients with pneumonia through chest radiography). Among the remaining 80 patients, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and the others were assigned to control group to only receive standard care. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for both groups. The time of viral RNA negative conversion in experimental group (Mean, 3·80 days, 95% CI 2·07-5·53), was significantly shorter than that in control group (7·40 days, 95% CI 4·57 to 10·23) (p = 0.031), and difference between means was 3·60 days. The percentage of patients in experimental group with reversion to negative viral RNA was significantly increased compared with control group on all sampling days (every day during the 12-day observation period) (p = 0·037). For the secondary endpoint, the experimental group had a significantly shorter time until improvement was seen by CT (Mean 6·21 days, N = 38/40, 95% CI 5·11-7·31) than that in control group (8·76 days, N = 34/40, 95% CI 7·57-9·96) (p = 0.002), and difference between means was 2·55 days. No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by any experimental patients. Interpretation: In conclusion, we found that aerosol inhalation of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 in combination with standard care is safe and superior to standard care alone in shortening the time up to viral RNA negative conversion in all clinical samples. In addition, the patients in experimental group had a significantly shortened CT imaging improvement time than those in control group. This study suggested that this combination treatment is able to facilitate clinical improvement (negative for virus, improvement by CT, reduced hospitalization stay) and thereby result in an early release from the hospital. These data support the need for exploration with a large-scale trial of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 to treat COVID-19.

This situation triggers anxiety, which is bad for everyone. The government's role is very influential in solving these problems with its work program. It also has many pros and cons that cause public anxiety. For that, it is necessary to detect anxiety to improve government programs that can increase public expectations. This study applies machine learning to detecting anxiety based on social media comments regarding government programs to deal with this pandemic. This concept will adopt a sentiment analysis in detecting anxiety based on positive and negative comments from netizens. The machine learning methods implemented include K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XG-boost. The data sample used is the result of crawling YouTube comments. The data used amounted to 4862 comments consisting of negative and positive data with 3211 and 1651. Negative data identify anxiety, while positive data identifies hope (not anxious). Machine learning is processed based on feature extraction of count-vectorization and TF-IDF. The results showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 973 in testing, and training with the greatest accuracy was the random forest with feature extraction of vectorization count and TF-IDF of 84.99% and 82.63%, respectively. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is XG-Boost. Thus, Random Forest is the best accurate to detect someone's anxiety based-on data from social media.","Saifullah, Shoffan; Fauziah, Yuli; Aribowo, Agus Sasmito",,263,24

365377,365377,365377,Highly flexible neighborhood promotes efficient coordination: experimental evidence,14.625625,3.4970708,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing is an important component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Minimizing social interactions and travel reduces the rate at which the infection spreads and ""flattens the curve"" so that the medical system is better equipped to treat infected individuals. However, it remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies as the pandemic continues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We used public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much users travel in a given week. METHODS: We collected 469,669,925 tweets geotagged in the United States from January 1, 2019, to April 27, 2020. We analyzed the aggregated mobility variance of a total of 3,768,959 Twitter users at the city and state level from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We found a large reduction (61.83%) in travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing policies. However, the variance by state was high, ranging from 38.54% to 76.80%. The eight states that had not issued statewide social distancing orders as of the start of April ranked poorly in terms of travel reduction: Arkansas (45), Iowa (37), Nebraska (35), North Dakota (22), South Carolina (38), South Dakota (46), Oklahoma (50), Utah (14), and Wyoming (53). We are presenting our findings on the internet and will continue to update our analysis during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We observed larger travel reductions in states that were early adopters of social distancing policies and smaller changes in states without such policies. The results were also consistent with those based on other mobility data to a certain extent. Therefore, geolocated tweets are an effective way to track social distancing practices using a public resource, and this tracking may be useful as part of ongoing pandemic response planning.","Xu, Paiheng; Dredze, Mark; Broniatowski, David A",J Med Internet Res,263,21

The paper starts with describing the explainable neural network (XNN), which attempts to extract and visualize several high-level concepts purely from the deep network, without relying on human linguistic concepts. This helps users understand network classifications that are less intuitive and substantially improves user performance on a difficult fine-grained classification task of discriminating among different species of seagulls. Realizing that an important missing piece is a reliable heatmap visualization tool, we have developed I-GOS and iGOS++ utilizing integrated gradients to avoid local optima in heatmap generation, which improved the performance across all resolutions. During the development of those visualizations, we realized that for a significant number of images, the classifier has multiple different paths to reach a confident prediction. This has lead to our recent development of structured attention graphs (SAGs), an approach that utilizes beam search to locate multiple coarse heatmaps for a single image, and compactly visualizes a set of heatmaps by capturing how different combinations of image regions impact the confidence of a classifier. Through the research process, we have learned much about insights in building deep network explanations, the existence and frequency of multiple explanations, and various tricks of the trade that make explanations work. In this paper, we attempt to share those insights and opinions with the readers with the hope that some of them will be informative for future researchers on explainable deep learning.","Fuxin, Li; Qi, Zhongang; Khorram, Saeed; Shitole, Vivswan; Tadepalli, Prasad; Kahng, Minsuk; Fern, Alan",,263,1

We have seen the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19 that has already infected more than 29 million people, with more than 900 000 deaths since its identification in December 2019. Considering the significant impact of viral infections, research and development of new antivirals and control strategies are essential. In this paper, we summarize 96 antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1987 and 2019. Of these, 49 (51%) are used in treatments against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), four against human papillomavirus, six against cytomegalovirus, eight against hepatitis B virus, five against influenza, six against herpes simplex virus, 17 against hepatitis C virus and one against respiratory syncytial virus. This review also describes future perspectives for new antiviral therapies such as nanotechnologies, monoclonal antibodies and the CRISPR-Cas system. These strategies are suggested as inhibitors of viral replication by various means, such as direct binding to the viral particle, blocking the infection, changes in intracellular mechanisms or viral genes, preventing replication and virion formation. We also observed that a large number of viral agents have no therapy available and the majority of those approved in the last 32 years are restricted to some groups, especially anti-HIV. Additionally, the emergence of new viruses and strains resistant to available antivirals has necessitated the formulation of new antivirals.","Gonçalves, Bruna Carolina; Lopes Barbosa, Mário Gabriel; Silva Olak, Anna Paula; Belebecha Terezo, Natalia; Nishi, Leticia; Watanabe, Maria Angélica; Marinello, Poliana; Zendrini Rechenchoski, Daniele; Dejato Rocha, Sergio Paulo; Faccin-Galhardi, Lígia Carla",Fundam. clin. pharmacol,263,1

With the potential need to reallocate human and financial resources at this challenging time, it will be useful to have detailed descriptions of the rates of pediatric trauma and understanding of how the pandemic affects these rates. Questions/Purposes: We sought to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of acute pediatric trauma admissions and procedures performed in a level-I trauma center in Cork University Hospital, Ireland. Methods: We compared the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures that occurred during the first 4 weeks of a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 with that of the same 4-week period in each of the preceding 11 years. Seasonal variables were measured and controlled for using multivariate regression analysis. Results: A total of 545 pediatric patients (under 16 years of age) were included. Over 12 years, the lowest number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures was recorded during the 2020 pandemic. There was a significant correlation between the number of school days and the number of acute traumatic admissions, as well as the procedures performed. The relationship between the number of school days and the number of trauma procedures was evident even when controlling for confounder variables of seasonal variation. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures performed in our level-I trauma center, likely because of a reduction in school days. With the reopening of schools, playgrounds, and sporting events, an increase in pediatric trauma admissions is anticipated. The results of this study can help prepare institutions and regulatory bodies to plan appropriately for this new phase.","Sheridan, Gerard A; Nagle, Matthew; Russell, Shane; Varghese, Stanly; O039,; Loughlin, Padhraig F; Boran, Sinead; Taylor, Colm; Harty, James A",HSS J,263,22

The questionnaire was sent to a total of 9416 dentists, with a response rate of 27.98% (n = 2635). Respondents were divided into seven macro areas by gross domestic product. Nearly two-thirds of dentists (65.16%) reported a reduction in their practice workload of more than 50% compared to the pre-pandemic period with statistically significant differences between German macro areas (p < 0.01). Weekly workload was reduced during the lockdown in 93.00% of study participants, while 55.33% dental care centers with multiple employed dentists under the direction of a non-dentist general manager had only a 40% reduction in weekly workload compared to a solo practice or a practice of a dentist with an employed dentist (30.24% and 28.39%, respectively). Dentists in Germany drastically reduced their practice activity during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown, both in rural and urban areas.

368071,368071,368071,Editor’s Note,14.792474,3.3310282,2020,"Digital health is a rapidly emerging field that offers several promising potentials: health care delivery remotely, in urban and rural areas, in any time zone, and in times of pandemics and ecological crises. Digital health encompasses electronic health, computing science, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, to name but a few technical components. Digital health is part of a vision for systems medicine. The advances in digital health have been, however, uneven and highly variable across communities, countries, medical specialties, and societal contexts. This article critically examines the determinants of digital health (DDH). DDH describes and critically responds to inequities and differences in digital health theory and practice across people, places, spaces, and time. DDH is not limited to studying variability in design and access to digital technologies. DDH is situated within a larger context of the political determinants of health. Hence, this article presents an analysis of DDH, as seen through political science, and the feminist studies of technology and society. A feminist lens would strengthen systems-driven, historically and critically informed governance for DDH. This would be a timely antidote against unchecked destructive/extractive governance narratives (e.g., technocracy and patriarchy) that produce and reproduce the health inequities. Moreover, feminist framing of DDH can help cultivate epistemic competence to detect and reject false equivalences in how we understand the emerging digital world(s). False equivalence, very common in the current pandemic and post-truth era, is a type of flawed reasoning in decision-making where equal weight is given to arguments with concrete material evidence, and those that are conjecture, untrue, or unjust. A feminist conceptual lens on DDH would help remedy what I refer to in this article as ""the normative deficits"" in science and technology policy that became endemic with the rise of neoliberal governance since the 1980s in particular. In this context, it is helpful to recall the feminist writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Le Guin posed ""what if?"" questions, to break free from oppressive narratives such as patriarchy and re-imagine technology futures. It is time to envision an emancipated, equitable, and more democratic world by asking ""what if we lived in a feminist world?"" That would be truly awesome, for everyone, women and men, children, youth, and future generations, to steer digital technologies and the new field of DDH toward broadly relevant, ethical, experiential, democratic, and socially responsive health outcomes.","Özdemir, Vural",OMICS,263,26

Many patients also develop cardiovascular complications during and after COVID-19 infection. Underlying cardiovascular disease increases the severity of COVID-19 infection;however, it is unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of or causes cardiovascular complications in patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease. The review is aimed at informing the primary care physicians of the potential cardiovascular complications, especially in patients without underlying cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive literature review was performed on cardiac and vascular complications of COVID-19. The primary cardiac and vascular complications include myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial injury, arrhythmia, heart failure, shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, venous and arterial thrombotic events, stroke, and coagulopathy. A detailed analysis of the pathogenesis revealed six possible mechanisms: direct cardiac damage, hypoxia-induced injury, inflammation, a dysfunctional endothelial response, coagulopathy, and the catecholamine stress response. Autopsy reports from studies show cardiomegaly, hypertrophy, ventricular dilation, infarction, and fibrosis. A wide range of cardiac and vascular complications should be considered when treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Elevated troponin and natriuretic peptides indicate an early cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Continuous monitoring of coagulation by measuring serum D-dimer can potentially prevent vascular complications. A long-term screening protocol to follow-up the patients in the primary care settings is needed to follow-up with the patients who recovered from COVID cardiovascular complications.

METHODS AND RESULTS: CAPACITY-COVID is an international patient registry established to determine the role of cardiovascular disease in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this registry, data generated during routine clinical practice are collected in a standardised manner for patients with a (highly suspected) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requiring hospitalisation. For the current analysis, consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 registered between 28 March and 3 July 2020 were included. Patients were followed for the occurrence of cardiac complications and pulmonary embolism from admission to discharge. In total, 3011 patients were included, of which 1890 (62.8%) were men. The median age was 67 years (interquartile range 56-76); 937 (31.0%) patients had a history of cardiac disease, with pre-existent coronary artery disease being most common (n=463, 15.4%). During hospitalisation, 595 (19.8%) patients died, including 16 patients (2.7%) with cardiac causes. Cardiac complications were diagnosed in 349 (11.6%) patients, with atrial fibrillation (n=142, 4.7%) being most common. The incidence of other cardiac complications was 1.8% for heart failure (n=55), 0.5% for acute coronary syndrome (n=15), 0.5% for ventricular arrhythmia (n=14), 0.1% for bacterial endocarditis (n=4) and myocarditis (n=3), respectively, and 0.03% for pericarditis (n=1). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 198 (6.6%) patients. CONCLUSION: This large study among 3011 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 shows that the incidence of cardiac complications during hospital admission is low, despite a frequent history of cardiovascular disease. Long-term cardiac outcomes and the role of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 outcome warrants further investigation.","Linschoten, Marijke; Peters, Sanne; van Smeden, Maarten; Jewbali, Lucia S; Schaap, Jeroen; Siebelink, Hans-Marc; Smits, Peter C; Tieleman, Robert G; van der Harst, Pim; van Gilst, Wiek H; Asselbergs, Folkert W",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,263,1

Currently, most studies based on location data model the pattern of an urban dynamic and then extract the anomalies, which deviate significantly from the pattern as urban events. However, few studies have considered the long temporal dependency of sentiment strength in geotagged social media data, and thus it is difficult to further improve the reliability of detection results. In this paper, we combined a sentiment analysis method and long short-term memory neural network for detecting urban events with geotagged social media data. We first applied a dictionary-based method to evaluate the positive and negative sentiment strength. Based on long short-term memory neural network, the long temporal dependency of sentiment strength in geotagged social media data was constructed. By considering the long temporal dependency, daily positive and negative sentiment strength are predicted. We extracted anomalies that deviated significantly from the prediction as urban events. For each event, event-related information was obtained by analyzing social media texts. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is a cost-effective way to detect urban events, such as festivals, COVID-19-related events and traffic jams. In addition, compared to existing methods, we found that accounting for a long temporal dependency of sentiment strength can significantly improve the reliability of event detection. © 2021 by the authors.","Jiang, W.; Wang, Y.; Xiong, Z.; Song, X.; Long, Y.; Cao, W.",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,263,16

METHODS: The authors queried three biomedical databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and two preprint servers (MedRxiv and SSRN) to identify literature pertaining to preprints. Additionally, they evaluated 12 preprint servers featuring COVID-19 research through sample submission of six manuscripts. RESULTS: The realm of health sciences research has seen a dramatic increase in the presence and importance of preprint publications. By posting manuscripts on preprint servers, researchers are able to immediately communicate their findings, thereby facilitating prompt feedback and promoting collaboration. In doing so, they may also reduce publication bias and improve methodological transparency. However, by circumventing the peer-review process, academia incurs the risk of disseminating erroneous or misinterpreted data and suffering the downstream consequences. Never have these issues been better highlighted than during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers have flooded the literature with preprint publications as stopgaps to meet the desperate need for knowledge about the disease. These unreviewed articles initially outnumbered those published in conventional journals and helped steer the mainstream scientific community at the start of the pandemic. In surveying select preprint servers, the authors discovered varying usability, review practices, and acceptance polices. CONCLUSION: While vital in the rapid dispensation of science, preprint manuscripts promulgate their conclusions without peer review and possess the capacity to misinform. Undoubtedly part of the future of science, conscientious consumers will need to appreciate not only their utility, but also their limitations.","Nabavi Nouri, Shayan; Cohen, Yosef A; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Slomka, Piotr J; Iskandrian, Ami E; Einstein, Andrew J",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice (Online),263,15

However, in the last months an increasing number of Italian pediatricians has reported the occurrence of erythema pernio-like in children following a flu-like syndrome, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: To report cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 adolescents. METHODS: Observational study reporting 4 adolescents with skin lesions, 2 weeks after the occurrence of a flu-like syndrome. RESULTS: Fourteen days after a flu-like syndrome, adolescents exhibited skin lesions to toes and feet. These lesions were rounded, with blurred limits, with a 5-15 mm diameter, red-violaceous-bluish colored, sometimes resulting in bullous lesions in correspondence of the central or apical portion, which tended to be covered with blackish crusts after evolution. Lesions were also accompanied by pain of variable intensity and evolved within two or three weeks to self-resolution without particular sequelae. In two patients, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the presentation of skin lesions. After 2 months from clinical manifestations, patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric and adolescent population, the occurrence of an erythema pernio-like after a flu-like syndrome could be associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Promenzio, Luigi; Arcangeli, Fabio; Cortis, Elisabetta; Sama, Elisa; Longhini, Federico",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),263,19

A tree of maximum credibility was constructed using the 72 entire genome sequences of this virus, from the three countries (China, Italy, and Spain) available as of 26 March 2020 on the GISAID reference frame. To schematize the current SARS-CoV-2 migration scenario between and within the three countries chosen, using the multitype bearth-death model implemented in BEAST2. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rate of evolution of 2.11 × 10-3 per sites per year (95% highest posterior density: 1.56 × 10-3 to 3.89 × 10-3 ), and a geographic origin in Shanghai, where time until the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) emerged, according to the analysis of the molecular clock, around 13 November 2019. While for Italy and Spain, there are two tMRCA for each country, which agree with the assumption of several introductions for these countries. That explains also this very short period of subepidermal circulation before the recent events. A total of 8 (median) migration events occurred during this short period, the largest proportion of which (6 events [75%]) occurred from Shanghai (China) to Spain and from Italy to Spain. Such events are marked by speeds of migration that are comparatively lower as compared with that from Shanghai to Italy. Shanghai's R0 and Italy's are closer to each other, though Spain's is slightly higher. All these results allow us to conclude the need for an automatic system of mixed, molecular and classical epidemiological surveillance, which could play a role in this global surveillance of public health and decision-making.","Nabil, Benazi; Sabrina, Bounab; Abdelhakim, Bounab",J. med. virol,263,14

We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised. The development of up-to-date self-harm and suicide statistics to monitor the effect of the current pandemic is an urgent priority.","Rogers, J P; Chesney, E; Oliver, D; Begum, N; Saini, A; Wang, S; McGuire, P; Fusar-Poli, P; Lewis, G; David, A S",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,263,10

Taking into consideration its ingredients and the prolonged use of hand sanitizers, ""Formulation 1"" (P1) was compared with two gel formulations (P2 and P3) prepared with the addition of natural emollients and two different viscosity enhancers to define their chemical-physical stability, biocidal efficacy, and in vivo acceptability and tolerability. P1 resulted in the most efficient biocide but was poorly tolerated by the skin and not acceptable in volunteer hedonic evaluation, especially in terms of irritation and drying effect, with an expectable reduction in the compliance. Moreover, its liquid formulation is unpractical and can cause ethanol evaporation. P2 and P3 proved to be both good products regarding pH and alcohol strength values. However, in terms of viscosity, texture, ease of use, and application, P3 seemed to be a better gel product than P2. Moreover, they were well tolerated by the skin, increasing the hydration of the stratum corneum, due to the addition of Calendula officinalis and Aloe vera. Despite a lower ethanol concentration than P1, P2 and P3 also showed a good biocide efficiency, with better results in P2. In conclusion, these gel formulations proved to be more convenient for long-term use with a good balance between efficacy, safety, and compatibility with the skin.","Fallica, F.; Leonardi, C.; Toscano, V.; Santonocito, D.; Leonardi, P.; Puglia, C.",Pharmaceutics,263,10

APOBEC3 genes are highly amplified and diversified in mammals, suggesting that their evolution and diversification have been driven by conflicts with ancient viruses. At present, lentiviruses, including HIV, the causative agent of AIDS, are known to encode a viral protein called Vif to overcome the antiviral effects of the APOBEC3 proteins of their hosts. Recent studies have revealed that the acquisition of an anti-APOBEC3 ability by lentiviruses is a key step in achieving successful cross-species transmission. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the interplay between mammalian APOBEC3 proteins and viral infections and introduce a scenario of the coevolution of mammalian APOBEC3 genes and viruses.","Uriu, Keiya; Kosugi, Yusuke; Ito, Jumpei; Sato, Kei",Viruses,263,16

Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests. Nevertheless, more controlled serology cohort studies should be performed as soon as possible to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Huergo, Maria Ana Cristina; Thanh, Nguyen Thi Kim",Analyst,263,18

A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based survey during the first week of the lockdown period. There were 341 observations collected using a snowball sampling technique. A Tobit multivariable regression model was used to identify factors associated with the demand for each category of health information. The most requested information was the latest updated news on the epidemic, followed by information about disease symptoms and updated news on the outbreak. The prevalence of diverse socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnic factors in Vietnam requires consideration of the specific health information needs of unique groups. Identifying group-specific demands would be helpful to provide proper information to fulfill each population group's needs.","Le, Huong Thi; Nguyen, Diep Ngoc; Beydoun, Ahmed Sam; Le, Xuan Thi Thanh; Nguyen, Thao Thanh; Pham, Quan Thi; Ta, Nhung Thi Kim; Nguyen, Quynh Thi; Nguyen, Anh Ngoc; Hoang, Men Thi; Vu, Linh Gia; Tran, Bach Xuan; Latkin, Carl A; Ho, Cyrus S H; Ho, Roger C M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),263,24

The vision of families in Spain,14.7293,3.216145,2021,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems and safety providers have faced an unprecedented challenge of limited access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to conduct patient and public care. In federal emergencies, reuse of PPE after disinfection can occur by processes, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. We identified a vacant animal holding facility at our institution to repurpose into a regional VHP decontamination center. Methods: The facility is a multiroom, 20 000 ft 2building with control of HVAC to adjust to VHP conditional requirements. H 2O 2was delivered to rooms using robotic HaloFoggers, dispersing H 2O 2vapor and increasingly concentrated microdroplets as a fog for a timed period based on cubic footage of rooms. Results: Fogging cycles eliminated 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus up to 7 days postcycle. Functional efficacy of treated N95s was confirmed by fit tests of institutional personnel. Signage, process flow mapping, and training materials facilitated ease of workflow and adherence to safety expectations within the building. Discussion and Conclusion: Our study determined that a variety of N95 respirator types and sizes were able to be cleared of potential bacterial and viral agents using VHP in a controlled fog/dwell/exhaust cycle. This repurposed animal facility has the capacity to decontaminate up to 6700 respirators daily, which will address the predicted surge of COVID-19 cases in the state, and ultimately allow each respirator to be reused multiple times. There is no other public site in the region with our capacity to offset the continued supply chain issues for PPE needs.","Hankenson, F.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods: A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results: A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (R²â¯=â¯0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress. Conclusions: Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on emotional status of healthcare workers involved in this study.","Erquicia, Juan; Valls, Laura; Barja, Andrés; Gil, Sergi; Miquel, Joan; Leal-Blanquet, Joan; Schmidt, Carlos; Checa, Josep; Vega, Daniel",,263,20

The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion-CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.","Persson, B David; John, Lijo; Rafie, Karim; Strebl, Michael; Frängsmyr, Lars; Ballmann, Monika Z; Mindler, Katja; Havenga, Menzo; Lemckert, Angelique; Stehle, Thilo; Carlson, Lars-Anders; Arnberg, Niklas",Proc.

Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA at the start of the epidemic. We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R2 = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high predictability of R0 allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R0 argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.","Ives, Anthony R; Bozzuto, Claudio",Commun Biol,263,16

Although studies conducted prior to the pandemic have suggested that telemedicine is an acceptable format for older adults, there is a paucity of data on the practical implementation of telemedicine visits. Due to prior lack of reimbursement for telemedicine visits involving nonrural patients, no studies have compared telephone visits to video visits in geriatric primary care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine (1) whether video visits had longer durations, more visit diagnoses, and more advance care planning discussions than telephone visits during the rapid implementation of telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether disparities in visit type existed based on patient characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of patients seen at two geriatric clinics from April 23 to May 22, 2020. Approximately 25% of patients who had telephone and video appointments during this time underwent chart review. We analyzed patient characteristics, visit characteristics, duration of visits, number of visit diagnoses, and the presence of advance care planning discussion in clinical documentation. RESULTS: Of the 190 appointments reviewed, 47.4% (n=90) were video visits. Compared to telephone appointments, videoconferencing was, on average, 7 minutes longer (mean 37.3 minutes, SD 10 minutes; P<.001) and had, on average, 1.2 more visit diagnoses (mean 5.7, SD 3; P=.001). Video and telephone visits had similar rates of advance care planning. Furthermore, hearing, vision, and cognitive impairment did not result in different rates of video or telephone appointments. Non-White patients, patients who needed interpreter services, and patients who received Medicaid were less likely to have video visits than White patients, patients who did not need an interpreter, and patients who did not receive Medicaid, respectively (P=.003, P=.01, P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although clinicians spent more time on video visits than telephone visits, more than half of this study's older patients did not use video visits, especially if they were from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds or Medicaid beneficiaries. This potential health care disparity merits greater attention.","Schifeling, Christopher H; Shanbhag, Prajakta; Johnson, Angene; Atwater, Riannon C; Koljack, Claire; Parnes, Bennett L; Vejar, Maria M; Farro, Samantha A; Phimphasone-Brady, Phoutdavone; Lum, Hillary D",JMIR Aging,263,24

DESIGN: We compared, in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 older patients, three specifically developed scores with a previously established early warning score. Main endpoint was all causes in-hospital death. SETTING: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study, conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of an urban teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the clinical records of the confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more consecutively admitted to our ED over a 6-week period (March 1st to April 15th, 2020). A total of 210 patients, aged between 60 and 98 years were included in the study cohort. MEASUREMENTS: International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterization Protocol-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium (ISARIC-4C) score, COVID-GRAM Critical Illness Risk Score (COVID-GRAM), quick COVID-19 Severity Index (qCSI), National Early Warning Score (NEWS). RESULTS: Median age was 74 (67-82) and 133 (63.3%) were males. Globally, 42 patients (20.0%) deceased. All the score evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in-hospital death. The ISARIC-4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 (0.738-0.851), followed by the COVID-GRAM 0.785 (0.723-0.838), NEWS 0.764 (0.700-0.819), and qCSI 0.749 (0.685-0.806). However, these differences were not statistical significant. CONCLUSION: Among the evaluated scores, the ISARIC-4C and the COVID-GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance, although the qCSI had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items. However, the NEWS, already widely validated in clinical practice, had a similar performance and could be appropriate for older patients with COVID-19.","Covino, Marcello; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Burzo, Maria Livia; Russo, Andrea; Forte, Evelina; Carnicelli, Annamaria; Piccioni, Andrea; Simeoni, Benedetta; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco; Sandroni, Claudio",,263,29

The objective of this study was to understand the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income adults in the US as social distancing measures began to be implemented. On 19-24 March 2020 we fielded a national, web-based survey (53% response rate) among adults with <250% of the federal poverty line in the US (N = 1478). Measures included household food security status and COVID-19-related basic needs challenges. Overall, 36% of low-income adults in the US were food secure, 20% had marginal food security, and 44% were food insecure. Less than one in five (18.8%) of adults with very low food security reported being able to comply with public health recommendations to purchase two weeks of food at a time. For every basic needs challenge, food-insecure adults were significantly more likely to report facing that challenge, with a clear gradient effect based on severity of food security. The short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are magnifying existing disparities and disproportionately affecting low-income, food-insecure households that already struggle to meet basic needs.

METHODS: Two physicians and one nurse working on the same shift on 20th February 2021 were involved in the outbreak. Real-time PCR, antigen tests, and serological tests for the IgG anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were performed, along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all three HCWs; all presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19. The two physicians were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSIONS: This mini-outbreak highlights some important issues about the efficacy of vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the high risk of exposure among HCWs, and the need for optimized implementation of PPE in hospitals. The wide circulation of VOC 202012/01 in Europe and Italy highlights the need to improve surveillance and genetic sequencing.","Loconsole, Daniela; Sallustio, Anna; Accogli, Marisa; Leaci, Angela; Sanguedolce, Antonio; Parisi, Antonio; Chironna, Maria",Clin. microbiol. infect,263,33

Health-care resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic.","Aziz, Asma B; Raqib, Rubhana; Khan, Wasif A; Rahman, Mahbubur; Haque, Rashidul; Alam, Munir; Zaman, K; Ross, Allen G",Int. j. infect. dis,263,1

With the advent of data-sharing, computational approaches have gained a key role in evaluating future scenarios. To design optimal social, hospitalization and economical strategies that guarantee control over the pandemic progression, we developed a data-driven modelling framework with the aim to provide reliable near future predictions under constantly evolving social and pandemic conditions. The framework is flexible enough to be used at a single hospital, regional or national level. We used a variety of data such as social, serological, testing and clinical data to compute the infection dynamics and the hospital workload for France. We developed inference methods to calibrate model parameters from observed hospitalization statistics over adjustable time periods. We applied our model to study the age stratified pandemic evolution inside and outside hospitals until February 2021, and the competition between vaccinations and the novel delta variant. We obtained several predictions about hidden pandemic properties such as fractions of infected, infection hospitality and infection fatality ratios. We show that reproduction numbers and herd immunity levels are not universal but strongly depend on the underlying social dynamics. We find that with normal social interactions the present vaccination status and rate is not sufficient to prevent a new pandemic wave driven by the delta variant.","Reingruber, Juergen; Papale, Andrea; Ruckly, Stephane; Timsit, Jean-Francois; Holcman, David",,263,16

The mechanisms of COVID-19-associated hematologic complications involve endothelial cell and platelet dysfunction and have been intensively studied. We leveraged a prospectively collected acute COVID-19 biorepository to study the association of plasma levels of a comprehensive list of coagulation proteins with the occurrence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). We included in our analysis 305 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented to an urban Emergency Department with acute respiratory distress during the first COVID-19 surge in 2020; 13 (4.2%) were subsequently diagnosed with venous thromboembolism during hospitalization. Serial samples were obtained and assays were performed on two highly-multiplexed proteomic platforms. Nine coagulation proteins were differentially expressed in patients with thromboembolic events. P-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule on the surface of activated endothelial cells, displayed the strongest association with the diagnosis of VTE, independent of disease severity (p=0.0025). This supports the importance of endothelial activation in the mechanistic pathway of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19. P-selectin together with D-dimer upon hospital presentation provided better discriminative ability for VTE diagnosis than D-dimer alone.","Fenyves, Bank Gabor; Mehta, Arnav; amp, - MGH COVID-19 Collection; Team, Processing; Kays, Kyle; Goldberg, Marcia; Hacohen, Nir; Filbin, Michael",,263,1

Given their detailed knowledge of research protocols and regular contact with patients, clinicians, and sponsors, clinical research professionals offer important perspectives on these changes. METHODS: We developed and distributed an anonymous survey assessing COVID-19-related clinical trial adjustment experiences, perceptions, and recommendations to Clinical Research Office personnel at the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Responses were compared using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: A total of 94 of 109 contacted research personnel (87%) responded. Among these individuals, 58% had >5 years' professional experience in clinical research, and 56% had personal experience with a COVID-19-related change. Respondents perceived that these changes had a positive impact on patient safety; treatment efficacy; patient and staff experience; and communication with patients, investigators, and sponsors. More than 90% felt that positive changes should be continued after COVID-19. For remote consent, telehealth, therapy shipment, off-site diagnostics, and remote monitoring, individuals with personal experience with the specific change and individuals with >5 years' professional experience were numerically more likely to recommend continuing the adjustment, and these differences were significant for telehealth (P=.04) and therapy shipment (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research professionals perceive that COVID-19-related clinical trial adjustments positively impact multiple aspects of study conduct. Those with greatest experience-both specific to COVID-19-related changes and more generally-are more likely to recommend that these adjustments continue in the future.","Gerber, David E; Sheffield, Thomas Y; Beg, M Shaalan; Williams, Erin L; Clark, Valerie L; Xie, Yang; Holbein, M E Blair; Skinner, Celette Sugg; Lee, Simon J Craddock",J Natl Compr Canc Netw,263,24

Natural extracellular matrix (ECM) creates a microenvironment suitable for culture of stem cells. In the present study, we intended to assess the capability of the porous scaffold consisting of hyaluronic acid (HA), chitosan, and decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) as a proper niche for SSCs seeding. METHODS: The testes of four NMRI mice were extracted for further detergent-based decellularization process. We isolated, cultured, and clarified neonate mouse SSC, and a three-dimensional scaffold was prepared for SSCs culture. The loaded SSCs and hydrogel-based scaffold were investigated by several studies including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 3-[4, 5-dimethyl (thiazol-2yl)-3,5diphenyl] tetrazolium bromide (MTT), Acridine orange, and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. RESULTS: The efficiency of decellularization process was confirmed by DAPI, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and Masson's Trichrome staining. Acridine orange also depicted SSCs proliferation and viability. SEM approved the preservation of ECM components and also showed complex, coiled, and tubular seminiferous tubules, with intact and condensed collagenous form of the tunica albuginea. MTT test also revealed the scaffold's non-toxicity. Expression of PLZF, TP1, and TEKT1 markers also verified the capacity of SSCs proliferation on a cogel scaffold. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, cogel scaffold consisting of DTM, HA, and chitosan may provide the supporting layer for in vitro SSC differentiation and proliferation.","Naeemi, Sahar; Eidi, Akram; Khanbabaee, Ramezan; Sadri-Ardekani, Homan; Kajbafzadeh, Abdol-Mohammad",Int. urol. nephrol,263,24

Online media are a critical factor of influence on the formation of attitudes in many areas of modern society, which is why their proper use plays an important role in strengthening vaccine confidence and which may further contribute to improvement of public health. On the other side, having in mind the fact that communication is an integral part of marketing, it is clear that social marketing has an extremely important role regarding the analyzed topic, especially because of the fact that social marketing activities tend to change or maintain people's behavior for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole. For the purpose of this research, a conceptual model was developed. Quantitative research was conducted online in the first quarter of 2020 using the survey method. Statistical analysis was applied to data collected from 1593 parents in the analyzed countries. The relevance of the hypotheses was tested using standard statistical tests, ANOVA test, eta coefficient, and logistic regression. The research showed that all analyzed variables from the model have a significant impact on the parents' attitudes toward the vaccination of children and that they correlate with the degree of trust in vaccines. The results also approved that online media have a significant influence on the formation of parents' attitudes toward the vaccination of children (obtained values of eta coefficient Î·2 = 0.216, Î·2 = 0.18, Î·2 = 0.167, Î·2 = 0.090, reliability Cronbach's Alpha 0.892), which confirms the importance of the use of social marketing in order to direct communication properly and to strengthen the level of trust in vaccines. Additionally, the results of logistic regression showed that the following groups of parents are particularly vulnerable to the influence of online media on attitudes toward vaccines: women, parents of younger age (""millennials""), and parents who are in common law marriage, as well as parents who have more children. In addition, the results showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the attitudes of parents in the observed countries (Î·2 = 0.000, F = 0.85). Based on the results of the research, the authors suggest that decision makers should pay more attention to modern forms of online communication and social marketing in order to use their potential for improvement of public health, as well as avoid the harmful impact that certain forms of communication may have on the formation of attitudes and loss of confidence in vaccines. The findings provide an important contribution for public health policy makers to identify and understand properly the impact of online media and social marketing and thus to better adapt their initiatives to changes in modern society.","Melovic, Boban; Jaksic Stojanovic, Andjela; Vulic, Tamara Backovic; Dudic, Branislav; Benova, Eleonora",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),263,27

This study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, including the first case of each Regional Health Coordination and cases from three epidemic peaks. MethodsNinety SARS-CoV-2 genomes from RS were sequenced and analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 datasets available in GISAID for phylogenetic inference and mutation analysis. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 lineages among the first cases in RS were B.1 (33.3%), B.1.1.28 (26.7%), B.1.1 (13.3%), B.1.1.33 (10.0%), and A (6.7%), evidencing SARS-CoV-2 introduction by both international origin and community-driven transmission. We found predominance of B.1.1.33 (50.0%) and B.1.1.28 (35.0%) during the first epidemic peak (July-August, 2020), emergence of P.2 (55.6%) in the second peak (November-December, 2020), and massive spread of P.1 and related sequences (78.4%), such as P.1-like-II, P.1.1 and P.1.2 in the third peak (February-April, 2021). Eighteen novel mutation combinations were found among P.1 genomes, and 22 different spike mutations and/or deletions among P.1 and related sequences. ConclusionsThis study shows the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Southern Brazil, and describes SARS-CoV-2 diversity during three epidemic peaks, highlighting the spread of P.1 and the high genetic diversity of currently circulating lineages.

Twenty healthy participants were instrumented with fw and surface (s) EMG electrodes at the biceps brachii bilaterally. Participants held a weight statically with one arm and with the other arm either repeated the same task following a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) or repeated dynamic elbow flexion/extension contractions. Each task was repeated for 30 s every five minutes over two hours. EMG amplitude was smoothed and normalized to time = 0. Stable median power frequency of the s-EMG ruled out the confounding influence of fatigue. Repeated-measures ANCOVAs determined the effect of electrode type and time (covariate) on EMG amplitude and the confounding impact of task type. During the isometric protocol, fw-EMG amplitude reduced over time (p = 0.002), while s-EMG amplitude (p = 0.895) and MPF (p > 0.05) did not change. Fw-EMG amplitude attenuated faster during the dynamic than the isometric protocol (p = 0.008) and there was evidence that the MVC preceding the isometric protocol impacted the rate of decline (p = 0.001). We conclude that systematic signal attenuation of fw-EMG occurs over time and is more pronounced during dynamic tasks.","Reeves, Joanna; McLean, Linda",J Electromyogr Kinesiol,263,26

METHODS: A survey of the American College of Emergency Physicians Air Medical Section was conducted between May 13, 2020, and August 1, 2020. COVID-19 prevalence was defined as high versus low based on cases > 2,500 or &#8804; 2,500. RESULTS: Of the 48 respondents, the majority (89.6%) reported that their patient guidelines had changed because of COVID-19; 89.6% of programs reported transporting COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 91.5% reported transporting persons under investigation. The majority of respondents reported additional training in COVID-19 airway management (79.2%) and personal protective equipment use (93.6%). Permitted aerosol-generating procedures included bilevel positive airway pressure (40.4%) and high-flow nasal oxygen (66.0%). No difference in guideline changes, positive COVID-19/persons under investigation transport restrictions, or permitted aerosol-generating procedures were noted between high- and low-prevalence settings. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in changes to HEMS guidelines regardless of local disease prevalence. The pandemic has persisted sufficiently long that data regarding the effectiveness of guideline changes should be analyzed. In the absence of definitive data, national best practices should be developed to guide COVID-19 HEMS transport.","Meng, Xiaoyan; Blakeney, Craig A; Wood, Jeffrey N; Bucks, Colin M; Mhayamaguru, K Moses; Luke, Anuradha; Laudon, Dennis A; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D",Air Med J,263,16

This study investigated intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and influenza, and sought to identify attitudes towards vaccines and barriers for vaccine acceptance. Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Louisiana State University Medicine Clinic from September 2020 to December 2020. Intent to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 and influenza virus was assessed through a brief questionnaire. Additionally, hesitancy and attitudes regarding vaccines were ascertained using validated 5-point Likert scales. In total, 280 patients completed the questionnaire. Results: A total of 248 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall 167 (67%, 95% CI = 61.1-73.0%) of patients were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while only 19.3% (95% CI = 14.4-24.5%) were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against the influenza vaccine. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding side effects, fear of getting sick from the vaccine, and the absence of vaccine recommendations from their doctor. Concerningly, African American patients demonstrated decreased likelihood of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: This survey revealed that only 1 in 3 adults intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while 8 out of 10 adults intended to receive the influenza vaccine. Patients who intended on getting the COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to be African American. Given the degree of hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccination, a multifaceted approach to facilitate vaccine uptake that includes vaccine education, behavioral change strategies, and health promotion, is paramount.","Johnson, K.

We aimed to assess the impact of the measures and steps taken to mitigate these challenges in order to continue to deliver intestinal/multivisceral transplantation (I/MVTx). Methods: All I/MVTx between March 2020 to December 2020 were included in the study. Data were collated from a prospectively maintained departmental database and are presented descriptively. Results: All potential I/MVTx recipients were suspended at the start of the pandemic and were reactivated after an eight week period of risk assessment. A total of five transplants were performed during the study period. (Table-1) All recipients and donors were COVID tested just prior to surgery and managed through a COVID clean patient pathway as per NHSBT. Discussion: Pre-operative precautions (screening of donor history, additional endotracheal swabs and recipient swabs) were in place at the time of the procedures. Clinical urgency mandated conscious decisions such as liver reduction and staged abdominal closure in two patients with intractable GI bleeding. Intra-operative risk mitigation strategies included utilisation of standard PPE, minimal personnel in theatre and minimisation of surgical pauses. The prioritisation of the procedures to experienced donor and recipient surgeons allowed for short Cold ischemia times (some recipient operations were started prior to cross clamp at the donor site). No changes were made to immunosuppression protocols. Post-operative follow up was changed to minimize recipient visits to the hospital. There were no routine follow up endoscopies and stomal biopsies were reduced to once-a-week and when clinically indicated. No routine follow up face-to-face outpatient appointments were made. Instead, parents were educated and supported through a process of daily weight and stoma output monitoring and these were directly reported to the consultant through e-mail. Conclusion: Adaptation to different challenges during the pandemic permitted restitution of the intestinal transplant pathway without any deleterious effect on outcomes. Changes in post discharge practice introduced will continue and may improve the patient care pathway.","Pathanki, A.; Perera, T.; Sharif, K.; Hartog, H.; Hartley, J.; Hogg, L.; Bennett, J.; Bromley, P.; Bugg, N.; Stansfield, J.; Gupte, G.; Mirza, D.",Transplantation,263,16

Determining the quality and duration of that immunity is therefore key. But the adaptive immune system is complex, and these factors may differ between natural immunity (obtained by infection) and vaccine-generated immunity (1). Additionally, there is the question of the combination: What kind of immunity develops in people with natural immunity who are subsequently vaccinated? Such “hybrid immunity” is particularly interesting because of the notable finding that people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection mount unusually potent immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines (2). This is exemplified in two studies in this issue on pages 1413 and 1418 by Stamatatos et al. (3) and Reynolds et al.

The overarching goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the first comprehensive summary of the findings of published studies thus far describing COVID-19 lung imaging data in the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies assessing lung-imaging features of COVID-19 pediatric patients (0-18 years). A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of 29 articles (n = 1026 children) based on chest computerized tomography (CT) images were included. The main results of this comprehensive analysis are as follows: (1) Over a third of pediatric patients with COVID-19 (35.7%, 95% CI: 27.5%-44%) had normal chest CT scans and only 27.7% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.6%) had bilateral lesions. (2) The most typical pediatric chest CT findings of COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (37.2%, 95% CI: 29.3%-45%) and the presence of consolidations or pneumonic infiltrates (22.3%, 95% CI: 17.8%-26.9%). (3) The lung imaging findings in children with COVID-19 were overall less frequent and less severe than in adult patients. (4) Typical lung imaging features of viral respiratory infections in the pediatric population such as increased perihilar markings and hyperinflation were not reported in children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Chest CT manifestations in children with COVID-19 could potentially be used for early identification and prompt intervention in the pediatric population.","Nino, Gustavo; Zember, Jonathan; Sanchez-Jacob, Ramon; Gutierrez, Maria J; Sharma, Karun; Linguraru, Marius George",Pediatr. pulmonol,263,24

The p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has been implicated in acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction. The overwhelming inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection may be caused by disproportionately upregulated p38 activity, explained by two mechanisms. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity is lost during SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs and heart and converts Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II signals proinflammatory, pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-thrombotic activity through p38 MAPK activation, which is countered by Angiotensin 1-7 downregulation of p38 activity. Loss of ACE2 upon viral entry may tip the balance towards destructive p38 signaling through Angiotensin II. Second, SARS-CoV was previously shown to directly upregulate p38 activity via a viral protein, similar to other RNA respiratory viruses that may hijack p38 activity to promote replication. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter may employ a similar mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may induce overwhelming inflammation by directly activating p38 and downregulating a key inhibitory pathway, while simultaneously taking advantage of p38 activity to replicate. Therapeutic inhibition of p38 could therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model. A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious COVID-19 infection.","Grimes, Joseph M; Grimes, Kevin V",J Mol Cell Cardiol,263,16

Older people are more susceptible to the virus than other people. As a good health exercise suitable for the elderly, Tai Chi has a positive impact on heart function, blood pressure, lung function, immunity, etc. It can enhance cardiopulmonary function, increase the elasticity of blood vessels, and improve the body's self-regulation function. For the elder patients with COVID-19, Tai Chi has outstanding merits. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, Clinical Trials and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and meta-analyses. Endnote X9.3 will be used to manage data screening. The statistical analysis will be completed by Stata/SE 15.1 software. RESULTS: This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi for the improvement of psychological pressure, cardiopulmonary function, and immunity in elderly COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to prove the safety and effectiveness of Tai Chi on elderly COVID-19 patients during the recovery period.

This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN: Descriptive study from two hospitals. SETTING: The ICUs from university hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received mechanical ventilation, including those underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 8, 2020, to March 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records. One-hundred twenty-nine critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia were admitted to ICU of the two referral hospitals. Fifty-nine patients received mechanical ventilation and 21 of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (fourteen from Zhongnan hospital and seven from Wuhan pulmonary hospital). Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782). For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020. Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.","Yang, Xiao; Cai, Shuhan; Luo, Yun; Zhu, Fangfang; Hu, Ming; Zhao, Yan; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Hu, Bo; Peng, Zhiyong",Crit Care Med,263,23

In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. Here we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. SAP also reduced D-dimer levels in the lung fluid. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, SAP attenuated ORN06-induced extracellular accumulation of IL-6. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms and/or a cytokine storm.","Karhadkar, Tejas R; Pilling, Darrell; Gomer, Richard H",PLoS One,263,16

The survey was completed by nurses, midwives, doctors and allied health (AH) staff between 15 May and 10 June 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 items (DASS-21) assessed the psychological well-being of respondents in the previous week.ResultsIn all, 668 people responded to the survey (nurses/midwives, n=391; doctors, n=138; AH staff, n=139). Of these, 108 (16.2%) had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Approximately one-quarter of respondents reported symptoms of psychological distress. Between 11% (AH staff) and 29% (nurses/midwives) had anxiety scores in the mild to extremely severe ranges. Nurses and midwives had significantly higher anxiety scores than doctors (P<0.001) and AH staff (P<0.001). Direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis (P<0.001) and being a nurse or midwife (P<0.001) were associated with higher anxiety scores. Higher ratings of the health service's pandemic response and staff support strategies were protective against depression (P<0.001), anxiety (P<0.05) and stress (P<0.001).ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff, particularly nurses and midwives. Staff would benefit from (additional) targeted supportive interventions during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases.What is known about the topic?The outbreak of COVID-19 is having, and will have, a considerable effect on health services. No Australian data about the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff are available.What does this paper add?Australia healthcare providers have experienced considerable emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly nurses and midwives and clinical staff who have had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, nurses and midwives had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the pandemic than general Australian adult population norms, and significantly more severe anxiety symptoms than medical and AH staff. Despite a lower number of COVID-19 cases and a lower death rate than in other countries, the proportion of Australian hospital clinical staff experiencing distress is similar to that found in other countries.What are the implications for practitioners?Targeted well-being interventions are required to support hospital clinical staff during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases and other 'crises' or adverse events.","Holton, Sara; Wynter, Karen; Trueman, Melody; Bruce, Suellen; Sweeney, Susan; Crowe, Shane; Dabscheck, Adrian; Eleftheriou, Paul; Booth, Sarah; Hitch, Danielle; Said, Catherine M; Haines, Kimberley J; Rasmussen, Bodil",Aust Health Rev,263,24

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULTS: The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.","Blackman, Carolyn; Farber, Sharon; Feifer, Richard A; Mor, Vincent; White, Elizabeth M",J. am. geriatr. soc,263,1

METHODS: From a registry of consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hub hospital in Italy from 25/02/2020 to 03/07/2020, we selected those ≥ 60 year-old and with cTnI measured within three days from the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When available, a second cTnI value within 48 h was also extracted. The relationship between increased cTnI and all-cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated by a Cox regression model and restricted cubic spline functions with three knots. RESULTS: Of 343 included patients (median age: 75.0 (68.0-83.0) years, 34.7% men), 88 (25.7%) had cTnI above the upper-reference limit (0.046 µg/L). Patients with increased cTnI had more comorbidities, greater impaired respiratory exchange and higher inflammatory markers on admission than those with normal cTnI. Furthermore, they died more (73.9%vs. 37.3%, P &lt; 0.001) over 15 (6-25) days of hospitalization. The association of elevated cTnI with mortality was confirmed by the adjusted Cox regression model (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.06-2.52, P = 0.039) and was linear until 0.3 µg/L, with a subsequent plateau. Of 191 (55.7%) patients with a second cTnI measurement, 49 (25.7%) had an increasing trend, which was not associated with mortality (univariate HR = 1.39, 95%CI: 0.87-2.22, P = 0.265). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly COVID-19 patients, an initial increase in cTn is common and predicts a higher risk of death. Serial cTn testing may not confer additional prognostic information.","De Marzo, V.; Di Biagio, A.; Della Bona, R.; Vena, A.; Arboscello, E.; Emirjona, H.; Mora, S.; Giacomini, M.; Da Rin, G.; Pelosi, P.; Bassetti, M.; Ameri, P.; Porto, I.; Gecovid Study, Group",J Geriatr Cardiol,263,30

METHODS This study aimed to quantify the dynamics and determine the prognostic value of surrogate markers of impaired ventilation in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. The present study is a secondary analysis of the PRactice Of VENTilation in COVID-19 patients (PROVENT-COVID) in 22 intensive care unit hospitals in the Netherlands. Surrogates of impaired ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by Harris-Benedict-VD/VT HB and direct method-VD/VT DIR), ventilatory ratio (VR), and end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio (PETCO2/PaCO2) were used. RESULTS 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 related ARDS were included in this study. Surrogates of impaired ventilation were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p &lt;0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles for VD/VT HB and VD/VT DIR, and VR, and decreased with successive tertiles for PETCO2/PaCO2. Mortality over the first 28 days was higher in patients in the high group of dead space fraction by VD/VT HB (16.4% vs. 12.3%;p = 0.003), but similar in the groups considering the dead space fraction by VD/VT DIR (15.4% vs. 13.3%;p = 0.100), and VR (15.5% vs. 13.2%;p = 0.080) (Figure 2). After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities, ventilation and oxygenation parameters, none of the surrogates of impaired ventilation measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION Surrogate markers for impaired ventilation are abnormal at the start of invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS and worsen during consequent days. Ventilation impairment seems to be more extensive in non-survivors than in survivors, but they do not yield prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model. In the absence of bedside capnography, surrogates of impaired ventilation may serve as an important tool to assess the severity of COVID-19 related ARDS along with other variables such as oxygenation abnormalities and respiratory mechanics.","Morales-Quinteros, L.; Serpa Neto, A.; Artigas, A.; Blanch, L.; Botta, M.; Kaufman, D.

In this study, the potential of some flavonoids presents in propolis to bind to ACE-II receptors was calculated with in silico. Binding constants of ten flavonoids, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, chrysin, galangin, myricetin, rutin, hesperetin, pinocembrin, luteolin and quercetin were measured using the AutoDock 4.2 molecular docking program. And also, these binding constants were compared to reference ligand of MLN-4760. The results are shown that rutin has the best inhibition potentials among the studied molecules with high binding energy - 8.04 kcal/mol, and it is followed by myricetin, quercetin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester and hesperetin. However, the reference molecule has binding energy of - 7.24 kcal/mol. In conclusion, the high potential of flavonoids in ethanolic propolis extracts to bind to ACE-II receptors indicates that this natural bee product has high potential for COVID-19 treatment, but this needs to be supported by experimental studies.","Guler, Halil Ibrahim; Tatar, Gizem; Yildiz, Oktay; Belduz, Ali Osman; Kolayli, Sevgi",Arch Microbiol,263,1

Deviation from the usual pathways on stroke management has become the collateral damage of this pandemic. This present review summarizes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on stroke care. Methods: The research question was answered with a systematic literature and results were summarized narratively. A literature search in the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CIHNL, Open Grey, Grey Net and PROSPERO between 2019 to August 2020 was performed. Three authors reviewed the full texts of potentially relevant studies to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Results: Fourteen studies were included in this review. There was a delay in hospital presentation, door-to-needle time and door-to-imaging time in the process flow of stroke management during the pandemic. There was also a decrease in the number of admissions, rate of IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and rehabilitation referrals. Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic has totally changed how patients with acute stroke are managed. There is a need to devise ways to circumvent this problem to maximize patient recovery without compromising patient safety.

We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the super site epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and breakthrough infections characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.","Shen, Lishuang; Triche, Timothy J; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Biegel, Jaclyn A; Judkins, Alexander R; Gai, Xiaowu",,263,24

Unemployment rates skyrocketed past their Great Recession highs as businesses closed their doors.18 Uber and Lyft drivers, some of whom had taken out loans to purchase vehicles, saw their ridership and income plummet.19 Within weeks of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic,20 Congress stepped in to stabilize businesses' and households' financial situations with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (""CARES"") Act.21 As detailed in Part II of this Essay, the CARES Act provided households with money and enforced pauses of other debt payments such that people were seemingly able to stay current on car loan payments through the fall of 2020.22 A handful of states also legislated additional debt relief for households.23 Auto dealers and lenders likewise struggled during the pandemic, and they focused on enticing people to become or remain customers, rather than repossessing cars.24 Through these combined measures, auto loan defaults did not increase immediately. Staving Off the Bubble's Burst COVID-19's emergence ended the post-Great Recession economic expansion.26 Employment losses between March 2020 and the end of August 2020 wiped out almost all of the job growth during the prior decade and GDP plummeted over 30 percent in those five months.27 Retail spending also quickly dropped, particularly at brick-and-mortar stores and for discretionary items.28 Although spending rebounded later in the summer of 2020, the pace of its recovery was slowed by the coronavirus's continued spread.29 Employment figures bounced back a bit as well, but the chair of the Federal Reserve viewed this growth with caution and commented that ""so many people [are] in need. Yet the second and third quarters of 2020 saw decreases in auto loan delinquencies.33 These declines coincided with decreases in delinquencies across non-mortgage consumer credit products, such as credit cards.34 In contrast, mortgage delinquencies increased, although the CARES Act's foreclosure moratorium provided homeowners the ability to defer payments.35 Consumer credit products, including auto loans, benefitted from the CARES Act's provisions designed to help households weather the economic fallout of stay-at-home orders.36 The CARES Act's extra unemployment compensation and relief rebate payments, delivered primarily in April through the end of July, aided households in paying recurring expenses and allowed them to stay current on some debts.37 Indeed, the CARES Act's payments ""ke[pt] more than [ten] million people out of poverty"" according to a report from the Urban Institute. 38 The CARES Act also allowed people to prioritize auto debt over other debt by pausing payments on home loans, some rent payments, and student loans.39 A handful of states legislated or decreed additional protections, such as eviction and debt collection moratoria.40 Although very few states added protections such as halts on auto repossessions,41 pausing the collection of other delinquent debts likely further allowed people to focus on remaining current with their auto loans.","Foohey, Pamela",Iowa Law Review,263,13

Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared to general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 22 human subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, were predominantly to the attended stream, originating primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized Temporal Response Functions revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal, and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Neural responses in the left temporal lobe were observed for both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations. The response dynamics show task-related differences that were used to reliably decode the attentional target of sentences or equations.","Kulasingham, Joshua P; Joshi, Neha H; Rezaeizadeh, Mohsen; Simon, Jonathan Z",J. neurosci,263,30

The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend. RESULTS: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala.

In this essay, we challenge the authors’ basic assumptions as well as their supportive evidence. We argue that ITT, as an intersection between IT and tourism, is a well-developed, multidisciplinary field and has contributed substantially to tourism research and beyond.

DESIGN: the trend of enrolment in the PROTECT study, ""A randomized study with Hydroxychloroquine versus observational support for prevention or early phase treatment of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"" (Eudract number: 2020-001501-24, NCT04363827), conducted in the period from May to September 2020, was analysed to evaluate the possible association of the enrolment rate with the amount of information published in the national and local press on hydroxychloroquine. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the PROTECT clinical study is an Italian interventional superiority study, open label, with cluster randomization, aimed at evaluating whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in a population of subjects exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus consisting of cohabitants/contacts of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients and the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Protect study from May to September 2020. RESULTS: from May to September 2020, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the PROTECT clinical trial showed a decrease consistent with the number of news on hydroxychloroquine appearing in the national and local press, starting from the time when the first criticisms of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine were made known; the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients showed a more marked and more timely decrease. CONCLUSIONS: in the context determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting a controlled clinical trial is strongly influenced by public opinion on scientific issues. Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems. It is preferable to use a sequential or adaptive design. Furthermore, study protocols should implement innovative approaches that also include the involvement of participants in the decision-making process. In any case, the influence of public information on scientific issues is an extremely important factor to consider in the design of clinical trials in exceptional situations such as a pandemic.","Lilli, Claudia; Biggeri, Annibale; Zingaretti, Chiara; Vertogen, Bernadette; Frassineti, Valeria; Vespignani, Roberto; Grossi, Veruska; Florescu, Caterina; Matteucci, Laura; Pazzi, Chiara; Bongiovanni, Alberto; Limarzi, Francesco; Fausti, Valentina; Bertoni, Lucia; Donati, Caterina; Galardi, Francesca; Gentili, Nicola; Mazza, Francesco; Martinelli, Giovanni; Nanni, Oriana",Epidemiol Prev,263,13

Evidence from SARS,14.87552,3.263469,2020,"MOTIVATION: Antibodies play an important role in clinical research and biotechnology, with their specificity determined by the interaction with the antigen's epitope region, as a special type of protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface. The ubiquitous availability of sequence data, allows us to predict epitopes from sequence in order to focus time-consuming wet-lab experiments towards the most promising epitope regions. Here, we extend our previously developed sequence-based predictors for homodimer and heterodimer PPI interfaces to predict epitope residues that have the potential to bind an antibody. RESULTS: We collected and curated a high quality epitope dataset from the SAbDab database. Our generic PPI heterodimer predictor obtained an AUC-ROC of 0.666 when evaluated on the epitope test set. We then trained a random forest model specifically on the epitope dataset, reaching AUC 0.694. Further training on the combined heterodimer and epitope datasets, improves our final predictor to AUC 0.703 on the epitope test set. This is better than the best state-of-the-art sequence-based epitope predictor BepiPred-2.0. On one solved antibody-antigen structure of the COVID19 virus spike RNA binding domain, our predictor reaches AUC 0.778. We added the SeRenDIP-CE Conformational Epitope predictors to our webserver, which is simple to use and only requires a single antigen sequence as input, which will help make the method immediately applicable in a wide range of biomedical and biomolecular research.

We found that a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 6.11 at admission discriminated a higher risk for mortality. Importantly, however, corticosteroid treatment in such individuals was associated with a lower risk of 60-day all-cause mortality. Conversely, in individuals with an NLR &#8804; 6.11 or with type 2 diabetes, corticosteroid treatment was not associated with reduced mortality, but rather increased risks of hyperglycemia and infections.

The combination of RT-PCR and chest-CT could improve diagnosis performance, but this would requires considerable resources for its rapid use in all patients with suspected COVID-19. The potential contribution of machine learning in this situation has not been fully evaluated. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate machine learning models using routine clinical and laboratory data to improve the performance of RT-PCR and chest-CT for COVID-19 diagnosis among post-emergency hospitalized patients. All adults admitted to the ED for suspected COVID-19, and then hospitalized at Rennes academic hospital, France, between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were included in the study. Three model types were created: logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. Each model was trained to diagnose COVID-19 using different sets of variables. Area under the receiving operator characteristics curve (AUC) was the primary outcome to evaluate model's performances. 536 patients were included in the study: 106 in the COVID group, 430 in the NOT-COVID group. The AUC values of chest-CT and RT-PCR increased from 0.778 to 0.892 and from 0.852 to 0.930, respectively, with the contribution of machine learning.

Hand and upper limb injuries presenting to the host organization during a pre-lockdown period (23rd March 2019-11th May 2019) and the formal UK lockdown period (23rd March 2020-11th May 2020) were compared, using data collated from the host institution's hand surgery database. The UK lockdown period was associated with a 52% fall in the number of patients presenting to the service with hand and upper limb injuries (589 pre-lockdown vs. 284 during lockdown). There was a significant increase in the proportion of injuries due to machinery use during lockdown (38, 6.5% pre-lockdown vs. 33, 11.6% during lockdown, P = 0.009), other etiologies were consistent. The proportion requiring surgical management were similar (n = 272, 46.2% pre-lockdown vs. n = 138, 48.6% during lockdown, P = 0.50). The proportion requiring overnight admission fell (n = 94, 16.0% pre-lockdown vs. 29, 10.2% during lockdown, P = 0.022). COVID-19 related lockdown in the UK resulted in a reduction in the presenting numbers of hand related injuries; however almost half of these patients still required surgery. These data may be of use to other hand surgery centers for resource planning during future lockdown periods, and for injury prevention strategies in the post-COVID-19 world.","Pidgeon, T E; Parthiban, S; Malone, P; Foster, M; Chester, D L",Hand Surg Rehabil,263,25

We described a multimodal approach to assess patient eligible for hemispherectomy and possibly predicting post-surgical outcomes. METHODS: We describe pre- and post-surgical clinical features along with neuroradiological results by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MR-tractography (MRT), and neurophysiological study by single and paired pulses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a child with cerebral palsy with epileptic encephalopathy, eligible for epilepsy surgery. RESULTS: Presurgical TMS evaluation showed a lateralization of motor function on the left motor cortex for both arms, and results were confirmed by MRI studies. Interestingly, after surgery, both epilepsy and motor performances improved and TMS showed enhancement of intracortical inhibition and facilitation activity. CONCLUSION: Functional hemispherectomy is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, and multimodal presurgical assessment may be a useful approach to guide surgeons in selecting patients. Moreover, pre- and post-surgical evaluation of these patients may enhance our understanding of brain plasticity phenomena.","Pilato, Fabio; Pravatà, Emanuele; Battaglia, Domenica; Calandrelli, Rosalinda; Massimi, Luca; Di Rocco, Concezio; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Childs nerv. syst,263,23

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.","Paschold, Lisa; Simnica, Donjete; Willscher, Edith; Vehreschild, Maria Jgt; Dutzmann, Jochen; Sedding, Daniel G; Schultheiß, Christoph; Binder, Mascha",,263,12

This study has two independent objectives: (1) to report the impact of COVID-19, as well as psycho-social responses during lockdown, in a sample of older adults in Spain, and (2) to explore through the review of published surveys what extent ageism has increased at the population level. The first objective was to search through an online questionnaire collecting information about self-reported health, lifestyles, psycho-social conditions, and a diversity of concerns. This questionnaire was administered to a volunteer sample of 315 older Spanish men and women (301 COVID-19-free and 14 diagnosed with COVID-19). All individuals reported that they had information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Their self-perception of health was also quite good, most maintaining healthy lifestyles and few reporting unhealthy behaviors. They reported few changes in family and interpersonal relations during lockdown. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety, irritation, and fear, in comparison with the COVID-19-free group. Interestingly, instead of being concerned about health, the greatest concern in both groups (COVID-free and those diagnosed with COVID) were politics and the future. Our second objective, to explore ageism during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, was examined across various surveys conducted in several populations by several authors. Results showed an increase in ageism in Spain. Although some new information about health perception, psychosocial responses, and concerns during this unknown stressful situation was obtained, much more research with representative samples is required in order to arrive at more accurate conclusions.","Fernández-Ballesteros, Rocío; Sánchez-Izquierdo, Macarena",,263,33

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eï¬ective risk communication.","Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong",BMJ Open,263,21

Herein, we report the behavior of carbohydrate-decorated amphiphilic nanoparticles in a plasma environment with regard to the formation and biological consequences of the protein corona. Naked amphiphilic nanoparticles were produced through the self-assembly of azido-PEO900-docosanoate molecules, and the coupling of N-acetylglucosamine via click chemistry enabled the fabrication of the corresponding bioactive glyco-nanostructures. Light scattering measurements, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the Pierce BCA protein assay all confirmed the presence of protein coronas around the self-assembled nanoparticles, regardless of the presence of the sugar residues, although it reduces the amount of adsorbed proteins. The protein coronas were formed mainly by human serum albumin, complement proteins, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (fibrinogen and prothrombin). While the presence of these protein coronas significantly reduced cellular uptake of the amphiphilic assemblies, they also notably reduced the cytotoxic and hemolytic effects that result from the contact of the nanoparticles with living cells. Accordingly, we highlight that protein coronas should not always be treated as artifacts that have to be avoided because they can also provide beneficial effects.","de Castro, Carlos E; Panico, Karine; Stangherlin, Lucas M; Ribeiro, Caroline A S; da Silva, Maria C C; Carneiro-Ramos, Marcela S; Dal-Bó, Alexandre G; Giacomelli, Fernando C",Bioconjug Chem,263,16

Here, we summarize the clinical and epidemiological features of this increased incidence of photokeratitis and share advice in using health education to prevent it.We collected data from patients diagnosed with photokeratitis from October 7, 2019 to December 1, 2019, and from February 17, 2020 to April 12, 2020, and compared the frequency of onset, site of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, reason for exposure, exposure time, and recovery time. We also implemented and evaluated multiple measures of public health education to prevent increased disease.After the COVID-19 outbreak, the frequency of onset of photokeratitis increased significantly, especially among young women. The main reason for UVR exposure changed from welding to disinfection. The incidence sites varied, and the exposure time was longer. As a result, patients needed a longer time to recover. Positive health education was an useful and convenient measure to prevent the disease.While the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, more attention should be paid to public health and implement positive measures to prevent photokeratitis.","Wang, YingMing; Lou, Jing; Ji, Ye; Wang, ZhenYu",Medicine (Baltimore),263,22

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between electrocardiographic findings and the indicators of the severity of COVID-19 detected on electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: A total of 219 patients that were hospitalized due to COVID-19 between April 15 and May 5, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of COVID-19 infection: severe (n = 95) and non-severe (n = 124). ECG findings at the time of admission were recorded for each patient. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Mean age was 65.2 ± 13.8 years in the severe group and was 57.9 ± 16.0 years in the non-severe group. ST depression (28% vs. 14%), T-wave inversion (29% vs. 16%), ST-T changes (36% vs. 21%), and the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) (17% vs. 7%) were more frequent in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03-5.67; p = 0.041), the severity of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.09-2.65; p = 0.026), presence of cardiac injury (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.45-7.60; p = 0.004), and d-dimer (OR: 3.60, 95% CI: 1.29-10.06; p = 0.014) were independent predictors of ST-T changes on ECG. CONCLUSION: ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes, and the presence of fQRS on admission ECG are closely associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Barman, Hasan Ali; Atici, Adem; Alici, Gokhan; Sit, Omer; Tugrul, Sevil; Gungor, Baris; Okuyan, Ertugrul; Sahin, Irfan",Am. j. emerg. med,263,22

The dominant paradigm underlying most standard modeling techniques assumes that the data are concentrated near a single unknown manifold of relatively small intrinsic dimension. Here, we present a systematic framework for detecting interfaces and related anomalies in data which may fail to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. By computing the local topology of small regions around each data point, we are able to partition a given dataset into disjoint classes, each of which can be individually approximated by a single manifold. Since these manifolds may have different intrinsic dimensions, local topology discovers singular regions in data even when none of the points have been sampled precisely from the singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations and by locating all of the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space. Due to the local nature of the topological computations, the algorithmic burden of performing such data stratification is readily distributable across several processors.","Stolz, Bernadette J; Tanner, Jared; Harrington, Heather A; Nanda, Vidit",Proc.

The aim of this study was to explore potential inequalities in care pathways for people with young-onset and late on-set dementia (YOD/LOD), including their family carers, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring throughout the course of the study and enabling a comparison between pre-pandemic and COVID-19 times. METHODS: People with YOD and LOD with their family carers were recruited via local support groups in the North West Coast region of England. Semi-structured interviews explored the experiences of people with YOD and LOD and family carers on their access to both health and social care services and community-based services. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analysed using thematic analysis. Fifteen interviews were conducted with seven people with YOD or LOD and 14 family carers between January and March 2020. Some interviews were conducted only with the person with dementia, because they did not have a family carer, and others were conducted only with the family carer, because the person with dementia was in the severe stages of the condition. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Getting the ball rolling: the process of diagnosis; (2) Balancing the support needs of people with dementia and carers; (3) Barriers to accessing support; and (4) Facilitators to accessing support. Inequities existed for both YOD and LOD, with emerging evidence of unequal experiences in accessing care at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: People with YOD and LOD and their carers require better support in accessing services after a diagnosis. Greater understanding of the pathways through which inequalities materialise are needed, especially those that might have been disrupted or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Sutcliffe, Caroline; Darlington-Pollock, Frances; Green, Mark A; Akpan, Asan; Dickinson, Julie; Watson, James; Gabbay, Mark",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),263,24

For this aim, at first we apply the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative to model the usual form of the phenomenon. In order to show the existence of a solution, the Banach fixed point theorem and the Picard–Lindelof approach are used. Additionally, the stability analysis is discussed using the fixed point theorem. The model is approximated based on Indian data and using the homotopy analysis transform method (HATM), which is among the most famous, flexible and applicable semi-analytical methods. After that, the CESTAC (Controle et Estimation Stochastique des Arrondis de Calculs) method and the CADNA (Control of Accuracy and Debugging for Numerical Applications) library, which are based on discrete stochastic arithmetic (DSA), are applied to validate the numerical results of the HATM. Additionally, the stopping condition in the numerical algorithm is based on two successive approximations and the main theorem of the CESTAC method can aid us analytically to apply the new terminations criterion instead of the usual absolute error that we use in the floating-point arithmetic (FPA). Finding the optimal approximations and the optimal iteration of the HATM to solve the nonlinear fractional order model of COVID-19 are the main novelties of this study.","Noeiaghdam, Samad Micula Sanda Nieto Juan J.",Mathematics,263,1

438941,438941,438941,Healthy Aging in the Time of Corona Pandemic,14.875538,3.5646565,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. The risks of transmission of infection are greater when a patient is undergoing an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Not all those with COVID-19 infection are symptomatic, or suspected of harbouring the infection. If a patient who is not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19 infection is to undergo an AGP, it would nonetheless be sensible to minimise the risk to those HCWs treating them. If the mouth and nose of an individual undergoing an AGP are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may be a simple and safe method of reducing the risk of any covert infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. Alternatively, the use of antimicrobial solutions by the HCW may decrease the chance of them acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to HCWs and/or patients when undertaking AGPs on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. SEARCH METHODS: Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to the patient or HCW before and/or after an AGP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs or patients; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 4) change in COVID-19 viral load at site(s) of irrigation; 5) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 6) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We found no completed studies to include in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review, nor any ongoing studies. The absence of completed studies is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named Covid-19 and declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Clinical symptoms of Covid-19 range from common cold to more severe disease defined as pneumonia, hypoxia, and severe respiratory distress. In the next stage, disease can become more critical with respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock, and/or multiorgan failure. Outcomes of Covid-19 indicate large gaps between the male-female and the young-elder groups. Several theories have been proposed to explain variations, such as gender, age, comorbidity, and genetic factors. It is likely that mixture of genetic and nongenetic factors interplays between virus and host genetics and determines the severity of disease outcome. In this review, we aimed to summarize current literature in terms of potential host genetic and epigenetic factors that associated with increased severity of Covid-19. Several studies indicated that the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism-related (angiotensin-converting enzymes, transmembrane serine protease-2, furin) and host innate immune response-related genes (interferons [IFNs], interleukins, toll-like receptors), and human leukocyte antigen, ABO, 3p21.31, and 9q34.2 loci are critical host determinants related to Covid-19 severity. Epigenetic mechanisms also affect Covid-19 outcomes by regulating IFN signaling, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, and immunity-related genes that particularly escape from X chromosome inactivation. Enhanced understanding of host genetic and epigenetic factors and viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improved prognostic tools and innovative therapeutics.","Yildirim, Zafer; Sahin, Oyku Semahat; Yazar, Seyhan; Bozok Cetintas, Vildan",Cell biol. int,263,16

Dental professionals and dental students are at an increased risk for these viruses from dental patients, as dental practice involves face-to-face communication with the patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Dental education can play an important role in the training of dental students, adequate knowledge and adopting attitudes regarding infection control measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and clinical education of dental students about COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 355 pre-clinical and clinical dental students (242 and 113, respectively, comprising 190 females and 165 males) at Firat University Dentistry Faculty, in Elazig, Turkey answered an online questionnaire about the biosafety procedures for and their attitudes to and knowledge of COVID-19. The study was conducted in March 2020, Turkey. The data gained were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and chi-square test. Results: Both the clinical and preclinical students were found to be afraid of infecting themselves and their environment with COVID-19, and the difference between them was statistically significant. Three quarters (74.9%) of the participants responded yes to the question of whether they thought that experiences related to COVID-19 affected them psychologically, with the differences between gender and clinical status were statistically significant. Responses to the question of which clinical rotation worried them more were 29.9% endodontics, 25.1% oral and maxillofacial surgery, 16.3% prosthesis, 15.2% periodontology, 6.8% restorative dentistry, 3.9% oral diagnosis and radiology, 1.7% pedodontics, and 1.1% orthodontics, with a significant difference between the preclinical and clinical students. Regarding the measures applied by the clinical students in their clinical rotation, the responses were 100% gloves and 100% mask (with 11.5% FFP3/N95 mask), 73.6% face protective shield and 37.1% safety glasses, and 49% bonnet and 16.8% disposable box, with 90.2% frequent hand washing, and 86.7% frequent hand antiseptic usage. Conclusions: While students gave good responses regarding the standard measures they take to protect against transmission of COVID-19, their knowledge and attitudes about the extra measures they can take should be improved. For students to be least affected by fears associated with the disease, dental faculties should be ready to provide psychological services to those in need.","Atas, Osman; Talo Yildirim, Tuba",PeerJ,263,26

Considering that there is still no definitive cure for the recent viral crisis, this article provides a review of nanomaterials with antiviral activity, with an emphasis on graphene and its derivatives, including graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and graphene quantum dots. The possible interactions between surfaces of such nanostructured materials with coronaviruses are discussed. The antiviral mechanisms of graphene materials can be related to events such as the inactivation of virus and/or the host cell receptor, electrostatic trapping and physico-chemical destruction of viral species. These effects can be enhanced by functionalization and/or decoration of carbons with species that enhances graphene-virus interactions. The low-cost and large-scale preparation of graphene materials with enhanced antiviral performances is an interesting research-direction to be explored.","Seifi, Tahereh; Reza Kamali, Ali",Med Drug Discov,263,11

However, there has been little published on the process of COVID-19 screening among travelers entering into a country. Identifying the characteristics of COVID-19 infected travelers could help attenuate the further spread of the disease. METHODS: The authors analyzed epidemiological investigation forms and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) of entrants to Incheon International Airport between March 11 to April 30, 2020. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the odds of positive SARS-CoV-2 result. RESULTS: A total of 11,074 entrants underwent reverse-transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2, resulting 388 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 had a strong association with the reported loss of smell or taste and association with self-reported fever, chill, cough, and vomiting. If a traveler reported contact with an individual with either respiratory symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 in the last two weeks directly prior to landing, the probability of a positive result was increased. CONCLUSION: If overseas travelers experience loss of smell or taste in the two weeks prior to arrival, they may require an immediate examination to rule out COVID-19 at a port of entry. As to measure body temperature upon arrival at a port of entry, it is important to screen for any occurrence of fever within the two weeks prior to travel. Also, information with epidemiological relevance, such as recent contact with an individual suffering from any respiratory symptoms or with confirmed COVID-19, should be included in COVID-19 screening questionnaires for international travelers.","Song, Seung Woo; Kim, Dongyeong; Park, Ji Yun; Lee, Solam",J Korean Med Sci,263,1

To confront this unprecedented crisis, nearly every country has been developing a wide range of policy responses, including fiscal measures. This study aims to discuss government fiscal responses to the pandemic from a financial management perspective. The core question is, “How does each country’s financial management system support its fiscal responses to the crisis?” We are particularly interested in reexamining commonly accepted norms about fiscal federalism and the fiscal condition of national and local governments heading into this pandemic. This study takes a comparative approach to the question, focusing on South Korea and the United States.

Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical practice and to determine whether surgical procedures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted, involving patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 periods: pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surgical intervention data evaluated included diagnostic category, case priority, complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 850 procedures were included, 36% during COVID-19. The median number of procedures per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (5.5 cases) than during the pre-COVID-19 period (12 cases; P < 0.0001). Complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality did not differ during the pandemic. In a multivariate analysis comparing both periods, case priority levels 1 (immediate) (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.67), 1 (1-24 h) (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-2.41), and 4 (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42) showed significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall number of neurosurgical procedures declined, but the load of emergency procedures remained the same, thus highlighting the need to allocate sufficient resources for emergencies. More importantly, performing neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic in regions with limited effects of the outbreak on the health care system was safe. Our findings may aid in developing guidelines for acute and long-term care during pandemics in surgical subspecialties.","Bajunaid, Khalid; Alqurashi, Ashwag; Alatar, Abdullah; Alkutbi, Mohammad; Alzahrani, Anas H; Sabbagh, Abdulrahman J; Alobaid, Abdullah; Barnawi, Abdulwahed; Alferayan, Ahmed Abdulrahman; Alkhani, Ahmed M; Salamah, Ali Bin; Sheikh, Bassem Yousef; Alotaibi, Fahad E; Alabbas, Faisal; Farrash, Faisal; Al-Jehani, Hosam M; Alhabib, Husam; Alnaami, Ibrahim; Altweijri, Ikhlass; Khoja, Isam; Taha, Mahmoud; Alzahrani, Moajeb; Bafaquh, Mohammed S; Binmahfoodh, Mohammed; Algahtany, Mubarak Ali; Al-Rashed, Sabah; Raza, Syed Muhammad; Elwatidy, Sherif; Alomar, Soha A; Al-Issawi, Wisam; Khormi, Yahya H; Ammar, Ahmad; Al-Habib, Amro; Baeesa, Saleh S; Ajlan, Abdulrazag",World Neurosurg,263,20

Its impact on the cost of surgical and obstetric care is significant. More so, in a country like Nigeria, where even before the pandemic, out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) has been the major payment method for healthcare. The increased cost of surgical and obstetric care occasioned by the pandemic has principally been due to the additional burden of ensuring the use of adequate/appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during patient care as a disease containment measure. These PPE are not readily available in public hospitals across Nigeria. Patients are therefore compelled to bear the financial burden of procuring scarce PPE for use by health care personnel, further increasing the already high cost of healthcare. In this study, we sought to appraise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cost of surgical and obstetric care in Nigeria, drawing from the experience from one of the major Nigerian teaching hospitals- the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Osun State. The cost of surgical and obstetric care was reviewed and compared pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic, deriving relevant examples from some commonly performed surgical operations in our centre (OAUTHC). We reviewed patients' hospital bills and receipts of consumables procured for surgery. Our findings revealed that the cost of surgical and obstetric care during the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly increased. We identified gaps and made relevant recommendations on measures to reduce the additional costs of surgical and obstetric care during and beyond pandemic.","Adesunkanmi, AbdulHafiz Oladapo; Ubom, Akaninyene Eseme; Olasehinde, Olalekan; Fasubaa, Olusola Benjamin; Ijarotimi, Omotade Adebimpe; Adesunkanmi, Abdul Rashid Kayode; Okon, Nwedobong Ededem",Pan Afr Med J,263,16

Although each metric provides a different perspective on the performance, they remain to be overall measures for the whole sample, discounting the uniqueness of each case or patient. Intuitively, we know that all cases are not equal, but the present evaluative approaches do not take case difficulty into account. OBJECTIVE: A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar value. METHODS: Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the interaction between them in predicting accuracy. RESULTS: The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.","Kline, Adrienne; Kline, Theresa; Shakeri Hossein Abad, Zahra; Lee, Joon",J Med Internet Res,263,3

This leads to a novel generalized Burgers equation that describes these groups' temporal evolution, and predicts a critical influx rate for potential recruits beyond which such groups will not form.

Molecular testing turnaround time precludes having results at the point-of-care (POC) thereby exposing COVID-19/Non-COVID-19 patients while awaiting diagnosis. We evaluated the utility of a triage strategy including FebriDx, a 10-minute POC finger-stick blood test that differentiates viral from bacterial acute respiratory infection through detection of Myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), to rapidly isolate viral cases requiring confirmatory testing. METHODS: This observational, prospective, single-center study enrolled patients presenting to/within an acute care hospital in England with suspected COVID-19 between March and April 2020. Immunocompetent patients &#8805;16 years requiring hospitalisation with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome or influenza-like illness (fever and &#8805;1 respiratory symptom within 7 days of enrolment, or inpatients with new respiratory symptoms, fever of unknown cause or pre-existing respiratory condition worsening). The primary endpoint was diagnostic performance of FebriDx to identify COVID-19 as a viral infection; secondary endpoint was SARS-CoV-2 molecular test diagnostic performance compared with the reference standard COVID-19 Case Definition (molecular or antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Valid results were available for 47 patients. By reference standard, 35 had viral infections (34/35 COVID-19; 1/35 non-COVID-19; overall FebriDx viral sensitivity 97.1% (95%CI 83.3-99.9)). Of the COVID-19 cases, 34/34 were FebriDx viral positive (sensitivity 100%; 95%CI 87.4-100); 29/34 had an initial SARS-CoV-2 positive molecular test (sensitivity 85.3%; 95%CI 68.2-94.5). FebriDx was viral negative when the diagnosis was not COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2 molecular test was negative (negative predictive value (NPV) 100% (13/13; 95%CI 71.7-100)) exceeding initial SARS-CoV-2 molecular test NPV 72.2% (13/19; 95%CI 46.4-89.3). The diagnostic specificity of FebriDx and initial SARS-CoV-2 molecular test was 100% (13/13; 95%CI 70-100 and 13/13; 95%CI 85.4-100, respectively).

Here, we document the detection of CoVs, PMVs, reoviruses, and rotaviruses (RVs) in Nigerian bats. The Nigerian bat CoVs are grouped within other bat SARS-CoV–like viruses identified from Ghana in a sister clade next to the human SARS-CoV clade. The phylogenetic analysis indicated a broad range of RVs present in Nigerian bats, some cluster with human RVs and some represent novel species.

Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Skåne University Hospitals in Malmö and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact). In health care workers, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with work in a designated COVID-19-unit (OR 5.7 (95CI 2.1-16)) and caring for COVID-19-patients during the majority of shifts (OR 5.4 (95CI 2.0-15)). In all participants, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case (OR 10 (95CI 2.0-45)) in the household. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed previous findings of elevated risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers in COVID-19-units, despite exclusion of units with known outbreaks. Interestingly, health care workers in non-COVID-19-units had similar risk as University employees. Further measures to improve the safety of health care workers might be needed.KEY POINTSPrevious findings of elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers with COVID-19 patient contact was confirmed, despite exclusion of wards with known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89±1.117), SDS (50.13±1.813), and PCL-C (50.13±1.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P<0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07±3.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%. CONCLUSIONS There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other. Hospitals should improve emergency management measures, strengthen psychological counseling for clinical front-line medical staff, strengthen exercise intervention, and improve their sleep quality and mental health.","Wu, Koulong; Wei, Xuemei",Med Sci Monit Basic Res,263,1

Compared with the control, 0.50% of nZVI-BC significantly decreased the leakage of As, Cd, and Pb by 97.94-98.45%, 42.86-81.12%, and 82.14-92.49%, respectively. In addition, 0.50% of nZVI-BC could transform the fraction of unstable heavy metals into a stable form, which substantially decreased the availability, leachability, and bioaccessibility of the heavy metals and hence greatly reduced the human health exposure risk. Column experiments showed that 0.50% of nZVI-BC effectively restrained the leaching of As, Cd, and Pb by 95.60-99.84%, 70.82-84.18%, and 91.68-99.81%, respectively. The predominant encapsulation mechanisms of nZVI-BC included complexation, precipitation/co-precipitation, reduction, and the formation of ternary surface complexes. Based on these insights, we can devise new strategies for the remediation of soil co-contaminated with As, Cd, and Pb.","Yang, Dong; Yang, Shiyan; Yuan, Honghong; Wang, Fan; Wang, Hailong; Xu, Jianming; Liu, Xingmei",J Hazard Mater,263,1

Here, we report on immune monitoring facilitating a successful outcome of severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis, and acute kidney and pancreas graft failure in a pancreas-kidney transplant recipient. Despite the very low numbers of circulating B, NK, and T cells identified in follow-up, a strong SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell response was observed. Importantly, we detected T cells reactive to Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with majority of T cells showing polyfunctional proinflammatory Th1 phenotype at all analyzed time points. Antibodies against Spike protein were also detected with increasing titers in follow-up. Neutralization tests confirmed their antiviral protection. A correlation between cellular and humoral immunity was observed underscoring the specificity of demonstrated data. We conclude that analyzing the kinetics of nonspecific and SARS-CoV-2-reactive cellular and humoral immunity can facilitate the clinical decision on immunosuppression adjustment and allow successful outcome as demonstrated in the current clinical case.

The knowledge of dentists of the reported guidelines is not yet assessed and lack of awareness of these guidelines may have negative implications on dental patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of dentists about COVID-19 and the MOH guidelines while treating dental patients in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey which was sent to a sample of dentists in Saudi Arabia from March to May 2020. Results: A total of 294 dentists with a mean age of (36.9 ± 10.6) years completed the questionnaire. Participants included 157 females and 137 males with a range of professional classification and experience. All of the participants were aware of COVID-19, the nature of the disease, symptoms, modes of transmission and people at higher risk, except for 7.2% who did not report the correct incubation period. All participants agreed that patients and staff should wear a facial mask, use hydroalcoholic hand sanitizer upon arrival. Only 72.4% had knowledge about published guidelines. Infection control training was provided for 53% of the participants and those who had training were more confident to treat patients.

The cytokine storm in SARS-CoV2 infection has been linked with both diabetes and Vitamin D deficiency. This study examined the hypothesis that supplementation with vitamin D, in combination with l-cysteine (LC), is better at reducing oxidative stress and thereby, more effective, at inhibiting the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in U937 monocytes exposed to high glucose concentrations. Methods: U937 monocytes were pretreated with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D (VD, 10 nM) or LC (250 µM) or VD + LC for 24 h and then exposed to control or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) for another 24 h. Results: There were significantly greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in monocytes treated with HG than those in controls. Combined supplementation with VD and LC showed a more significant reduction in ROS (46%) in comparison with treatment with LC (19%) or VD (26%) alone in monocytes exposed to HG. Similarly, VD supplementation, together with LC, caused a more significant inhibition in the secretion of IL-8 (36% versus 16%) and MCP-1 (46% versus 26%) in comparison with that of VD (10 nM) alone in high-glucose treated monocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that combined supplementation with vitamin D and LC has the potential to be more effective than either VD or LC alone in lowering the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19 infection. Further, this combined vitamin D with LC/N-acetylcysteine may be a potent alternative therapy for SARS-CoV2 infected subjects. This approach can prevent cellular damage due to cytokine storm in comorbid systemic inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.","Jain, Sushil K; Micinski, David; Parsanathan, Rajesh",J Am Coll Nutr,263,2

Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an online registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient. RESULTS: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","Sánchez-Álvarez, J Emilio; Pérez Fontán, Miguel; Jiménez Martín, Carlos; Blasco Pelícano, Miquel; Cabezas Reina, Carlos Jesús; Sevillano Prieto, Ángel M; Melilli, Edoardo; Crespo Barrios, Marta; Macía Heras, Manuel; Del Pino Y Pino, María Dolores",Nefrologia,263,1

METHODS: An online survey of patients in quarantine. Questions targeted the conditions of quarantine, sleep related behaviours and exposure to factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (light exposure and sport). RESULTS: In all, 1777 participants were included: 77% women and 72% aged 25-54 years. Quarantine conditions were most frequently in couples with children (36%) and in a house with a garden (51%). Forty-seven percent of participants reported a decrease in sleep quality during quarantine. Factors associated with a reduction in sleep quality by logistic regression were sleep reduction (OR 15.52 P<0.001), going to bed later (OR 1.72 P<0.001), getting up earlier (2.18 P=0.01), an increase in sleep-wake irregularity (OR 2.29 P<0.001), reduced exposure to daylight (OR 1.46 P=0.01) and increased screen use in the evenings (OR 1.33 P=0.04). CONCLUSION: Sleep quality tended to reduce during quarantine and this was associated with changes in sleep behaviours and light exposure, especially in the evening. In order to optimise sleep during quarantine, regular sleep and wake times, at least 1hour exposure to daylight and a reduction of screen use in the evenings are suggested.","Hartley, S; Colas des Francs, C; Aussert, F; Martinot, C; Dagneaux, S; Londe, V; Waldron, L; Royant-Parola, S",Encephale,263,24

Here we compare characteristics in children with elevated ALT (E-ALT) in two distinct manifestations of the infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome-children (MIS-C) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients &#8804;21 years of age with positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. E-ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were obtained to describe differences in children with and without E-ALT in COVID-19 and MIS-C. RESULTS: E-ALT was detected in 36% of the 291 patients; 31% with COVID-19, and 51% with MIS-C. E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with obesity (P < .001), immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P = .01). In the regression models, E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with higher c-reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01) after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with E-ALT and MIS-C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P = .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS-C, male gender (OR 5.3, P = .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with increased odds of E-ALT. Children with E-ALT in both cohorts had significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS-C had 2.3-fold increased risk of E-ALT compared to COVID-19. No association was found between E-ALT and mortality. CONCLUSION: E-ALT with SARS-CoV-2 presents as elevated transaminases without hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Patients with either manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and E-ALT experienced more severe disease.","Perez, Adriana; Cantor, Amanda; Rudolph, Bryan; Miller, Jonathan; Kogan-Liberman, Debora; Gao, Qi; Da Silva, Bernardo; Margolis, Kara G; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Martinez, Mercedes",Liver int,263,16

Many previous studies have found a negative association between health-protective behaviours and belief in the specific form of misinformation popularly known as 'conspiracy theory'. Concerns have arisen regarding the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories on social media. METHODS: Three questionnaire surveys of social media use, conspiracy beliefs and health-protective behaviours with regard to COVID-19 among UK residents were carried out online, one using a self-selecting sample (N = 949) and two using stratified random samples from a recruited panel (N = 2250, N = 2254). RESULTS: All three studies found a negative relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 health-protective behaviours, and a positive relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and use of social media as a source of information about COVID-19. Studies 2 and 3 also found a negative relationship between COVID-19 health-protective behaviours and use of social media as a source of information, and Study 3 found a positive relationship between health-protective behaviours and use of broadcast media as a source of information. CONCLUSIONS: When used as an information source, unregulated social media may present a health risk that is partly but not wholly reducible to their role as disseminators of health-related conspiracy beliefs.","Allington, Daniel; Duffy, Bobby; Wessely, Simon; Dhavan, Nayana; Rubin, James",Psychol Med,263,30

To identify spatiotemporal patterns of epidemic spread at the community level.Methods. We extracted influenza cases reported between 2016 and 2019 and COVID-19 cases reported in March and April 2020 from a hospital network in Rhode Island. We performed a spatiotemporal hotspot analysis to simulate a real-time surveillance scenario.Results. We analyzed 6527 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and identified microepidemics in more than 1100 neighborhoods, and more than half of the neighborhoods that had hotspots in a season became hotspots in the next season. We used data from 731 COVID-19 cases, and we found that a neighborhood was 1.90 times more likely to become a COVID-19 hotspot if it had been an influenza hotspot in 2018 to 2019.Conclusions. The use of readily available hospital data allows the real-time identification of spatiotemporal trends and hotspots of microepidemics.Public Health Implications. As local governments move to reopen the economy and ease physical distancing, the use of historic influenza hotspots could guide early prevention interventions, while the real-time identification of hotspots would enable the implementation of interventions that focus on small-area containment and mitigation.","Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Kalligeros, Markos; Benitez, Gregorio; Chan, Philip A; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Am J Public Health,263,1

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS-CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV-229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme® (CZ-MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. The CZ-MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ-MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ-MD have been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold. METHOD OF STUDY: The ability of the CZ-MD to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E was tested using an in vitro virucidal suspension test (ASTM E1052). RESULTS: CZ-MD inactivated SARS-CoV-2 by 98.3% and HCoV-229E by 99.9%. CONCLUSION: CZ-MD mouth spray can inactivate the respiratory coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. Although the in vitro results presented cannot be directly translated into clinical efficacy, the study indicates that CZ-MD might offer a protective barrier against SARS-CoV-2 and a decreased risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Gudmundsdottir, Ágústa; Scheving, Reynir; Lindberg, Fredrik; Stefansson, Bjarki",J. med. virol,263,24

While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of N protein. This enrichment of spike renders LV particles more infectious as well as less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is observed with both wild-type spike protein as well as the D614G mutant. Our results hold important implications for the design and interpretation of similar LV pseudotyping-based studies.","Mishra, Tarun; Sreepadmanabh, M; Ramdas, Pavitra; Sahu, Amit Kumar; Kumar, Atul; Chande, Ajit",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,263,24

Delivering COVID-19 treatment services in crisis settings will likely entail complex trade-offs between offering services of clinical benefit and minimising risks of nosocomial infection, while allocating resources appropriately and safeguarding other essential services. This paper outlines considerations for humanitarian actors planning COVID-19 treatment services where vaccination is not yet widely available. We suggest key decision-making considerations: allocation of resources to COVID-19 treatment services and the design of clinical services should be based on community preferences, likely opportunity costs, and a clearly articulated package of care across different health system levels. Moreover, appropriate service planning requires information on the expected COVID-19 burden and the resilience of the health system. We explore COVID-19 treatment service options at the patient level (diagnosis, management, location and level of treatment) and measures to reduce nosocomial transmission (cohorting patients, protecting healthcare workers). Lastly, we propose key indicators for monitoring COVID-19 health services.","Garry, Sylvia; Abdelmagid, Nada; Baxter, Louisa; Roberts, Natalie; le Polain de Waroux, Olivier; Ismail, Sharif; Ratnayake, Ruwan; Favas, Caroline; Lewis, Elizabeth; Checchi, Francesco",Confl Health,263,10

However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Covid-19 patients might have lower levels of ABO antibodies than non-infected individuals as they could offer some degree of protection. METHODS: After showing that the viral spike protein harbors the ABO glycan epitopes when produced by cells expressing the relevant glycosyltransferases, like upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, we enrolled 290 patients with Covid-19 and 276 asymptomatic controls to compare their levels of natural ABO blood group antibodies. RESULTS: We found significantly lower IgM anti-A + anti-B agglutination scores in blood group O patients (76.93 vs 88.29, P-value = 0.034) and lower levels of anti-B (24.93 vs 30.40, P-value = 0.028) and anti-A antibodies (28.56 vs 36.50, P-value = 0.048) in blood group A and blood group B patients, respectively, compared to controls.

However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine, and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data were captured by high-speed flash photography, and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed toward the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled toward the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the HCW located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough, and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution, and further validation studies are necessary.","Fried, Eric A; Zhou, George; Shah, Ronak; Shin, Da Wi; Shah, Anjan; Katz, Daniel; Burnett, Garrett W",Anesth Analg,263,1

Kentucky has poor health outcomes and limited broadband connectivity. Given these and other practice-specific constraints, the region serves as a unique context to explore the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the limitations of telehealth accessibility, patient satisfaction with telehealth relative to in-person visits, and the perceived advantages and disadvantages to telehealth. Our intent was two-fold. First, we wanted to conduct a rapid postassessment of the mandated overhaul of the health care delivery system, focusing on a representative specialty field, and how it was affecting patients. Second, we intend to use our findings to make suggestions about the future application of a telehealth model in specialty fields such as cardiology. METHODS: We constructed an online survey in Qualtrics following the Patient Assessment of Communication During Telemedicine, a patient self-report questionnaire that has been previously developed and validated. We invited all patients who had a visit scheduled during the COVID-19 telehealth-only time frame to participate. Questions included factors for declining telehealth, patient satisfaction ratings of telehealth and in-person visits, and perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with telehealth. We also used electronic medical records to collect no-show data for in-person versus telehealth visits to check for nonresponse bias. RESULTS: A total of 224 respondents began our survey (11% of our sample of 2019 patients). Our recruitment rate was 86% (n=193) and our completion rate was 62% (n=120). The no-show rate for telehealth visits (345/2019, 17%) was nearly identical to the typical no-show rate for in-person appointments. Among the 32 respondents who declined a telehealth visit, 20 (63%) cited not being aware of their appointment as a primary factor, and 15 (47%) respondents cited their opinion that a telehealth appointment was not medically necessary as at least somewhat of a factor in their decision. Both in-person and telehealth were viewed favorably, but in-person was rated higher across all domains of patient satisfaction. The only significantly lower mean score for telehealth (3.7 vs 4.2, P=.007) was in the clinical competence domain. Reduced travel time, lower visit wait time, and cost savings were seen as big advantages. Poor internet connectivity was rated as at least somewhat of a factor by 33.0% (35/106) of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: This study takes advantage of the natural experiment provided by the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. Patterns of satisfaction are consistent across modalities and show that telehealth appears to be a viable alternative to in-person appointments. However, we found evidence that scheduling of telehealth visits may be problematic and needs additional attention. Additionally, we include a note of caution that patient satisfaction with telehealth may be artificially inflated during COVID-19 due to external health concerns connected with in-person visits.","Singh, Aniruddha; Mountjoy, Natalie; McElroy, Doug; Mittal, Shilpi; Al Hemyari, Bashar; Coffey, Nicholas; Miller, Kristen; Gaines, Kenneth",JMIR Cardio,263,1

The medical conditions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a surge in the number of patients at clinics and hospitals, leading to a significantly increased strain on healthcare resources. As such, an important part of managing and handling patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections within the clinical workflow is severity assessment, which is often conducted with the use of chest x-ray (CXR) images. In this work, we introduce COVID-Net CXR-S, a convolutional neural network for predicting the airspace severity of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient based on a CXR image of the patient's chest. More specifically, we leveraged transfer learning to transfer representational knowledge gained from over 16,000 CXR images from a multinational cohort of over 15,000 patient cases into a custom network architecture for severity assessment. Experimental results with a multi-national patient cohort curated by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) RICORD initiative showed that the proposed COVID-Net CXR-S has potential to be a powerful tool for computer-aided severity assessment of CXR images of COVID-19 positive patients. Furthermore, radiologist validation on select cases by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of experience, respectively, showed consistency between radiologist interpretation and critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net CXR-S for severity assessment. While not a production-ready solution, the ultimate goal for the open source release of COVID-Net CXR-S is to act as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop innovative new clinical decision support solutions for helping clinicians around the world manage the continuing pandemic.","Aboutalebi, Hossein; Pavlova, Maya; Shafiee, Mohammad Javad; Sabri, Ali; Alaref, Amer; Wong, Alexander",,263,16

A sample of 511 online participants (mean age = 32.47 years) responded to anonymous questionnaires regarding COVID-19 information consumption on social media, health orientation, personal responsibility, and preventive behaviors. Bias-corrected bootstrap method was used to test the moderated mediation model. Results indicated that after controlling for participants' age, gender, education, income, and insurance, personal responsibility mediated the relationship between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, the direct relation between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors, and the mediation effect of personal responsibility were moderated by health orientation.

As a response, the United States shut down public gatherings and businesses in an effort to quarantine. This included the stopping of elective operations, which greatly affected plastic surgeons and their practices during the initial shutdown. OBJECTIVES: We aim to study the early impact of COVID-19 on the financial implications and practice patterns of plastic surgeons in the state of California during the initial shutdown of elective surgery and provide guidelines for effective management during future crises. METHODS: A 20-question survey was sent using Qualtrics XM software to 851 surgeon members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey was open from May 13, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Standard statistical analysis was completed to compare private practice and nonprivate practice plastic surgeons. RESULTS: We had a total of 140 respondents to our survey for a 16.5% response rate. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents were in a private practice setting. Private practice plastic surgeons reported a higher financial impact with a 79% reduction in financial income compared with nonprivate practice plastic surgeons at a 37% reduction (P < 0.0001). Additionally, private practice plastic surgeons demonstrated a higher reduction in case volume and were more likely to lay off or furlough staff, close their practice, and apply for loans (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey study showed that private practice plastic surgeons in the state of California faced the most financial hardship during the early shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a valuable snapshot in our economic history and depicts the heavy financial impact of the stopping of elective surgery. Since the reopening of practices, new guidelines have been implemented to maintain safe elective surgery while the pandemic continues. Further follow-up studies on both the state and national level need to be completed to see the continued financial effects on private and nonprivate plastic surgery practices since the reopening and resumption of elective surgery.","Crowley, Jiwon Sarah; Reghunathan, Meera; Kadakia, Nikita; Barttelbort, Scott; Gosman, Amanda",Ann Plast Surg,263,1

Neonates represent a vulnerable population, in which we have limited knowledge of its natural history, optimal management, and outcomes. In this retrospective observational study from a low-middle-income setting, clinical characteristics and outcomes of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. We report an incidence of 10.6% of SARS-CoV-2 infection (21 neonates), among a group of 198 neonates with suspected infection. Most of the SARS-CoV-2-infected neonates were term (80.9%) and none required any resuscitation. The infection was detected by a positive nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Neonatal COVID-19 manifestations developed in one-third (33.3%) of the infected neonates. Most of them demonstrated the involvement of respiratory (33.3%) and gastrointestinal systems (4.8%). Laboratory parameters suggested multi-systemic involvement, with elevated creatine kinase (CK) (76.2%), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) (76.2%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (71.4%) levels. Supportive treatment was given to infected neonates with intensive care required in six neonates (28.6%). This included four preterm and two term neonates, of which two received non-invasive and one received invasive ventilation with intra-tracheal surfactant instillation. IgM antibodies against COVID-19 were detected in one neonate. All neonates with COVID-19 improved and were successfully discharged.Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 in neonates has a wide clinical spectrum. Further studies are needed which are adequately powered to completely understand the course of this infection in neonates, its implications not only in the neonatal period but also on long-term follow-up. What is Known: â¢ SARS-CoV-2 infection has a predilection for all age groups but with limited literature on clinical profile, outcomes, and long-term follow-up in neonates. What is New: â¢ SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates has a wide clinical spectrum and displays a significant overlap with common neonatal conditions. â¢ Most neonates with COVID-19 improved with supportive care, though a subset required intensive care, emphasizing the need for cautious monitoring and management.","Nanavati, Ruchi; Mascarenhas, Dwayne; Goyal, Medha; Haribalakrishna, Anitha; Nataraj, Gita",Eur. j. pediatr,263,17

In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of the hospital workforce with the goal of simulating the health and productivity of the workers. The models were designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity and the efficiency of home office applied to the case of COVID-19. The results reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days increases the available workforce.","Sánchez-Taltavull, Daniel; Castelo-Szekely, Violeta; Candinas, Daniel; Roldán, Edgar; Beldi, Guido",J Theor Biol,263,1

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","Singh, Devika; Yi, Soojin V",Exp Mol Med,263,26

Therefore, they favor facelift operations applied under local anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 160 patients who underwent high superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) lamellar facelift under local anesthesia between 2010 and 2020 were included in this study. Patients operated under general anesthesia were excluded from this study. High SMAS lamellar facelift under local anesthesia was performed in all patients, consisting of 145 women and 15 men without any additional disease aged between 38 and 65 years. About 140 of these patients underwent primary facelift, whereas 20 of them had undergone SMAS plication more than 10 years ago. Lidocaine was used as a local anesthetic and the patients were not sedated. The duration of the operation was 80 minutes on average. The patients were left to rest for 1 hour after the operation and then sent home until their follow-up every other day for the first week. RESULTS: This study shows that high SMAS facelift operations for the mid-face can easily be performed under local anesthesia under operating room conditions without sedation. However, an important point to keep in mind is that although the results of this surgery satisfy the patients, the outcomes do not entirely match the expectations from total face and neck lift performed under general anesthesia. High SMAS facelift with local anesthesia should be considered as an alternative for patients who do not want to undergo general anesthesia or who are at risk of undergoing general anesthesia. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, local anesthesia was considered much safer for the patients.Level of evidence: Level V.","Ors, Safvet",J. craniofac. surg,263,26

Many aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents remain unclear, and optimal treatment has not yet been defined. Therefore, our goal was to develop a consensus document, practically synthesizing the accumulated data and clinical experience of our expert group. Literature research was carried out using the keywords ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""children"" or ""pediatrics"" and ""prevention"" or ""diagnosis"" or ""MIS-C"" or ""treatment"" in electronic databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED), existing guidelines and gray literature. The fact that the majority of the problems posed by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric age do not need hospital care and that, therefore, infected children and adolescents can be managed at home highlights the need for a strengthening of territorial pediatric structures. The sharing of hospitalization and therapeutic management criteria for severe cases between professionals is essential to ensure a fair approach based on the best available knowledge. Moreover, the activity of social and health professionals must also include the description, management and limitation of psychophysical-relational damage resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the health of children and adolescents, whether or not affected by COVID-19. Due to the characteristics of COVID-19 pathology in pediatric age, the importance of strengthening the network between hospital and territorial pediatrics, school, educational, social and family personnel both for strictly clinical management and for the reduction in discomfort, with priority in children of more frail families, represents a priority.","Esposito, S.; Marchetti, F.; Lanari, M.; Caramelli, F.; De Fanti, A.; Vergine, G.; Iughetti, L.; Fornaro, M.; Suppiej, A.; Zona, S.; Pession, A.; Biasucci, G.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],263,9

A few studies have explored the impact of climate change or human activity on the disease incidence in China or a city. The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector; the impact of effective factors and interaction terms on COVID-19 is simulated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results find that mean temperature (MeanT), destination proportion in population flow from Wuhan (WH), migration scale (MS), and WH*MeanT, are generally promoting for COVID-19 incidence before Wuhan's shutdown (T1); the WH and MeanT play a determinant role in the disease spread in T1. The effect of environment on COVID-19 incidence after Wuhan's shutdown (T2) includes more factors (including mean DEM, relative humidity, precipitation (Pre), travel intensity within a city (TC), and their interactive terms) than T1, and their effect shows distinct spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, the dividing line of positive-negative effect of MeanT and Pre on COVID-19 incidence is 8.5°C and 1 mm, respectively. In T2, WH has weak impact, but the MS has the strongest effect. The COVID-19 incidence in T2 without quarantine is also modeled using the developed GWR model, and the modeled incidence shows an obvious increase for 75.6% cities compared with reported incidence in T2 especially for some mega cities. This evidences national quarantine and traffic control take determinant role in controlling the disease spread. The study indicates that both natural environment and human factors integratedly affect the spread pattern of COVID-19 in China.","Wu, Xiaoxu; Yin, Jie; Li, Chenlu; Xiang, Hongxu; Lv, Meng; Guo, Zhiyi",Sci Total Environ,263,7

However, due to complex feature behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for lung's multi-symptom (multi-label) classification. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative procedure. The core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label correlations information is used to design multi-label margin (MLM) strategy and confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and confident labels. On this basis, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML) classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung symptoms, and a human-machine interaction is exploited to confirm the final annotations that are used to fine-tune MSML with progressively labeled data. Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently containing 71 clinical patients with 6,836 images sampled from 678 videos. Experimental evaluations show that TSAL using only 20% data can achieve superior performance to the baseline and the state-of-the-art.

To further reveal the pathologic associations between coronavirus and hypoxemia, we report the findings of 4 complete systematic autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive individuals who died of multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined the donated corpses of 4 deceased patients who had been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A complete post-mortem examination was carried out on each corpse, and multiple organs were macroscopically examined. RESULTS The 4 corpses were 2 males and 2 females, with an average age of 69 years. Bilateral lungs showed various degrees of atrophy and consolidation, with diffusely tough and solid texture in the sections. A thromboembolism was found in the main pulmonary artery extending into the atrium in 1 corpse, and significant atherosclerotic plaques tagged in the inner wall of the aortic arch were found in 2 corpses. Two corpses were found to have slightly atrophied bilateral renal parenchyma. Atrophic changes in the spleen were found in 2 corpses. Notably, there were significantly expanded alveolar septa and prominent fibroblastic proliferation. CONCLUSIONS The laboratory data of these corpses showed a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, followed by refractory and irreversible hypoxemia. Clinical and laboratory information and autopsy and histologic presentations of multiple organs showed insufficient air exchange due to abnormalities in the respiratory system, and reduced erythropoiesis in bone marrow may play a role.","Zhang, Heng; Zhou, Jun; Chen, Rong; Ren, Yong; Cai, Jun; Zhao, Lei; Fei, Xiaochun; Liu, Zhenhua; Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Ling; Wang, Chaofu",Med Sci Monit,263,16

Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spread of RGs in a fish-duck pond and the RGs and bacterial community of fish intestines. Five fish tanks, including a control tank and four experimental tanks (duck manure, duck manure + cefotaxime, duck manure + As, and duck manure + cefotaxime + As), were tested for 100 days. The results showed that duck manure increased both the diversity and relative abundance of RGs in fish intestines, and the addition of stress factors (cefotaxime, As) increased the relative abundance of RGs by one to two orders of magnitude. The stress-inducing effect of cefotaxime was greater than that of As. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to stress factors and were the predominant RGs in fish intestines. RGs in duck manure preferentially spread from the water to biofilm and then to fish intestines, whereas co-stress of cefotaxime and As obviously promoted the spread of RGs to fish intestines. In comparison to the control tank, duck manure and stress factors significantly changed the bacterial community of fish intestines. Correlation analysis also revealed that arsB, MOX, tetA and sul1 were significantly correlated with intI1 (P < 0.01), which hinted a potentially dissemination risk of RGs in fish intestines. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further investigating the dissemination of RGs in integrated culture systems and for evaluating the ecological risk of antibiotic and As use in aquaculture.","Zhou, Min; Xu, Yanbin; Ouyang, Pengqian; Ling, Jiayin; Cai, Qiujie; Du, Qingping; Zheng, Li",Sci Total Environ,263,20

This systematic review aims to assess the association of mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. MethodsEnglish and Chinese databases were searched electronically to identify studies reporting data on MPV, PDW or P-LCR in COVID-19 patients. Included articles underwent a quality rating. A meta-analysis was performed using the standard mean difference and interpreted as the common language effect size (CLES). ResultsTwenty-two studies (11,906 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 14 were rated poor and eight were fair. The MPV and P-LCR was significantly higher at hospital admission in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. The MPV, PDW and P-LCR were significantly higher at hospital admission in non-survivors compared to survivors. There was a marked increase in the probability of a severe COVID-19 patient presenting with higher P-LCR at hospital admission than a non-severe patient (CLES: 68.7% [95% CI: 59.8%, 76.5%]), when compared with MPV and PDW ((CLES: 59.2% [95% CI: 53.1%, 65.1%]) and (CLES: 55.9% [95% CI: 50.6%, 62.2%]), respectively). ConclusionSevere COVID-19 disease is associated with the increased production of larger, younger platelets. When comparing MPV, PDW and P-LCR, P-LCR is the most important biomarker for evaluating platelet activity. P-LCR testing at hospital admission could identify COVID-19 patients with increased risk for thrombotic events, allowing preventative treatment.

The one-year scheme provides Psych Stars with a matched mentor, free registration at the RCPsych's International Congress, financial support for psychiatry-related activities, journal subscriptions and access to two online learning platforms. This project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme in supporting Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry and in promoting psychiatry as a career choice, through use of a survey for both Psych Stars and mentors.MethodSurveys were sent to all Psych Stars and mentors from the first cohort of the scheme. The mentor and student surveys contained a mixture of ranking, multiple choice, closed-ended and open-ended questions. Questions examined: clarity of the scheme's aims and objectives;benefits of each aspect of the scheme;impact of the scheme on application to Core Training;benefits and barriers to successful mentorship;adequacy of mentor support from the RCPsych and suggestions to improve the scheme.ResultSix Psych Stars and nine mentors completed the respective surveys. All Psych Stars stated the scheme was enjoyable. Five Psych Stars were more likely to apply for Core Training because of the scheme. All Psych Stars identified the most beneficial aspect of the scheme being the funded place at the RCPsych International Congress. Other aspects highly ranked included: funding to explore areas of psychiatry of interest and the opportunity to be an ambassador for psychiatry. All Psych Stars found the mentorship useful.Mentors supported Psych Stars by providing career advice, suggesting relevant conferences to attend and assisting Psych Stars make decisions on how to use their allocated funding. Barriers to mentorship that were identified included: geographical separation, limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of time. For mentors, areas for improvement included clearer aims and objectives and more support from the RCPsych.Both mentors and Psych Stars suggested forming a network of Psych Stars and mentors would be useful to share ideas and experiences.ConclusionThis evaluation shows that the Psych Star scheme successfully supports Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry, and promotes psychiatry as a career choice. This survey has been helpful in identifying what aspects of the scheme are particularly attractive, and also, importantly, how the Psych Stars scheme can be improved for future cohorts. The survey will be delivered to all future annual cohorts of Psych Stars and mentors.","Lunn, India Hyland Declan",BJPsych Open,263,20
487630,487630,487630,A Machine Learning-Aided Global Diagnostic and Comparative Tool to Assess Effect of Quarantine Control in COVID-19 Spread,14.90828,3.280977,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which was initially identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, poses a major threat to worldwide health care. By August 04, 2020, there were globally 695,848 deaths (Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). A total of 5765 of them come from Turkey (Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). As a result, various governments and their respective populations have taken strong measures to control the spread of the pandemic. In this study, a model that is by construction able to describe both government actions and individual reactions in addition to the well-known exponential spread is presented. Moreover, the influence of the weather is included. This approach demonstrates a quantitative method to track these dynamic influences. This makes it possible to numerically estimate the influence that various private or state measures that were put into effect to contain the pandemic had at time t. This might serve governments across the world by allowing them to plan their actions based on quantitative data to minimize the social and economic consequences of their containment strategies. METHODS: A compartmental model based on SEIR that includes the risk perception of the population by an additional differential equation and uses an implicit time-dependent transmission rate is constructed. Within this model, the transmission rate depends on temperature, population, and government actions, which in turn depend on time. The model was tested using different scenarios, with the different dynamic influences being mathematically switched on and off. In addition, the real data of infected coronavirus cases in Turkey were compared with the results of the model. RESULTS: The mathematical study of the influence of the different parameters is presented through different scenarios. Remarkably, the last scenario is also an example of a theoretical mitigation strategy that shows its maximum in August 2020. In addition, the results of the model are compared with the real data from Turkey using conventional fitting that shows good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Although most countries activated their pandemic plans, significant disruptions in health-care systems occurred. The framework of this model seems to be valid for a numerical analysis of dynamic processes that occur during the COVID-19 outbreak due to weather and human reactions. As a result, the effects of the measures introduced could be better planned in advance by use of this model.","Öz, Yahya",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,263,16

Surgical emergencies and oncological procedures were the only operations allowed in public hospitals. Consequently, patients with morbid obesity were put in a standby situation. With the aim at exploring the viewpoint of our future bariatric surgery patients, we built a questionnaire concerning obesity and COVID-19. Method: A total of 116 bariatric surgery candidates were approached using a telephonic interview during the Italian lockdown. Results: Of the total sample, 73.8% were favorable to regular bariatric surgery execution. Forty percent were concerned about their own health status due to the COVID-19 emergency, and 61.1% were troubled by the temporary closure of the bariatric unit. The majority of the sample were eating more. Forty-five percent and the 27.5% of patients reported a worsening of the emotional state and physical health, respectively. Most of the patients (52.2%) considered themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19, especially individuals with class III obesity. Patients who reported an increased consumption of food were younger (43.44 ± 12.16 vs. 49.18 ± 12.66; F = 4.28, p = 0.042). No gender difference emerged. Conclusion: The lockdown had a negative result on Italian patients' psychological well-being and eating habits. The majority of patients would have proceeded with the surgery even during the COVID-19 emergency. Effective management and bariatric surgery should be restarted as soon as possible.","Bianciardi, Emanuela; Imperatori, Claudio; Niolu, Cinzia; Campanelli, Michela; Franceschilli, Marzia; Petagna, Lorenzo; Zerbin, Francesca; Siracusano, Alberto; Gentileschi, Paolo",Front Public Health,263,1

In Ethiopia, more than 90,490 and 1,300 confirmed cases and deaths were reported by the Federal Ministry of Health at the time of writing up this project. As health care providers are frontline workers managing the COVID-19 pandemic, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 among health professionals in Ethiopia. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and African Journal of Online (AJOL) were searched. The data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was checked by funnel plot and more objectively through Egger's regression test, with P < 0.05 considered to indicate potential publication bias. The heterogeneity of studies was checked using I2 statistics. Pooled analysis was conducted using a weighted inverse variance random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was done related to geographic region and time. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was also employed. RESULT: A total of 11 studies with 3,843 study participants for knowledge, eight studies with 2,842 study participants for attitude and 10 studies with 3, 435 study participants for practice were used to estimate the pooled level of good knowledge, positive attitude and poor practice among health professionals. The overall estimated good level of knowledge, positive attitude and poor practice towards COVID-19 was found to be 79.4% (95% CI: 73.5%-85.2%; I2 = 96%), 73.7% (95%CI: 63.09%-84.4%; I2 = 98.3%) and 40.3% (95%CI: 31.1%-49.6%; I2 = 97.1%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Study findings showed that there were significant gaps in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and practice with respect to World Health Organization recommendations on COVID-19 management and personal protection practices. This study therefore recommends that institutions provide with immediate effect accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19 and training that encourages improved knowledge, attitude and practice to mitigate this pandemic.","Lake, Eyasu Alem; Demissie, Birhanu Wondimeneh; Gebeyehu, Natneal Atnafu; Wassie, Addisu Yeshambel; Gelaw, Kelemu Abebe; Azeze, Gedion Asnake",PLoS One,263,13

The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.","Anonymous,",Alzheimers Dement,263,1

The commensurate structure with a modulation wavevector q = 5c*/6 was analyzed in a conventional manner in 3D space, while a structure model in (3+1)-dimensional superspace was used for the other two crystals with modulation wavevectors slightly differing from 5c*/6. The superstructure of the commensurate phase was described using the space group P4/n and a common superspace group I4/m(00Î³)00 was used for the (3+1)D structures of all three crystals. The whole structure of each crystal consists of two substructures. Basis vectors a and b are common, but c is different for the two substructures. The first substructure is a host framework constructed by (Li/Al)O4 tetrahedra sharing edges. A linear connection of cavities is seen to be channel-like, in which Sr ions locate as guest cations forming the second substructure. The crystal of q = 5c*/6 contains five Sr ions per six cavities in a channel. Sr ions are distributed at seven sites, some of which are partially occupied. Statistical disorder of local structure models for the location of Sr ions in the channel was assumed to explain the results. Such a partially disordered character was also seen in the incommensurate phases and properly embodied by a (3+1)D model containing an atomic domain of the Sr ion with occupational modulation. Plots of the occupation factor, interatomic distances and the bond valence sum at each metal site as functions of t (= x4 - q·r) are roughly identical in the three crystals, which are considered as members of the same series of composite crystals.","Ooishi, Atsushi; Michiue, Yuichi; Funahashi, Shiro; Takeda, Takashi; Hirosaki, Naoto",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,263,1

To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that ""Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk."" During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.","Mattioli, Anna Vittoria; Ballerini Puviani, Matteo; Nasi, Milena; Farinetti, Alberto",Eur J Clin Nutr,263,1

Here, we investigated whether increased engagement with digital social tools may help mitigate effects of enforced isolation on physical activity and mood, in a naturalistic study of at-risk individuals. Passively sensed smartphone app use and actigraphy data were collected from a group of psychiatric outpatients before and during imposition of strict Covid-19 lockdown measures. Data were analysed using Gaussian graphical models: a form of network analysis which gives insight into the predictive relationships between measures across timepoints. Within-individuals, we found evidence of a positive predictive path between digital social engagement, general smartphone use, and physical activity-selectively under lockdown conditions (N = 127 individual users, M = 6201 daily observations). Further, we observed a positive relationship between social media use and total daily steps across individuals during (but not prior to) lockdown. Although there are important limitations on the validity of drawing causal conclusions from observational data, a plausible explanation for our findings is that, during lockdown, individuals use their smartphones to access social support, which may help guard against negative effects of in-person social deprivation and other pandemic-related stress. Importantly, passive monitoring of smartphone app usage is low burden and non-intrusive. Given appropriate consent, this could help identify people who are failing to engage in usual patterns of digital social interaction, providing a route to early intervention.","Norbury, Agnes; Liu, Shelley H; Campaña-Montes, Juan José; Romero-Medrano, Lorena; Barrigón, María Luisa; Smith, Emma; Artés-Rodríguez, Antonio; Baca-García, Enrique; Perez-Rodriguez, M Mercedes",Mol. psychiatry,263,24

We present a stealth labeling approach that can efficiently, and with high fidelity, generate RNA transcripts, through enzymatic incorporation of the triphosphate of tCO, a fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue. We demonstrate this by incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of the natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). Spectroscopic characterization of this mRNA shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is similar to cytosine, which allows for efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently translated into H2B:GFP inside human cells. Hence, we not only develop the use of fluorescent base analogue labeling of nucleic acids in live-cell microscopy but also, importantly, show that the resulting transcript is translated into the correct protein. Moreover, the spectral properties of our transcripts and their translation product allow for their straightforward, simultaneous visualization in live cells. Finally, we find that chemically transfected tCO-labeled RNA, unlike a state-of-the-art fluorescently labeled RNA, gives rise to expression of a similar amount of protein as its natural counterpart, hence representing a methodology for studying natural, unperturbed processing of mRNA used in RNA therapeutics and in vaccines, like the ones developed against SARS-CoV-2.","Baladi, Tom; Nilsson, Jesper R; Gallud, Audrey; Celauro, Emanuele; Gasse, Cécile; Levi-Acobas, Fabienne; Sarac, Ivo; Hollenstein, Marcel R; Dahlén, Anders; Esbjörner, Elin K; Wilhelmsson, L Marcus",J Am Chem Soc,263,1

The model showed that, although no death of children would result from the reopening of the schools in the three cities analysed, the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and secondary cases among teachers, school staff and relatives of the children is not negligible. Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take. The purpose of our model and simulations is to provide a method to estimate the risk of school reopening, although we are sure it could be applied as a guide to public health strategies.","Massad, Eduardo; Amaku, Marcos; Tadeu Covas, Dimas; Fernandes Lopez, Luis; Coutinho, Francisco Antonio Bezerra",Epidemiol Infect,263,24

Alternatively, capillary blood can be taken via a finger prick (dried blood spots, DBS). In this study, paired DBS and venipuncture samples were tested using two serological assays to evaluate the usability of DBS for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Paired samples of DBS and venous serum were collected from 389 volunteers, of whom 75 had a recent PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against both viral S1 and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) antigens using two ELISAs. Degree of agreement and correlation coefficients between ELISA results based on the two sampling methods were calculated. RESULTS: Results of DBS showed almost perfect agreement and high correlations with results from corresponding serum samples in both the S1-based ELISA and the NCP-based ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: ELISA results derived from DBS showed very high agreement to those obtained with serum, supposing adequate usability and robustness of DBS as sample material for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In the near future, large-scale epidemiological screening for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will be carried out. Since DBS reduce the strain on healthcare institutions regarding sample collection, they have a potential to facilitate efficient community- and population-based screening in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Weisser, Heike; Steinhagen, Katja; Höcker, Ralf; Borchardt-Lohölter, Viola; Anvari, Özlem; Kern, Peter M",Clin. chem. lab. med,263,20

While the method is advantageous for better resolution, it suffers from grainy speckles and dark areas in the image mainly due to the interference of non-sinusoidal functions. In this Letter, we introduce a modified NL-p-DAS technique called nonlinear pth root spectral magnitude scaling (NL-p-SMS), which performs the pth root on the spectral magnitude instead of the temporal amplitude. We evaluated the US and PA images of NL-p-SMS against those of NL-p-DAS by comparing the axial and lateral line profiles, contrasts, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) in both phantom and in vivo imaging studies with various p values. As a result, we found that the NL-p-SMS has better axial resolution and CNR than the NL-p-DAS, and reduces the grainy speckles and dark area artifacts.

Methods: This study integrates the available literature on internet of things (IoT) e-health ecosystem and informal care. Results: In the first part of this article, we describe the health consequences of quarantine and isolation and outline the potential role of informal care in containing the risk of spreading the infection and reducing the burden on the health care system. Then, we present an overview of the characteristics of emerging technological ecosystems in health care and how they can be adopted as a strategic option to achieve different goals: (1) support informal carers to help vulnerable populations during quarantine and isolation and facilitate the recovery process; (2) promote the adoption of e-health and telemedicine resources to reduce the well-documented burden experienced by caregivers; and (3) lessen the various forms of digital disadvantage among vulnerable individuals, who are at more risk to be digitally excluded. In the last part of this work, we introduce solutions to overcome potential challenges related to the development and adoption of advanced technological ecosystems and propose a reflection on the legacy of COVID-19 on telemedicine. Conclusions: Thanks to the disruptive potential of IoT for health and wellness promotion, technological ecosystems emerge as a valuable resource to support both informal carers and vulnerable populations. The main factors that represent a strategic advantage of a technological ecosystem are affordability, regulatory, and availability. A high degree of interconnection between all the stakeholders emerges as a key element for the provision of intergenerational care.

However, recent observations revealed the presence of unusually high solid fraction nanoscale textures (&#934;s ~ 0.25 to 0.64) on water-repellent insect surfaces, which cannot be explained by existing wetting theories. Here, we show that the contact time of bouncing droplets on high solid fraction surfaces can be reduced by reducing the texture size to ~100 nm. We demonstrated that the texture size-dependent contact time reduction could be attributed to the dominance of line tension on nanotextures and that compact arrangement of nanotextures is essential to withstand the impact pressure of raindrops. Our findings illustrate a potential survival strategy of insects to rapidly shed impacting raindrops, and suggest a previously unidentified design principle to engineering robust water-repellent materials for applications including miniaturized drones.","Wang, Lin; Wang, Ruoxi; Wang, Jing; Wong, Tak-Sing",Sci Adv,263,1

This study examined pharmacy workers' drug knowledge and practice for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) management, including antihypertensives and anticonvulsants, and determine factors associated with their knowledge. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with 382 pharmacy workers in public facilities (government) and private pharmacies and drug stores assessed their knowledge of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs. 'Pharmacy workers' include personnel who work at pharmacies, pharmacists, family welfare visitors (FWVs), sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs), drug storekeepers. Exploratory and multivariate logistic models were used to describe association between knowledge of medicines used in pregnancy and demographic characteristics of pharmacy workers. RESULTS: Overall, 53% pharmacy workers interviewed were drug store owners in private pharmacies while 27% FWVs/SACMOs, who are government service providers also work as drug prescribers and/or dispensers in public facility pharmacies. Majority of pharmacy workers had poor knowledge compared to correct knowledge on both antihypertensive (77.8% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001) and anticonvulsant drugs (MgSO4) (82.2% vs 17.8%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed SACMOs and FWVs were greater than 4 times more likely to have correct knowledge on anti-hypertensives (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI:1.3-12.3, P < 0.01) and anticonvulsant drugs (AOR = 4.9, 95% CI:1.3-18.1, P < 0.01) compared to pharmacists. Pharmacy workers who had received training were more likely to have correct knowledge on antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs than those who had no training. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy workers' knowledge and understanding of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs, particularly for prevention and management of PE/E is limited in Bangladesh. Most pharmacies surveyed are private and staffed with unskilled workers with no formal training on drugs. Expansion of maternal and newborn health programs should consider providing additional skills training to pharmacy workers, as well as regulating these medicines at informal pharmacies to mitigate any harmful practices or adverse outcomes of unauthorized and incorrectly prescribed and used drugs. It is important that correct messaging and medicines are available as drug stores are often the first point of contact for most of the women and their families.","Roy, Shongkour; Sultana, Kanij; Hossain, Sharif Mohammed Ismail; Sripad, Pooja; Warren, Charlotte E",BMC Health Serv Res,263,1

This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. METHODS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. RESULTS: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.","Page, Andrew; Diallo, Saikou Y; Wildman, Wesley J; Hodulik, George; Weisel, Eric W; Gondal, Neha; Voas, David",Simul. healthc,263,20

However, resistance against osimertinib is inevitable; therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are needed. Doxazosin, a classic quinazoline-based alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia with a known safety profile. The anticancer effects of doxazosin have been examined in various types of malignancies from the viewpoint of drug repositioning or repurposing. However, it currently remains unclear whether doxazosin sensitizes cancer cells to osimertinib. Herein, we demonstrated that doxazosin induced autophagy and enhanced the anticancer effects of osimertinib on the cancer cells and cancer stem cells of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma at a concentration at which the growth of non-tumor cells was not affected. The osimertinib-sensitizing effects of doxazosin were suppressed by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, which suggested that the effects of doxazosin were mediated by autophagy.

During the lockdown, all major anthropogenic activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution (such as industries, vehicles, and businesses), were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the lockdown on tropospheric NO2 concentrations. Satellite-based ozone monitoring instrument sensor data were analyzed in order to investigate the variations in tropospheric NO2 concentrations. The results showed that from March 1 to 21, 2020, the average tropospheric NO2 concentration was 214.4 ×1013 molecule cm-2 over India, and it subsequently decreased by 12.1% over the next four weeks. An increase of 0.8% in tropospheric NO2 concentrations was observed for the same period in 2019 and hence, the reduced tropospheric NO2 concentrations can be attributed to restricted anthropogenic activities during the lockdown. In the absence of significant activities, the contribution of various sources was estimated, and the emissions from biomass burning were identified as a major source of tropospheric NO2 during the lockdown. The findings of this study provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism of tropospheric NO2 emissions over India, in order to improve air quality modeling and management strategies.","Biswal, Akash; Singh, Tanbir; Singh, Vikas; Ravindra, Khaiwal; Mor, Suman",Heliyon,263,19

We propose a novel method that simultaneously clusters and fits autoregression models for groups of similar individuals. We apply a Wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modeling the corresponding autocorrelation matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule-Walker equations, fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is able to discern differences in underlying serial variation of time series while accounting for an individual's intrinsic variability. We prove consistency of our cluster membership estimator and compare our approach against competing methods through simulation as well as by modeling regional COVID-19 infection rates.","Ren, Benny; Barnett, Ian",,263,19

Hospitals worldwide have decreased face-to-face visits to reduce the exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prenatal and postpartum care are essential for the health of women and their fetuses. Therefore, many hospitals have incorporated telehealth into their protocols. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine how health care organizations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating telehealth visits into their protocols for obstetrics care, what services were converted to telehealth, and its benefits and barriers. Method: A computerized literature search was performed using PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases using terms, including ""telehealth,"" ""virtual visits,"" ""obstetric,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""postpartum,"" and ""COVID-19"" for articles published before October 2020. Peer reviewed articles and guidelines were included in this review. Results: A total of 25 articles were identified. Fifteen articles reported protocols. During this pandemic, protocols developed replaced some in-person visits with telehealth visits, when no testing or vaccinations are required. The main reported benefits were minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the continuity to provide high-quality and safe care. Lack of access to high-speed internet and hardware and inaccessibility to patients were the most reported barriers. Conclusion: Telehealth provided the opportunity for reducing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some prenatal services could be completely provided through telehealth and others require medical equipment to be delivered. Health care organizations recognized that using telehealth could be continued beyond this pandemic, as they provided many benefits for patients, medical staff, and the organizations themselves.","Almuslim, Hameeda; AlDossary, Sharifah",Telemed. j. e. health,263,22

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.","Kai, Hisashi; Kai, Mamiko",Hypertens Res,263,16

METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Sleep Med,263,1

Corticosteroids decrease mortality in severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, the optimal dose remains unresolved. The ongoing randomised COVID STEROID 2 trial investigates the effects of higher vs lower doses of dexamethasone (12 vs 6 mg intravenously daily for up to 10 days) in 1,000 adult patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. METHODS: This protocol outlines the rationale and statistical methods for a secondary, pre-planned Bayesian analysis of the primary outcome (days alive without life support at day 28) and all secondary outcomes registered up to day 90. We will use hurdle-negative binomial models to estimate the mean number of days alive without life support in each group and present results as mean differences and incidence rate ratios with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). Additional count outcomes will be analysed similarly and binary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression models with results presented as probabilities, relative risks and risk differences with 95% CrIs. We will present probabilities of any benefit/harm, clinically important benefit/harm and probabilities of effects smaller than pre-defined clinically minimally important differences for all outcomes analysed. Analyses will be adjusted for stratification variables and conducted using weakly informative priors supplemented by sensitivity analyses using sceptic priors. DISCUSSION: This secondary, pre-planned Bayesian analysis will supplement the primary, conventional analysis and may help clinicians, researchers and policymakers interpret the results of the COVID STEROID 2 trial while avoiding arbitrarily dichotomised interpretations of the results.

One hundred and thirty-one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non-COVID-19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z = -2.799, P = .005 < .05). A positive correlation was found between MMP3 and interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß; r = .681, P = .000 < .05), and IL-6 (r = .529, P = .002 < .05). Serum MMP3 concentration, measured over three separate time points, were 55.98 (30.80 ~ 75.97) ng/mL, 34.84 (0.00 ~ 51.84) ng/mL, and 5.71 (0.00 ~ 40.46) ng/mL, respectively. Detection of serum MMP3 levels may play an important role in the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 and may indicate the severity of disease.","Shi, Shengjie; Su, Min; Shen, Ge; Hu, Yan; Yi, Fan; Zeng, Ziyan; Zhu, Pan; Yang, Gang; Zhou, Hui; Li, Qiong; Xie, Xiaobing",J. med. virol,263,10

The reports are organized by stakeholders and work domain into a novel taxonomy of six application categories, reflecting major differences in work envelope, adoption strategy, and human-robot interaction constraints. Each application category is further divided into a total of 30 subcategories based on differences in mission. The largest number of reported instances were for public safety (74 out of 203) and clinical care (46), though robots for quality of life (27), continuity of work and education (22), laboratory and supply chain automation (21), and non-clinical care (13) were notable. Ground robots were used more frequently (119) than aerial systems (84), but unlike ground robots, aerial applications appeared to take advantage of existing general purpose platforms that were used for multiple applications and missions. Of the 104 models of robots, 82 were determined to be commercially available or already existed as a prototype, 11 were modifications to existing robots, 11 were built from scratch. Teleoperation dominated the control style (105 instances), with the majority of those applications intentionally providing remote presence and thus not amenable to full autonomy in the future. Automation accounted for 74 instances and taskable agency forms of autonomy, 24. The data suggests areas for further research in autonomy, human-robot interaction, and adaptability.","Murphy, Robin R.; Gandudi, Vignesh Babu Manjunath; Adams, Justin",,263,21

We identified following histopathological changes among our patients:: hyaline membranes;endothelial cells/ interstitial cells involvement;alveolar cells, type I pneumocytes/ type II pneumocytes involvement;interstitial and/ or alveolar edema;evidence of hemorrhage, of inflammatory cells, evidence of microthrombi;evidence of fibrin deposition and of viral infection in the tissue samples. The scenario with proliferative cell desquamation is typical of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that can be classified as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and not DAD-ARDS. The proposed pathological mechanism concerns the role of both innate and adaptive components of the immune system.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on non-symptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death. METHODS: We developed two sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (e.g. United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population. RESULTS: Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92·000 (UI 68·000 to 124·000) pulmonary complications and almost 30·000 deaths (UI 22·000 to 40·000), respectively; for Europe, some 131·000 patients (UI 97·000 to 178·000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47·000 deaths (UI 34·000 to 63·000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18·700 (UI 13·700 to 25·300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6·400 (UI 4·600 to 8·600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259·000 (UI 191·000 to 351·000) pulmonary complications and 89·000 deaths (UI 65·000 to 120·000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 1·2 million pulmonary complications and 350·000 deaths. CONCLUSION: The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.","Soreide, Kjetil; Yaqub, Sheraz; Hallet, Julie; Kvaløy, Jan Terje; Kleppe, Tore Selland",Ann. surg,263,24

Although most people are immunocompetent to the virus, a small group fail to mount an effective antiviral response and develop chronic infections that trigger hyperinflammation. This results in major complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure, which all carry poor prognoses. Emerging evidence suggests that the complement system plays a key role in this inflammatory reaction. Indeed, patients with severe COVID-19 show prominent complement activation in their lung, skin, and sera, and those individuals who were treated with complement inhibitors all recovered with no adverse reactions. These and other studies hint at complement's therapeutic potential in these sequalae, and thus, to support drug development, in this review, we provide a summary of COVID-19 and review complement's role in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome and coagulopathy.","Lo, Martin W; Kemper, Claudia; Woodruff, Trent M",J Immunol,263,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study collecting demographic and mental health data from 2166 participants living in the Arab Gulf region (568 with diabetes, 1598 without diabetes). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 61% and 45%, in people with diabetes (PWD) and 62% and 44%, respectively, in people without diabetes. PWD who have had their diabetes visit canceled by the clinic were more likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms than those without diabetes (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.37 [1.02, 1.84] and 1.37 [1.04, 1.80], for depression and anxiety; respectively). PWD who had no method of telecommunication with their health care providers (HCP) during the pandemic, PWD with A1C of &#8805; 10%, women, employees (particularly HCPs), students, unmarried individuals, and those with lower income were more likely to report depression and/or anxiety symptoms (all P < 0.01). Fear of acquiring the coronavirus infection; running out of diabetes medications; or requiring hospitalization for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; and lack of telecommunication with HCPs were all associated with significantly higher odds of having depression and anxiety symptoms among PWD. CONCLUSIONS: The remarkably high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among subgroups of PWD, calls for urgent public health policies to address mental health during the pandemic and reestablish health care access for PWD.","Al-Sofiani, Mohammed E; Albunyan, Sarah; Alguwaihes, Abdullah M; Kalyani, Rita R; Golden, Sherita Hill; Alfadda, Assim",J. diabetes (Online),263,16

As todays students are tomorrows doctors, it is critical to understand their attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. To our knowledge, this study was the first national one to look into the attitudes of Algerian medical students toward the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using an electronic convenience survey. 383 medical students from five Algerian universities were included, with a mean age of 21.02. 85.37% (n=327) of respondents had not taken the COVID-19 vaccine yet and were divided into three groups; the vaccine acceptance group (n=175, 53.51%), the vaccine-hesitant group (n=75, 22.93%), and the vaccine refusal group (n=77, 23.54%). Gender, age, education level, university, and previous experience with COVID-19 were not significant predictors for vaccine acceptance. The confirmed barriers to the COVID-19 vaccine concern available information, effectiveness, safety, and adverse effects. This work highlights the need for an educational strategy about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Medical students should be educated about the benefits of vaccination for themselves and their families and friends. The Vaccine acceptant students influence should not be neglected with a possible ambassador role to hesitant and resistant students.

This paper proposes a Bayesian framework for joint recognition of body temperature and location (distance and direction of arrival) of people in an indoor operational environment. Unlike conventional frame-based methods, the proposed approach exploits a statistical model for the estimation of the body distance from the IR sensors and of the direction/angle of arrival (AOA) using the body-induced thermal signatures and a mobility model for tracking multi-body motions. Compared to conventional machine learning approaches, the proposed framework processes backlogs of thermal images to prevent typical detection problems such as subject disappearance. The Bayesian method for distancing monitoring is verified experimentally with field measurements for wall mounted IR sensors.","Savazzi, S.; Rampa, V.; Costa, L.; Tolochenko, D.; Ieee,",IEEE Sensors Conference,263,16

All these factors, corroborated by prolonged restrictions, have contributed to a decrease in employee satisfaction, diminishing performance and generating a counterproductive behavior. Based on Social Exchange Theory, this research plans to investigate the influence of internal marketing on job satisfaction, task performance, and counterproductive work behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in an emerging market, namely Romania. Based on a quantitative research study among 850 employees, we show that internal marketing strongly and significantly impacts job satisfaction, while insignificantly impacting task performance and counterproductive work behavior. Job satisfaction actuates task performance in a significant and positive manner, contributing to a reduction in counterproductive work behaviors.

Current perceptions of small health care businesses toward remote care, particularly perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve business sustainability, would highlight the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology among policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of small health care businesses regarding the impact of RVC on their business sustainability during COVID-19, gauge their perceptions of their current levels of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models and analyze how well that aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and determine whether these perceptions influence their view of their midterm sustainability (SUST). METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and sought assistance from a consulting firm to collect survey data in July 2020. Focal estimated study effects were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: In total, 270 respondents, including 82 clinics, 99 small physician offices, and 89 pharmacies, across Colorado were included. SRVC and SCBS had direct, significant, and positive effects on SUST. However, we investigated the effect of the interaction between SRVC and SCBS to determine whether RVC adoption aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of business sustainability. Effects differed among the three groups. The interaction term SRVC×SCBS was significant and positive for clinics (P=.02), significant and negative for physician offices (P=.05), and not significant for pharmacies (P=.76). These variations indicate that while clinics positively perceived RVC alignment with the current business scenario, the opposite held true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide and RVC adoption progresses rapidly, it is critical to understand the impact of RVC on small health care businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. Small physician practices cannot harness RVC developments and, in contrast with clinics, consider it incompatible with business survival during and after COVID-19. If small health care firms cannot compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually become nonoperational, the resulting damage to traditional health care services may be severe, particularly for critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. Our results have implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","Parthasarathy, Madhavan; Khuntia, Jiban; Stacey, Rulon",J Med Internet Res,263,0

Possible inactivation, downstream, and formulation conditions are given including suitable buffers and some first ideas for quality-control methods.

Several instructive tables are given, including the pI and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins in comparison. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in many regards, so information can often be derived. Both are unusually stable, but sensitive at their lipophilic membranes.

In an attempt to curb the spread of the virus and circumvent health systems from being overwhelmed, governments have imposed regulations such as lockdown restrictions and home confinement. These restrictions, while effective for infection control, have contributed to poorer lifestyle behaviors. Currently, Positive Psychology and Lifestyle Medicine are two distinct but complimentary disciplines that offer an array of evidence-based approaches for promoting mental health and well-being across a universal population. However, these strategies for improving mental health are typically used in isolation. This perspective calls for a new paradigm shift to create and rollout well-designed interdisciplinary universal multicomponent mental health interventions that integrates the benefits of both disciplines, and uses innovative digital mental health solutions to achieve scalability and accessibility within the limitations and beyond the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions.","Przybylko, G.; Morton, D.

There is little information on the clinical presentation and specific prognostic factors for this group. This trial evaluated the clinical presentation and prognostic factors of severe disease and mortality in the oldest-old population. METHODS: This is an ambispective cohort study of oldest-old patients hospitalized for respiratory infection associated with COVID-19 and with a positive test by RT-PCR. The clinical presentation and the factors associated with severe disease and mortality were evaluated (logistic regression). All patients were followed up until discharge or death. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (59.2% female) were included. The most frequent symptoms were fever (68.9%), dyspnoea (60.2%), and cough (39.8%), and 11.7% presented confusion. Fifty-nine patients (57.3%) presented severe disease, and 59 died, with 43 patients (41.7%) presenting both of these. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.13-0.73, p 0.0074) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.21-5.37, p 0.0139) were associated with severe disease, and serum sodium was associated with mortality (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.18-8.26, p 0.0222). No chronic disease or pharmacological treatment was associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The typical presenting symptoms of respiratory infection in COVID-19 are less frequent in the oldest-old population. Male sex and LDH level are associated with severe disease, and the serum sodium level is associated with mortality in this population.","Gálvez-Barrón, César; Arroyo-Huidobro, Marta; Minarro, Antonio; Añaños, Gemma; Chamero, Antonio; Martín, Mireia; Gris, Clara; Avalos, Jose L; Capielo, Anna M; Ventosa, Ester; Tremosa, Gemma; Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro",Gerontology,263,16

Risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes is consistently lower in women than men worldwide, suggesting that female biological sex is instrumental in protection. This mini-review discusses the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions of high physiological concentrations of the steroids 17ß-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). We review how E2 and P4 favor a state of decreased innate immune inflammatory response while enhancing immune tolerance and antibody production. We discuss how the combination of E2 and P4 may improve the immune dysregulation that leads to the COVID-19 cytokine storm. It is intended to stimulate novel consideration of the biological forces that are protective in women compared to men, and to therapeutically harness these factors to mitigate COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Mauvais-Jarvis, Franck; Klein, Sabra L; Levin, Ellis R",Endocrinology,263,1

However, less attention has been given to the assessment of intra-host diversity. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 inhabit the host as a population of variants called quasispecies. We studied the quasispecies diversity in four of the main SARS-CoV-2 genes (ORF1a, ORF1b, S and N genes), using a dataset consisting of 210 next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples collected between January and early April of 2020 in the State of Victoria, Australia. We found evidence of quasispecies diversity in 68% of the samples, 76% of which was nonsynonymous variants with a higher density in the spike (S) glycoprotein and ORF1a genes. About one-third of the nonsynonymous intra-host variants were shared among the samples, suggesting host-to-host transmission. Quasispecies diversity changed over time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some of the intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were restricted to specific lineages, highlighting their potential importance in the epidemiology of this virus. A greater effort must be made to determine the magnitude of the genetic bottleneck during transmission and the epidemiological and/or evolutionary factors that may play a role in the changes in the diversity of quasispecies over time.","Armero, Alix; Berthet, Nicolas; Avarre, Jean-Christophe",Viruses,263,20

These drugs show inhibition but also show side effects and complications too. On December 27, 2020, 80,926,235 cases have been reported worldwide. Specifically, in Pakistan, 471,335 has been reported with inconsiderable deaths. Problem statement: Identification of COVID-19 drugs pathway through drug-gene and gene-gene interaction to find out the most important genes involved in the pathway to deal with the actual cause of side effects beyond the beneficent effects of the drugs. Methodology: The medicines used to treat COVID-19 are retrieved from the Drug Bank. The drug-gene interaction was performed using the Drug Gene Interaction Database to check the relation between the genes and the drugs. The networks of genes are developed by Gene MANIA, while Cytoscape is used to check the active functional association of the targeted gene. The developed systems cross-validated using the EnrichNet tool and identify drug genes' concerned pathways using Reactome and STRING. Results: Five drugs Azithromycin, Bevacizumab, CQ, HCQ, and Lopinavir, are retrieved. The drug-gene interaction shows several genes that are targeted by the drug. Gene MANIA interaction network shows the functional association of the genes like co-expression, physical interaction, predicted, genetic interaction, co-localization, and shared protein domains. Conclusion: Our study suggests the pathways for each drug in which targeted genes and medicines play a crucial role, which will help experts in-vitro overcome and deal with the side effects of these drugs, as we find out the in-silico gene analysis for the COVID-19 drugs.","Attique, Zarlish; Ali, Ashaq; Hamza, Muhammad; Al-Ghanim, Khalid A; Mehmood, Azhar; Khan, Sajid; Ahmed, Zubair; Al-Mulhm, Norah; Rizwan, Muhammad; Munir, Anum; Al-Suliman, Emin; Farooq, Muhammad; F, Al-Misned; Mahboob, Shahid",,263,12

This has led to both corpora for biomedical articles related to COVID-19 (such as the CORD-19 corpus (Wang et al., 2020)) as well as search engines to query such data. While most research in search engines is performed in the academic field of information retrieval (IR), most academic search engines--though rigorously evaluated--are sparsely utilized, while major commercial web search engines (e.g., Google, Bing) dominate. This relates to COVID-19 because it can be expected that commercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher traction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions about the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to empirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced by Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated in the context of the TREC-COVID track (Roberts et al., 2020). To ensure a fair comparison, we limit the number of documents in the retrieved runs and also annotate additional documents.

Based on a large collection of Twitter data spanning from March to August 2020 in Argentina, we present a thematic analysis on the differences in language used in social media posts, and look at indicators that reveal the different stages of a crisis and the country response thereof. The analysis was combined with a study of the temporal prevalence of mental health conversations across the time span. Beyond the Argentinian case-study, the proposed approach and analyses can be applied to any public large-scale data. This approach can provide insights for the design of public health politics oriented to monitor and eventually intervene during the different stages of a crisis, and thus improve the adverse mental health effects on the population.","Tommasel, Antonela; Godoy, Daniela; Rodriguez, Juan Manuel",,263,16

We describe our experience with hospitalized dialysis patients with COVID-19 and factors associated with mortality. METHODS: From March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, all dialysis patients admitted to 4 Emory Hospitals and tested for COVID-19 were identified. Sociodemographic information and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Death was defined as an in-hospital death or transfer to hospice for end-of-life care. Patients were followed until discharge or death. RESULTS: Sixty-four dialysis patients with COVID-19 were identified. Eighty-four percent were African-American. The median age was 64 years, and 59% were males. Four patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 60 were on hemodialysis for a median time of 3.8 years, while 31% were obese. Fever (72%), cough (61%), and diarrhea (22%) were the most common symptoms at presentation. Thirty-three percent required admission to intensive care unit, and 23% required mechanical ventilation. The median length of stay was 10 days, while 11 patients (17%) died during hospitalization and 17% were discharged to a temporary rehabilitation facility.

The seriousness of economic costs such as the closure of some workplaces, unemployment, reduction in production, and social costs such as school closures, disruptions in education could be observable. However, the effect of the measures taken on the spread of the epidemic, such as the number of delayed or prevented cases, could not be observed. For this reason, the direct effects of the measures taken on health, that is, the effects on the course of the epidemic, are important research subjects. For this purpose, in this study, the breakpoint linear regression analysis is performed to analyze the trends of daily active cases, recovered, and deaths in Turkey. The analysis reveals that there has been a remarkable impact on lockdown and other precautions. Using the breakpoint regression model, we also analyze the active cases' trajectory for eight affected countries and compare the patterns in these countries with Turkey.","Guney, Yecsim; Tuacc, Yetkin; Ozdemir, cSenay; Yavuz, Fulya Gokalp; Arslan, Olcay",,263,26

Depressive symptoms affect motivation to engage in healthy behaviors and self-management of symptoms. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with depressive symptoms who participated in a 12-week mindful physical activity intervention (Mindful Moms) throughout their pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: In this qualitative study, we explore the lived experience of women with depressive symptoms who participated in Mindful Moms, a self-management intervention involving nurse-led motivational sessions and group-based mindful physical activity (yoga). METHODS: Semistructured interviews conducted at approximately 6 weeks postpartum provided rich qualitative data that was analyzed using a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-five women participated. Findings suggest that participants in Mindful Moms felt empowered to manage their depressive symptoms through the combination of four key factors: a newly recognized need for help, a felt sense of physical and emotional benefit from participation, the power of shared safe space with other pregnant women, support from study staff, and an overall sense of empowerment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Mindful Moms appears to be a feasible and acceptable approach to enhancing motivation to self-manage depressive symptoms in pregnant women. Nurses working with childbearing women should be aware of the potential benefits of self-management strategies, such as mindful physical activity and motivational interviewing, for women facing perinatal depressive symptoms.","Russell, Sasha; Aubry, Christine; Rider, Amy; Mazzeo, Suzanne E; Kinser, Patricia A",MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs,263,16

The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data usability. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely on bespoke data sharing contracts. These contracts increase the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research. This paper provides a synthesis between two novel advanced privacy enhancing technologies (PETs): Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multiparty Computation (defined together as Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption or MHE). These PETs provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with MHE providing a performance advantage over separately using HE or SMC. We argue MHE fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using MHE can be considered anonymized data. We explain how MHE can reduce the reliance on customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research whilst offering additional incentives for healthcare and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.","Scheibner, James; Raisaro, Jean Louis; Troncoso-Pastoriza, Juan Ram'on; Ienca, Marcello; Fellay, Jacques; Vayena, Effy; Hubaux, Jean-Pierre",,263,17

CNS diseases caused by intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli stimulate the resident immune cells including microglia and astrocyte, resulting in neuroinflammation that exacerbates the progression of diseases. Recent evidence reveals the aberrant expression patterns of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the damaged tissues following CNS diseases. It was also proposed that lncRNAs possessed immune-modulatory activities by directly or indirectly affecting various effector proteins including transcriptional factor, acetylase, protein kinase, phosphatase, etc. In addition, lncRNAs can form a sophisticated network by interacting with other molecules to regulate the expression or activation of downstream immune response pathways. However, the major roles of lncRNAs in CNS pathophysiologies are still elusive, especially in neuroinflammation. Herein, we tend to review some potential roles of lncRNAs in modulating neuroinflammation based on current evidence in various CNS diseases, in order to provide novel explanations for the initiation and progression of CNS diseases and help to establish therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation.","Chen, Zhuohui; Wu, Haiyue; Zhang, Mengqi",Neurochemistry international,263,1

A recent meta-analysis provides support for prolonged corticosteroid treatment in ALI-ARDS. We prospectively evaluated the response to oseltamivir and prolonged corticosteroid treatment in patients with ALI-ARDS and suspected H1N1 influenza. METHODS: From June 24 through 12 July 2009, 13 patients with suspected H1N1 pneumonia and ALI-ARDS were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital. H1N1 influenza was confirmed with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in eight patients. Oseltamivir and corticosteroid treatment were initiated concomitantly at ICU admission; those with severe ARDS received methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), and others received hydrocortisone (300 mg/day) for a duration of 21 ± 6 days. RESULTS: Patients with and without confirmed H1N1 influenza had similar disease severity at presentation and a comparable response to treatment. By day 7 of treatment, patients experienced a significant improvement in lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores (P < 0.001). Twelve patients (92%) improved lung function, were extubated, and discharged alive from the ICU. Hospital length of stay and mortality were 18.7 ± 9.6 days and 15%, respectively. Survivors were discharged home without oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, with and without confirmed H1N1 influenza, prolonged low-to-moderate dose corticosteroid treatment was well tolerated and associated with significant improvement in lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores and a low hospital mortality. These findings provide the rationale for developing a randomized trial.","Quispe-Laime, Adolfo Maximo; Bracco, Jonas Daniel; Barberio, Patricia Alejandra; Campagne, Claudio German; Rolfo, Verónica Edith; Umberger, Reba; Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto",Intensive Care Med,263,5

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","Zhu, Xiaolin; Zhang, Aiyin; Xu, Shuai; Jia, Pengfei; Tan, Xiaoyue; Tian, Jiaqi; Wei, Tao; Quan, Zhenxian; Yu, Jiali",,263,1

This study aimed to build and validate a simple tool that can quickly predict the deterioration and survival of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 351 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Yichang between 9 January to 25 March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were randomly grouped into training (n = 246) or a validation (n = 105) dataset. Risk factors associated with deterioration were identified using univariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The factors were then incorporated into the nomogram. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the survival of patients between the low- and high-risk groups divided by the cut-off point. RESULTS: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to construct the nomogram via four parameters (white blood cells, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte≥0.8 × 10(9)/L, and lactate dehydrogenase ≥400 U/L). The nomogram showed good discriminative performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.945 (95% confidence interval: 0.91–0.98), and good calibration (P = 0.539). Besides, the nomogram showed good discrimination performance and good calibration in the validation and total cohorts (AUROC = 0.979 and AUROC = 0.954, respectively). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model had clinical application value. Kaplan-Meier analysis illustrated that low-risk patients had a significantly higher 8-week survival rate than those in the high-risk group (100% vs 71.41% and P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A simple-to-use nomogram with excellent performance in predicting deterioration risk and survival of COVID-19 patients was developed and validated.

Identifying reinfection requires detecting the virus at two different time points and using viral genomic data to distinguish reinfection from persistent viral carriage. This process is hindered by challenges of logistics and capacity, such as banking samples from primary infection and performing viral genome sequencing. These challenges may help to explain why very few cases have been described to date. In addition, reinfection may be a rare phenomenon, but detailed prospective studies are needed to rigorously assess its frequency. To provide context for future investigations of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we review 16 cases that have been published to date or are available in preprint. Reinfection occurred across demographic spectra and in patients whose initial infections were both asymptomatic/mild and moderate/severe. For cases in which severity could be compared between episodes, half of reinfections were less severe, raising the possibility of partial immune protection. Although many patients had a positive total immunoglobulin or IgG result at the time of reinfection, very little examination of their immune response was performed. Further work is needed to elucidate the frequency, determinants, and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Establishing the necessary frameworks for surveillance and investigation will rely heavily on clinical laboratories and clinical investigators, and we propose several considerations to guide the medical community in identifying and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections.","Babiker, Ahmed; Marvil, Charles E.; Waggoner, Jesse J.; Collins, Matthew H.; Piantadosi, Anne",J Clin Microbiol,263,16

To determine the effects of somatic mutation on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, we analyzed six independent antibody lineages. As well as increased neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed pathways for acquisition of resistance and, in some cases, restricted the range of neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation apparently imposed a requirement for multiple spike mutations to enable escape. For certain antibody lineages, maturation enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.","Muecksch, Frauke; Weisblum, Yiska; Barnes, Christopher O.; Schmidt, Fabian; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Flyak, Andrew I; DeLaitsch, Andrew T; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Hou, Shurong; Schiffer, Celia A.; Gaebler, Christian; Wang, Zijun; Da Silva, Justin; Poston, Daniel; Finkin, Shlomo; Cho, Alice; Cipolla, Melissa; Oliveira, Thiago Y.; Millard, Katrina G.; Ramos, Victor; Gazumyan, Anna; Rutkowska, Magdalena; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.",bioRxiv,263,22

Our goal was to identify the incidence of AKI, predictive factors and impact on hospital mortality. METHOD: Retrospective cohort of patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ICU. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Data was collected from electronic medical records between March 17 and April 26. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 55.9% progressed with AKI, and the majority (66.7%) was classified as stage 3. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. Twenty-three patients died. In the group without kidney injury, there were 8.9% deaths, while in the group with AKI, 33.3% of patients died (RR 5.125; 95% CI 1.598 - 16.431; p = 0.0060). The average survival, in days, was higher in the group without AKI.

Following this, there has been a rapid increase in the number of cases. On 12th March 2020, there were over 100,000 confirmed cases and almost 4,300 deaths worldwide. The clinical profile of children with COVID-19 is unknown due to the few number of cases reported. Currently, available data suggest they may have a milder form of illness. METHODS: A review of the literature published from June 2019 to March 2020 was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of COVID-19 in in children. Data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, ISI Web of Knowledge and references within identified articles. RESULTS: We identified 303 potential studies, and 295 were excluded for reasons including duplicates, experimental studies and case reports. Eight studies were eligible for inclusion, including a total of 820 paediatric cases of COVID-19. Asymptomatic cases represented 14.3% (n = 117) of the total number of cases identified, and thus the remaining 85.7% (n = 703) experienced symptoms. Fever was the commonest symptom in 53.9% (n = 48) of cases, followed by cough in 39.3% (n = 35) of cases, and rhinorrhoea or pharyngeal congestion in 13.5% (n = 12) of cases. Diarrhoea and sore throats were less common symptoms, 7.9% (n = 7) and 9.0% (n = 8) respectively. Other symptoms, including fatigue, headache and dizziness were rare. CONCLUSION: Children are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are more likely to run a milder cause of illness following this infection compared to adults. This outbreak only started 3 months ago, therefore, further population wide studies are needed to validate these findings.","Tung Ho, Carmen Lok; Oligbu, Peter; Ojubolamo, Olakunle; Pervaiz, Muhammad; Oligbu, Godwin",AIMS Public Health,263,24

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included adult patients presenting to The Alfred and Sandringham Hospital EDs during the first month of Stage 2 and 3 SOE restrictions (March 26–April 252 020). Patients transferred from other hospitals or diagnosed with COVID‐19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the average number of presentations per day. Secondary outcomes included the average daily number of presentations for pre‐specified subgroups defined by triage category and diagnosis. The independent impact of SOE restrictions, adjusted for underlying trends in attendance, was determined using negative binomial regression and reported as an incident rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Average daily attendance during the exposure period was 174.7. In the absence of SOE restrictions, 278.8 presentations per day were predicted, a reduction of 37.3% (IRR 0.63, CI 0.59–0.67). Attendance was lower than anticipated for all triage categories (especially category 5 [IRR 0.51, CI 0.44–0.59]) and diagnostic groups (including circulatory problems [IRR 0.62, CI 0.50–0.76) and injury [IRR 0.58, CI 0.53–0.63]). There were fewer than predicted presentations for several sentinel diagnoses, including gastroenteritis (IRR 0.27, CI 0.17–0.42) and renal colic [IRR 0.55, CI 0.33–0.92]. CONCLUSIONS: SOE restrictions were associated with a significant reduction in ED presentations across a range of triage categories and diagnoses.

The virus is transmitted from an infected person to another person through close contact and droplets. Frontline health care workers are the most at risk of infection, and so a WHO interim guidance document was issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) which underscores the importance of proper sanitation and waste management practices for COVID- 19 in health-care settings. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and preventive practices towards Covid-19 among health care providers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno Bedele zones, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 330 health workers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno-Bedelle Zones, Southwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of preventive practices towards Covid-19. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05. RESULT: The majority of respondents (93.3%) demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19, and the mean (SD) knowledge score was 9.04 ± 1.06. Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of the study participants had good infection prevention practices. Being male (AOR = 3.65, 95% CI: (1.96, 6.80)), education level (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI (1.02, 3.22)), profession (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI (1.08, 9.33)), service year (5–10 years) (AOR = 2.00 (1.02, 3.92)) and more than 10 years (AOR = 3.14 (1.51, 6.52)), availability of personal protective equipment (AOR = 1.96 (1.06, 3.61)) and Knowledge level (AOR = 2.61 (1.48, 4.62)) were independent predictors of COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: The overall level of knowledge of HCWs was good. However, the practice was relatively low. Gender, educational status, profession, year of service, knowledge towards COVID-19, and availability of personal protective equipment were independent predictors of good infection prevention practices. Optimizing the infection prevention and control loop of the health facilities is recommended.

For this, we mainly consider AI-driven tools that employ two different types of image data, namely chest Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray. We elaborate on their strengths and weaknesses by taking the following important factors into account: i) dataset size; ii) model fitting criteria (over-fitting and under-fitting); iii) transfer learning in the deep learning era; and iv) data augmentation. Medical imaging tools do not explicitly analyze model fitting. Also, using transfer learning, with fewer data, one could possibly build Covid-19 deep learning model but they are limited to education and training. We observe that, in both image modalities, neither the dataset size nor does data augmentation work well for Covid-19 screening purposes because a large dataset does not guarantee all possible Covid-19 manifestations and data augmentation does not create new Covid-19 cases.","Santosh, KC; Ghosh, Sourodip",J Med Syst,263,1

It helps the entry of novel coronavirus (n-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the host cell. Successful inhibition of the TMPRSS2 can be one of the crucial strategies to stop the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, a set of bioactive molecules from Morus alba Linn. were screened against the TMPRSS2 through two widely used molecular docking engines such as Autodock vina and Glide. Molecules having a higher binding affinity toward the TMPRSS2 compared to Camostat and Ambroxol were considered for in-silico pharmacokinetic analyses. Based on acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness, finally, five molecules were found to be important for the TMPRSS2 inhibition. A number of bonding interactions in terms of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions were observed between the proposed molecules and ligand-interacting amino acids of the TMPRSS2. The dynamic behavior and stability of best-docked complex between TRMPRSS2 and proposed molecules were assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several parameters from MD simulation have suggested the stability between the protein and ligands. Binding free energy of each molecule calculated through MM-GBSA approach from the MD simulation trajectory suggested strong affection toward the TMPRSS2. Hence, proposed molecules might be crucial chemical components for the TMPRSS2 inhibition.

This study investigated pre- to in-pandemic changes in health behaviors and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of personality traits in these changes in Finland. Data from a larger population-based cohort study of 51–59-year-old Finnish women were used (n = 358). Self-reported questionnaires gathered information about depressive symptoms, eating behavior, physical activity, and alcohol consumption before the pandemic time, at the onset, and at the end of the COVID-19 emergency conditions. Information about personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) and sociodemographic factors was available from the pre-pandemic baseline. Women reported more depressive symptoms and unhealthier eating habits at the end of the emergency conditions compared to the pre-pandemic time. An increase in depressive symptoms was associated with changing to unhealthier eating habits. Higher extraversion was associated with a perceived decrease in alcohol consumption and with changing to healthier eating habits. Women with higher neuroticism reported changing to either healthier or unhealthier eating habits. In general, some women reported healthier lifestyle changes while other women reported the opposite. Personality traits help to understand these individual differences in adaptation to the pandemic situation.","Kekäläinen, Tiia; Hietavala, Enni-Maria; Hakamäki, Matti; Sipilä, Sarianna; Laakkonen, Eija K.; Kokko, Katja",Int J Environ Res Public Health,263,24

A series of experimental tests have been carried out with nine different Android devices to study the system performance. These tests have shown that the ALE beacon can be detected at one meter distance with signal-to-noise ratios as low as −12 dB. The tests have also demonstrated a detection rate above 80% for reception angles up to 50° with respect to the beacon’s acoustic axis at the same distance. Finally, a study of the ALE beacon energy consumption has been conducted demonstrating comparable power consumption to commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Besides, the ALE beacon search can save up to 9% more battery of the Android devices than the BLE beacon scanning.","Aguilera, Teodoro; Aranda, Fernando J.; Parralejo, Felipe; Gutiérrez, Juan D.; Moreno, José A.; Álvarez, Fernando J.",Sensors (Basel),263,33

This is particularly important with the advent of a new strain of coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has led to the present pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although, the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are less described and controversial, we presume a link between smoking and COVID-19. Smoking has been shown to enhance the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) key entry genes utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and induce a ‘cytokine storm’, which further increases the severity of COVID-19 clinical course. Nevertheless, the impact of smoking on ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 receptors expression remains paradoxical. Thus, further research is necessary to unravel the association between smoking and COVID-19 and to pursue the development of potential novel therapies that are able to constrain the morbidity and mortality provoked by this infectious disease.

Approximately 16% of patients (n = 45) had severe disease, and there were no deaths. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease were older, had a higher frequency of coexisting conditions and pneumonia, and had a shorter incubation period (all P < .05). There were no differences between patients who likely contacted the virus in Wuhan and those who had no exposure to Wuhan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that older age, male sex, and decreased albumin level were independently associated with disease severity.

Private maternity hospitals have a unique challenge of reassuring unaffected patients of uneventful delivery with the lowest possible rate of coronavirus infection while consequently offering compassionate and state of art services to women who turn out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. This has led to a routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of all patients before admission in many of the private hospitals in India. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-COV-2 among asymptomatic pregnant women and to ascertain the utility of universal screening in these women. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational multi-center study was conducted over a period of approximately 5 months (1-May-2020 to 10-September-2020) in a chain of privately run maternity hospitals with presence in multiple cities across India. All asymptomatic pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to elective/emergency hospital admission. RESULTS: Among 4158 women tested, 54 (1.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and intra partum and postnatal period was uneventful for all of them.

During the epidemic, some patients with neurological diseases also have COVID-19, which could be misdiagnosed and cause silent transmission and nosocomial infection. Such risk is high in a neurological intensive care unit (NCU). Therefore, prevention and control of epidemic in critically ill patients is of utmost importance. The principle of NCU care should include comprehensive screening and risk assessment, weighing risk against benefits and reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission while treating patients as promptly as possible.","Wang, Furong; Liu, Jingyi; Zhang, Ping; Jiang, Wen; Zhang, Le; Zhang, Meng; Teng, Junfang; Wang, Jinquan; Xie, Xiaoqi; Cao, Jie; Li, Wei; Wu, Yongming; Zhou, Hao; Su, Yingying; Pan, Suyue; Liu, Liping",Stroke Vasc Neurol,263,16

Elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been described in patients with COVID-19. However, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains incompletely understood. In order to elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis, we conducted a case–control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis, as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis. We found that remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera were associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic events in spite of prophylactic anticoagulation. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19, as well as novel approaches for thrombosis prevention.

Globally more than 24 million have been infected and the disease has claimed more than a million lives as of October 2020. Predicting which patients will need respiratory support is important to guiding individual patient treatment and also to ensuring sufficient resources are available. We evaluated the ability of six common Early Warning Scores (EWS) to identify respiratory deterioration defined as the need for advanced respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airways pressure, non-invasive ventilation, intubation) within a prediction window of 24 hours. We show these scores perform sub-optimally at this specific task. Therefore, we develop an alternative Early Warning Score based on a Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) algorithm that is able to predict deterioration within the next 24 hours with high AUROC 94% and an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 70%, 96%, 70%, respectively. Our GBT model outperformed the best EWS (LDTEWS:NEWS), increasing the AUROC by 14%.

In this work, we constructed a dual-wavelength ratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on entropy-driven and bipedal DNA walker cycle amplification strategies for detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The entropy-driven cyclic amplification reaction was started by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene to generate a bandage. The bandage could combine with two other single-stranded S1 and S2 to form a bipedal DNA walker to create the following cycle reaction. After the bipedal DNA walker completed the walking process, the hairpin structures at the top of the DNA tetrahedrons (TDNAs) were removed. Subsequently, the PEI-Ru@Ti(3)C(2)@AuNPs-S7 probes were used to combine with the excised hairpin part of TDNAs on the surface of Au-g-C(3)N(4), and the signal change was realized employing electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET). By combining entropy-driven and DNA walker cycle amplification strategy, the ratiometric ECL biosensor exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 7.8 aM for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. As a result, detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene in human serum still possessed high recovery so that the dual-wavelength ratiometer biosensor could be used in early clinical diagnosis.","Fan, Zhenqiang; Yao, Bo; Ding, Yuedi; Xu, Dong; Zhao, Jianfeng; Zhang, Kai",Chem Eng J,263,26

Immigrants from the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti are among the top foreign–born communities in New York City (NYC). As people migrate to new countries, they bring their ethnomedical beliefs and practices, and adapt their plant pharmacopoeias. Haiti and the DR share a flora on the island of Hispaniola. In NYC, the flora is limited to what is available in the city. We selected plants for future laboratory research based on ethnobotanical data from two surveys among Dominicans in the DR and NYC, and a Haitian literature review. In both Dominican datasets, gynecological infections were the top women’s health condition treated with plants. We identified 10 species for this purpose reported by Dominicans that are also known medicines in Haitian culture, although not yet documented for women’s health. Plants for gynecological infections potentially cause dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota, and may increase rather than prevent disease. There is a public health need to assess traditional medicines for their ability to inhibit pathogenic bacteria, while causing minimal disruption to the vaginal flora. Several species are known antibacterials, but remain to be tested for their efficacy. These results also provide a foundation for a planned ethnobotanical survey among NYC Haitian women.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.","Edrada, Edna M.; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Salva Villarama, Eumelia P.; Dagoc, Bren F.; Smith, Chris; Sayo, Ana Ria; Verona, Jeffrey A.; Trifalgar-Arches, Jamie; Lazaro, Jezreel; Balinas, Ellen Grace M.; Telan, Elizabeth Freda O.; Roy, Lynsil; Galon, Myvie; Florida, Carl Hill N.; Ukawa, Tatsuya; Villaneuva, Annavi Marie G.; Saito, Nobuo; Nepomuceno, Jean Raphael; Ariyoshi, Koya; Carlos, Celia; Nicolasora, Amalea Dulcene; Solante, Rontgene M.",Trop Med Health,263,26

OBJECTIVE: To characterize symptoms 7 to 9 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. DESIGN: Self-reported surveys and semistructured telephone interviews at enrollment and 30 to 45 days and 7 to 9 months from diagnosis. SETTING: From 18 March to 15 May 2020, symptomatic persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the Geneva University Hospitals were followed by CoviCare, a virtual, clinical, outpatient follow-up program. Persons were contacted again at 30 to 45 days and 7 to 9 months from diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who were a part of the CoviCare program from 18 March to 15 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: A standardized interview of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with grading of intensity. RESULTS: Of the 629 participants in the study who completed the baseline interviews, 410 completed follow-up at 7 to 9 months after COVID-19 diagnosis; 39.0% reported residual symptoms. Fatigue (20.7%) was the most common symptom reported, followed by loss of taste or smell (16.8%), dyspnea (11.7%), and headache (10.0%). LIMITATION: Limitations include generalizability and missing data for 34.8% of participants. CONCLUSION: Residual symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection are common among otherwise young and healthy persons followed in an outpatient setting. These findings contribute to the recognition of long-term effects in a disease mostly counted by its death toll to date by promoting communication on postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and encouraging physicians to continue long-term monitoring of their patients.

The available evidence indicates that cutaneous signs are heterogeneous and can be divided as follows: a) erythematous rashes, b) lesions of vascular origin, c) vesicular rashes, d) urticarial rashes, and e) acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme (EM) and other polymorphic/atypical reactions. Most cutaneous manifestations appear simultaneously or after respiratory and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, even if rarely urticaria has been reported as the first sign of the disease. It has been proposed that erythematous and vesicular rashes, as well as urticaria, are the result of immunological activation against Sars-CoV-2, similarly to other viral exanthems; alternatively, reactivation or co-infection of herpesviruses and drug hypersensitivity represent possible etiologic diagnosis that has to be considered. Regarding lesions of vascular origin, ischemic ones are the result of systemic hypercoagulability established in severe infections, whereas chilblains seem to be linked to the type I-interferon massively produced to halt virus replication. AGEP is triggered by drugs, whereas EM could represent a delayed immune response to the virus or a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs elicited by the inflammatory process built to fight the infection. A further pathogenic hypothesis is that the virus, or its particles detected in the skin (particularly in endothelium and eccrine glands), could be responsible for certain skin reactions, including chilblains and EM. From the available data, it appears that chilblains are correlated with younger age and less severe disease, while ischemic manifestations occur in the elderly with severe infection. In conclusion, larger studies are needed to confirm the suggested pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID-19-related skin reactions and to determine the potential prognostic significance of each one.","Farinazzo, Eleonora; Dianzani, Caterina; Zalaudek, Iris; Conforti, Claudio; Grabbe, Stephan; Goldust, Mohamad",Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,263,32

DESIGN: Ecological analysis of COVID-19-related mortality rates occurring by 24 April 2020 and ethnic composition of the population. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. SETTING: Local authorities in England. RESULTS: For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19-related deaths increased by 5·12, 95% CI (4·00 to 6·24), per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined, including the white minority group. The size of this increase is a little reduced in an adjusted model to 4·42, 95% CI (2·24 to 6·60), suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England COVID-19-related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with two times the average number of ethnic minority people. CONCLUSIONS: We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19-related mortality within a local authority increases as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Nazroo, James; Becares, Laia",BMJ Open,263,16

There is limited information about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and obstetrics programs, particularly in rural regions. AIMS: Most published reports have been from large urban hospitals. This study sought to gain insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting rural obstetrics programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study surveyed participants who worked in rural obstetrics programs in New Mexico using a free response questionnaire. RESULTS: The pandemic has changed the obstetrics experience in rural New Mexico by impacting the relationship between patients and providers and altering the family-centered model of birth. Difficulties unique to rural obstetrics included lack of transportation, limited hospital rooms and limited staff, including OB providers, nurses and housekeeping. Wellness has been impacted for providers, manifested in increased anxiety, stress and burnout. Patients reported increased anxiety, decreased family support, and potential disruptions in maternal-infant bonding. CONCLUSIONS: Rural hospitals and clinics in New Mexico and across the United States operate with challenges at baseline, with many clinics across the nation closing, leading to increasing shortages of healthcare services in rural areas. This study showed that COVID-19 has increased the challenges that rural obstetrics providers face, altering the way they practice and creating uncertainty for the future due to potentially permanent changes to their practice. Future research will explore the lasting effects of the pandemic on rural obstetrics providers specifically, and rural hospitals generally.","Sells, Colleen E.; Maes, Aurora M.; Fleddermann, Rachel A.; Otero-Bell, Eliana L; Hartley, Rebecca S.",J Family Med Prim Care,263,1

The COVID-19 crisis leads to a reduction in site productivity, has increased compliance costs, delayed projects and increased construction workers' exposure to risk and infections. However, as countries begin to ease lockdowns and restrictions, there is a need to examine the measures that the construction companies can take to ensure workers are “Covid-safe”. This research developed a questionnaire instrument that included 24 Covid-preventive measures on construction sites. Isolating sick workers, conducting daily checks for COVID-19 symptoms, preventing hugging/handshaking at the site, displaying health advisory posters and info-graphics, and providing face masks to workers are seen to be the main measures towards keeping sites “Covid-safe”. The Principal Component Analysis structured the 24 measures into 4 components. The 4 components explained about 73% of the model, namely hygiene and control, equipment and monitoring, awareness, and incentives. The results found that compliance costs of health and safety regulations to prevent COVID-19 will increase project cost by more than 20%, site productivity will be reduced by up to 50%, and the pandemic will have caused a 40% increase in skill shortages. Cluster analysis was performed to cluster the sites in terms of their exposure to COVID-19 risk. In order to examine the practicability of the findings, the model was validated with 4 case studies. It is asserted that the research findings have the potential to keep sites “Covid-safe”, which helps construction companies increase productivity, reduce project costs, reduce claims, and deliver projects on schedule. This research is the first to examine measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on construction sites, and the findings hold critical theoretical and practical implications for future research on health and safety management.","Olanrewaju, AbdulLateef; AbdulAziz, AbdulRashid; Preece, Christopher Nigel; Shobowale, Kafayat",Clean Eng Technol,263,1

METHODS: 2,187 Austrian and German GPs answered an internet survey on preparedness, testing, staff protection, perception of risk, self-confidence, a decrease in the number of patient contacts, and efforts to control the spread of the virus in the practice during the early phase of the COVID-pandemic (3rd to 30th April). RESULTS: The completion rate of the questionnaire was high (90.9%). GPs gave low ratings to their preparedness for a pandemic, testing of suspected cases and efforts to protect staff. The provision of information to GPs and the perception of risk were rated as moderate. On the other hand, the participants rated their self-confidence, a decrease in patient contacts and their efforts to control the spread of the disease highly. CONCLUSION: Primary care is an important resource for dealing with a pandemic like COVID-19. The workforce is confident and willing to take an active role, but needs to be provided with the appropriate surrounding conditions. This will require that certain conditions are met.

Viral sepsis has been proposed as a description for severe COVID-19, and numerous therapies have been on trials based upon this hypothesis. However, whether the clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 are similar to those of bacterial sepsis has not been elucidated. Methods We retrospectively compared the clinical data of non-surviving COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a 30-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan Infectious Diseases Hospital (Wuhan, China) from 22 January 2020, to 28 February 2020, with those of non-surviving patients with bacterial sepsis who were admitted to the ICU in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China) from 3 July 2018, to 30 June 2020. Results A total of 53 COVID-19 patients and 26 septic patients were included in the analysis. The mean ages were 65.6 [standard deviation (SD): 11.1] and 70.4 (SD: 14.3) years in the COVID-19 cohort and sepsis cohort, respectively. The proportion of participants with hypertension was higher in non-survivors with COVID-19 than in non-survivors with sepsis (41.5% vs. 15.4%, P=0.020). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of non-survivors with COVID-19 was lower than that of non-survivors with sepsis at ICU admission {4.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 3.0-6.0] vs. 7.5 [IQR: 5.8-11.0], P<0.001}. The clinical parameters at ICU admission assessed with principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that COVID-19 patients were distinct from bacterial septic patients. Compared with non-survivors with sepsis, non-survivors with COVID-19 had a higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, total protein, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer; a lower eosinophil count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, myohemoglobin, albumin/globulin ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalization ratio (INR) at ICU admission. In addition, the levels of total protein, globulin, LDH, D-dimer, and IL-6 were significantly different between the two groups during the ICU stay. Conclusions Patients with critical COVID-19 have a phenotype distinct from that of patients with bacterial sepsis. Therefore, caution should be used when applying the previous experience of bacterial sepsis to patients with severe COVID-19.","Yu, Jie; Wang, Yingqin; Lin, Shilong; Jiang, Li; Sang, Ling; Zheng, Xia; Zhong, Ming",Annals of translational medicine,263,2

As these characteristics easily lead to global pandemics, studying the evolutionary relationship between viruses is essential for clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing has played an important role in evolutionary analysis. Recent alignment-free methods can overcome the problems of traditional alignment-based methods, which consume both time and space. This paper proposes a novel alignment-free method called the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV), which defines a correlation measure of the L-step delay of a nucleotide location from its location in the original DNA sequence. The numerical feature is a 16 × L-dimensional numerical vector describing the distribution characteristics of the nucleotide positions in a DNA sequence. The proposed L-step delay correlation measure is interestingly related to some types of L + 1 spaced mers. Unlike traditional gene comparison, our method avoids the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment, and hence improves the speed of sequence comparison. Our method is applied to evolutionary analysis of the common human viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Dengue virus, Hepatitis B virus, and human rhinovirus and achieves the same or even better results than alignment-based methods. Especially for SARS-CoV-2, our method also confirms that bats are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Lily; Sun, Siyang; Zhang, Qianyue; Bao, Xiaona; Li, Peter K.",Infect Genet Evol,263,24

Bocavirus infections are associated with a wide spectrum of disease in humans and various mammalian species. Here we describe a fatal enteritis associated with infection with a novel strain of canine bocavirus 2 (CaBoV-2), that occurred in a litter of German wirehaired pointers. Necropsy performed on three puppies revealed an enteritis reminiscent of canine parvovirus associated enteritis, accompanied with signs of lymphocytolytic disease in bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus. While other major causes of enteritis of young dogs, including canine parvovirus, were excluded, by random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing, a novel CaBoV-2 strain was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome of this novel canine bocavirus strain indicated that this virus was indeed most closely related to group 2 canine bocaviruses. Infection with canine bocavirus was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which revealed the presence of CaBoV-2 nucleic acid in the intestinal tract and lymphoid tissues of the dogs. In a small-scale retrospective analysis concerning the role of CaBoV-2 no additional cases were identified.

Poultry eggs provide an important source of protein, and consumers demand high-quality products. The industry relies on efficiency and good management, including vaccinations against the major poultry diseases, in order to ensure that they can match consumer demand. However, although there are a number of effective disease prevention protocols in place on poultry farms, viruses that affect egg production continue to be a major constraint for the sustainability of the table egg industry globally. Various factors related to either the infecting virus, the host, or the management system have been demonstrated to contribute significantly to the challenge for effective egg production. Viral infections in laying flocks have been shown to target various biological mechanisms that are essential for the quantitative and qualitative traits of egg production. This review describes the mechanisms involved in viral diseases of poultry that induce undesirable effects on egg production. ABSTRACT: Eggs are a common source of protein and other nutrient components for people worldwide. Commercial egg-laying birds encounter several challenges during the long production cycle. An efficient egg production process requires a healthy bird with a competent reproductive system. Several viral pathogens that can impact the bird’s health or induce reversible or irreversible lesions in the female reproductive organs adversely interfere with the egg industry. The negative effects exerted by viral diseases create a temporary or permanent decrease in egg production, in addition to the production of low-quality eggs. Several factors including, but not limited to, the age of the bird, and the infecting viral strain and part of reproductive system involved contribute to the form of reproductive disease encountered. Advanced methodologies have successfully elucidated some of the virus–host interactions relevant to the hen’s reproductive performance, however, this branch needs further research. This review discusses the major avian viral infections that have been reported to adversely affect egg productivity and quality and aims to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the observed negative effects.","Hassan, Mohamed S.

It achieves this by simultaneously binding the target substrate (sub) and para-hydrogen to a metal centre. To date, sterically large substrates are relatively inaccessible to SABRE due to their weak binding leading to catalyst destabilisation. We overcome this problem here through a simple co-ligand strategy that allows the hyperpolarisation of a range of weakly binding and sterically encumbered N-heterocycles. The resulting (1)H NMR signal size is increased by up to 1400 times relative to their more usual Boltzmann controlled levels at 400 MHz. Hence, a significant reduction in scan time is achieved. The SABRE catalyst in these systems takes the form [IrX(H)(2)(NHC)(sulfoxide)(sub)] where X = Cl, Br or I. These complexes are shown to undergo very rapid ligand exchange and lower temperatures dramatically improve the efficiency of these SABRE catalysts.","Rayner, Peter J.; Gillions, Joseph P.; Hannibal, Valentin D.; John, Richard O.; Duckett, Simon B.",Chemical science,263,1

This debate article discusses whether artificial intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for elder care. MAIN TEXT: Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy. CONCLUSION: It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote older adults’ health outcomes, and minimize waste.","Ho, Anita",BMC Geriatr,263,1

The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from randomly selected people in England in order to describe patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Here, we report data from round 9a of REACT-1 for swabs collected between 4th and 13th February 2021. Results : Out of 85,473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than two thirds since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all nine regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5 to12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Healthcare and care home workers were more likely to test positive compared to other workers. Conclusions : There is a strong decline in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England among the general population five to six weeks into lockdown, but prevalence remains high: at levels similar to those observed in late September 2020. Also, the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals is higher than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020.

Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. METHODS: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5–8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. FINDINGS: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. INTERPRETATIONS: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent- child relationship disruptions.

However, its prevalence after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and its association with long‐term mortality remain controversial. METHODS: Data were extracted from the South Korean National Health Insurance Service database in this population‐based cohort study. Adults who received ECMO therapy from 2006 to 2014 were included. Survivors of ECMO were defined as patients who underwent ECMO and survived over 365 days after the initiation of ECMO therapy. RESULTS: A total of 3,055 survivors of ECMO were included in the final analysis. They were classified into the pre‐ECMO depression group (n = 275 [9.0%]), post‐ECMO depression group (n = 331 [10.8%]), and other ECMO survivor group. In the multivariable Cox regression model, a 1.52‐fold higher mortality was observed in the post‐ECMO depression group than in the other groups (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–1.96; p = .002). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the pre‐ECMO depression group and the other groups (p = .075). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pre‐ and post‐ECMO depression was 9.0% and 10.8%, respectively. Additionally, post‐ECMO depression was associated with an increased 5 year all‐cause mortality; however, pre‐ECMO depression was not.","Park, Hye Youn; Cho, Hyoung‐Won; Song, In‐Ae; Lee, Sukyoon; Oh, Tak Kyu",Brain Behav,263,1

One of the interventions that proved beneficial was the use of prone positioning (PP) for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. In our institution, we practiced PP in the medical ICU for this population. However, with the dramatically increasing patient load, we anticipated that we would require greater capacity to provide this treatment to all qualifying patients. METHODS: : A group of physical therapists and occupational therapists (PT/OTs) with ICU experience was redeployed from their regular roles to receive training in PP from an experienced MICU RN. After intensive training, the team was ready to provide PP to patients. As the workload increased, additional PT/OTs were recruited to the team. A coordinating structure comprising attending pulmonologists screened and advised on appropriate patients. A communication & feedback structure was implemented also. RESULTS: : Over a period of seven weeks, the team provided PP to over 100 patients, with 577 individual interventions in a total of 14 ICUs & one emergency department. There were no major airway or central venous access complications, and only one anterior pressure injury recorded. CONCLUSIONS: : The rapid implementation of an interdisciplinary PP team in a crisis situation is feasible.

Here, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of these novel biomarkers in COVID-19 patients and the diabetes subgroup. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from January to March 2020 in five hospitals in Wuhan, China. Demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, and outcomes were recorded. Neutrophil to HDL-C ratio (NHR), monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR), lymphocyte to HDL-C ratio (LHR), and platelet to HDL-C ratio (PHR) were investigated and compared in both the overall population and the subgroup with diabetes. The associations between blood parameters at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

On admission, HDL-C concentration was decreased while NHR was high in patients with critical compared with non-critical COVID-19, and were independently associated with poor outcome as continuous variables in the overall population (HR: 0.213, 95% CI 0.090–0.507; HR: 1.066, 95% CI 1.030–1.103, respectively) after adjusting for confounding factors. Additionally, when HDL-C and NHR were examined as categorical variables, the HRs and 95% CIs for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 were 0.280 (0.128–0.612) and 4.458 (1.817–10.938), respectively. Similar results were observed in the diabetes subgroup. ROC curves showed that the NHR had good performance in predicting worse outcomes. The cutoff point of the NHR was 5.50. However, the data in our present study could not confirm the possible predictive effect of LHR, MHR, and PHR on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Lower HDL-C concentrations and higher NHR at admission were observed in patients with critical COVID-19 than in those with noncritical COVID-19, and were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients as well as in the diabetes subgroup.","Wang, Yuxiu; Zhang, Jiaoyue; Li, Huiqing; Kong, Wen; Zheng, Juan; Li, Yan; Wei, Qi; Li, Qin; Yang, Li; Xu, Ying; Li, Li; Wang, Hanyu; Sun, Hui; Xia, Wenfang; Liu, Geng; Zhong, Xueyu; Qiu, Kangli; Wang, Han; Liu, Hua; Song, Xiaoli; Xiong, Si; Liu, Yumei; Cui, Zhenhai; Chen, Lulu; Zeng, Tianshu",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),263,20

In this study, we used Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) to anchor the expression of TGEV antigen (S) to dendritic cells (DCs) via dendritic cell-targeting peptides (DCpep). The results show that S antigen could be detected on the surface of L. plantarum by different detection methods. Furthermore, flow cytometry and ELISA techniques were used to measure the cellular, mucosal, and humoral immune responses of the different orally gavaged mouse groups. The obtained results demonstrated the significant effect of the constructed L. plantarum expressing S-DCpep fusion proteins in inducing high expression levels of B7 molecules on DCs, as well as high levels of IgG, secretory IgA, and IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines compared with the other groups. Accordingly, surface expression of DC-targeted antigens successfully induced cellular, mucosal, and humoral immunity in mice and could be used as a vaccine.","Yang, Wen-Tao; Li, Qiong-Yan; Ata, Emad Beshir; Jiang, Yan-Long; Huang, Hai-Bin; Shi, Chun-Wei; Wang, Jian-Zhong; Wang, Guan; Kang, Yuan-Huan; Liu, Jing; Yang, Gui-Lian; Wang, Chun-Feng",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,263,24

Effective containment and control measures ensured the eradication of these viruses but the event culminated in substantial loss of livestock and significant economic impact. The avian HPAI H7N7 virus generally does not infect humans; however, evidence shows the ocular pathway presents a favourable tissue tropism for human infection. Through antigenic drift, mutations in the H7N7 viral genome may increase virulence and pathogenicity in humans. The Victorian outbreak also detected LPAI H7N6 in emus at a commercial farm. Novel influenza A viruses can emerge by mixing different viral strains in a host susceptible to avian and human influenza strains. Studies show that emus are susceptible to infections from a wide range of influenza viral subtypes, including H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1. The emu’s internal organs and tissues express abundant cell surface sialic acid receptors that favour the attachment of avian and human influenza viruses, increasing the potential for internal genetic reassortment and the emergence of novel influenza A viruses. This review summarises the historical context of H7N7 in Australia, considers the potential for increased virulence and pathogenesis through mutations and draws attention to the emu as potentially an unrecognised viral mixing vessel.","Bisset, Andrew T.; Hoyne, Gerard F.",Microorganisms,263,26

To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HCoV in Guangzhou, south China, we collected totally 13048 throat and nasal swab specimens from adults and children with fever and acute upper respiratory infection symptoms in Gunazhou, south China between July 2010 and June 2015, and the epidemiological features of HCoV and its species were studied. Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010–2015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those <3 years old) and old people (>50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%). Fifteen HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013–2014 were selected for S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters in the phylogenetic tree, 12 strains of which formed a separate cluster that was closer to genotype G found in Malaysia. It was revealed for the first time that genotype B and genotype G of HCoV-OC43 co-circulated and the newly defined genotype G was epidemic as a dominant genotype during 2013–2014 in Guanzhou, south China.","Zhang, Su-fen; Tuo, Jiu-ling; Huang, Xu-bin; Zhu, Xun; Zhang, Ding-mei; Zhou, Kai; Yuan, Lei; Luo, Hong-jiao; Zheng, Bo-jian; Yuen, Kwok-yung; Li, Meng-feng; Cao, Kai-yuan; Xu, Lin",PLoS One,263,12

The endothelium is also a target of SARS-CoV-2. Damaged endothelial cells, which break away from organs and enter the blood to form circulating endothelial cells, were recently reported as putative biomarkers for COVID-19. Additionally, by modulating the expression level of sphingosine-1 phosphate via sphingosine kinase activation, endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis can be controlled. Thus, it may be possible to obtain a sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19 severity by assessing the absolute number and the viable/apoptotic ratio of circulating endothelial cells. Furthermore, a focus on the endothelium could help to develop a strategy for COVID-19 treatment from the perspective of endothelium protection and repair.","Zhang, Xuchang; Jiang, Man; Yang, Jianshe",Int J Infect Dis,263,24

The aim of this study was to evaluate the health effects of late implementation of the lockdown in Italy. Using national data on the daily number of COVID-19 cases, we first estimated the effect of the lockdown, employing an interrupted time series analysis. Second, we evaluated the effect of an early lockdown on the trend of new cases, creating a counterfactual scenario where the intervention was implemented one week in advance. We then predicted the corresponding number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, non-ICU admissions, and deaths. Finally, we compared results under the actual and counterfactual scenarios. An early implementation of the lockdown would have avoided about 126,000 COVID-19 cases, 54,700 non-ICU admissions, 15,600 ICU admissions, and 12,800 deaths, corresponding to 60% (95%CI: 55% to 64%), 52% (95%CI: 46% to 57%), 48% (95%CI: 42% to 53%), and 44% (95%CI: 38% to 50%) reduction, respectively.

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been widely used for serosurveys, epidemiology, and identification of potential convalescent plasma donors. However, the clinical role of serologic testing is still limited and evolving. In this report, we describe the experience of selecting, validating, and implementing SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for clinical purposes at an academic medical center in a rural state. Successful implementation involved close collaboration between pathology, infectious diseases, and outpatient clinics. The most common clinician concerns were appropriateness/utility of testing, patient charges/insurance coverage, and assay specificity. In analyzing test utilization, serologic testing in the first month after go-live was almost entirely outpatient and appeared to be strongly driven by patient interest (including health care workers and others in high-risk occupations for exposure to SARS-CoV-2), with little evidence that the results impacted clinical decision-making. Test volumes for serology declined steadily through October 31, 2020, with inpatient ordering assuming a steadily higher percentage of the total. In a 5-month period, SARS-CoV-2 serology test volumes amounted to only 1.3% of that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Unlike reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, supply chain challenges and reagent availability were not major issues for serology testing. We also discuss the most recent challenge of requirements for SARS-CoV-2 testing in international travel protocols. Overall, our experience at an academic medical center shows that SARS-CoV-2 serology testing assumed a limited clinical role.","Humble, Robert M.; Merrill, Anna E.; Ford, Bradley A.; Diekema, Daniel J.; Krasowski, Matthew D.",Acad Pathol,263,24

METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental design to compare supportive care referral patterns between a group of rural cancer survivors receiving the intervention and a control group (N = 60). We evaluated the impact of the intervention on the number and type of referrals offered and whether or not the participant accepted the referral. CRD was measured using a modified version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer and Problem List. RESULTS: Overall, 30% of participants received a referral for further post-treatment supportive care. Supporting the benefits of the intervention, the odds of being offered a referral were 13 times higher for those who received the intervention than those in the control group. However, even among the intervention group, only 28.6% of participants who were offered a referral for further psychosocial care accepted. CONCLUSIONS: A nursing telemedicine visit was successful in identifying areas of high distress and increasing referrals. However, referral uptake was low, particularly for psychosocial support. Distance to care and stigma associated with seeking psychosocial care may be factors. Further study to improve referral uptake is warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Screening for CRD may be inadequate for cancer survivors unless patients can be successfully referred to further supportive care. Strategies to improve uptake of psychosocial referrals is of high importance for rural survivors, who are at higher risk of CRD.

This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until June, using time series ARIMA model. In further analysis, based on predicted active cases, we estimated the requirement of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients until June. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of June month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in India from March 14, 2020, to May 3 2020. We estimated requirement of ICU beds as 10%, Ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases predicted from our calculations. Results: We expect that India will be having 441896 confirmed cases (95% CI: 210240, 673552), 124712 active cases (95% CI: 68481, 180944) at the end of June based on our forecasts. Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of June while Kerala is expected to have less than 1000 confirmed cases and no active cases at the end of June. We expect that India has to prepare 106006 isolation beds (95% CI: 58209, 153802), 12471 ICU beds (95% CI: 6848,18094) and 6236 ventilators (95% CI: 3424,9047) to accommodate the patients at the end of June. Discussion and Conclusion: Our forecasts show a very alarming situation for India in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases as India is observing partial lockdown currently. In future, lockdown might be lifted, and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system.","Tyagi, R.; Bramhankar, M.; Pandey, M.; M, K.",,263,0

To date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with COVID-19 vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States. To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, the present study leveraged nationally-representative data with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data to estimate levels of vaccine initiation and the adjusted relative odds of vaccine initiation and planned vaccination among adults by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and other characteristics. METHODS. Using pooled cross-sectional data from 66,994 adults aged 18-85 years in nationally-representative surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau administered between January 6, 2021 and January 18, 2021 and multivariable logistic regression, this study estimated the associations between race/ethnicity, education, and pre-pandemic (2019) household income with the self-reported: 1) receipt of [≥]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) either receipt of [≥]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or the plan to definitely receive a vaccine once available to the respondent. RESULTS. In Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics, the estimated prevalences of vaccine initiation were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 8.7% in White non-Hispanics and 15.1% in Asian non-Hispanics. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics were no more or less likely than White non-Hispanics to have received [≥]1 vaccine dose. However, for the combined outcome of either vaccine initiation or planned vaccination, Black non-Hispanics were 52% less likely than White non-Hispanics to have reported either outcome (P<.001). Meanwhile, both education and pre-pandemic income levels exhibited evidence of positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for linear trend = .01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial (vs. no) financial hardship was linked to 44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety. CONCLUSIONS. In this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy will be critical to mitigate the pandemic's disproportionately higher risks of infection and adverse outcomes in Black non-Hispanics and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and to help maximize vaccination coverage nationwide.","Kim, D.",,263,1

We recently identified a new PK-resistant PrP species, designated PrP(*20), in uninfected human and animal brains. It was preferentially detected with the 1E4 antibody against human PrP 97-108 but not with the anti-PrP 3F4 antibody, although the 3F4 epitope is adjacent to the 1E4 epitope in the PrP(*20) molecule. The present study reveals that removal of the N-terminal amino acids up to residue 91 significantly increases accessibility of the 1E4 antibody to PrP of brains and cultured cells. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type PrP, cells expressing pathogenic mutant PrP accumulate not only PrP(*20) but also a small amount of 3F4-detected PK-resistant PrP27-30. Remarkably, during the course of human prion disease, a transition from an increase in 1E4-detected PrP(*20) to the occurrence of the 3F4-detected PrP27-30 was observed. Our study suggests that an increase in the level of PrP(*20) characterizes the early stages of prion diseases.","Yuan, J.; Dong, Z.; Guo, J.-P.; McGeehan, J.; Xiao, X.; Wang, J.; Cali, I.; McGeer, P.

As a natural landscape in the city, urban waterfront space has efficient ecological benefits, high-quality landscape vision and environment, and it is an important carrier of citizens’ activities. However, existing studies have mainly focused on coping with environmental problems, while social functions and strategies have been neglected. Therefore, this study aims to fill such research gaps by understanding the social performance of urban waterfront spaces. Field observation and questionnaire survey were conducted in a famous urban waterfront space, Qiantang riverside walkway, in Hangzhou, China. The results indicate that the Qiantang riverside walkway serves as a space for tourism, leisure and entertainment, as the visitors who lived more than 5 km away from here accounted for about 50% and the local people also accounted for about 50%. People’s activities exhibited significantly temporal differences, where the occupation of the Qiantang riverside walkway reached a peak at night. For the people who lived far from here, they mainly depended on self-driving, which led to two critical problems relevant to transport linkage with the city and parking lot. Results also indicate that the landscape, supporting facilities and road functions could perform well among the mind of 102 respondents. However, public service and main facilities should be improved to meet more people’s requirements. Moreover, importantly, the results indicate the phenomenon of stratification and agglomeration so that the similar aspects (e.g. rest seat quantity, rest seat style) could be merged into the same cluster (e.g. rest seat) for consideration in the urban waterfront space planning and design. This study also generates some implications for the renovation of urban waterfront spaces. Overall, this study provides people with basic understanding of the social performance of existing urban waterfront spaces, which can further promote urban planners and designers to comprehensively build sustainable, resilient and healthy water-based living environments.","Wang, Yuan; Dewancker, Bart Julien; Qi, Qianlong",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,263,24

The R(0) of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The 30-day probable incidence and cumulative incidence were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using ‘earlyR’ and ‘projections’ packages in R software. The maximum-likelihood value of R(0) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1−3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI 1.03–1.25) by the end of day 42. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud was 9.0 ± 3.8 cases/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178–383) new cases for the period between 02 April to 03 May 2020. By day 67 (27 April), the effective reproduction number (R(t)), which had a descending trend and was around 1, reduced to 0.70. Based on the R(t) for the last 21 days (days 46–67 of the epidemic), the prediction for 27 April to 26 May is a mean daily cases of 2.9 ± 2.0 with 87 (48–136) new cases. In order to maintain R below 1, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel and providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.","Khosravi, A.; Chaman, R.; Rohani-Rasaf, M.; Zare, F.; Mehravaran, S.; Emamian, M.

Co-circulating seasonal influenza has greatly diminished recently, but expected to return with novel strains emerging, thus requiring annual strain adjustments. We have developed a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (qNIV) produced using an established recombinant insect cell expression system to produce nanoparticles. Influenza qNIV adjuvanted with Matrix-M was well-tolerated and induced robust antibody and cellular responses, notably against both homologous and drifted A/H3N2 viruses in Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials. We also developed a full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine which is stable in the prefusion conformation (NVX-CoV2373) using the same platform technology. In phase 3 clinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and protective against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant. Here we describe the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccine (qNIV/CoV2373) in ferret and hamster models. The combination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine produces high titer influenza hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) and neutralizing antibodies against influenza A and B strains. The combination vaccine also elicited antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor. Significantly, hamsters immunized with qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected against weight loss and were free of replicating SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tract with no evidence of viral pneumonia. This study supports evaluation of qNIV/CoV2373 combination vaccine as a preventive measure for seasonal influenza and CoVID-19. Highlights Combination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine induced protective hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) responses to seasonal influenza A and B unchanged when formulated with recombinant spike.

The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households, and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). Methods: We conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as proportion of estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering. Results: 39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant ({beta}interaction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00). Conclusions: Over-crowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19.

Here, we monitored indoor pollutants and bacterial communities during reductions in building leakage for weatherized single-family residential homes in New York State and compared the data to non-weatherized homes. Nine weatherized and eleven non-weatherized single-family homes in Tompkins County, New York were sampled twice: before and after the weatherization procedures for case homes, and at least 3 months apart for control homes that were not weatherized. We found that weatherization efforts led to a significant increase in radon levels, a shift in indoor microbial community, and a warmer and less humid indoor environment.

After authorizing the use of FFRs certified by other regions of the world, decision-makers in many countries have published alerts, particularly concerning the ‘KN95’ type. METHODS: This paper investigated the filtration performance of different FFRs using an experimental setup already employed during several studies on FFRs filtration performance. Its high-resolution measuring devices permit to determine filtration performance according to the normative criteria: the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency. Eight different FFRs have been used: four NIOSH-approved FFRs and four not NIOSH-approved with a ‘KN95’ shape available during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The data show a high disparity between different FFRs purchased by healthcare establishments, and between those that are NIOSH-approved and those that are not NIOSH-approved. The results confirm that the NIOSH certification offers good protection according to the normative criteria. The ‘KN95’ types present pressure drops which correspond to the normative value, however their efficiencies are lower than the efficiencies of FFRs certified by NIOSH and lower than 95% at the most penetrate particle size.

The death toll of the current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly biased toward the elderly. However, some studies of crises suggest that older adults tend to perceive events as less stressful than do younger people. Therefore, we examined healthy behavior in populations at risk according to the age cutoff-points used by the Ministry of Health at the time of vaccination, and divided the participants into three age groups (45–59, 60–69, and 70+) following health organizations’ recommendations. METHODS: Participants were 1202 people, 381 males and 821 females, aged 45–90. A survey comprised of six parts was used: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire–short version, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – PANAS, the Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive moods, and questions regarding weight change, based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Data were collected in Israel during the first complete lockdown. The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook using a snowball sampling method. RESULTS: Resilience and negative feelings and depression symptoms were higher in age group 45–59 compared to 70+ year-old participants, and the depression symptoms score was also higher among participants aged 45–59 compared to ages 60–69. Physical activity was associated with higher resilience, fewer depression symptoms, and fewer negative emotions. Regarding gender and psychological variables, no differences were found. During the time of lockdown, weight change was not prevalent and sleeping hours increased. CONCLUSION: In adults at 70+, the physical activity level, physical activity before and during the lockdown, emotions, sleeping hours, and weight change were similar to the other adult groups that were examined (45–59 and 60–69). However, in the older adults groups (70+ and 60–69), resilience and depression symptoms were lower than in the youngest age group.","Zach, Sima; Zeev, Aviva; Ophir, Miki; Eilat-Adar, Sigal",Eur Rev Aging Phys Act,263,16

These include individual training, organizational culture change management, and legislative changes. The importance of relationships and stakeholder engagement in EIDM has led to an evolution of models and approaches including integrated knowledge translation (IKT). IKT has emerged as a key strategy for ensuring that engagement is equitable, demand-driven, and responsive. As a result, the African-German Collaboration for Evidence-Based Healthcare and Public Health in Africa (CEBHA+) incorporated an IKT approach to influence noncommunicable diseases (NCD) policy and practice. We documented the phased process of developing, implementing, and monitoring the IKT approach in South Africa; and explored the appropriateness of using the exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment (EPIS) framework for this purpose. METHODS: We mapped the South Africa IKT approach onto the EPIS framework using a framework analysis approach. Notes of team meetings, stakeholder matrices, and engagement strategies were analysed and purposefully plotted against the four phases of the framework in order to populate the different constructs. We discussed and finalized the analysis in a series of online iterations until consensus was reached. RESULTS: The mapping exercise revealed an IKT approach that was much more iterative, dynamic, and engaging than initially thought. Several constructs (phase-agnostic) remained important and stable across EPIS phases: stable and supportive funding; committed and competent leadership; skilled and dedicated IKT champions; diverse and established personal networks; a conducive and enabling policy environment; and boundary-spanning intermediaries. Constructs such as “innovations” constantly evolved and adapted to the changing inner and outer contexts (phase-specific). CONCLUSIONS: Using the EPIS framework to interrogate, reflect on, and document our IKT experiences proved extremely relevant and useful. Phase-agnostic constructs proved critical to ensure resilience and agility of NCD deliberations and policies in the face of highly dynamic and changing local contexts, particularly in view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Bridging IKT with a framework from implementation science helps to reflect on this process and can guide the development and planning of similar interventions and strategies.","Jessani, Nasreen S.; Rohwer, Anke; Schmidt, Bey-Marrie; Delobelle, Peter",Health Res Policy Syst,263,16

This study explored the trends in opioid dispensing for cancer pain before and during the lockdown. METHODS: The trends were calculated based on an analysis of quantity of all opioids dispensed. March 24, 2020, was considered as a cutoff for analyzing before and during lockdown period dispensing trends. No information regarding individual patients was retrieved in the current study. RESULTS: There was a decrease in total morphine, tramadol, and fentanyl patch dispensing parallel to decrease in total number of patients visiting the outpatient department. However, there was a statistically significant increase in per capita opioid dispensing during the lockdown period. There was also an increase in the proportion of cancer pain patients that were dispensed morphine during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: Despite the lockdown, the palliative care team at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital has continued to provide adequate pain relief to patients that could manage to reach the center. Policy-makers need to be cognizant of the pain relief needs of cancer patients in times when accessing hospitals is becoming increasingly difficult.

Here, we characterized that porcine torovirus (PToV; family Tobaniviridae, order Nidovirales) 3CLpro autocatalytically releases itself from the viral precursor protein by self-cleavage. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that PToV 3CLpro, as a serine protease, employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues. Interestingly, unlike most nidovirus 3CLpro, the P1 residue plays a less essential role in N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro Substituting either P1 or P4 residue of substrate alone has little discernible effect on N-terminal cleavage. Notably, replacement of the two residues together completely blocks N-terminal cleavage, suggesting that N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro is synergistically affected by both P1 and P4 residues. Using a cyclized luciferase-based biosensor, we systematically scanned the polyproteins for cleavage sites and identified (FXXQ&#8595;A/S) as the main consensus sequences. Subsequent homology modeling and biochemical experiments suggested that the protease formed putative pockets S1 and S4 between the substrate. Indeed, mutants of both predicted S1 (D159A, H174A) and S4 (P62G/L185G) pockets completely lost the ability of cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro In conclusion, the characterization of self-processing activities and substrate specificities of PToV 3CLpro will offer helpful information for the mechanism of nidovirus 3C-like proteinase's substrate specificities and the rational development of the antinidovirus drugs.IMPORTANCE Currently, the active-site residues and substrate specificities of 3C-like protease (3CLpro) differ among nidoviruses, and the detailed catalytic mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, porcine torovirus (PToV) 3CLpro cleaves 12 sites in the polyproteins, including its N- and C-terminal self-processing sites. Unlike coronaviruses and arteriviruses, PToV 3CLpro employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues that recognize a glutamine (Gln) at the P1 position. Surprisingly, mutations of P1-Gln impaired the C-terminal self-processing but did not affect N-terminal self-processing. The ""noncanonical"" substrate specificity for its N-terminal self-processing was attributed to the phenylalanine (Phe) residue at the P4 position in the N-terminal site. Furthermore, a double glycine (neutral) substitution at the putative P4-Phe-binding residues (P62G/L185G) abolished the cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro suggested the potential hydrophobic force between the PToV 3CLpro and P4-Phe side chains.","Xu, Shangen; Zhou, Junwei; Chen, Yingjin; Tong, Xue; Wang, Zixin; Guo, Jiahui; Chen, Jiyao; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Xiao, Shaobo",J. virol,263,11

In contrast, vegetarianism was found not to be a protected philosophical belief in Conisbee v Crossley Farms Limited and others. The authors argue that the Employment Tribunal misunderstood the notion of vegetarianism when deciding that it was a ‘life-style choice’. There are different kinds of vegans and vegetarians, each with their own way of practising the philosophy which influences how they live their life. Not all people who follow a meat-free diet should be afforded this protection, and it depends on whether their belief is one which is determined by certain factors, such as animal welfare and environmentalism, rather than for health purposes. The authors explore the arguments and analysis in the above employment cases, coming to the conclusion that the tribunals oversimplified what it means to hold values such as veganism and vegetarianism, failing to understand the differences between different classifications and sub-groups when coming to a decision. The different kinds of vegans and vegetarians and their characteristics are outlined, before determining whether this should constitute protection under employment law, protecting individuals from discrimination. The situation in the USA and Canada regarding this issue is very different, and there are parallels drawn with attempting to establish veganism or vegetarianism as a religion, and where they could benefit from the recent decision in England and Wales. Finally, this paper concludes that ethical and environmental veganism and vegetarianism should both qualify as protected philosophical beliefs, but other kinds may fall short of what is required to satisfy the requirements under law.","McKeown, Paul; Dunn, Rachel Ann",Liverp Law Rev,263,1

Using a population-wide sample of in total N = 482 participants this study aimed to examine whether there are differences in HCC when participants collect the required samples by themselves with the help of a partner in domestic settings compared to professionally collected hair strands in the lab. Potential confounding factors that may affect HCC and might obfuscate the outcomes were considered. The results suggest that the two compared sample collection methods did not significantly differ from each other in terms of HCC (p = 0.307). A somewhat larger sample loss in the domestic setting was observed due to hair samples where HCC could not be determined (5.3 % vs. 1.8 % in the lab). Similarly, in a sample of N = 50 using a within-subjects design (Sample 2) no significant HCC differences between collection methods occurred (p = .206). In addition, potential moderating effects of personality traits of the Five-Factor-Model on the relationship between hair collection method and HCC were investigated. In Sample 1 personality data of the hair donor were available, while in Sample 2 personality data (n = 40) were available for the hair donor and the hair sample collector. Interestingly, none of the Big Five traits significantly moderated the relationship between HCC and hair collection method (all p > .20). Overall, these findings suggest that the self-collection of hair in domestic settings is a viable and economical method for measuring long-term cortisol concentrations in hair.","Enge, S.; Fleischhauer, M.; Hadj-Abo, A.; Butt, F.; Kirschbaum, C.; Schmidt, K.; Miller, R.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,263,16

In an effort to continue to serve the community of people who inject drugs and practice compassionate and non-judgmental care, the students transitioned the clinic to a model of TeleMOUD (medications for opioid use disorder). We describe development and implementation of a medical student-run telemedicine clinic through an academic medical center-operated syringe services program. METHODS: Students advertised TeleMOUD services at the syringe service program on social media and created an online sign-up form. They coordinated appointments and interviewed patients by phone or videoconference where they assessed patients for opioid use disorder. Supervising attending physicians also interviewed patients and prescribed buprenorphine when appropriate. Students assisted patients in obtaining medication from the pharmacy and provided support and guidance during home buprenorphine induction. RESULTS: Over the first 9 weeks in operation, 31 appointments were requested, and 22 initial telehealth appointments were completed by a team of students and attending physicians. Fifteen appointments were for MOUD and 7 for other health issues. All patients seeking MOUD were prescribed buprenorphine and 12/15 successfully picked up medications from the pharmacy. The mean time between appointment request and prescription pick-up was 9.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: TeleMOUD is feasible and successful in providing people who inject drugs with low barrier access to life-saving MOUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. This model also provided medical students with experience treating addiction during a time when they were restricted from most clinical activities.","Castillo, Marcus; Conte, Brianna; Hinkes, Sam; Mathew, Megan; Na, C.

Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942 cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60% ± 0.03%, 85.87% ± 0.54%, 83.75% ± 0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period. Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [≤ 3.2 (x10(3)/μL)], fever (≥38°C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x10(3)/μL)], and elderly (≥ 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96–6.76], 3.17 [95%CI: 2.74–3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44–3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50–2.10], respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can facilitate medical and public health efforts to minimize the health threat of dengue epidemics. However, laboratory confirmation remains the primary goal of surveillance and outbreak investigation.","Ho, Tzong-Shiann; Weng, Ting-Chia; Wang, Jung-Der; Han, Hsieh-Cheng; Cheng, Hao-Chien; Yang, Chun-Chieh; Yu, Chih-Hen; Liu, Yen-Jung; Hu, Chien Hsiang; Huang, Chun-Yu; Chen, Ming-Hong; King, Chwan-Chuen; Oyang, Yen-Jen; Liu, Ching-Chuan",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,263,16

The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected cells express the Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2‐positive neighboring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Interferon‐induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S‐mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell‐free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that SARS‐CoV‐2 pathological effects are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.","Buchrieser, Julian; Dufloo, Jérémy; Hubert, Mathieu; Monel, Blandine; Planas, Delphine; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Planchais, Cyril; Porrot, Françoise; Guivel‐Benhassine, Florence; Van der Werf, Sylvie; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Mouquet, Hugo; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier",EMBO J,263,16

To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences. RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection. In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection. These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected. To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations. Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants. The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes. These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection. The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.","Adami, Cecilia; Pooley, Joan; Glomb, Juliet; Stecker, Eric; Fazal, Fabeha; Fleming, John O.; Baker, Susan C.",Virology,263,5

The virus is distinct its cousins, SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV in term of severity of the infection. The obligated killing properties of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus is mediated by its unique structure. Efforts for developing vaccines for COVID‐19 are ongoing, but it is unlikely to be available in the immediate future. Due to the absence of precise treatment, the investigators are discovering other effective, protective and healing choices. However, the lower than predictable number of SARS‐CoV‐2 cases in countries with fragile health systems is mystifying. Recently, there has been a buzz about the protective effect of BCG vaccine in COVID‐19 through long‐term boosting of trained immunity. Based on epidemiological correlations, we link up that BCG vaccination adopted by different countries might influence the SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission patterns and/or COVID‐19 associated mortality through the vaccine's capacity to confer heterologous protection. A number of clinical studies are underway to investigate this possibility but ‐even if they prove effective‐many questions will remain. Moreover, responsible stewardship of the BCG vaccine in the context of the COVID‐19 epidemic is directly needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.","Islam, Md.

L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates.

However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo.","Weigelt, Carina Marianne; Sehgal, Rohan; Tain, Luke Stephen; Cheng, Jun; Eßer, Jacqueline; Pahl, André; Dieterich, Christoph; Grönke, Sebastian; Partridge, Linda",Mol Cell,263,32

Located at the interface between the endothelium and the blood stream, this highly fragile structure is prone to many disruptive factors such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Shedding of the EG has been described in various acute and chronic diseases characterized by endothelial dysfunction and angiopathy, such as sepsis, trauma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Circulating EG components including syndecan-1, hyaluronan and heparan sulfate are being evaluated in animal and clinical studies as diagnostic and prognostic markers in several pathologies, and advances in microscopic techniques have enabled in vivo assessment of the EG. While research regarding the EG in adult physiology and pathology has greatly advanced throughout the last decades, our knowledge of the development of the glycocalyx and its involvement in pathological conditions in the pediatric population is limited. Current evidence suggests that the EG is present early during fetal development and plays a critical role in vessel formation and maturation. Like in adults, EG shedding has been demonstrated in acute inflammatory conditions in infants and children and chronic diseases with childhood-onset. However, the underlying mechanisms and their contribution to disease manifestation and progression still need to be established. In the future, the glycocalyx might serve as a marker to identify pediatric patients at risk for vascular sequelae and as a potential target for early interventions.","Puchwein-Schwepcke, Alexandra; Genzel-Boroviczény, Orsolya; Nussbaum, Claudia",Front Cell Dev Biol,263,6

METHODS: A prospective, open label, observational study was performed from April 2020 to December 2020 at two COVID Health Centers. A custom-made Excel spreadsheet containing 71 fields covering a spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms was shared with doctors for regular reporting. Cases suitable for PFR were selected. LR was calculated for commonly occurring symptoms. Outlier values with LR ≥5 were identified and variance of LRs was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 1,889 treated cases of confirmed COVID-19, 1,445 cases were selected for pre-specified reasons. Nine medicines, Arsenicum album, Bryonia alba, Gelsemium sempervirens, Pulsatilla nigricans, Hepar sulphuricus, Magnesia muriaticum, Phosphorus, Nux vomica and Belladonna, were most frequently prescribed. Outlier values and large variance for Hepar sulphuricus and Magnesia muriaticum were noticed as indication of bias. Confirmation bias leading to lowering of symptom threshold, keynote prescribing, and deficiency in checking of all symptoms in each case were identified as the most important sources of bias.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on ischemic times in consecutive all-comer STEMI patients. We included consecutive STEMI patients (n = 163, median age: 61 years, 27% women) who were referred to seven tertiary care hospitals across Austria for primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 24 February 2020 (calendar week 9) and 5 April 2020 (calendar week 14).

It is the third zoonotic coronavirus-dependent outbreak in the last twenty years and represents a major infective threat for public health worldwide.

Accordingly, a detailed mechanistic knowledge of the molecular events with which the virus infects cells and induces an immunological response appears necessary. In this review, we will report details of the initial process of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry with major emphasis on the maturation of the spike protein. Then, a particular focus will be devoted to describe the possible mechanisms by which dendritic cells, a major cellular component of innate and adaptive immune responses, may play a role in the spread of the virus in the human body and in the clinical evolution of the disease.","Campana, Pasquale; Parisi, Valentina; Leosco, Dario; Bencivenga, Debora; Della Ragione, Fulvio; Borriello, Adriana",Cells,263,23

Poor oral health exacerbates oral diseases, leading to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases and self-care dependence, particularly in the elderly, worldwide. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) play influential roles in individual oral care. However, the evidence of KAP related to oral care among the elderly is still inadequate. Objective: This study aimed to examine KAP and their associated factors related to oral care among the elderly community. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. The eligible subjects were recruited, using convenience sampling and snowball sampling. Results: A total of 385 elderly individuals were included, and 51.4% were women. The mean age was 71.66 (SD 6.28). Knowledge was reportedly poor, as more than 50% elderly answered several questions incorrectly. The mean attitude and practices scores were 44.94 (SD 6.33) and 68.90 (SD 10.44), respectively. There was a significant correlation among knowledge, attitudes, and practices (p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed numerous factors had remarkably significant association with knowledge [R(2) = 0.30, F (4,380) = 11.96, p < 0.001], attitudes [R(2) = 0.28, F (6,378) = 9.27, p < 0.001], and practices [R(2) = 0.31, F (5,379) = 12.34, p < 0.001], particularly education levels, full-time employment, and self-care independence. Conclusions: Based on the KAP theoretical model, KAP are closely interrelated. Identified factors associated with KAP are useful to understand at-risk groups. Elderly individuals at lower education levels, with poor family support and inadequate self-care independence, have poor KAP related to oral care. Therefore, this study improves insight for health promotion developers, suggesting that more attention should be paid to at-risk elderly groups’ oral health. To enhance participation in dental care and improve oral care performance in the elderly, educational program containing oral health knowledge should be offered to at-risk groups. Family support and involvement are also important for improving oral care among elderly individuals.","Wong, Florence M.F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,263,26

To battle this spread, clinical imaging techniques, for example, computed tomography (CT), can be utilized for diagnosis. Automatic identification software tools are essential for helping to screen COVID-19 using CT images. However, there are few datasets available, making it difficult to train deep learning (DL) networks. To address this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed in this work to generate more CT images. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to optimize the hyperparameters of GAN's generator. The proposed method is tested and validated with different classification and meta-heuristics algorithms using the SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan dataset, consisting of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images. The performance metrics of the proposed optimized model, including accuracy (99.22%), sensitivity (99.78%), specificity (97.78%), F1-score (98.79%), positive predictive value (97.82%), and negative predictive value (99.77%), as well as its confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, indicate that it performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

Around 96 million coronavirus cases have already been identified with over half a million deaths. Despite numerous efforts by the government as well as international organizations, these numbers are still increasing with a surprising rate. Although urgent and absolutely necessary, a reliable therapeutic or vaccine is still elusive and this status quo may remain for an uncertain period of time. Taken that into account, boosting up adaptive immunity through nutritional interventions may help subside this epidemic and save many lives. This review focuses on the nexus between a balanced diet and adaptive immunity, particularly, how a poor diet may lead to compromised immunity resulting in susceptibility to viral infections. Additionally, we discuss how nutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) can be used as a tool to modulate immune response and thus impede viral infections. The study also summarizes nutritional recommendations to combat COVID-19 in different countries and territories as well as dietary sources of those key nutrients. Moreover, different nutritional intervention strategies based on different age groups, physiological and medical conditions were also included, and the challenges of nutritional interventions towards the care of COVID-19 patients are also discussed. Since the availability of a drug or vaccine is still uncertain, a balanced diet or nutrient therapy can be used as a robust strategy to combat COVID-19. Thus, we hope this review may help to make an informed decision with regard to diet choice both at individual level as well as clinical settings.","Alam, Sabiha; Bhuiyan, Farhana Rumzum; Emon, Tanvir Hossain; Hasan, Mahmudul",Heliyon,263,16

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Importance Immune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.","Kruglova, Natalia; Siniavin, Andrei; Gushchin, Vladimir; Mazurov, Dmitriy",bioRxiv,263,1

Molecular biological techniques are permitting a rapid and accurate diagnosis of infections caused by respiratory pathogens, and have typically been applied to upper respiratory samples. Sputum induction provides an opportunity to directly sample secretions from the lower respiratory tract. Objectives/study design: To determine the role of induced sputum reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of respiratory pathogens and compare this with detection using serology and immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) testing, we recruited 49 adults from emergency room with exacerbations of asthma. After a medical assessment and spirometry, sputum was induced using ultrasonically nebulised normal saline. Sputum was assayed using IFA and RT-PCR for flu and RSV. Flu serology was performed acutely and at convalescence, 4–5 weeks later. Results: Influenza A or B was detected in 24% of the samples by PCR, significantly more than the nine cases detected using serology and the one case using IFA (P<0.05). RSV was detected in 37% of samples using PCR and 20% by IFA (P<0.05). Conclusion: The combination of induced sputum and RT-PCR provides a useful means of detecting respiratory infection. The technique is safe in both adults and children, and RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional serology and IFA. The improved sensitivity of induced sputum RT-PCR also permits a more rapid diagnosis and the opportunity of early administration of effective treatments.","Simpson, Jodie L; Moric, Ivana; Wark, Peter A.B; Johnston, Sebastian L; Gibson, Peter G",J Clin Virol,263,20

Studies have found associations between the rising levels of TNF-α and severe COVID-19 cases. Hence, TNF-α blocking can possibly be a favorable intervention in modifying COVID-19. To this end, in order to manage pneumonia caused by COVID-19, adalimumab may potentially be considered as a potential therapeutic agent. The present study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of adalimumab in treating COVID-19 cases in combination therapy with remdesivir and dexamethasone. METHODS: Among the 68 patients who were included in the current randomized controlled trial, 34 were assigned to the adalimumab group and the remaining 34 were assigned to the control group. Adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg, subcutaneous for once, was used for the intervention group. Both the intervention and control groups received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supportive care. The data gathered to make comparisons of the groups included demographic information, the rate of mortality, mechanical ventilation requirement, length of stay in hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the terms of mortality rate (P-value = 1) and mechanical ventilation requirement (P-value = 1). The length of hospital and ICU stay as well as radiologic changes were not affected either (P-value = 1, 0.27, and 0.53, respectively).

From “New York Living for Nuts Only” and “One in Five Here Mentally Fit” to “Scratch a New Yorker, and What Do You Find?” and “City Gets Mental Test, Results are Real Crazy,” the stories highlighted the shocking and, to some, incredible statistics that fewer than one in five (18.5%) Manhattanites had good mental health. Approximately a quarter of them had such bad mental health that they were effectively incapacitated, often unable to work or function socially. The headlines were gleaned from Mental Health in the Metropolis (1962), the first major output of the Midtown Manhattan Study, a large-scale, interdisciplinary project that surveyed the mental health of 1660 white Upper East Side residents between the ages of 20 and 59. One of the most significant social psychiatry projects to emerge following the Second World War, the Midtown Manhattan Study endeavored to “test the general hypothesis that biosocial and sociocultural factors leave imprints on mental health which are discernible when viewed from the panoramic perspective provided by a large population.” Despite initial media and academic interest, however, the Midtown Manhattan Study’s findings were soon forgotten, as American psychiatry turned its focus to individual—rather than population—psychopathology, and turned to the brain—rather than the environment—for explanations. Relying on archival sources, contemporary medical and social scientific literature, and oral history interviews, this article explains why the Midtown Manhattan Study failed to become more influential, concluding that its emphasis on the role of social isolation and poverty in mental illness should be taken more seriously today.","Smith, Matthew",Cult Med Psychiatry,263,30

Abstract John Langdon Down first described this genetic disorder known today as Down syndrome (DS), due to a trisomy of chromosome 21. The frequent appearance of respiratory infections in DS is attributed to structural and functional anomalies of the respiratory system, the presence of congenital heart malformations and IgG deficits. We present three clinical cases of adult DS patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and a review of the literature regarding: epidemiology, prevalence, symptomatology, laboratory and radiographic findings, morbidity, mortality, clinical evolution and the importance of prevention of pneumonia in DS patients. These patients presented symptoms of acute infection of the lower respiratory tract: high fever, scanty productive cough with or without sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and other atypical symptoms. Chest radiography showed focal inflammatory condensation in the affected lung and bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrate. Laboratory tests showed increased values of leukocytes and C-reactive protein, deficiency of IgG and low lymphocyte CD4+. Patients with DS are highly susceptible to lower and higher respiratory tract infection. Community physicians should take exceptional precautions on detecting respiratory symptoms in these patients, since they may result in pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Presentation may be atypical and the complications may even lead to mortality.","Hermida Pérez, J. A.; Hernández Guerra, J. S.",Revista Médica Internacional sobre el Síndrome de Down,263,20

We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ECMO in the treatment of COVID‐19 compared with conventional ventilation support. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected on extremely critical patients with COVID‐19 from January 2020 to March 2020 in intensive care unit of a hospital in charge by national rescue team in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of pandemic. Patients were classified into the ECMO group and the conventional ventilation non‐ECMO group. Clinical characteristics, technical characteristics, laboratory results, mortality, and complications of the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: 88 patients with extremely critical COVID‐19 were screened; 34 received ECMO support and 31 received conventional ventilation support. Both groups had comparable characteristics at baseline in terms of age, gender, and comorbidities. Before ECMO or conventional therapy, patients in the two groups had sever acute respiratory distress syndrome with a mean partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio of 69.6 and 75.4, respectively. At the time of reporting, patients in the ECMO had significantly lower in‐hospital mortality compared with the control group (58.8 vs. 93.5%, p = .001). CONCLUSION: ECMO is shown to decrease the mortality of extremely critical ill COVID‐19 patients compared with the conventional treatment. Although complications occurred frequently, ECMO could still be a rescue therapy for the treatment of COVID‐19 during the pandemic.","Li, Shuanglei; Xiong, Jing; Du, Zhongtao; Lai, Wei; Ma, Xinhua; Feng, Zhichun; Shi, Yuan; Hong, Xiaoyang; Chen, Yundai",J Card Surg,263,24

We aimed to investigate whether increases in the proportion of infections with this variant are associated with differences in symptoms or disease course, reinfection rates, or transmissibility. METHODS: We did an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27, 2020 (during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK). From this dataset, we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection, defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the B.1.1.7 variant across the UK was estimated with use of genomic data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and data from Public Health England on spike-gene target failure (a non-specific indicator of the B.1.1.7 variant) in community cases in England. We used linear regression to examine the association between reported symptoms and proportion of B.1.1.7. We assessed the Spearman correlation between the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases and number of reinfections over time, and between the number of positive tests and reinfections. We estimated incidence for B.1.1.7 and previous variants, and compared the effective reproduction number, R(t), for the two incidence estimates. FINDINGS: From Sept 28 to Dec 27, 2020, positive COVID-19 tests were reported by 36 920 COVID Symptom Study app users whose region was known and who reported as healthy on app sign-up. We found no changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. For the same period, possible reinfections were identified in 249 (0·7% [95% CI 0·6–0·8]) of 36 509 app users who reported a positive swab test before Oct 1, 2020, but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants. Reinfection occurrences were more positively correlated with the overall regional rise in cases (Spearman correlation 0·56–0·69 for South East, London, and East of England) than with the regional increase in the proportion of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant (Spearman correlation 0·38–0·56 in the same regions), suggesting B.1.1.7 does not substantially alter the risk of reinfection. We found a multiplicative increase in the R(t) of B.1.1.7 by a factor of 1·35 (95% CI 1·02–1·69) relative to pre-existing variants. However, R(t) fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns, even in regions with high proportions of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant. INTERPRETATION: The lack of change in symptoms identified in this study indicates that existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the B.1.1.7 variant. In addition, given that there was no apparent increase in the reinfection rate, vaccines are likely to remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.

AAT inhibits host proteases that facilitate viral entry and possesses broad anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Researchers have demonstrated that an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) enhances pro-inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Hence, we wanted to understand the potential anti-inflammatory activities of plasma-derived and recombinant AAT (recAAT) in a model of human total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to a combination of CHO expressed trimeric spike protein and LPS, ex vivo. We confirmed that cytokine production was enhanced in PBMCs within six hours when low levels of LPS were combined with purified spike proteins (“spike”). In the presence of 0.5 mg/mL recAAT, however, LPS/spike-induced TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression and protein release were significantly inhibited (by about 46–50%) relative to LPS/spike alone. Although without statistical significance, recAAT also reduced production of IL-6 and IL-8. Notably, under the same experimental conditions, the plasma-derived AAT preparation Respreeza (used in native and oxidized forms) did not show significant effects. Our findings imply that an early pro-inflammatory activation of human PBMCs is better controlled by the recombinant version of AAT than the human plasma-derived AAT used here. Considering the increasing clinical interest in AAT therapy as useful to ameliorate the hyper-inflammation seen during COVID-19 infection, different AAT preparations require careful evaluation.","Tumpara, Srinu; Gründing, Anna R.; Sivaraman, Kokilavani; Wrenger, Sabine; Olejnicka, Beata; Welte, Tobias; Wurm, Maria J.; Pino, Paco; Kiseljak, Divor; Wurm, Florian M.; Janciauskiene, Sabina",Int J Mol Sci,263,9

Long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional LSTM networks are used to learn and test the original time-series data, and a Gramian angular field and recurrence plot are used to encode time-series data to images, and a BLS is employed for image learning and testing. Finally, to obtain the final classification results, Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (D–S evidence theory) is considered to fuse the probability outputs of the two categories. Through the testing of public datasets, the method proposed in this paper obtains competitive results, compensating for the deficiencies of using only time-series data or images for different types of datasets.","Jin, Xue-Bo; Yang, Aiqiang; Su, Tingli; Kong, Jian-Lei; Bai, Yuting",Sensors (Basel),263,20

However, what happens to the virus after the pandemic subsides has not been fully explored. In this article, we discuss the ways that past and present human viruses have emerged via zoonotic transmission, the mechanisms that they have acquired the ability for effective transmission among humans, the process to sustain a chain of transmission to coexist with humans, and the factors important for complete containment leading to eradication of viruses. These aspects of viral disease may provide clues for the future path that SARS-CoV-2 might take in relation to human infection.","Furuse, Yuki; Oshitani, Hitoshi",Front Microbiol,263,22

The COVID-19 triggers a lung infection with a multiple proinflammatory cytokine storm in severe patients. Without effective and safe treatments, COVID-19 has killed thousands of people, becoming a pandemic. Stem cells have been suggested as a therapy for lung-related diseases. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been successfully tested in some clinical trials in patients with COVID-19. The encouraging results positioned MSCs as a possible cell therapy for COVID-19. The amniotic membrane from the human placenta at term is a valuable stem cell source, including human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs). Interestingly, amnion cells have immunoregulatory, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, hAECs and hAMSCs have been used both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials against respiratory diseases. They have reduced the inflammatory response and restored the pulmonary tissue architecture in lung injury in vivo models. Here, we review the existing data about the stem cells use for COVID-19 treatment, including the ongoing clinical trials. We also consider the non-cellular therapies that are being applied. Finally, we discuss the human amniotic membrane cells use in patients who suffer from immune/inflammatory lung diseases and hypothesize their possible use as a successful treatment against COVID-19.","Riedel, Rodrigo N.; Pérez-Pérez, Antonio; Sánchez-Margalet, Víctor; Varone, Cecilia L.; Maymó, Julieta L.",Stem Cell Res Ther,263,24

METHODS: 105 patients admitted to our hospital with clinical- and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were studied. Data were collected from January 17, 2020 to March 5, 2020. RESULTS: 105 patients (57 male and 48 female) were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Among the 105 patients, 55 (52%) had made short trips to Wuhan during the two weeks before the onset of illness, and these were the first-generation confirmed cases. An exact date of close contact with someone in Wenzhou with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection from Wuhan (the second-generation confirmed cases) could be provided by 38 (36%) patients. Of the remaining patients, six (6%; the third-generation confirmed cases) were familial clusters of the second-generation confirmed cases, three (3%) had no definite epidemiological features, and 16 (15%) were from the same location as for the case report. CONCLUSION: Due to the infectiousness of COVID-19, patients with infections should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible after developing fever symptoms or showing other clinical characteristics or imaging features. With respect to high-risk cases, we must focus on any complications that arise and take effective measures to treat them immediately. This will significantly improve the prognosis of patients with severe infections.","Shi, Ji-Chan; Yu, Zhi-Jie; He, Gui-Qing; Chen, Wei; Ye, Xin-Chun; Wu, Zheng-Xing; Zhu, Xiao-Qu; Pan, Jiao-Zhi; Jiang, Xian-Gao",J Natl Med Assoc,263,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CT findings and laboratory data in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study including consecutive patients presenting to the Reggio Emilia (Italy) province emergency rooms for suspected COVID-19 for one month during the outbreak peak, who underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at presentation and resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Included were 866 patients. Total leukocytes, neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, AST, ALT and LDH increase with worsening parenchymal involvement; an increase in platelets was appreciable with the highest burden of lung involvement. A decrease in lymphocyte counts paralleled worsening parenchymal extension, along with reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure and saturation. After correcting for parenchymal extension, ground-glass opacities were associated with reduced platelets and increased procalcitonin, consolidation with increased CRP and reduced oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary lesions induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with raised inflammatory response, impaired gas exchange and end-organ damage. These data suggest that lung lesions probably exert a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and clinical presentation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis were given a questionnaire consisting of general questions (age, sex, date of symptoms, smoking history, concomitant diseases), questions about the most obvious symptom at presentation (one option only), the severity and frequency of symptoms (general and ENT), and STL (recovery time and degree of recovery). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 172 patients, 18–65 years old (mean age, 37.8 ± 12.5 years; 51.2% female; 76.2% nonsmokers). Cough (n = 30, 17.4%) and loss of sense of smell (n = 18, 10.4%) were the most obvious general and ENT symptoms, respectively. Eighty-eight patients (51.2%) reported loss of sense of smell, and 81 patients (47.1%) reported loss of sense of taste. The mean recovery times for loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were 8.02 ± 6.41 and 8.20 ± 7.07 days, respectively. The loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were the unique symptoms in four (4.54%) and one (1.23%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: STL is a common symptom in COVID-19 and may be the first and/or only symptom of this disease. In patients presenting with STL complaints, surveillance for possible COVID-19 disease and screening tests will facilitate the struggle against the disease.","Sakalli, Erdal; Temirbekov, Dastan; Bayri, Esra; Alis, Esra Ergun; Erdurak, Selcuk Cem; Bayraktaroglu, Mesut",Am J Otolaryngol,263,23

However, the number of undernourished people has resumed growth in the 2010s amid food supply disruptions, economic slowdowns, and protectionist restrictions to agricultural trade. Having been common to most nations, these challenges to the food security status of the population still vary depending on the level of economic development and national income of individual countries. In order to explore the long-run determinants of food supply transformations, this study employs five-stage multiple regression analysis to identify the strengths and directions of effects of agricultural production parameters, income level, price indices, food trade, and currency exchange on supply of calories, proteins, and fats across 11 groups of agricultural products in 1980–2018. To address the diversity of effects across developing nations, the study includes 99 countries of Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa categorized as low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income economies. It is found that in low-income countries, food supply parameters are more strongly affected by production factors compared to economic and trade variables. The effect of economic factors on the food supply of higher-value food products, such as meat and dairy products, fruit, and vegetables, increases with the rise in the level of income, but it stays marginal for staples in all three groups of countries. The influence of trade factors on food supply is stronger compared to production and economic parameters in import-dependent economies irrelevant of the gross national income per capita. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the research on how food supply patterns and their determinants evolve in the course of economic transformations in low-income countries.","Erokhin, Vasilii; Diao, Li; Gao, Tianming; Andrei, Jean-Vasile; Ivolga, Anna; Zong, Yuhang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,263,33

AIM: To describe COVID-19 containment in a nursing home transformed into a caring center. METHODS: Physicians and nurses were recruited. The facility was reorganized and connected with the laboratory of the reference hospital. Ultrasound was used to diagnose pneumonia. Patients needing intensive care were transferred to the reference hospital. Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin/enoxaparin were used initially, while amiodarone/enoxaparin were used at a later phase. Under both regimens, methylprednisolone was added for severe cases. Prophylaxis was done with hydroxychloroquine initially and then with amiodarone. Period covered: March 22–July 31, 2020. RESULTS: The facility was reorganized in two days. Ninety-two guests of the 121 (76%) and 25 personnel of 118 (21.1%) became swab test positive. Seven swab test negative patients who developed symptoms were considered to have COVID-19. Twenty-seven patients died, 23 swab test positive, 5 of whom after full recovery. Four patients needing intensive care were transferred (3 died).

In total we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a meta-analysis of both case-control panels. Results. We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5x10-8) in the meta-analysis of both study panels, odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.14x10-10 and OR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95x10-8), respectively.

Humic-like components are often called as carriers of biological activity of shilajit. The goal of this study was to evaluate anti-HIV activity of well characterized HS isolated from coal, peat, and peloids, and compare it to that of water-soluble organic matter (OM) isolated from different samples of Shilajit. The set of humic materials included 16 samples of different fractional composition: humic acid (HA), hymatomelanic acid (HMA), fulvic acid (FA). The set of shilajit OM included 19 samples of different geographic origin and level of alteration. The HIV-1 p24 antigen assay and cell viability test were used for assessment of antiviral activity. The HIV-1 Bru strain was used to infect CEM-SS cells. The obtained EC50 values varied from 0.37 to 1.4 mg·L(-1) for the humic materials, and from 14 to 142 mg·L(-1) for the shilajit OM. Hence, all humic materials used in this study outcompeted largely the shilajit materials with respect to anti-HIV activity: For the humic materials, the structure-activity relationships revealed strong correlation between the EC50 values and the content of aromatic carbon indicating the most important role of aromatic structures. For shilajit OM, the reverse relationship was obtained indicating the different mechanism of shilajit activity. The FTICRMS molecular assignments were used for ChEMBL data mining in search of the active humic molecules. As potential carriers of antiviral activity were identified aromatic structures with alkyl substituents, terpenoids, N-containing analogs of typical flavonoids, and aza-podophyllotoxins. The conclusion was made that the typical humic materials and Shilajit differ greatly in molecular composition, and the humic materials have substantial preferences as a natural source of antiviral agents as compared to shilajit.","Zhernov, Yury V.; Konstantinov, Andrey I.; Zherebker, Alexander; Nikolaev, Eugene; Orlov, Alexey; Savinykh, Mikhail I.; Kornilaeva, Galina V.; Karamov, Eduard V.; Perminova, Irina V.",Environ Res,263,29

From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements. With strong representation from across the country and the support of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the authors have attempted to provide guidance to their colleagues on the subjects of leadership roles that cardiac surgeons may assume during this pandemic: patient assessment and triage, risk reduction, and real-time sharing of expertise and experiences. A visual abstract of the main principles underlying our recommended approach is provided in Figure 1.","Hassan, Ansar; Arora, Rakesh C.; Adams, Corey; Bouchard, Denis; Cook, Richard; Gunning, Derek; Lamarche, Yoan; Malas, Tarek; Moon, Michael; Ouzounian, Maral; Rao, Vivek; Rubens, Fraser; Tremblay, Philippe; Whitlock, Richard; Moss, Emmanuel; Légaré, Jean-François",Can J Cardiol,263,24

The indoor environments of multi-zone and multi-story buildings are affected differently by outdoor particles compared with single-family houses, because of the buildings’ more complicated airflow characteristics. The objective of this study is to analyze outdoor particle penetration and transport, and their impact on indoor air, in a multi-zone and multi-story building using a CONTAMW simulation. For the airflow and particle transport analysis, the building leakage, penetration coefficients, and deposition rates were determined by on-site experiments. The results of airflow simulations for cold winters show that outdoor air infiltrates through the lower part of building and exfiltrates from the upper part. The results of the particle simulation also indicated that the airflow characteristics, combined with deposition rates, cause the lower floors of a multi-story building to be exposed to higher fine particle concentrations compared with the upper floors of the building. The study demonstrated that the CONTAMW simulation can be useful in analyzing the impact of outdoor particles on indoor environments through the identification of key particle transport parameters and validated airflow simulations.","Lee, Byung Hee; Yee, Su Whan; Kang, Dong Hwa; Yeo, Myoung Souk; Kim, Kwang Woo",Build Simul,263,22

Among the natural compounds that produce beneficial effects on human health, polyphenols have shown potential therapeutic applications in cancer due to their protective functions in plants, their use as food additives, and their excellent antioxidant properties. The possibility of combining conventional drugs—which are usually more aggressive than natural compounds—with polyphenols offers very valuable advantages such as the building of more efficient anticancer therapies with less side effects on human health. This review shows a wide range of trials in which polyphenolic compounds play a crucial role as anticancer medicines alone or in combination with other drugs at different stages of cancer: cancer initiation, promotion, and growth or progression. Moreover, the future directions in applications of various polyphenols in cancer therapy are emphasized.","Montané, Xavier; Kowalczyk, Oliwia; Reig-Vano, Belen; Bajek, Anna; Roszkowski, Krzysztof; Tomczyk, Remigiusz; Pawliszak, Wojciech; Giamberini, Marta; Mocek-Płóciniak, Agnieszka; Tylkowski, Bartosz",Molecules,263,16

In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model for the main proteinase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then we used this pharmacophore model to search NCI 3D database including 250, 251 compounds and identified 30 existing drugs containing the pharmacophore query. Among them are six compounds that already exhibited anti-SARS-CoV activity experimentally. This means that our pharmacophore model can lead to the discovery of potent anti-SARS-CoV inhibitors or promising lead compounds for further SARS-CoV main proteinase inhibitor development.","Zhang, Xue Wu; Yap, Yee Leng; Altmeyer, Ralf M.",Eur J Med Chem,263,24
