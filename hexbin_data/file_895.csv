75609,"[Development, operational dilemma and tentative idea for construction mechanism of fever clinic in China].",2020-03-01,"Total hip replacement (THR) is a very common procedure undertaken in up to 285 000 Americans each year. Patient satisfaction with THR is very high, with improvements in general health, quality of life, and function while at the same time very cost effective. Although the majority of patients have a high degree of satisfaction with their THR, 27% experience some discomfort, and up to 6% experience severe chronic pain. Although it can be difficult to diagnose the cause of the pain in these patients, this clinical issue should be approached systematically and thoroughly. A detailed history and clinical examination can often provide the correct diagnosis and guide the appropriate selection of investigations, which will then serve to confirm the clinical diagnosis made.","Lanting, B A; MacDonald, S J",The bone & joint journal,https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.95b11.32948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24187357/,895
