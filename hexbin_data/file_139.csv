293,Diagnosis and management of drug-associated interstitial lung disease,2004-08-31,"Symptoms of drug-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) are nonspecific and can be difficult to distinguish from a number of illnesses that commonly occur in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on therapy. Identification of drug involvement and differentiation from other illnesses is problematic, although radiological manifestations and clinical tests enable many of the alternative causes of symptoms in advanced NSCLC to be excluded. In lung cancer patients, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is more sensitive than a chest radiograph in evaluating the severity and progression of parenchymal lung disease. Indeed, the use of HRCT imaging has led to the recognition of many distinct patterns of lung involvement and, along with clinical signs and symptoms, helps to predict both outcome and response to treatment. This manuscript outlines the radiology of drug-associated ILD and its differential diagnosis in NSCLC. An algorithm that uses clinical tests to exclude alternative diagnoses is also described.","Müller, N L; White, D A; Jiang, H; Gemma, A",Br J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750814/,139

861,Prognosis of hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza in Spain: influence of neuraminidase inhibitors,2012-03-30,"BACKGROUND: The H1N1 influenza pandemic strain has been associated with a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients. The present report evaluates the factors influencing prognosis. METHODS: A total of 813 patients hospitalized with H1N1 influenza in 36 hospitals (nationwide) in Spain were analysed. Detailed histories of variables preceding hospital admission were obtained by interview, validating data on medications and vaccine with their attending physicians. Data on treatment and complications during hospital stay were recorded. As definition of poor outcome, the endpoints of death and admission to intensive care were combined; and as a further outcome, length of stay was used. RESULTS: The mean age was 38.5 years (SD 22.8 years). There were 10 deaths and 79 admissions to intensive care (combined, 88). The use of neuraminidase inhibitors was reported by 495 patients (60.9%). The variables significantly associated with a poor outcome were diabetes (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.21–4.02), corticosteroid therapy (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.39–8.20) and use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.14–6.36), while the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34–0.94) was protective. Neuraminidase inhibitors within the first 2 days after the influenza onset reduced hospital stay by a mean of 1.9 days (95% CI = 4.7–6.6). CONCLUSIONS: The use of neuraminidase inhibitors decreases the length of hospital stay and admission to intensive care and/or death.","Delgado-Rodríguez, Miguel; Castilla, Jesús; Godoy, Pere; Martín, Vicente; Soldevila, Nuria; Alonso, Jordi; Astray, Jenaro; Baricot, Maretva; Cantón, Rafael; Castro, Ady; Gónzález-Candelas, Fernando; Mayoral, José María; Quintana, José María; Pumarola, Tomás; Tamames, Sonia; Sáez, Marc; Domínguez, Angela",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370819/,139
1130,ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas Axis in Brain: A Potential Target for Prevention and Treatment of Ischemic Stroke,2013-03-11,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in brain is a crucial regulator for physiological homeostasis and diseases of cerebrovascular system, such as ischemic stroke. Overactivation of brain Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - Angiotensin II (Ang II) - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis was found to be involved in the progress of hypertension, atherosclerosis and thrombogenesis, which increased the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Besides, brain Ang II levels have been revealed to be increased in ischemic tissues after stroke, and contribute to neural damage through elevating oxidative stress levels and inducing inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere via AT(1)R. In recent years, new components of RAS have been discovered, including ACE2, Angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1-7)] and Mas, which constitute ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-(1-7), and Ang-(1-7) binds with its receptor Mas, exerting benefical effects in cerebrovascular disease. Through interacting with nitric oxide and bradykinin, Ang-(1-7) could attenuate the development of hypertension and the pathologic progress of atherosclerosis. Besides, its antithrombotic activity also prevents thrombogenic events, which may contribute to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. In addition, after ischemia insult, ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas has been shown to reduce the cerebral infarct size and improve neurological deficits through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, activation of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis may become a novel therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of ischemia stroke, which deserves further investigations.","Jiang, Teng; Gao, Li; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Ying-Dong",Curr Neuropharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637674/,139
1131,Baicalein Reduces Airway Injury in Allergen and IL-13 Induced Airway Inflammation,2013-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Baicalein, a bioflavone present in the dry roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, is known to reduce eotaxin production in human fibroblasts. However, there are no reports of its anti-asthma activity or its effect on airway injury. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a standard experimental asthma model, male Balb/c mice that were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA), treated with baicalein (10 mg/kg, ip) or a vehicle control, either during (preventive use) or after OVA challenge (therapeutic use). In an alternate model, baicalein was administered to male Balb/c mice which were given either IL-4 or IL-13 intranasally. Features of asthma were determined by estimating airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), histopathological changes and biochemical assays of key inflammatory molecules. Airway injury was determined with apoptotic assays, transmission electron microscopy and assessing key mitochondrial functions. Baicalein treatment reduced AHR and inflammation in both experimental models. TGF-β(1), sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell metaplasia, were also reduced. Furthermore, baicalein treatment significantly reduced 12/15-LOX activity, features of mitochondrial dysfunctions, and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that baicalein can attenuate important features of asthma, possibly through the reduction of airway injury and restoration of mitochondrial function.","Mabalirajan, Ulaganathan; Ahmad, Tanveer; Rehman, Rakhshinda; Leishangthem, Geeta Devi; Dinda, Amit Kumar; Agrawal, Anurag; Ghosh, Balaram; Sharma, Surendra Kumar",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639905/,139
1258,Therapy and prophylaxis of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients: a guideline by the German and Austrian AIDS societies (DAIG/ÖAG) (AWMF 055/066),2013-09-14,"INTRODUCTION: There was a growing need for practical guidelines for the most common OIs in Germany and Austria under consideration of the local epidemiological conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The German and Austrian AIDS societies developed these guidelines between March 2010 and November 2011. A structured Medline research was performed for 12 diseases, namely Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus manifestations, candidiasis, herpes simplex virus infections, varizella zoster virus infections, progressive multifocal leucencephalopathy, cryptosporidiosis, cryptococcosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria infections and tuberculosis. Due to the lack of evidence by randomized controlled trials, part of the guidelines reflects expert opinions. The German version was accepted by the German and Austrian AIDS Societies and was previously published by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften (AWMF; German Association of the Scientific Medical Societies). CONCLUSION: The review presented here is a translation of a short version of the German–Austrian Guidelines of opportunistic infections in HIV patients. These guidelines are well-accepted in a clinical setting in both Germany and Austria. They lead to a similar treatment of a heterogeneous group of patients in these countries.","Thoden, J.; Potthoff, A.; Bogner, J. R.; Brockmeyer, N.

1653,Autopsy analyses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,2014-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is associated with high mortality. However, few studies have so far reviewed analyses of autopsy findings in patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 consecutive patients with AE-IPF who underwent autopsies at five university hospitals and one municipal hospital between 1999 and 2013. The following variables were abstracted from the medical records: demographic and clinical data, autopsy findings and complications during the clinical course until death. RESULTS: The median age at autopsy was 71 years (range 47–86 years), and the subjects included 38 (73.1%) males. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated in 45 (86.5%) patients after AE-IPF. The underling fibrotic lesion was classified as having the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in all cases. Furthermore, 41 (78.8%) patients had diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), 15 (28.8%) exhibited pulmonary hemorrhage, nine (17.3%) developed pulmonary thromboembolism and six (11.5%) were diagnosed with lung carcinoma. In addition, six (11.5%) patients developed pneumothorax prior to death and 26 (53.1%) developed diabetes that required insulin treatment after the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. In addition, 15 (28.8%) patients presented with bronchopneumonia during their clinical course and/or until death, including fungal (seven, 13.5%), cytomegalovirus (six, 11.5%) and bacterial (five, 9.6%) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological findings in patients with AE-IPF represent not only DAD, but also a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, making a diagnosis of AE-IPF is often difficult, and the use of cautious diagnostic approaches is required for appropriate treatment.","Oda, Keishi; Ishimoto, Hiroshi; Yamada, Sohsuke; Kushima, Hisako; Ishii, Hiroshi; Imanaga, Tomotoshi; Harada, Tatsuhiko; Ishimatsu, Yuji; Matsumoto, Nobuhiro; Naito, Keisuke; Yatera, Kazuhiro; Nakazato, Masamitsu; Kadota, Jun-ichi; Watanabe, Kentaro; Kohno, Shigeru; Mukae, Hiroshi",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243719/,139
1678,Novel PDE4 Inhibitors Derived from Chinese Medicine Forsythia,2014-12-30,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a crucial intracellular second messenger molecule that converts extracellular molecules to intracellular signal transduction pathways generating cell- and stimulus-specific effects. Importantly, specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) subtypes control the amplitude and duration of cAMP-induced physiological processes and are therefore a prominent pharmacological target currently used in a variety of fields. Here we tested the extracts from traditional Chinese medicine, Forsythia suspense seeds, which have been used for more than 2000 years to relieve respiratory symptoms. Using structural-functional analysis we found its major lignin, Forsynthin, acted as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting PDE4 in inflammatory and immune cell. Moreover, several novel, selective small molecule derivatives of Forsythin were tested in vitro and in murine models of viral and bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and cytokine-driven systemic inflammation. Thus, pharmacological targeting of PDE4 may be a promising strategy for immune-related disorders characterized by amplified host inflammatory response.","Coon, Tiffany A.; McKelvey, Alison C.; Weathington, Nate M.; Birru, Rahel L.; Lear, Travis; Leikauf, George D.; Chen, Bill B.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4280171/,139
2401,Bibliometric analysis of global scientific research on carbapenem resistance (1986–2015),2016-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health challenge and carbapenem resistance, in particular, is considered an urgent global health threat. This study was carried out to give a bibliometric overview of literature on carbapenem resistance. In specific, number of publications, top productive countries and institutes, highly cited articles, citation analysis, co-authorships, international collaboration, top active authors, and journals publishing articles on carbapenem resistance were analyzed and discussed. METHODS: Specific keywords pertaining to carbapenem resistance were used in Scopus database. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of retrieved data were presented using appropriate bibliometric indicators and visualization maps. RESULTS: A total of 2617 journal articles were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was of 21.47. The growth of publications showed a dramatic increase from 2008 to 2015. Approximately 9 % of retrieved articles on carbapenem resistance were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal. Retrieved articles were published by 102 different countries. The United States of America (USA) contributed most with 437 (16.70 %) articles followed by China with 257 (9.82 %) articles. When productivity was stratified by population size, Greece ranked first followed by France. Greece also ranked first when data were stratified by gross domestic product (GDP). Asian countries have lesser international collaboration compared with other countries in the top ten list. Five of top ten productive institutes were Europeans (France, the UK, Greece, Italy, and Switzerland) and two were Asians (China and South Korea). Other active institutes included an Israeli and a Brazilian institute. Four of the top ten cited articles were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal and two were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. CONCLUSION: There was a dramatic increase in number of publications on carbapenem resistance in the past few years. These publications were produced from different world regions including Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Latin America. International collaboration needs to be encouraged particularly for researchers in Asia. Molecular biology and epidemiology dominated the theme of the top ten cited articles on carbapenem resistance. This bibliometric study will hopefully help health policy makers in planning future research and allocating funds pertaining to carbapenem resistance.","Sweileh, Waleed M.; Shraim, Naser Y.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; AbuTaha, Adham S.; Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035509/,139
3705,An outbreak of leptospirosis with predominant cardiac involvement: a case series,2019-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Severe leptospirosis is known to cause multi organ dysfunction including cardiac involvement. In the clinical setting with limited resources, high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose cardiac involvement including myocarditis. Although myocarditis is not reported as a common complication due to lack of diagnostic facilities, there are evidence to support myocarditis is more prevalent in post mortem studies of patients died due to leptospirosis. We present a case series of severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement observed during a period of one month at Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here five patients with severe leptospirosis complicated with cardiac involvement, admitted to a single medical ward, Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka during a one-month period. Out of six suspected leptospirosis patients admitted during that period, five in a raw developed severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement. In this case series, four patients were confirmed serologically or quantitative PCR and one patient had possible leptospirosis. All patients developed shock during their course of illness. Two patients developed rapid atrial fibrillation. One patient had dynamic T wave changes in ECG and the other two had sinus tachycardia. Two patients had evidence of myocarditis in 2D echocardiogram, whereas other two patients had nonspecific findings and one patient had normal 2D echocardiogram. All five patients had elevated cardiac troponin I titre and it was normalized with the recovery. All five patients developed acute kidney injury. Four patients needed inotropic/vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure and one patient recovered from shock with fluid resuscitation. All patients were recovered from their illness and repeat 2D echocardiograms after recovery did not show residual complications. One patient had serologically proven dengue co-infection with leptospirosis. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in leptospirosis may be overlooked due to non-specific clinical findings and co-existing multi-organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to micro-geographic variation and unusual outbreak of leptospirosis. Co-infection of dengue with leptospirosis should be considered in managing patients especially in endemic areas.","Jayathilaka, P. G. N. S.; Mendis, A. S. V.; Perera, M. H. M. T. S.; Damsiri, H. M.

3884,High antistreptolysin O titer is associated with coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease,2018-11-07,"PURPOSE: In Kawasaki disease (KD) patients, coronary artery complications, incomplete and refractory types occur more frequently in patients with streptococcal or other bacterial/viral infections. Recently, we observed a higher incidence of coronary lesions in KD patients with high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer. Therefore, we hypothesized that KD patients diagnosed with concurrent streptococcal infection have poor prognoses, with respect to treatment response and development of coronary artery lesions. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 723 patients with KD who were admitted to 2 major hospitals between June 2010 and September 2017. RESULTS: Among 723 patients with KD, 11 initially showed an elevated ASO titer (>320 IU/mL) or elevated follow-up ASO titer after treatment. Of these patients, 5 showed no response to the first intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, 3 had abnormalities of the coronary arteries. This is a significantly higher proportion of patients with a high ASO titer (n=3, 27.3%) than those with a normal ASO titer (n=53 [7.4%], P=0.047). A severe clinical course was seen in 81.8% of patients in the high ASO group versus 14.5% of patients in the normal ASO group. CONCLUSION: It is not certain whether acute streptococcal infection may cause KD, but this study revealed that KD with high ASO titers showed higher rates of severe clinical course. It may be helpful to analyze concurrent streptococcal infection in patients with a severe clinical course.","Min, Dong Eun; Kim, Do Hee; Han, Mi Young; Cha, Sung Ho; Yoon, Kyung Lim",Korean J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6584233/,139
3959,Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation in Children with Benign Disorders: Improved Survival and Cost-Effective Care Over 15 Years from a Single Center in India,2019-01-28,"We present our experience in haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo SCT) in children with benign disorders. We performed a retrospective study where children aged up to 18 years diagnosed to have benign disorders and underwent haplo SCT from 2002 to September 2017 were included. Of the 54 children, the most common indications were Fanconi anaemia 12 (22%), severe aplastic anaemia 8 (14%) and primary immune deficiency disorders (PID) 25 (46%). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was used in 41 (75.9%) and ex vivo T depletion in 13 (24.1%). Engraftment rates were 70% with acute graft versus host disease in 36% and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 55% children. There was a statistically significant difference found between survival with siblings as donors as compared to parents (p value 0.018). Overall survival was 60% which is the 1-year survival, with 68% survival among those with PIDs. Cytokine release syndrome was noted in 12/41 (29%) of children who received T replete graft and PTCy. In children over 6 months of age, PTCy at a cost of INR 1200 provides cost effective T cell depletion comparable with TCR α/β depletion priced at INR 1200,000. Haplo SCT is feasible option for cure in children with benign disorder.","Uppuluri, Ramya; Sivasankaran, Meena; Patel, Shivani; Swaminathan, Venkateswaran Vellaichamy; Ravichandran, Nikila; Ramanan, Kesavan Melarcode; Vaidhyanathan, Lakshman; Ramakrishnan, Balasubramaniam; Jayakumar, Indira; Raj, Revathi",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6646640/,139
4650,Effects of Pidotimod on recurrent respiratory infections in children with Down syndrome: a retrospective Italian study,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: The “END-of-Life ScorING-System” (ENDING-S) was previously developed to identify patients at high-risk of dying in the ICU and to facilitate a practical integration between palliative and intensive care. The aim of this study is to prospectively validate ENDING-S in a cohort of long-term critical care patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult long-term ICU patients (with a length-of-stay> 4 days) were considered for this prospective multicenter observational study. ENDING-S and SOFA score were calculated daily and evaluated against the patient’s ICU outcome. The predictive properties were evaluated through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled for this study. Among these, 21.46% died during the ICU stay. ENDING-S correctly predicted the ICU outcome in 71.4% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values associated with the previously identified ENDING-S cut-off of 11.5 were 68.1, 72.3, 60 and 89.3%, respectively. ROC-AUC for outcome prediction was 0.79 for ENDING-S and 0.88 for SOFA in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: ENDING-S, while not as accurately as in the pilot study, demonstrated acceptable discrimination properties in identifying long-term ICU patients at very high-risk of dying. ENDING-S may be a useful tool aimed at facilitating a practical integration between palliative, end-of-life and intensive care.

5047,Development of ulcerative colitis under the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine,1992,"The attachment of specific antibody to viral glycoproteins and other structures on the surface of a virus or virus-infected cell has a number of potential consequences to the virus or virus-infected cell. Antibody is multivalent and thus able to redistribute or patch surface viral proteins or virus-encoded structures within the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope or the cell membrane. In certain instances, antibody may agglutinate viruses or virus-infected cells. The physical presence of antibody molecules on the virus surface may interfere with the ability of the virus to infect potentially susceptible cells. Antibody on the surface of virus-infected cells may prevent the maturation and release of virus particles; antibody also can alter certain normal cell functions. The Fc portions of antibody molecules bound to virus-infected cells facilitate interactions with effector cells bearing Fc receptors. In the case of lymphocytes and perhaps phagocytic cells, this interaction may lead to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [51, 58]. The exposed Fc regions may also facilitate attempts at ingestion by monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.","Cooper, Neil R.; Nemerow, Glen R.",Springer Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087538/,139

Much of the insight into LDL metabolism has been gained through the study of Mendelian disorders of lipid metabolism. Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) are now being used to identify novel genes and loci that contribute to variations in LDL-C levels, and they have identified the SORT1 gene as an important modulator of LDL-C levels and ASCVD risk. Mechanistic studies in mice and cell culture also suggest that the SORT1 gene is an important regulator of lipoprotein metabolism; however, these studies disagree on the directionality of the effect of Sort1 expression on plasma lipids and the mechanism for the lipid changes.

5720,Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome,2020-03-14,"In this article we review the current knowledge of the effects of urban expansion on bats and assess the potential of these mammals as bioindicators of urbanization. The response of bats to this process is highly species-specific: some species tolerate urban habitat or are even favoured by its roosting or foraging opportunities, others are affected by the loss or fragmentation of key natural habitat, or by the physical and chemical pollution associated with urbanization. Species responses generally translate into altered community structures, with few markedly dominating species. We propose different hypothetical models of bat fitness along an urbanization gradient and discuss why bat population density may not be an effective fitness proxy to assess the reactions of these mammals to urban expansion. We also suggest that urban habitat may act as an ecological trap even for apparently synurbic species. Overall, bat sensitivity to urbanization makes these mammals promising candidates to track the effects of this process of land use change on the biota, but more studies, specifically tailored to explore this role, are needed.","Russo, Danilo; Ancillotto, Leonardo",Mamm Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094881/,139

6744,Invasive streptococcal infections,2001,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is considered a classic Old World etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). HFRS is considered to be distinct from hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary syndrome (HPS or HCPS), described in the New World. Here, we report a severe case, which fulfilled most, if not all, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HPS, needing non-invasive ventilation and subsequent acute hemodialysis. However, the etiological agent was PUUV, as proved by serological testing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing. Viral antigen was detected by specific anti-PUUV immunostaining, showing, for the first time, greenish intracytoplasmic inclusions in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages. This case definitely confirms that HPS can be encountered during PUUV infections. Interestingly, special findings could render the diagnosis easier, such as greenish homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions, surrounded by a fine clear halo in BAL macrophages. Therefore, although the diagnosis remains difficult before the onset of renal involvement, the occurrence of severe respiratory failure mimicking community-acquired pneumonia must alert the clinician for possible HPS, especially in endemic areas.","Gizzi, M.; Delaere, B.; Weynand, B.; Clement, J.; Maes, P.; Vergote, V.; Laenen, L.; Hjelle, B.; Verroken, A.; Dive, A.; Michaux, I.; Evrard, P.; Creytens, D.; Bulpa, P.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102061/,139

This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty(s) (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty(r) (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps(d) nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection. Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella. These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens.","Fallon, Michael T.; Schoeb, Trenton R.; Benjamin, William H.; Lindsey, J.Russell; Briles, David E.",Microb Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127339/,139

9962,Amplified rhinovirus colds in atopic subjects,2006-04-27,"Objectives To determine if a ventilator available in an emergency department could quickly be modified to provide ventilation for four adults simultaneously. Methods Using lung simulators, readily available plastic tubing, and ventilators (840 Series Ventilator; Puritan‐Bennett), human lung simulators were added in parallel until the ventilator was ventilating the equivalent of four adults. Data collected included peak pressure, positive end‐expiratory pressure, total tidal volume, and total minute ventilation. Any obvious asymmetry in the delivery of gas to the lung simulators was also documented. The ventilator was run for almost 12 consecutive hours (5.5 hours of pressure control and more than six hours of volume control). Results Using readily available plastic tubing set up to minimize dead space volume, the four lung simulators were easily ventilated for 12 hours using one ventilator. In pressure control (set at 25 mm H(2)O), the mean tidal volume was 1,884 mL (approximately 471 mL/lung simulator) with an average minute ventilation of 30.2 L/min (or 7.5 L/min/lung simulator). In volume control (set at 2 L), the mean peak pressure was 28 cm H(2)O and the minute ventilation was 32.5 L/min total (8.1 L/min/lung simulator). Conclusions A single ventilator may be quickly modified to ventilate four simulated adults for a limited time. The volumes delivered in this simulation should be able to sustain four 70‐kg individuals. While further study is necessary, this pilot study suggests significant potential for the expanded use of a single ventilator during cases of disaster surge involving multiple casualties with respiratory failure.","Neyman, Greg; Irvin, Charlene Babcock",Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164837/,139

Chemokines constitute a group of bioactive peptides that regulate leukocyte migration and also contribute to activation of these cells. Chemokines are essential mediators of inflammation and important for control of viral infections. The profile of chemokine expression contributes to shaping the immune response during viral infection, whereas viral subversion of the chemokine system allows the virus to evade antiviral activities of the host. In this review, we discuss the role of chemokines in host‐defense against virus infections, and we also look deeper into the virus‐cell interactions that trigger chemokine expression as well as the cellular signaling cascades involved.","Melchjorsen, Jesper; Sørensen, Louise N.; Paludan, Søren R.",J Leukoc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166880/,139

Although a number of studies have reported the usefulness of I-ASV, the clinical situations in which it may be useful have not yet been clarified. We aimed to report our initial 3 years of experience using I-ASV, particularly the clinical conditions and the technical and organizational factors associated with its use. Furthermore, we evaluated the usefulness of I-ASV and determined the predictive factors for successful management with I-ASV. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective observational study included patients who were ventilated using the Hamilton G5® ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, Rhäzüns, Switzerland) from January 2016 to December 2018. The patients were categorized into the “I-ASV success” group and “I-ASV failure” group (those receiving mechanical ventilation with I-ASV along with any other mode). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with successful I-ASV management. RESULTS: Of the 189 patients, 135 (71.4%) were categorized into the I-ASV success group. In the I-ASV success group, the reasons for ICU admission included post-elective surgery (94.1%), post-emergent surgery (81.5%), and other medical reasons (55.6%). I-ASV failure was associated with a low P/F ratio (278 vs. 167, P = 0.0003) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (21 vs. 26, P < 0.0001). The main reasons for not using I-ASV included strong inspiratory effort and asynchrony. The APACHE II score was an independent predictive factor for successful management with I-ASV, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidential interval 0.87–0.96, P = 0.0006). The area under the receiver operating curve for the APACHE II score was 0.722 (cut-off: 24). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that 71.4% of the fully mechanically ventilated patients could be managed successfully with I-ASV. The APACHE II score was an independent factor that could help predict the successful management of I-ASV. To improve I-ASV management, it is necessary to focus on patient-ventilator interactions.","Katayama, Shinshu; Tonai, Ken; Shima, Jun; Koyama, Kansuke; Nunomiya, Shin",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183105/,139
11325,Peanut Oral Immunotherapy: a Current Perspective,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Early mortality in ruptured abdominal aneurysm (rAAA) is high, but data on long-term outcome are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome in survivors after open surgery for rAAA in well-defined population. METHODS: This is a population-based, observational long-term follow-up (beyond 30-day mortality) study of patients surgically treated for rAAA from 2000 through 2014. Long-term survival was analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared to the general population by analyses of relative survival. RESULTS: Out of 178 patients operated for rAAA, 95 patients (55%) either died in the perioperative period, were referred from other hospitals or were lost to follow-up (two patients). Altogether 83 patients were eligible for long-term outcomes: 72 men and 11 women. Estimated median crude survival time was 6.5 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8–8.2]. Men had a median survival of 7.3 years (95% CI 5.1–9.4) versus 5.4 years in females (95% CI 3.5–7.3) (P = 0.082). Reinterventions during follow-up occurred in 31 (37%). Relative survival demonstrated a slightly higher risk of death in the rAAA population compared to the general age- and gender-matched population. Age, but not comorbidities, had a significant influence on long-term survival. CONCLUSION: For survivors beyond 30 days after surgery for rAAA, long-term survival compares well to that of an age- and sex-matched population. A high frequency of cardiovascular comorbidities did not seem to affect long-term survival.","Reite, Andreas; Søreide, Kjetil; Kvaløy, Jan Terje; Vetrhus, Morten",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223706/,139

Given that other serotypes of hypervirulent FAdVs have also been reported in poultry around the world, a common ELISA for all serotypes within the group I fowl adenoviruses (FAdV-I) is urgently needed, especially for clinical epidemic serotypes. In this study, we used high purity and concentration virions of FAdV-4 and developed a common ELISA for detecting antibodies against 12 FAdV-I serotypes. The developed ELISA was able to distinguish between antibodies against FAdV-I, FAdV-III, and other heterologous viruses without any cross-reaction. Furthermore, the ELISA showed higher sensitivity than the FAdV-1-based ELISA to the novel FAdV-4 found in China. Moreover, since there are no commercial vaccines against FAdVs in China, the ELISA was applied to detect sera samples from specific pathogen-free chickens inoculated with inactivated FAdV-1, FAdV-4, and FAdV-8a. The assay showed high sensitivities for all three detected serotypes within FAdV-I. In conclusion, a novel, common ELISA for FAdV-I was developed in this study and could be a powerful tool for seroepidemiological investigations and FAdVs vaccine development.","Pan, Qing; Wang, Jing; Gao, Yulong; Cui, Hongyu; Liu, Changjun; Qi, Xiaole; Zhang, Yanping; Wang, Yongqiang; Li, Kai; Gao, Li; Wang, Xiaomei",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223807/,139
11462,Response Measures to Infection Outbreaks During the Second Year of Sustenance Phase of Infection Control Quality Improvement,2020-02-08,"HBV infection initiates hepatitis B and promotes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. IFN-α is commonly used in hepatitis B therapy, but how it inhibits HBV is not fully understood. We screened 285 human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) for anti-HBV activity using a cell-based assay, which revealed several anti-HBV ISGs. Among these ISGs, SAMD4A was the strongest suppressor of HBV replication. We found the binding site of SAMD4A in HBV RNA, which was a previously unidentified Smaug recognition region (SRE) sequence conserved in HBV variants. SAMD4A binds to the SRE site in viral RNA to trigger its degradation. The SAM domain in SAMD4A is critical for RNA binding and the C-terminal domain of SAMD4A is required for SAMD4A anti-HBV function. Human SAMD4B is a homolog of human SAMD4A but is not an ISG, and the murine genome encodes SAMD4. All these SAMD4 proteins suppressed HBV replication when overexpressed in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that knocking out the Samd4 gene in hepatocytes led to a higher level of HBV replication in mice and AAV-delivered SAMD4A expression reduced the virus titer in HBV-producing transgenic mice. In addition, a database analysis revealed a negative correlation between the levels of SAMD4A/B and HBV in patients. Our data suggest that SAMD4A is an important anti-HBV ISG for use in IFN therapy of hepatitis B and that the levels of SAMD4A/B expression are related to HBV sensitivity in humans.","Wang, Yuze; Fan, Xinrui; Song, Yunlong; Liu, Yifei; Liu, Ruixin; Wu, Jianfeng; Li, Xiaoling; Yuan, Quan; Fu, Guo; Xia, Ningshao; Han, Jiahuai",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223975/,139
12471,DNMT3A mutations mediate the epigenetic reactivation of the leukemogenic factor MEIS1 in acute myeloid leukemia,2017-07-20,"Trace deposition timing reflects a novel concept in forensic molecular biology involving the use of rhythmic biomarkers for estimating the time within a 24-h day/night cycle a human biological sample was left at the crime scene, which in principle allows verifying a sample donor’s alibi. Previously, we introduced two circadian hormones for trace deposition timing and recently demonstrated that messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers significantly improve time prediction accuracy. Here, we investigate the suitability of metabolites measured using a targeted metabolomics approach, for trace deposition timing. Analysis of 171 plasma metabolites collected around the clock at 2-h intervals for 36 h from 12 male participants under controlled laboratory conditions identified 56 metabolites showing statistically significant oscillations, with peak times falling into three day/night time categories: morning/noon, afternoon/evening and night/early morning. Time prediction modelling identified 10 independently contributing metabolite biomarkers, which together achieved prediction accuracies expressed as AUC of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.90 for these three time categories respectively. Combining metabolites with previously established hormone and mRNA biomarkers in time prediction modelling resulted in an improved prediction accuracy reaching AUCs of 0.85, 0.89 and 0.96 respectively. The additional impact of metabolite biomarkers, however, was rather minor as the previously established model with melatonin, cortisol and three mRNA biomarkers achieved AUC values of 0.88, 0.88 and 0.95 for the same three time categories respectively. Nevertheless, the selected metabolites could become practically useful in scenarios where RNA marker information is unavailable such as due to RNA degradation. This is the first metabolomics study investigating circulating metabolites for trace deposition timing, and more work is needed to fully establish their usefulness for this forensic purpose.","Lech, Karolina; Liu, Fan; Davies, Sarah K.; Ackermann, Katrin; Ang, Joo Ern; Middleton, Benita; Revell, Victoria L.; Raynaud, Florence J.; Hoveijn, Igor; Hut, Roelof A.; Skene, Debra J.; Kayser, Manfred",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748410/,139

Despite thrombo-inflammation underlying these co-morbidities, its pathogenesis remains complicated and drug discovery programs aimed at reducing and resolving the detrimental effects remain a major therapeutic challenge. The objective of this study was to assess whether the anti-inflammatory pro-resolving protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1) was able to reduce inflammation-induced thrombosis and suppress platelet activation and thrombus formation in the cerebral microvasculature. Using two distinct models of pathological thrombo-inflammation (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sickle transgenic mice (STM)), thrombosis was induced in the murine brain using photoactivation (light/dye) coupled with intravital microscopy. The heightened inflammation-induced microvascular thrombosis present in these two distinct thrombo-inflammatory models was inhibited significantly by the administration of AnxA1 mimetic peptide AnxA1(Ac2-26) (an effect more pronounced in the SCD model vs. the endotoxin model) and mediated by the key resolution receptor, Fpr2/ALX. Furthermore, AnxA1(Ac2-26) treatment was able to hamper platelet aggregation by reducing platelet stimulation and aggregation (by moderating α(IIb)β(3) and P-selectin). These findings suggest that targeting the AnxA1/Fpr2/ALX pathway represents an attractive novel treatment strategy for resolving thrombo-inflammation, counteracting e.g., stroke in high-risk patient cohorts.","Vital, Shantel A.; Senchenkova, Elena Y.; Ansari, Junaid; Gavins, Felicity N.

Negative social media experiences may modify depressive symptoms among LGB persons. We sought to assess the potential influence of negative social media experiences on the association between LGB orientation and depression. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential influence of negative social media experiences on the association between LGB orientation and depression. METHODS: We performed a web-based survey of a national sample of US young adults aged 18-30 years. We assessed the respondents’ LGB orientation, negative social media experiences, and depression using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used generalized structural equation modeling to assess both the direct and indirect effects (via negative social media experiences) of LGB orientation on depression while controlling for relevant demographic and personal characteristics. RESULTS: We found a conditional indirect effect (ab path) of LGB orientation on depressive symptoms via negative social media experience (a: observed coefficient 0.229; P<.001; bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% CI 0.162-0.319, and b: observed coefficient 2.158; P<.001; bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% CI 1.840-2.494). The results show that among LGB respondents, for those who reported negative social media experiences in the past year, a 1 unit increase in these experiences was associated with a 0.494 unit increase in depressive symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher rates of depression among LGB young adults are partially explained by negative social media experiences; these results could help inform future patient/provider conversations about mental health risk and protective factors related to social media use. Reducing these experiences and increasing positive social media experiences among LGB persons may mitigate depressive symptomatology in this population.","Escobar-Viera, César G; Shensa, Ariel; Sidani, Jaime; Primack, Brian; Marshal, Michael P",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746493/,139

Earlier evidence indicates that the nuclear Charme isoform, named pCharme, acts on the chromatin by assisting the formation of chromatin domains where myogenic transcription occurs. By combining RNA antisense purification (RAP) with mass spectrometry and loss-of-function analyses, we have now identified the proteins that assist these chromatin activities. These proteins—which include a sub-set of splicing regulators, principally PTBP1 and the multifunctional RNA/DNA binding protein MATR3—bind to sequences located within the alternatively spliced intron-1 to form nuclear aggregates. Consistent with the functional importance of pCharme interactome in vivo, a targeted deletion of the intron-1 by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach in mouse causes the release of pCharme from the chromatin and results in cardiac defects similar to what was observed upon knockout of the full-length transcript.","Desideri, Fabio; Cipriano, Andrea; Petrezselyova, Silvia; Buonaiuto, Giulia; Santini, Tiziana; Kasparek, Petr; Prochazka, Jan; Janson, Giacomo; Paiardini, Alessandro; Calicchio, Alessandro; Colantoni, Alessio; Sedlacek, Radislav; Bozzoni, Irene; Ballarino, Monica",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7773549/,139

This also means youths have a voice in the development of youth center offerings. The participatory health research approach can support accomplishing this mandate. OBJECTIVES: As a consequence of the municipal youth congress’s demand for more autonomy so-called “Autonomous Openings” (AO) – the opening of youth centers by the youths themselves and spending their time independently – were implemented in Braunschweig, Germany. Participatory research methods were used to scientifically support the center’s youths and professionals in evaluating the AOs. This paper reports on one of three contributing youth centers. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: After each AO the adolescents reflected on their experiences by filling in a questionnaire jointly developed by researchers and professionals. The survey was accessible via the digital tool “Mentimeter”. The professionals’ perspective was captured in interviews. Topics such as revealing one’s personal interests and the development of competencies were the main interest. The gathered data was assessed by the researchers and reflected upon together with youths and professionals during a workshop. RESULTS: Ten AOs took place throughout a period of ten months. Five adolescents were preliminary responsible and about another 20 were co-responsible. The results show that young people revealed their own interests more substantially. Moreover, the professionals observed a strengthening of competencies in various fields. Several factors were identified that can facilitate transferability to other youth centers.

Treatments remain unsatisfactory due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying host–pathogen interactions during infection. In the present study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify key macrophage modules and hub genes associated with mycobacterial infection. WGCNA was performed combining our own transcriptomic results using Mycobacterium aurum-infected human monocytic macrophages (THP1) with publicly accessible datasets obtained from three types of macrophages infected with seven different mycobacterial strains in various one-to-one combinations. A hierarchical clustering tree of 11,533 genes was built from 198 samples, and 47 distinct modules were revealed. We identified a module, consisting of 226 genes, which represented the common response of host macrophages to different mycobacterial infections that showed significant enrichment in innate immune stimulation, bacterial pattern recognition, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Moreover, by network analysis applied to the 74 genes with the best correlation with mycobacteria infection, we identified the top 10 hub-connecting genes: NAMPT, IRAK2, SOCS3, PTGS2, CCL20, IL1B, ZC3H12A, ABTB2, GFPT2, and ELOVL7.

Our aim was to evaluate for the effect of prematurity-related morbidity on ANS development in preterm infants in the NICU. METHODS: We compared time and frequency domains of heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of ANS tone in 56 preterm infants from 2 NICUs (28 from each). One cohort was from a high-morbidity regional referral NICU, the other from a community-based inborn NICU with low prematurity-related morbidity. Propensity score matching was used to balance the groups by a 1:1 nearest neighbor design. ANS tone was analyzed. RESULTS: The two cohorts showed parallel maturational trajectory of the alpha 1 time-domain metric, with the cohort from the high-morbidity NICU having lower autonomic tone. The maturational trajectories between the two cohorts differed in all other time-domain metrics (alpha 2, RMS1, RMS2). There was no difference between groups by frequency-domain metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity-associated morbidities correlate with autonomic development in premature infants and may have a greater impact on the extrauterine maturation of this system than birth gestational age. IMPACT: Autonomic nervous system development measured by time-domain metrics of heart rate variability correlate with morbidities associated with premature birth. This study builds upon our previously published work that showed that development of autonomic tone was not impacted by gestational age at birth. This study adds to our understanding of autonomic nervous system development in a preterm extrauterine environment. Our study suggests that gestational age at birth may have less impact on autonomic nervous system development than previously thought.","Schlatterer, Sarah D.; Govindan, Rathinaswamy B.; Barnett, Scott D.; Al-Shargabi, Tareq; Reich, Daniel A.; Iyer, Sneha; Hitchings, Laura; Larry Maxwell, G.; Baker, Robin; du Plessis, Adre J.; Mulkey, Sarah B.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922721/,139

According to individual researcher's reports, the atmospheric loading of anthropogenic air pollutants is currently on an alarming increase in Nigeria. Greater concerns are premised on the inadequacy existing emission inventories, continuous assessment, political will and development of policy plans for effective mitigation of these pollutants. The identified key drivers of these emissions include gas flaring, petroleum product refining, thermal plants for electricity generation, transportation, manufacturing sector, land use changes, proliferation of small and medium enterprises, medical wastes incineration, municipal waste disposal, domestic cooking, bush burning and agricultural activities such as land cultivation and animal rearing. Having identified the key sources of anthropogenic air emissions and established the rise in their atmospheric levels through aggregation of literature reports, this study calls for a review of energy policy, adoption of best practices in the management air emissions and solid wastes as well as agriculture and land use pattern which appear to be the rallying points of all identified sources of emission. The study concluded that the adoption of cleaner energy policies and initiatives in energy generation and usage as against pursuit of thermal plants and heavy dependence on fossil fuels will assist to ameliorate the atmospheric loadings of these pollutants.","Okedere, Oyetunji O.; Elehinafe, Francis B.; Oyelami, Seun; Ayeni, Augustine O.",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938250/,139

This was a retrospective cohort study of three independent cohorts of critically ill patients from the United States and Scandinavia consisting of adults with septic shock. We compared the 30-day mortality across the blood types within each cohort and pooled the results in a meta-analysis. We also estimated the incidence of AKI and degree of endothelial damage, as measured by blood concentrations of soluble thrombomodulin and syndecan-1. RESULTS: We included 12,342 patients with severe sepsis. In a pooled analysis blood type B carried a slightly lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality compared to non-blood type B (adjusted HR 0.88; 95%-CI 0.79–0.98; p = 0.02). There was no difference in the risk of AKI. Soluble thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 concentrations were lower in patients with blood type B and O compared to blood type A, suggesting less endothelial damage. CONCLUSION: Septic patients with blood type B had less endothelial damage, and a small reduction in mortality. The exposure is, however, unmodifiable.

METHODS: A matched case–control study was conducted. The involving participants were from the hard-hit areas 10 years after the Wenchuan earthquake. The collected information includes demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, behaviour habits, earthquake exposure, perceived social support, physical health and mental health. Mental health status was measured using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Respondents with PCL-C score ⩾38 were classified as cases, and then the cases and controls were matched based on age (±3 years) and community location according to a ratio of 1:3. RESULTS: We obtained 86 cases and 258 controls. After controlling for confounding factors, it was found that lower income (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.16–5.03), chronic diseases (OR 3.00; 95% CI 1.31–6.88) and death of immediate families in the earthquake (OR 7.30; 95% CI 2.36–22.57) were significantly associated with long-term PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSION: Even 10 years after the Wenchuan earthquake, the survivors in the hard-hit areas still suffered from severe mental trauma. Low income, chronic diseases and death of immediate families in the earthquakes are significantly associated with long-term PTSD symptoms. Interventions by local governments and health institutions to address these risk factors should be undertaken to promote the health of survivors.","Lu, Bingqing; Zeng, Wenqi; Li, Zhuyue; Wen, Jin",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061289/,139
17415,PerFECT 2.0: A Web-Based Platform Designed to Facilitate and Support the Diagnosis of Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in Italy,2021-05-11,"The implantation of a biomaterial quickly initiates a tissue repair program initially characterized by a neutrophil influx. During the acute inflammatory response, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and secrete soluble signals to modulate the tissue environment. In this work, we evaluated chloroquine diphosphate, an antimalarial with immunomodulatory and antithrombotic effects, as an electrospun biomaterial additive to regulate neutrophil-mediated inflammation. Electrospinning of polydioxanone was optimized for rapid chloroquine elution within 1 h, and acute neutrophil-biomaterial interactions were evaluated in vitro with fresh human peripheral blood neutrophils at 3 and 6 h before quantifying the release of NETs and secretion of inflammatory and regenerative factors. Our results indicate that chloroquine suppresses NET release in a biomaterial surface area–dependent manner at the early time point, whereas it modulates signal secretion at both early and late time points. More specifically, chloroquine elution down-regulates interleukin 8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase nine secretion while up-regulating hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and IL-22 secretion, suggesting a potential shift toward a resolving neutrophil phenotype. Our novel repurposing of chloroquine as a biomaterial additive may therefore have synergistic, immunomodulatory effects that are advantageous for biomaterial-guided in situ tissue regeneration applications.","Fetz, Allison E.; Wallace, Shannon E.; Bowlin, Gary L.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8111017/,139

Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in rural China. This study aims to determine whether a primary care-based integrated mobile health intervention (SINEMA intervention) could improve stroke management in rural China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Based on extensive barrier analyses, contextual research, and feasibility studies, we conducted a community-based, two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment in Hebei Province, rural Northern China including 1,299 stroke patients (mean age: 65.7 [SD:8.2], 42.6% females, 71.2% received education below primary school) recruited from 50 villages between June 23 and July 21, 2017. Villages were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or control arm (usual care). In the intervention arm, village doctors who were government-sponsored primary healthcare providers received training, conducted monthly follow-up visits supported by an Android-based mobile application, and received performance-based payments. Participants received monthly doctor visits and automatically dispatched daily voice messages. The primary outcome was the 12-month change in systolic blood pressure (BP). Secondary outcomes were predefined, including diastolic BP, health-related quality of life, physical activity level, self-reported medication adherence (antiplatelet, statin, and antihypertensive), and performance in “timed up and go” test. Analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat framework at the individual level with clusters and stratified design accounted for by following the prepublished statistical analysis plan. All villages completed the 12-month follow-up, and 611 (intervention) and 615 (control) patients were successfully followed (3.4% lost to follow-up among survivors). The program was implemented with high fidelity, and the annual program delivery cost per capita was US$24.3. There was a significant reduction in systolic BP in the intervention as compared with the control group with an adjusted mean difference: −2.8 mm Hg (95% CI −4.8, −0.9; p = 0.005). The intervention was significantly associated with improvements in 6 out of 7 secondary outcomes in diastolic BP reduction (p < 0.001), health-related quality of life (p = 0.008), physical activity level (p < 0.001), adherence in statin (p = 0.003) and antihypertensive medicines (p = 0.039), and performance in “timed up and go” test (p = 0.022). We observed reductions in all exploratory outcomes, including stroke recurrence (4.4% versus 9.3%; risk ratio [RR] = 0.46, 95% CI 0.32, 0.66; risk difference [RD] = 4.9 percentage points [pp]), hospitalization (4.4% versus 9.3%; RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.32, 0.62; RD = 4.9 pp), disability (20.9% versus 30.2%; RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.53, 0.79; RD = 9.3 pp), and death (1.8% versus 3.1%; RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.28, 0.96; RD = 1.3 pp). Limitations include the relatively short study duration of only 1 year and the generalizability of our findings beyond the study setting. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a primary care-based mobile health intervention integrating provider-centered and patient-facing technology was effective in reducing BP and improving stroke secondary prevention in a resource-limited rural setting in China.

17939,Challenges and Opportunities in Social Media Research in Gastroenterology,2021-05-29,"Background: Extubation failure (EF) can lead to an increased chance of ventilator-associated pneumonia, longer hospital stays, and a higher mortality rate. This study aimed to develop and validate an accurate machine-learning model to predict EF in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: Patients who underwent extubation in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database were included. EF was defined as the need for ventilatory support (non-invasive ventilation or reintubation) or death within 48 h following extubation. A machine-learning model called Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) was developed based on 89 clinical and laboratory variables. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to evaluate feature importance and the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to select key features. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using an automated machine-learning toolkit (Neural Network Intelligence). The final model was trained based on key features and compared with 10 other models. The model was then prospectively validated in patients enrolled in the Cardiac Surgical ICU of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. In addition, a web-based tool was developed to help clinicians use our model. Results: Of 16,189 patients included in the MIMIC-IV cohort, 2,756 (17.0%) had EF. Nineteen key features were selected using the RFE algorithm, including age, body mass index, stroke, heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, temperature, pH, central venous pressure, tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, pressure support ventilation (PSV) level, mechanical ventilation (MV) durations, spontaneous breathing trial success times, urine output, crystalloid amount, and antibiotic types. After hyperparameter optimization, our model had the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.835) in internal validation. Significant differences in mortality, reintubation rates, and NIV rates were shown between patients with a high predicted risk and those with a low predicted risk. In the prospective validation, the superiority of our model was also observed (AUROC: 0.803). According to the SHAP values, MV duration and PSV level were the most important features for prediction. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study developed and prospectively validated a CatBoost model, which better predicted EF in ICUs than other models.","Zhao, Qin-Yu; Wang, Huan; Luo, Jing-Chao; Luo, Ming-Hao; Liu, Le-Ping; Yu, Shen-Ji; Liu, Kai; Zhang, Yi-Jie; Sun, Peng; Tu, Guo-Wei; Luo, Zhe",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165178/,139

The control group was taught with a traditional lecture-based learning method and the experimental group was taught using a blended learning method. The two groups were compared after training to assess their theoretical and practical differences. A student satisfaction survey was given to participants in both groups. RESULTS: The results of the experimental group’s theoretical and practical assessments were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the control group. The student satisfaction survey showed that blended learning was significantly more effective for acquiring relevant knowledge, enhancing student-centered learning and improving clinical practice.

Blood Adv. 2019;3(8):1285-1297.",2019-06-05,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital anomalies (CAs) are a major cause of infant mortality, childhood morbidity and long-term disability. Over 130 000 children born in Europe every year will have a CA. This paper describes the EUROlinkCAT study, which is investigating the health and educational outcomes of children with CAs for the first 10 years of their lives. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: EUROCAT is a European network of population-based registries for the epidemiological surveillance of CAs. EUROlinkCAT is using the EUROCAT infrastructure to support 22 EUROCAT registries in 14 countries to link their data on births with CAs to mortality, hospital discharge, prescription and educational databases. Once linked, each registry transforms their case data into a common data model (CDM) format and they are then supplied with common STATA syntax scripts to analyse their data. The resulting aggregate tables and analysis results are submitted to a central results repository (CRR) and meta-analyses are performed to summarise the results across all registries. The CRR currently contains data on 155 594 children with a CA followed up to age 10 from a population of 6 million births from 1995 to 2014. ETHICS: The CA registries have the required ethics permissions for routine surveillance and transmission of anonymised data to the EUROCAT central database. Each registry is responsible for applying for and obtaining additional ethics and other permissions required for their participation in EUROlinkCAT. DISSEMINATION: The CDM and associated documentation, including linkage and standardisation procedures, will be available post-EUROlinkCAT thus facilitating future local, national and European-level analyses to improve healthcare. Recommendations to improve the accuracy of routinely collected data will be made. Findings will provide evidence to inform parents, health professionals, public health authorities and national treatment guidelines to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children with a view to reducing health inequalities in Europe.","Morris, Joan K; Garne, Ester; Loane, Maria; Barisic, Ingeborg; Densem, James; Latos-Bieleńska, Anna; Neville, Amanda; Pierini, Anna; Rankin, Judith; Rissmann, Anke; de Walle, Hermien; Tan, Joachim; Given, Joanne Emma; Claridge, Hugh",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240574/,139

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020205675). A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and gray literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English language with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, comparing the caries arrest potential of SDF with ART in primary teeth and first permanent molars in children. The risk of bias and quality assessment of the studies was done using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Data analysis was performed using RevMan software; the outcomes were summarized in meta-analysis (MA) using the random-effects model, and the odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed. RESULTS: A total of 1059 studies were identified, out of which 562 remained after removal of duplicates. Eight studies were considered for full-text eligibility, and four studies were included in the qualitative review. Three out of four studies were conducted on primary dentition, whereas one study was done on erupting first permanent molars in children. MA of the two studies compared 30% SDF with ART in primary molars at 12 months and revealed the OR to be 2.02 (95% CI: 0.86–4.71; I(2) = 62%; P = 0.10). CONCLUSION: The current review points to the lack of solid evidence comparing SDF with ART for arresting active caries in primary teeth, especially in the first permanent molars. No statistically significant difference between 30% SDF and ART in primary molars at 12 months was found in the present review. Well-designed RCTs are required to determine a minimum concentration of SDF which is effective and safe for caries arrest in children.","Wakhloo, Tulika; Reddy, Srinivas Gosla; Sharma, Suresh K; Chug, Ashi; Dixit, Ashutosh; Thakur, Kalpana",J Int Soc Prev Community Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352060/,139

The first part of this paper overviews the theoretical innovations of the last decades regarding the interpretation of cause-specific mortality dynamics, often referred to as epidemiological transition theories, and their relevance for the analysis of mortality inequalities. The paper then analyses the cause-specific trends of mortality for two educational classes between 1971 and 2008. The trends were corrected for changes in the coding system and divided into linear (stagnating, increasing or decreasing) periods. Causes of death were grouped according to the relationship between the sequences of these periods for the two educational classes. The 57 causes of death were finally clustered into six groups. One group, which is dominated by nutrition-related and cardiovascular diseases, is largely responsible for the onset of mortality inequalities in 1980. The results imply that the quality of nutrition has diverged for the educational classes since 1980, and this fact has left its footprint on the pattern of mortality. The history of food production and availability seems to be in line with nutrition-related mortality, and it is argued that nutrition transition theory provides a very plausible explanatory framework for the growth of mortality inequalities.","Kovács, Katalin",Mortality in an International Perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114985/,139

We review advances in sepsis and ARDS resulting from omics studies, including those involving genome-wide association, gene expression, targeted proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. We focus on promising evidence of biological subtypes in both sepsis and ARDS that consistently display high risk for death. In sepsis, a gene expression signature with dysregulated adaptive immune signaling has evidence for a differential response to systemic steroid therapy, whereas in ARDS, a hyperinflammatory pattern identified in plasma using targeted proteomics responded more favorably to randomized interventions including high positive end-expiratory pressure, volume conservative fluid therapy, and simvastatin therapy. These early examples suggest heterogeneous biology that may be challenging to detect by clinical factors alone and speak to the promise of a precision approach that targets the right treatment at the right time to the right patient.","Rogers, Angela J.; Meyer, Nuala J.","Precision in Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120471/,139

To date, six different astroviruses have been identified in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys, ducklings, pigeons, and guinea fowl; and TAstrovirus-2-like viruses have also been found in guinea fowl. Astroviruses are commonly associated with enteric disease syndromes in poultry including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), and enteritis in guinea fowl. The molecular characterization of the different avian astroviruses shows great genetic variability among each type, and this variability influences the ability to detect these viruses by molecular and serological techniques.

25720,Mechanisms of Acute Liver Failure,2013-10-29,"Whether gender influences the outcome of severe sepsis remains a matter of debate. Because many confounding variables may affect observed associations between gender and mortality, high-quality statistical analyses are essential to carefully adjust the two groups of patients. About 55% to 65% of patients with sepsis have chronic co-morbidities associated with immune dysfunction (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and alcohol abuse), which increase the susceptibility to sepsis [1]. Genetic polymorphisms that affect the susceptibility to infection and/or the severity of the systemic response to infection [2] may lead to variability among individuals and between males and females [3]. Access to healthcare, another determinant of the incidence and outcome of sepsis, varies according to age, ethnic group, and gender, although a recent study conducted in the USA found only relatively small quality-of-care differences between males and females or across income groups compared to the gap for each subgroup between observed and desirable quality of health care [4]. Here, we review the data on the existence of, and reasons for, associations between gender and outcome of severe sepsis (Fig. 1).","Adrie, C.; Azoulay, E.; Timsit, J. -F.",Intensive Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122393/,139

Probiotics can protect the host against several health threats, including infectious diseases. Before 1995, researchers believed that the effect of probiotics was only on gut microbiota which can restore the gut flora and thus prevent pathogenic bacteria from triggering gastroenteritis. Recent studies have shown that the immunomodulatory activity is the most important mechanism of action of probiotics. From this information, researchers started to evaluate the effect of some immunobiotics, not only on pathogenic bacteria but also on viruses, including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several studies have confirmed the potential antiviral activity of some probiotics due to the immunomodulatory effect. These studies were conducted on humans (clinical trials) and in animal models. In this chapter, probiotics with antiviral effect against respiratory and enteric viruses will be presented and discussed, as well as their mechanisms of action.","AL KASSAA, Imad",New Insights on Antiviral Probiotics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122849/,139
26150,Differential Diagnosis of Asthma,2019-02-23,"Severe noninfectious adverse events (AEs) and transmission of pathogens by plasma-derived protein concentrates from the very beginning of their clinical use were threats for recipients (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-68038-5_11 for additional information). “Standard IgG” preparations were the first available for clinical use. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception. Noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001). Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities. This in turn resulted in a paradigm shift how the modern plasma industry operates (Steinhardt 1998).","Späth, Peter J.",Antibody Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122986/,139
26483,Rituximab-Related Pulmonary Toxicity,2010-08-19,"Susan Sontag revealed how a disease could be turned into a metaphor in social evolution, from merely a disease of the body to moral judgment or even political oppression. In her article “AIDS and its Metaphors” written in 1989, she offers a plan to do away with the metaphor: “With this illness, one that elicits so much guilt and shame, the effort to detach it from these meanings, these metaphors, seems particularly liberating, even consoling. But the metaphors cannot be distanced just by abstaining from them. They have to be exposed, criticized, belabored, used up” (Songtag 2003). In Sontag’s terms, “metaphor” mainly refers to the symbolic social oppression of the diseases. For example, cancer is a metaphor for the defect of the sick person in personality. While diseases were a biological phenomenon, the “metaphor” was a social one. What I would like to demonstrate here was none other than the related “political metaphor” started by the “anti-germ warfare.”","Hu, Yi",Rural Health Care Delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123395/,139
26571,Risks and Epidemiology of Infections After Lung or Heart–Lung Transplantation,2016-02-15,"One of the most critical events of birth is the conversion of the fluid-filled lung, unimportant to fetal intrauterine existence, into a hollow organ distended with air and capable of gaseous exchange sufficient to support life. Indeed, it has been argued that the major determinant of perinatal survival is respiratory function (Wigglesworth and Desai 1982). The failure to make this conversion adequately may lead, directly or indirectly, to infant death, and the pathologist often needs to assess the contribution made by respiratory inadequacy to the sequence of events leading to death. In the preterm infant, problems are mainly related to pulmonary immaturity and associated therapy. In the mature infant, birth asphyxia primarily results in cerebral damage but can engender significant respiratory complications when associated with aspiration of meconium. Even in stillbirths, where primary pulmonary pathology is rarely a cause of death, lung pathology may provide clues to antecedent events. Poor lung growth and maturation may point to the presence of pathology elsewhere. Consequently, adequate pathological investigation of the fetal or infant respiratory system is critical in any perinatal autopsy.","Gould, Steve J.",Fetal and Neonatal Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123513/,139

26755,"Antigenicity, Immunogenicity, Allergenicity",2015-11-03,"A person under investigation (PUI) is defined as a patient who presents with both clinical and epidemiological risk factors for a specific infectious disease. In the case of infectious diseases that present risks of transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients, the use of the identify-isolate-inform framework is essential to protect staff and patients and the delivery of safe and effective care. This includes early identification of PUIs, institution of appropriate transmission-based precautions including use of specific personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation, and prompt notification of relevant personnel, including relevant experts and authorities. Depending on the specific infection suspected, once appropriate infection control measures have been implemented, clinical evaluation of PUIs can vary in complexity. In the case of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the need for specialized PPE and training, well-developed procedures, and dedicated space can be extremely resource-intensive and costly for facilities. In addition, depending upon the need to reduce risks to other patients and HCWs, regular laboratory and imaging equipment may not be available (or available at the standard frequency or turnaround time) to support medical care. Lastly, diagnostic tests needed to confirm the diagnosis may not be available at the healthcare facility and may instead be accessible through public health authorities. This testing may take several days to confirm the diagnosis or rule out the presence of the suspected infection. Thus, the potential period of evaluation for a PUI can extend well beyond a typical clinic or emergency department (ED) visit. Thoughtful and coordinated planning efforts are required across the community and across the hospital to be able to adequately care for the PUI.","Biddinger, Paul D.; Shenoy, Erica S.",Bioemergency Planning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123748/,139

34158,Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Lung Disease: Cardiac Considerations,2020-06-10,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen that can cause clinical and subclinical endometritis in humans and animals. In this study, a designed CSαβ peptide ID13 from DLP4 exhibited high stable antibacterial activity in simulated gastric fluid (90.79%), serum (99.54%), and different pH buffers (> 99%) against S. aureus CVCC 546 and lower cytotoxicity (89.62% viability) than its parent peptide DLP4 (74.14% viability) toward mouse endometrial epithelial cells (MEECs). ID13 caused a depolarization of bacterial membrane and downregulation of the expression of genes involved in membrane potential maintenance and biofilm formation. The in vitro efficacy analysis of ID13 showed a synergistic effect with vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin; intracellular antimicrobial activity against S. aureus CVCC 546 in MEECs; and the ability to inhibit lipoteichoic acid-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines from RAW 264.7. In the S. aureus-induced endometritis of mice, similar to vancomycin, ID13 remarkably alleviated pathological conditions, inhibited the production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-10), and suppressed the TLR2-NF-κB signal pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that ID13 could be a potential candidate peptide for therapeutic application in S. aureus-induced endometritis.

No data have been published on individual abortion experiences or preferences of this understudied population. OBJECTIVE(S): To fill existing evidence gaps on the abortion experiences and preferences of TGE people in the United States to inform policies and practices to improve access to and quality of abortion care for this population. STUDY DESIGN: In 2019, we recruited TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth and aged 18 years and older from across the United States to participate in an online survey about sexual and reproductive health recruited through The PRIDE Study and online postings. We descriptively analyzed closed- and open-ended survey responses related to pregnancy history, abortion experiences, preferences for abortion method, recommendations to improve abortion care for TGE people, and respondent sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: The majority of the 1,694 respondents were less than 30 years of age. Respondents represented multiple gender identities and sexual orientations and resided across all four United States Census Regions. Overall, 210 (12%) respondents had ever been pregnant; these 210 reported 421 total pregnancies, of which 92 (22%) ended in abortion. For respondents’ most recent abortion, 41 (61%) were surgical, 23 (34%) were medication, and 3 (4.5%) used another method (primarily herbal). Most recent abortions took place at or before nine weeks gestation (n=41, 61%). If they were to need an abortion today, respondents preferred medication abortion to surgical abortion three to one (n=703 versus n=217), but 514 (30%) respondents did not know which method they would prefer. Reasons for medication abortion preference among the 703 respondents included a belief that it is the least invasive method (n=553, 79%) and the most private method (n=388, 55%). To improve accessibility and quality of abortion care for TGE patients, respondents most frequently recommended that abortion clinics adopt gender-neutral or gender-affirming intake forms, that providers utilize gender-neutral language, and that greater privacy be incorporated into the clinic. CONCLUSION(S): These data contribute significantly to the evidence base on individual experiences of and preferences for abortion care for TGE people. Findings can be used to adapt abortion care to better include and affirm the experiences of this underserved population.","MOSESON, Heidi; FIX, Laura; RAGOSTA, Sachiko; FORSBERG, Hannah; HASTINGS, Jen; STOEFFLER, Ari; LUNN, Mitchell R.; FLENTJE, Annesa; CAPRIOTTI, Matthew R.; LUBENSKY, Micah E.; OBEDIN-MALIVER, Juno",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518170/,139

METHODS: The clinical manifestations and laboratory study on brain neuroimaging of patients with severe JE were statistically analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up for 6 months after discharge. The patients were grouped into good outcome and poor outcome according to the results of the follow-up. RESULTS: This retrospective study consists of 9 adults with severe JE, including 5 cases with poor outcome, defined as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of greater than or equal to 4 points, and remained ventilator dependent. Typical clinical manifestations of JE include fever (100%), altered consciousness (100%), headache (66.7%), flaccid weakness (66.7%), and status epilepticus (44.4%). Serological examination revealed that a higher percentage of neutrophils and a lower percentage of lymphocytes at admission may be associated with a poor outcome. Abnormal neuroimaging of the thalamus (85.7%), hippocampal (71.4%), midbrain (28.6%), and basal ganglia (14.3%) was found. 42.9% of patients left severe irreversible disability, and the most prominent were mental symptoms (71.4%) and memory or understanding disorder (57.1%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that respiratory failure is one of the important causes of early death. Serologic examination, coma, and status epilepticus may indicate a poor outcome for severe JE.

Security and security management are not immune from this influence. Building on the scientific literature, this article explores the mixed impact of this unexpected macro-level phenomenon and its consequences on violent extremism and terrorism in the West, in the short and in the medium to long term. The paper looks at the influence on extremist beliefs and attitudes and, moreover, it examines the effects on extremist behaviors, with an emphasis on terrorist activities, drawing on a model of terrorist attack cycle.

44631,One Giant Step for Giant Cell Arteritis: Updates in Diagnosis and Treatment,2021-01-16,"CCN2, formerly termed Connective Tissue Growth Factor, is a protein belonging to the Cellular Communication Network (CCN)-family of secreted extracellular matrix-associated proteins. As a matricellular protein it is mainly considered to be active as a modifier of signaling activity of several different signaling pathways and as an orchestrator of their cross-talk. Furthermore, CCN2 and its fragments have been implicated in the regulation of a multitude of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, cell survival, apoptosis and the production of extracellular matrix products, as well as in more complex processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, fibrosis, mechanotransduction and inflammation. Its function is complex and context dependent, depending on cell type, state of differentiation and microenvironmental context. CCN2 plays a role in many diseases, especially those associated with fibrosis, but has also been implicated in many different forms of cancer. In the bone marrow (BM), CCN2 is highly expressed in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). CCN2 is important for MSC function, supporting its proliferation, migration and differentiation. In addition, stromal CCN2 supports the maintenance and longtime survival of hematopoietic stem cells, and in the presence of interleukin 7, stimulates the differentiation of pro-B lymphocytes into pre-B lymphocytes. Overexpression of CCN2 is seen in the majority of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias, especially in certain cytogenetic subgroups associated with poor outcome. In acute myeloid leukemia, CCN2 expression is increased in MSCs, which has been associated with leukemic engraftment in vivo. In this review, the complex function of CCN2 in the BM microenvironment and in normal as well as malignant hematopoiesis is discussed. In addition, an overview is given of data on the remaining CCN family members regarding normal and malignant hematopoiesis, having many similarities and some differences in their function.","Leguit, Roos J.; Raymakers, Reinier A.

These approaches can be classified as per their usage. Thus, some will be efficient for indoor operations, and others will be useful for outdoor operations. The performance of both types of drone-based smart healthcare systems can be measured in terms of stabilizing the attitude for both indoor and outdoor operations as per requirements. Further, gain-based drone scheduling is commonly used in flight controllers. In COVID-19 pandemic situations, the gains can be measured using an alternative way. Here, different parameters like medication advantage to COVID-19 pandemic areas, identifying the COVID-19 hotspots, sanitizing requirements and potentials, finding the COVID-19 chain, etc., could be considered in gain measurement for the deployment of drone-based COVID-19’s smart healthcare. This work proposes a multi-constraint and multi-objective gain-based simulation-optimization approach for scheduling the linear and nonlinear dynamic and controllable drone movement models. The proposed model considered the identity-based lower and upper limits of control interface. Further, this interface is having the provision to include some human factors in its execution. The performance of the overall system is measured using performance and security metrics. In performance, drone-based smart healthcare systems’ efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness are measured. The measurements are analyzed by varying optimization parameters. In the security, lightweight cryptography primitives and protocols are analyzed for performance measurements. These lightweight cryptography primitives and protocols ensure secure data storage, transmission, and processing at any device. Further, the scope of centralized and distributed systems of drone cooperations for COVID-19 monitoring, sanitization, cleaning, and control room will be explored to have time-saving and autonomous drone-based smart healthcare systems.","Sharma, Kriti; Singh, Harvinder; Sharma, Deepak Kumar; Kumar, Adarsh; Nayyar, Anand; Krishnamurthi, Rajalakshmi",Emerging Technologies for Battling Covid-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979254/,139

In this research note, we document the use of the media's construction of risk through framing in the early stages of the pandemic. We analyze three dimensions of the health risk narratives related to COVID-19 that dominated Canadians’ concerns about the virus. To capture these narratives, we examine print and online news coverage from two nationally distributed media sources. We assess these frames alongside epidemiological data and find there is a clear link between media coverage, epidemiological data and risk frames in the early stages of the pandemic. It appears that the media relied on health expertise and political sources to guide their coverage and was responsive to the public health data presented to Canadians.","Wallace, Rebecca; Lawlor, Andrea; Tolley, Erin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082132/,139

Hence, automatic and fast screening of COVID-19 infections has become an urgent need of this pandemic. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a commonly used primary clinical method, is expensive and time-consuming for skilled health professionals. With the aid of various AI functionalities and advanced technologies, chest CT scans may thus be a viable alternative for quick and automatic screening of COVID-19. At the moment, significant advances in 5G cellular and internet of things (IoT) technology are finding use in various applications in the healthcare sector. This study presents an IoT-enabled deep learning-based stacking model to analyze chest CT scans for effective diagnosis of COVID-19 encounters. At first, patient data will be obtained using IoT devices and sent to a cloud server during the data procurement stage. Then we use different fine-tuned CNN sub-models, which are stacked together using a meta-learner to detect COVID-19 infection from input CT scans. The proposed model is evaluated using an open access dataset containing both COVID-19 infected and non-COVID CT images. Evaluation results show the efficacy of the proposed stacked model containing fine-tuned CNNs and a meta-learner in detecting coronavirus infections using CT scans.","Shorfuzzaman, Mohammad",Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216100/,139

No prognostic tool has yet gained any widespread use. We compared the predictive value of various models based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) subitems, ranging from simple to more complex models, for predicting large artery occlusion (LAO) in anterior circulation stroke. Methods Patients registered in the SITS international Stroke Register with available NIHSS and radiological arterial occlusion data were analysed. We compared 2042 patients harbouring an LAO with 2881 patients having no/distal occlusions. Using binary logistic regression, we developed models ranging from simple 1 NIHSS-subitem to full NIHSS-subitems models. Sensitivities and specificities of the models for predicting LAO were examined. Results The model with highest predictive value included all NIHSS subitems for predicting LAO (area under the curve (AUC) 0.77), yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 76%, respectively. The second most predictive model (AUC 0.76) included 4-NIHSS-subitems (level of consciousness commands, gaze, facial and arm motor function) yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 75%, respectively. The simplest model included only deficits in arm motor-function (AUC 0.72) for predicting LAO, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 72%, respectively. Conclusions Although increasingly more complex models yield a higher discriminative performance for predicting LAO, differences between models are not large. Assessing grade of arm dysfunction along with an established stroke-diagnosis model may serve as a surrogate measure of arterial occlusion-status, thereby assisting in triage decisions.","Cooray, Charith; Mazya, Michael V; Bottai, Matteo; Scheitz, Jan F; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Moreira, Tiago Prazeres; Mikulik, Robert; Krajina, Antonin; Nevsimalova, Miroslava; Toni, Danilo; Wahlgren, Nils; Ahmed, Niaz",Stroke and vascular neurology,https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2018-000165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637127/,139

MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred sixty-three patients diagnosed with right-sided colon adenocarcinoma underwent laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC) between April 2011 and December 2017. Seventy-four of these patients underwent 3-LRC procedure and 89 patients underwent 5-LRC. Clinical characteristics, perioperative short-term outcomes, and pathologic data were analyzed. RESULTS There were no differences in TNM stage, tumor location, estimated blood loss, complications, and open conversion rates. The operation time was shorter in the 3-LRC group than in 5-LRC group (140.9 ± 27.5 minutes versus 178.2 ± 38.2 minutes; P = .001). The number of harvested lymph nodes (28.5 ± 13.9 versus 22.6 ± 11.7; P = .004) was also higher in the 3-LRC group. The first passage of flatus and first oral diet were significantly faster in the 3-LRC group than in the 5-LRC group (2.8 ± 1.0 days versus 4.0 ± 1.2 days; P = .001, 3.6 ± 2.9 days versus 5.0 ± 1.5 days; P = .001). The number of patients who required analgesics is less in the 3-LRC group (32.4% versus 43.8%; P = .583).

The benefits of smaller incisions, improved pain and convalescence, and shorter hospital stays have greatly improved patient care and satisfaction. In an effort to further minimize the morbidity of surgery, laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) or single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged. We review the collective experience with this novel technique and share our initial observations and early results. METHODS We performed a literature search to review the published experience with this new technique including the breadth of applications and perioperative outcomes associated with LESS in urology. We also analysed the experience with this emerging technique at our institution. RESULTS There are numerous variations with regards to nomenclature as well as types of access to the abdominal cavity as it pertains to LESS. Urologic procedures involving single-port access have acceptable operating room time, blood loss, and postoperative pain, which are in line with standard laparoscopic surgical outcomes with the added benefit of improved cosmesis and smaller incisions. CONCLUSIONS Further studies and larger cohorts are needed to assess the real benefit of LESS procedures.

Though the benefits of service learning are widely acknowledged within the literature, there is little documentation of the associated challenges. Drawing on reflections from our own practice, and those of colleagues from a variety of institutions across the UK, we propose four key areas of risk associated with the integration of service learning into undergraduate medical education: unsafe encounters, patient disempowerment, inequality of experience and misalignment of service and learning priorities. Considering each area in turn, we identify contributory factors alongside practical recommendations to mitigate these risks. Acknowledgement of this subject is timely as medical schools develop their curricula to reflect evolving service and patient priorities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to encourage discussion and debate amongst the medical education community at a time where emphasis is being increasingly placed on medical students as being active participants in the delivery of patient care. In doing so, faculty may reduce associated risks and maximise the benefit of opportunities for all stakeholders.","Lalloo, Felicity; Hawkins, Nichola; Lindley, Rachel; Kumar, Sonia","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2020.1869589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586625/,139

Although they can be inferred from guidelines and trials, they should be designed and standardized to allow better assessment of the quality of care. PURPOSE Quality indicators are crucial for assessing the performance of any health care system. To allow efficiency, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness, there is a need for prompt acquisition of up-to-date information. Among the available quality indicators, process indicators have the highest sensitivity to frequent changes and could better reflect the implementation outcomes of novel ideas and technology. This study aimed to map the available information regarding process quality indicators in glaucoma care, identify the current development stage of these indicators, and systematically synthesize them. METHODS We performed a scoping review of four electronic bibliographic databases for studies reporting on process quality indicators in glaucoma. We retrieved 7502 references and created a domain list reflecting the core idea underlying each indicator. RESULTS We summarized information from 18 documents and listed 20 domains. The most mentioned domains were follow-up, optic nerve head assessment, visual field test, and intra-ocular pressure. Indicators regarding quality of life assessment, patient assistance, or presence of written protocols were less frequently mentioned. CONCLUSION There are notable variations among process quality indicators in glaucoma and significant heterogeneity in their descriptions in published studies. Although novel indicators can be inferred from guidelines and trials, they should be designed and standardized for better assessment of performance in health systems to improve their quality.","Iorio-Aranha, Flavio; Peleteiro, Bárbara; Rocha-Sousa, Amândio; Azevedo, Ana; Breda, João Barbosa",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675335/,139

Few studies have prospectively examined the association between physiological responses to acute psychological stress prior to a traumatic event with later PTSD symptoms. The present prospective study examined whether cardiovascular responses to an acute psychological stress task prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic predicted PTSD symptoms related to the ongoing pandemic. METHOD Participants (N = 120) were a subsample of an ongoing research study. Phase 1 consisted of a 10-minute baseline and 4-minute acute psychological stress task with blood pressure and heart rate recorded throughout. Phase 2 was initiated two weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the ongoing pandemic. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to examine whether cardiovascular stress reactivity predicted COVID-19 PTSD symptoms. RESULTS Heart rate reactivity significantly predicted IES-intrusion, b = -.208, t = -2.28, p = .025, DR = .041, CI: [-.021 - -.001] and IES-hyperarousal b = -.224, t = -2.54, p = .012, DR = .047, CI: [-0.22 - - .003], but not IES-avoidance (p = .077). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for gender, socioeconomic status, baseline cardiovascular activity, neuroticism, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and adverse childhood experiences. There were no statistically significant associations between blood pressure with any of the IES-R subscales (p's > .12). CONCLUSIONS Diminished heart rate responses (i.e., lower physiological arousal) to acute psychological stress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicted reported PTSD symptoms during the crisis.","Ginty, Annie T; Young, Danielle A; Tyra, Alexandra T; Hurley, Page E; Brindle, Ryan C; Williams, Sarah E",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796336/,139

However, the etiology of KD remains unclear. AIM2, an intracellular receptor, plays a vital role during the infection caused by a variety of pathogens. However, its role in KD remains unclear. The principal aim of the present research is to concentrate on the relation between AIM2 and KD. We detected the levels of AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1β in all subjects by ELISA. The conventional inflammatory indices were detected in all subjects, such as WBC, HB, CRP and so on. The serum concentrations of AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1β were notably upregulated in the KD group compared to the febrile group and healthy group, respectively. And the three indicators in the KD patients were greatly reduced after interpreted with IVIG. Furthermore, the expressions of IL-18 and IL-1β were positively correlated with AIM2. Meanwhile, the cutoff value of serum AIM2 level for the diagnosis of KD was 541.90 ng/L with the specificity of 60% and sensitivity of 92.5%, compared to the febrile controls. And the area under curve (AUC) of AIM2 was 0.771. And no difference was observed in patients with CALs when compared with patients without CALs. The serum AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1β might play a critical role during the progress of KD.

Despite the extensive work done on developing chelates for Tc(I), a rigorous investigation of the impact of changing donor groups and labeling conditions on radiochemical yields and/or distribution has been lacking. This information is crucially important if these platforms are going to be used to develop molecular imaging probes. Previous studies on the coordination chemistry of the {M(CO)(3)}(+) core have established alkylamine, aromatic nitrogen heterocycles, and carboxylate donors as effective chelating ligands. These observations led to the design of tridentate ligands derived from the amino acid lysine. Such amino acid analogues provide a tridentate donor set for chelation to the metal and an amino acid functionality for conjugation to biomolecules. We recently developed a family of single amino acid chelates (SAAC) that serve this function and can be readily incorporated into peptides via solid-phase synthesis techniques. As part of these continuing studies, we report here on the radiolabeling with technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) and stability of a series of SAAC analogues of lysine.

Secondary objectives included a comparison of mesh exposure from total hysterectomies (TH) versus supracervical hysterectomies (SCH) and determination of risk factors for mesh exposure. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent RSCP between January 2009 and December 2011 at one academic center. The primary outcome was mesh exposure at 6 weeks postoperation. Subjects were divided into two groups: those with concomitant hysterectomy and those with RSCP alone. The hysterectomy group was subdivided into TH versus SCH. Mesh exposures and mesh revision procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 and CPT codes, respectively, and confirmed by chart review. RESULTS There were 230 eligible women who underwent RSCP during the study period and were followed up at a 6-week postoperative visit; 118 (51.7%) had RSCP only and 112 (48.7%) had a concomitant hysterectomy. Of those who underwent hysterectomy, 79 patients (70.5%) had TH and 33 (29.5%) had SCH. There were nine (3.9%) mesh exposures attributed to RSCP. The difference between the RSCP + hysterectomy group and the RSCP-only group was 2.7% versus 5.1% (P = 0.50). The 2.7% of mesh exposures in the hysterectomy group were associated with TH and none with SCH, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS Although mesh exposure with RSCP is low, serious morbidity can be associated with mesh use and appropriate preoperative counseling is critical.","Crane, Andrea K; Geller, Elizabeth J; Sullivan, Stephanie; Robinson, Barbara L; Myers, Erinn M; Horton, Christine; Matthews, Catherine A",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000000170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25279861/,139

Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question ""In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?"". Social disconnectedness included information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI).Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely.Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulating virtual talking connectedness might have the potential to diminish loneliness despite steep outside-home disconnectedness.","Torres, Juliana Lustosa; Braga, Luciana de Souza; Moreira, Bruno de Souza; Sabino Castro, Camila Menezes; Vaz, Camila Teixeira; Andrade, Amanda Cristina de Souza; Bof Andrade, Fabíola; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Caiaffa, Waleska Teixeira",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1913479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970704/,139

BACKGROUND Although endovascular treatment of short superficial femoral artery lesions revealed excellent results, efficacy in long lesions remains unsatisfactory. METHODS In a prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter study, 141 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease were assigned to treatment with heparin-bonded, covered stents (Viabahn 72 patients) or BMS (69 patients). Clinical outcomes and patency rates were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS Mean ± SD lesion length was 19.0 ± 6.3 cm in the Viabahn group and 17.3 ± 6.6 cm in the BMS group. Major complications within 30 days were observed in 1.4%. The 12-month primary patency rates in the Viabahn and BMS groups were: intention-to-treat (ITT) 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58 to 0.80) and 55.1% (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.67) (log-rank test p = 0.11); treatment per-protocol (TPP) 78.1% (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.86) and 53.5% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.65) (hazard ratio: 2.23 [95% CI: 1.14 to 4.34) (log-rank test p = 0.009). In lesions ≥20 cm, (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus class D), the 12-month patency rate was significantly longer in VIA patients in the ITT analysis (VIA 71.3% vs. BMS 36.8%; p = 0.01) and the TPP analysis (VIA 73.3% vs. BMS 33.3%; p = 0.004). Freedom from target lesion revascularization was 84.6% for Viabahn (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.91) versus 77.0% for BMS (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.85; p = 0.37). The ankle-brachial index in the Viabahn group significantly increased to 0.94 ± 0.23 compared with the BMS group (0.85 ± 0.23; p < 0.05) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS This randomized trial in symptomatic patients with peripheral arterial disease who underwent endovascular treatment for long femoropopliteal lesions demonstrated significant clinical and patency benefits for heparin-bonded covered stents compared with BMS in lesions ≥20 cm and for all lesions in the TPP analysis. In the ITT analysis for all lesions, which was flawed by major protocol deviations in 8.5% of the patients, the difference was not significant.

64676,Impact of previous stroke on outcome after thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion.,2019,"The interferon (IFN) antagonists of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) proteins contribute to the JE pathogenesis. Most flavivirus non-structural (NS) proteins correlate with virus-induced inflammation and immune escape. NS4A proteins of West Nile virus and dengue type 2 virus have been demonstrated to inhibit IFN signaling. In this study, JEV NS4A without the C-terminal 2K domain has been demonstrated to partially block activation of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-based cis-reporter by IFN-alpha/beta. In addition, JEV NS4A significantly inhibited the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 and STAT2, but not TYK2 in the IFN-treated cells. Moreover, the N-terminus of a RNA helicase DDX42 protein identified using a phage display human brain cDNA library have been demonstrated to specifically bind to JEV NS4A in vitro using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The interaction between JEV NS4A and RNA helicase DDX42 showed partial co-localization in human medulloblastoma TE-671 cells by confocal microscopy. Importantly, the expression of N-terminal DDX42 is able to overcome JEV-induced antagonism of IFN responses. Therefore, these results show that JEV NS4A without the C-terminal 2K domain is associated with modulation of the IFN response and the interaction of JEV NS4A with RNA helicase DDX42 could be important for JE pathogenesis.","Lin, Cheng-Wen; Cheng, Chieh-Wen; Yang, Tsuey-Ching; Li, Shih-Wein; Cheng, Mei-Hsiu; Wan, Lei; Lin, Ying-Ju; Lai, Chih-Ho; Lin, Wei-Yong; Kao, Ming-Ching",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18588927/,139

65414,"Aneurysm treatment with WEB in the cumulative population of two prospective, multicenter series: 3-year follow-up.",2020-06-12,"OBJECTIVE Heart rate variability (HRV) offers a noninvasive way to peek into the physiological status of the human body. When this physiological status is dynamic, traditional HRV indices calculated from power spectrum do not resolve the dynamic situation due to the issue of nonstationarity. Clinical anesthesia is a typically dynamic situation that calls for time-varying HRV analysis. Concentration of frequency and time (ConceFT) is a nonlinear time-frequency (TF) analysis generalizing the multitaper technique and the synchrosqueezing transform. The result is a sharp TF representation capturing the dynamics inside HRV. Companion indices of the commonly applied HRV indices, including time-varying low-frequency power (tvLF), time-varying high-frequency power, and time-varying low-high ratio, are considered as measures of noxious stimulation. METHODS To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed indices, we apply these indices to study two different types of noxious stimulation, the endotracheal intubation and surgical skin incision, under general anesthesia. The performance was compared with traditional HRV indices, the heart rate reading, and indices from electroencephalography. RESULTS The results indicate that the tvLF index performs best and outperforms not only the traditional HRV index, but also the commonly used heart rate reading. CONCLUSION With the help of ConceFT, the proposed HRV indices are potential to provide a better quantification of the dynamic change of the autonomic nerve system. SIGNIFICANCE Our proposed scheme of time-varying HRV analysis could contribute to the clinical assessment of analgesia under general anesthesia.","Lin, Yu-Ting; Wu, Hau-Tieng",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2016.2549048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27046888/,139

However, it can be associated with nutritional deficiencies postoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate micronutrient status post LSG. METHODS This is a retrospective study of 565 patients who underwent an LSG from January 2015 to September 2018. Patients lost to follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months were 6.3%, 18.6% and 32.4%, respectively. Follow-up of the patients included regular dietetic input and micronutrient supplementation. Data that was collected included both anthropometry and nutritional markers. RESULTS The mean preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI) were 118.13 ± 25.36 kg and 42.40 ± 7.66 kg/m2, respectively. Statistically, significant reductions in anthropometric parameters including weight, BMI (30.50 kg/m2), total weight loss (28.03%), excess weight loss (72.03%) and BMI loss (12.32 kg/m2) were observed at all timepoints up to 12 months follow-up. At 12 months, there were significant increases in 25-OH vitamin D with the incidence of deficiency decreasing from 45.7 to 15.0% compared to baseline. The incidence of hyperparathyroidism also decreased from 32.2 to 18.9% compared to baseline, and incidence of folate deficiency increased from 7.7 to 19.2%. Other nutritional parameters including calcium, iron, ferritin, vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin (active B12) and haemoglobin did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS Modest effects on micronutrient status were observed in the 12-month postoperative period. Of clinically significant, de novo folate deficiencies increased, and vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism decreased. Thus, optimizing postoperative micronutrient status is imperative following LSG.","Dong, Lillian; Suh, Hyerim; Karantanis, William; Jia, Sisi; Yang, Yive; Loi, Ken W K",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05089-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33146868/,139

However, no prospective cohort study has quantitatively evaluated the color matching and extent of repigmentation in the head and neck area by this method. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the color matching and extent of repigmentation after pixel array epidermal grafting by image analysis software and physicians' naked eye. METHODS Ten Asian patients with head and neck vitiligo lesions stable for at least 6 months were treated with pixel array epidermal grafting with an automatic harvesting system and post-grafting phototherapy. The patients were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months post grafting for the percentage of repigmentation by blinded physicians' assessment and image analysis software. The color matching index of repigmentation was evaluated by measuring the melanin index in the grafted area and the juxta non-vitiliginous area. RESULTS The average blister harvest time was 46.3 ± 9.7 min. The area percentile of repigmentation by the image analysis software were 32.3 ± 26.8, 64.6 ± 29.4, and 76.5 ± 25.9 at 1, 3, and 6 months post grafting, respectively. There were no significant differences between the physicians' assessments and the results from the image analysis software. The change in the area percentile of repigmentation between 3 and 6 months post grafting was only statistically significant using image analysis software. The grafted area achieved a color match of 83.1 ± 13.4% that of the juxta non-vitiliginous area 6 months after grafting. Three patients had repigmentation of leukotrichia. CONCLUSION By quantitative measurement, uniform pixel array micrografts provide a very good extent of repigmentation and color match in the head and neck area. Image analysis software revealed a steady increase in repigmentation after POM3 until POM6, which was not detected by subjective assessment.","Wang, Yen-Jen; Chang Liao, Nien-Feng; Chang, Chang-Cheng; Lin, Erh-Ti; Chiang, Hsiu-Mei; Lin, Bor-Shyh",Dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326964/,139
65936,[Systemic lupus erythematosus].,2020-05-01,"AIMS Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been deemed as a global pandemic by World Health Organization. While diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is recognized to be the primary manifestation COVID-19 pneumonia, there has been little emphasis on the progression to the fibrosing phase of DAD. This topic is of great interest due to growing concerns regarding the potential long-term complications in prolonged survivors. METHODS Here we report a detailed histopathologic study of thirty autopsy cases with COVID-19 virus infection, based on minimally invasive autopsies performed between February to March, 2020. RESULTS The mean age was 69 years, with twenty (67%) males and 10 (33%) females and frequent (70.0%) underlying comorbidities. The duration of illness ranged from 16 to 82 (median=42) days. Histologically, the most common manifestation was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 28 (93.3%) cases which showed predominantly acute (32%), organizing (25%), and/or fibrosing (43%) patterns. Patients with fibrosing DAD were one decade younger (p=0.034) and they had a longer duration of illness (p=0.033), hospitalization (p=0.037) and mechanical ventilation (p=0.014) compared to those with acute DAD. Patients with organizing DAD had a longer duration of illness (p=0.032) and hospitalization (p=0.023) compared to those with acute DAD. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pneumonia patients who develop DAD can progress to the fibrosing pattern. While we observed fibrosing DAD in fatal cases, whether surviving patients are at risk for developing pulmonary fibrosis and the frequency of this complication will require further clinical and radiologic follow-up studies.","Li, Yan; Wu, Junhua; Wang, Sihua; Li, Xiang; Zhou, Junjie; Huang, Bo; Luo, Danju; Cao, Qin; Chen, Yajun; Chen, Shuo; Ma, Lin; Peng, Li; Pan, Huaxiong; Travis, William D; Nie, Xiu",Histopathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926596/,139

METHODS All women undergoing laparoscopy for stage IV endometriosis at a tertiary referral hospital between November 2016 and January 2018 and had evidence of DIE of the rectum were included. Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score was measured using a validated questionnaire. RESULTS Thirty-six women formed the cohort of the study. The mean age was 37 years (range 20-72 years). All women underwent a laparoscopic anterior rectal disc resection for DIE. The response rate was 100%. There was an increase in the percentage of patients having no LARS postoperatively compared to preoperatively (an increase of 78-83%). There was a reduction in LARS scores postoperatively observed in 18 patients (50%) and the prevalence of major LARS decreased postoperatively from 10% to 1%. Comparison of individual symptoms revealed a significant improvement in postoperative stool frequency scores (P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis using logistic regression analysis demonstrated that reduction in postoperative stool frequency scores remained an independent factor (P = 0.008).

Within the USA, the beef cattle industry loses up to an estimated 1 billion dollars a year due to BRDC. There are many contributors to BRDC, including environmental stressors and viral and/or bacterial infections. One species of bacteria in particular, Mannheimia haemolytica, is recognized as the major cause of severe fibrinonecrotic pneumonia in cattle. M. haemolytica is an opportunistic pathogen that normally populates the upper respiratory tract of cattle, and invades the lower respiratory tract in stressed and/or virally infected cattle by mechanisms that are not completely understood. However, not all M. haemolytica appear to be equally pathogenic to cattle. Thus, a test could be developed to distinguish M. haemolytica genetic subtypes by their propensity to cause respiratory disease, allowing isolation and/or treatment of cattle harboring strains with an increased propensity to cause disease. To that end, the genomes of over 300 M. haemolytica strains are being sequenced.","Clawson, Michael L; Murray, Robert W",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252314000188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381881/,139

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,277; deaths = 102. Over the past fortnightly reporting period, the number of new cases in all jurisdictions continues to decline, or remain very low, and testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.1%. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 147 cases notified between 25 May and 7 June, 63% acquired their infection overseas. The proportion of cases locally acquired has dropped substantially to 28% of new cases this period compared with 50% and greater observed since 30 March 2020. Of the cases considered to be locally-acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 7 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.8%. Countries in South America are seeing rapid growth in case numbers, while the United States is seeing a steady decline in its daily new case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, with several countries in Eastern Europe experiencing rapid growth. In the South East Asia region, India and Bangladesh are seeing accelerating epidemics, compounded by the recovery from Cyclone Amphan.

The technical difficulties, the steep learning curve and the concerns about performing an oncologic and safe reconstruction in advanced cases, are the main reasons for the low adoption of VATS for sleeve resections. Most of the authors use 3-4 incisions for thoracoscopic sleeve procedures. However these surgical techniques can be performed by a single incision approach by skilled uniportal VATS surgeons. The improvements of the surgical instruments, high definition cameras and recent 3D systems have greatly contributed to facilitate the adoption of uniportal VATS techniques for sleeve procedures.

68665,"Thrombectomy for secondary distal, medium vessel occlusions of the posterior circulation: seeking complete reperfusion.",2021-07-16,"BACKGROUND As Japan's population continues to age, it is estimated that the number of people aged ≥75 years will exceed 20 million by 2025. Furthermore, over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it is important to address ""frailty,"" a condition in which people become more vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS Disparity between healthy life expectancy and average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a paradigm shift from ""cure-seeking medical care"" to ""cure- and support-seeking medical care."" Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are low in Japanese people aged ≥75 years; particularly in people aged ≥80 years, low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication of effects and the presence of drugs that ""require particularly careful administration,"" it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age. CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL In this report, we have put together a vision for the future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional organizations. The paradigm shift from ""cure-seeking medical care"" to ""cure- and support-seeking medical care"" should be promoted for the development of a healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from ""cure-seeking medical care"" to ""cure- and support-seeking medical care,"" the development of various comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In addition, it is important to strengthen industry-academia-government-private partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community. In addition, industry-academia-government-private partnership is necessary, including all aforementioned, such as places where people can play an active role in the rest of their lives (such as employment), promotion of human connections, promotion of technology to support older people and support for daily life.

69567,Clinical chemistry tests for patients with COVID-19 - important caveats for interpretation.,2020-04-16,"The authors present a preliminary experience with ethyl-enevinylalcohol copolymer (Onyx) for hemangioblastoma vessel embolization before surgical resection. The patient presented with neck pain, dizziness, blurred vision, vomiting, and loss of balance. Diagnostic imaging revealed a posterior fossa cystic mass with a nodular component. Angiography demonstrated a significant vascular blush with arteriovenous shunting that was characteristic of a hemangioblastoma. Tumor vessels originating off the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery were embolized before surgery using Onyx 18 (ev3, Covidien Vascular Therapies, Mansfield, MA, USA). This resulted in complete obliteration of all tumor vessels, transforming a highly vascular tumor into an avascular mass. A safe and uneventful surgical resection was performed the next day. Onyx is a valuable embolic agent for preoperative hemangioblastoma vessel embolization. Because of its low viscosity, Onyx penetrates deeply into the tumor vasculature and allows complete obliteration of tumor vessels. Risks of the intervention have to be carefully weighed against the benefits. If preoperative embolization is indicated, the use of Onyx should be strongly considered.","Horvathy, Denes B; Hauck, Erik F; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2010.06.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21237650/,139

SILS has recently been introduced in this field and applied in Viet Duc University Hospital. Herein, we report our experience with single-incision transperitoneal adrenalectomy. METHODS Between August 2010 and January 2012, 61 patients (23 men, 38 women) underwent SILS adrenalectomy at our institution. The diagnoses consisted of 20 patients with pheochromocytoma, 17 with nonfunctioning adenoma, 16 with Conn syndrome, 4 with Cushing syndrome and 4 with adrenal cysts. The mean age was 47.8 years (range, 21-68 years). There were 29 right-sided and 32 left-sided tumors; their mean diameter was 30.7 mm (range, 8-59 mm). Patients were in the flank position with the operated side up. A 2.5-cm pararectal incision at the level of the umbilicus was made to insert the SILS Port. RESULTS The mean operating time was 78 min (range, 50-120 min), and mean blood loss was approximately 70 mL. Left-sided tumors were excised entirely with the SILS technique. Right-sided lesions sometimes required an additional trocar (hybrid technique). No drainage was needed at the operating site. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, but one case was converted to the conventional three-port technique. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 days (range, 2-6 days). CONCLUSION Our preliminary results show that SILS adrenalectomy is safe and technically feasible. It should be considered among the surgical managements for selected patients with adrenal tumors.","Tran, Giang Binh; Nguyen, Tien Duc; Le, Khanh Viet",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2012.00157.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22989250/,139

We examined the cardiovascular safety of HCQ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS We conducted an active comparator safety study of HCQ in a propensity score-matched cohort of 8852 Veterans newly diagnosed with RA between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2017. Patients were initiated on HCQ (n=4426) or another non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; n=4426) after RA diagnosis, up to December 31, 2018, and followed for 12 months after therapy initiation, up to December 31, 2019. RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 64 (±12) years, 14% were women, 28% African American, and were balanced on 87 baseline characteristics. There were 3 (0.03%) long QT syndrome (LQTS) events, of which 2 belonged to the HCQ group. Of the 56 (0.63%) arrhythmia-related hospitalizations, 30 belonged to the HCQ group (hazard ratio associated with HCQ, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.68-1.95). All-cause mortality occurred in 144 (3.25%) and 136 (3.07%) patients in the HCQ and non-HCQ groups, respectively (hazard ratio associated with HCQ, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.84-1.34). During the first 30 days of follow-up, there was no LQTS event, 2 arrhythmia-related hospitalizations (none in the HCQ group), and 13 deaths (6 in the HCQ group). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of LQTS and arrhythmia-related hospitalization was low in patients with RA during the first year after the initiation of HCQ or another non-biologic DMARD. We found no evidence that HCQ therapy is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events or death.","Faselis, Charles; Zeng-Treitler, Qing; Cheng, Yan; Kerr, Gail S; Nashel, David J; Liappis, Angelike P; Weintrob, Amy C; Karasik, Pamela E; Arundel, Cherinne; Boehm, Denise; Heimall, Michael S; Connell, Lawrence B; Taub, Daniel D; Shao, Yijun; Redd, Douglas F; Sheriff, Helen M; Zhang, Sijian; Fletcher, Ross D; Fonarow, Gregg C; Moore, Hans J; Ahmed, Ali",Arthritis & rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973403/,139

However, the data of predicting clinical outcome after thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever were limited. We attempt to identify prognostic factors of clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive acute ischemic strokes cases treated between December 2010 and December2013 where the Solitaire stent retriever was used for acute ischemic stroke. We assessed the effect of selected demographic characteristics, clinical factors on poor outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin score 3-6), mortality at 3 months, and hemorrhage within 24 h (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Clinical, imaging and logistic variables were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables influencing clinical outcome, based on discharge NIHSS score change and mRS at 3 months. RESULTS Eighty nine consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Multivariate analysis revealed that admission NIHSS score, Serum glucose and endovascular procedure duration were independently associated with clinical outcome. Sex, NIHSS score at admission, diabetes and time of operation were associated with sICH in 1 day. NIHSS score ≥20 (OR 9.38; 95% CI 2.41-36.50), onset to reperfusion >5 hours (OR 5.23; 95% CI1.34,20.41) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 10.19; 95% CI1.80,57.83) were potential predictive factors of mortality at 3 months. CONCLUSION Multiple pre- and intra-procedural factors can be used to predict clinical outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular therapy. This knowledge is helpful for patients selection for endovascular mechanical thrombectomy.","Jiang, Shaowei; Fei, Aihua; Peng, Ya; Zhang, Jun; Lu, You-Ran; Wang, Hai-Rong; Chen, Miao; Pan, Shuming",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642052/,139

Early identification of COVID-19 patients who are at risk for AKI and may develop critical illness and death is of great importance. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model of AKI and in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19, incorporating the new tubular injury biomarker urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest computed tomography (CT) analysis. Methods A single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included in this study. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and AI-assisted chest CT imaging variables identified on hospital admission were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to develop a model for predicting the AKI risk. The accuracy of the AKI prediction model was measured using the concordance index (C-index), and the internal validity of the model was assessed by bootstrap resampling. A multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for survival analysis in COVID-19 patients. Results One hundred seventy-four patients were included. The median (±SD) age of the patients was 63.59 ± 13.79 years, and 83 (47.7%) were men.u-NGAL, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and CT ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume were independent predictors of AKI, and all were selected in the nomogram. The prediction model was validated by internal bootstrapping resampling, showing results similar to those obtained from the original samples (i.e., 0.958; 95% CI 0.9097-0.9864). The C-index for predicting AKI was 0.955 (95% CI 0.916-0.995). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed that a high u-NGAL level, an increased GGO volume, and lymphopenia are strong predictors of a poor prognosis and a high risk of in-hospital death. Conclusions This model provides a useful individualized risk estimate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. Measurement of u-NGAL and AI-based chest CT quantification are worthy of application and may help clinicians to identify patients with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 at an early stage.","He, Li; Zhang, Qunzi; Li, Ze; Shen, Li; Zhang, Jiayin; Wang, Peng; Wu, Shan; Zhou, Ting; Xu, Qiuting; Chen, Xiaohua; Fan, Xiaohong; Fan, Ying; Wang, Niansong",Kidney diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824868/,139

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, 31 patients (mean age 67 ± 8 years) with malignant CVO who had undergone revascularization by implantation of a self-expanding stent into the superior vena cava (SVC) (Sinus XL®, OptiMed, Germany; n = 11 [Group1] and Protégé ™ EverFlex, Covidien, Ireland; n = 20 [Group 2]) via a transfemoral access were identified. Simultaneously, percutaneous access via a subclavian vein was used to (a) probe the lesion from above, (b) facilitate a through-and-through maneuver, and (c) implant a TIVAP. Primary endpoints with regard to the SVC syndrome were technical (residual stenosis < 30%) and clinical (relief of symptoms) success; with regard to TIVAP implantation technical success was defined as positioning of the functional catheter within the SVC. Secondary endpoints were complications as well as stent and TIVAP patency. RESULTS Technical and clinical success rate were 100% for revascularization of the SVS and 100% for implantation of the TIVAP. One access site hematoma (minor complication, day 2) and one port-catheter-associated sepsis (major complication, day 18) were identified. Mean catheter days were 313 ± 370 days. Mean imaging follow-up was 184 ± 172 days. Estimated patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 100% in Group 1 and 84, 84, and 56% in Group 2 (p = 0.338). CONCLUSION Stent-based revascularization of malignant SVCS with concomitant implantation of a port device using a dual venous approach appears to be safe and effective.","Anton, Susanne; Oechtering, T; Stahlberg, E; Jacob, F; Kleemann, M; Barkhausen, J; Goltz, J P",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3997-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274029/,139

However, the direct specific effect of QS molecules on host biology is largely understudied. In this work, we show that the QS molecule DSF (cis-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid) produced by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana, mediated by flagellin-induced activation of flagellin receptor FLS2. The DSF-mediated attenuation of innate immunity results from the alteration of FLS2 nanoclusters and endocytic internalization of plasma membrane FLS2. DSF altered the lipid profile of Arabidopsis, with a particular increase in the phytosterol species, which impairs the general endocytosis pathway mediated by clathrin and FLS2 nano-clustering on the plasma membrane. The DSF effect on receptor dynamics and host immune responses could be entirely reversed by sterol removal. Together, our results highlighted the importance of sterol homeostasis to plasma membrane organization and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria use their communicating molecule to manipulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered host immunity.","Tran, Tuan Minh; Ma, Zhiming; Triebl, Alexander; Nath, Sangeeta; Cheng, Yingying; Gong, Ben-Qiang; Han, Xiao; Wang, Junqi; Li, Jian-Feng; Wenk, Markus R; Torta, Federico; Mayor, Satyajit; Yang, Liang; Miao, Yansong",Life science alliance,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788227/,139

Little is known about the spectrum of medications used or dosing ranges. To inform the design of future studies, we conducted a prospective analysis of respiratory medication exposure among 832 extremely low gestational age neonates. METHODS The prematurity and respiratory outcomes program (PROP) enrolled neonates less than 29-week gestation from 6 centers incorporating 13 clinical sites. We collected recorded daily ""respiratory"" medications given along with dosing information through 40-week postmenstrual age or neonatal intensive care unit discharge if earlier. RESULTS PROP participants were exposed to a wide range of respiratory medications, often at doses beyond published recommendations. Nearly 50% received caffeine and furosemide beyond published recommendations for cumulative dose. Those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were more likely to receive treatment with respiratory medications. However, more than 30% of PROP subjects that did not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia also were treated with diuretics, systemic steroids, and other respiratory medications. CONCLUSION Extremely preterm neonates in PROP were exposed to high doses of medications at levels known to generate significant adverse effects.

For this reason, systematic surveillance on small animal disease carried out through the collection and analysis of necropsy records could be helpful to public health. To describe the causes of death in dogs from the province of Rome (Italy) submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana for necropsy during 2003-2007, a retrospective study was conducted on diagnostic data of 870 dogs. The final diagnosis was established by anatomo-histopathological examinations and, when needed, by ancillary laboratory tests. The most common causes of death were 'infectious disease' (23%) and 'poisoning' (17%). In 5% of the cases, the cause remained undetermined. The frequency of 'poisoning' was higher (39%) in stray dogs, while 'infectious disease' was more frequent (49%) in dogs from breeding farms. Parvovirosis was the most frequent infectious disease (33%) while anticoagulants accounted for 30% of the cases involving toxicity. Death by neoplastic lesions was quite infrequent (7%). Findings from this study provide veterinarians with an overview of the causes of death in dogs and it could provide public health authorities with new data about both novel and re-emerging threats.","Eleni, Claudia; Scholl, Francesco; Scaramozzino, Paola",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.13.07.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981915/,139

The aim of this study was to summarize the epidemiology of AGE in northeastern Poland before 2021 and to evaluate the effectiveness of out-of-pocket rotavirus vaccinations on the incidence of rotavirus AGE. METHODS A review of patients with gastroenteritis hospitalized between 2006 and 2020 in northeastern Poland, with regards to the coverage with the rotavirus vaccine in the region. RESULTS Rotavirus was the most common agent of gastroenteritis. The seasonality of rotavirus gastroenteritis peaked between February and May, except in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has skewed any viable comparisons of seasonality. Coverage with the rotavirus vaccine did not exceed 25% during the study period and had no impact on the number of hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Rotavirus was the major causative agent of AGE in northeastern Poland. Voluntary vaccines did not affect the number of hospitalizations due to rotavirus AGE.

This strategy involves integration of high-temperature thermal isolation followed by thermal nanowiring techniques. The impure thermally-isolated REOs were purified and transformed into one dimensional (1D) nanorods of hybrid REOs. Besides, during high-temperature thermal isolation, defect-rich ZnO with tailored structures of nanorods and nanoribbons were fabricated using controllable vapour deposition. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoribbons for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) revealed a considerable overpotential reduction of 131 mV (18%) compared to pure commercial nano-ZnO. This approach is transformational in providing a scalable and cost-effective pathway to facilitate recycling of the challenging, yet critical, waste materials into functional nanostructures for energy and environmental applications.","Maroufi, Samane; Nekouei, Rasoul Khayyam; Mofarah, Sajjad S; Sahajwalla, Veena",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740716/,139

While the biochemical networks involved in energy transduction are well-characterized, the energetic costs and constraints for specific cellular processes remain largely unknown. In particular, what are the energy budgets of cells? What are the constraints and limits energy flows impose on cellular processes? Do cells operate near these limits, and if so how do energetic constraints impact cellular functions? Physics has provided many tools to study nonequilibrium systems and to define physical limits, but applying these tools to cell biology remains a challenge. Physical bioenergetics, which resides at the interface of nonequilibrium physics, energy metabolism, and cell biology, seeks to understand how much energy cells are using, how they partition this energy between different cellular processes, and the associated energetic constraints. Here we review recent advances and discuss open questions and challenges in physical bioenergetics.","Yang, Xingbo; Heinemann, Matthias; Howard, Jonathon; Huber, Greg; Iyer-Biswas, Srividya; Le Treut, Guillaume; Lynch, Michael; Montooth, Kristi L; Needleman, Daniel J; Pigolotti, Simone; Rodenfels, Jonathan; Ronceray, Pierre; Shankar, Sadasivan; Tavassoly, Iman; Thutupalli, Shashi; Titov, Denis V; Wang, Jin; Foster, Peter J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026786118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140336/,139

Recent studies have reported that lung cancer cells overexpressing Nrf2 exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy. Suppression of overexpressed Nrf2 is needed for a new therapeutic approach against lung cancers. In the present study, we found that Cinnamomi Cortex extract (CCE) has an ability to suppress Nrf2-regulated enzyme activity and Nrf2 expression in human lung cancer A549 cells with high Nrf2 activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that CCE significantly enhances sensitivity of A549 cells to the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin and etoposide as well as increasing the intracellular accumulation of both drugs. These results suggest that CCE might be an effective concomitant agent to reduce anticancer drug resistance derived from Nrf2 overexpression. Bioactivity-guided fractionation revealed that procyanidin tetramers and pentamers contained in CCE were active components in suppressing Nrf2.","Ohnuma, Tomokazu; Matsumoto, Takashi; Itoi, Ayano; Kawana, Ayako; Nishiyama, Takahito; Ogura, Kenichiro; Hiratsuka, Akira",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925486/,139

However, they fail to mention that in some countries, with the rise in COVID-19-related hospital admissions, competition can occur between COVID-19 and trauma patients for scarce hospital resources. In South Africa, this has led to the temporary banning of alcohol sales at two periods during the lockdown. Stockwell et al. highlight the fact that alcohol is deemed an 'essential service' in many countries and point to the reasons why this might have occurred, and that industry appears to be taking advantage of lockdown conditions to expand their reach in ways that might continue after the lockdown. The alcohol industry in South Africa has also used the points given by Stockwell et al. as to why governments might be reluctant to restrict alcohol at this time in pushing back against imposition of alcohol control measures, and furthermore referred to the effect of the sales ban on jobs in the alcohol and related industries and policy inconsistencies in dealing with different industries. Finally, the commentary expands on the measures presented on how governments should use the opportunity provided by the COVID-19 crisis to push for further alcohol control measures to be implemented.","Parry, Charles D H",Drug and alcohol review,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029822/,139

We describe prospective hemorrhage risk in women who become pregnant after an established CM diagnosis. METHODS Beginning in 2015, we recruited consecutive patients with radiologically confirmed CM of the brain or spinal cord to participate in a prospective registry. Participants underwent a baseline and annual medical record review, imaging review, and annual surveys to ascertain pregnancies, deliveries, and neurological complications. We collected prospective hemorrhage data on reproductive age women. We calculated prospective hemorrhage rates on childbearing age patients based on the number of hemorrhages occurring post-CM diagnosis during pregnancy and nonpregnancy, divided by the years of follow-up and censored at last follow-up, age 46, or surgery in sporadic-form CM. The hemorrhage rates were compared and the 95% CI presented with a P value of <0.05. RESULTS Of 160 women, 90 presented with CM under the age of 46 (average age 31.6 years; 25.6% familial form; 46.7% with hemorrhage; 24.4% brain stem location). These 90 patients had 136 pregnancies before CM diagnosis; 36 pregnancies occurred at or after the diagnosis of CM. Four patients had a hemorrhage while pregnant or postpartum leading to the first CM diagnosis. During 402.6 years of follow-up while not pregnant, 42 hemorrhages occurred prospectively yielding a 10.4% per year (95% CI, 7.5-14.0) risk of hemorrhage while not pregnant. No hemorrhages occurred during 32 prospective pregnancies (26 live births including 1 twinset and 7 nonviable fetuses) after CM diagnosis during 26.9 years of pregnancy time yielding a rate of 0% per year (95% CI, 0-13.6). We found no statistical difference in the rates of hemorrhage during pregnant and nonpregnant time (P=0.09). No hemorrhage occurred during delivery. CONCLUSIONS Our prospective data suggest that pregnancy does not increase the risk of hemorrhage in women with a known brain or spinal cord CM and that vaginal delivery is safe in appropriate candidates.","Joseph, Nycole K; Kumar, Shivram; Brown, Robert D; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Flemming, Kelly D",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493052/,139

Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing diffcult or impractical in combating the outbreak. METHODS We consider the development of multi-scale public health strategies that act on individual and community levels. We simulate policies for community-level response aimed at early screening all members of a community, as well as travel restrictions to prevent inter-community transmission. RESULTS Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance and for a variety of local and long range contact transmission networks. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas. DISCUSSION Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.","Wong, Vincent; Cooney, Daniel; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",PLoS currents,https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.322427f4c3cc2b9c1a5b3395e7d20894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27486552/,139

74364,"Early Transmissibility Assessment of a Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China.",2020-01-24,"BACKGROUND Biomarker assays are often conducted on whole blood samples in the course of drug development studies. Because bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin) contamination is known to cause spontaneous cytokine production by monocytes, contamination of blood collection tubes may interfere with biomarker assay results. METHODS Whole blood from healthy donors was collected into plastic or glass sodium (Na(+))-heparin Vacutainer() blood collection tubes and heparinized syringes. Samples were analyzed for phosphoprotein response, cytokine production, and RNA expression. Tubes were tested for endotoxin contamination by use of the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. RESULTS Results of phospho-flow cytometry, branched DNA (bDNA), and ELISA assays indicated that a specific lot (#5339582) of plastic Na(+)-heparin Vacutainer tubes was highly contaminated with an endotoxinlike substance, and contamination was confirmed by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Analysis of multiple-analyte panels revealed that analytes whose changed expression was predictive of LPS stimulation were increased when whole blood was incubated in contaminated tubes for 6 or 18 h. Two additional lots of plastic tubes tested had detectable amounts of endotoxin sufficient to strongly alter phospho-flow cytometry analyses, as determined by the fold change in phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha and LPS. In contrast, 3 lots of glass tubes had substantially lower levels of spontaneous blood activation. CONCLUSIONS Endotoxin contamination associated with tubes from 3 lots of a particular type of plastic Na(+)-heparin Vacutainer tube dramatically affected biomarker assay measurements. Prescreening these tubes is suggested before their use in clinical sample analysis.","Newhall, Kathryn J; Diemer, Geoffrey S; Leshinsky, Natalia; Kerkof, Keith; Chute, Hilary T; Russell, Chris B; Rees, William; Welcher, Andrew A; Patterson, Scott D; Means, Gary D",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2006.144618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663962/,139

75044,A Review of the Current State of Liver Transplantation Disparities.,2020-12-07,"PURPOSE The red-hair phenotype, which is often produced by mutations in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene, has been associated with an increase in sedative, anesthetic, and analgesic requirements in both animal and human studies. Nevertheless, the clinical implications of this phenomenon in red-haired patients undergoing surgery are currently unknown. METHODS In a secondary analysis of a prospective trial of intraoperative awareness, red-haired patients were identified and matched with five control patients, and the relative risk for intraoperative awareness was determined. Overall anesthetic management between groups was compared using Hotelling's T(2) statistic. Inhaled anesthetic requirements were compared between cohorts by evaluating the relationship between end-tidal anesthetic concentration and the bispectral index with a linear mixed-effects model. Time to recovery was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differences in postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting were evaluated with Chi square tests. RESULTS A cohort of 319 red-haired patients was matched with 1,595 control patients for a sample size of 1,914. There were no significant differences in the relative risk of intraoperative awareness (relative risk = 1.67; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 8.22), anesthetic management, recovery times, or postoperative pain between red-haired patients and control patients. The relationship between pharmacokinetically stable volatile anesthetic concentrations and bispectral index values differed significantly between red-haired patients and controls (P < 0.001), but without clinical implications. CONCLUSION There were no demonstrable differences between red-haired patients and controls in response to anesthetic and analgesic agents or in recovery parameters. These findings suggest that perioperative anesthetic and analgesic management should not be altered based on self-reported red-hair phenotype.","Gradwohl, Stephen C; Aranake, Amrita; Abdallah, Arbi Ben; McNair, Paul; Lin, Nan; Fritz, Bradley A; Villafranca, Alex; Glick, David; Jacobsohn, Eric; Mashour, George A; Avidan, Michael S",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-014-0305-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681040/,139

Emergency clinicians are routinely in the position of applying new evidence in clinical practice. With an ever-increasing volume of evidence generated, this can be problematic when studies are conducted in different settings, and include different patient groups, different interventions and different outcomes. This is made even more difficult when the results of primary research studies do not agree. Systematic reviews are becoming increasingly valuable as they appraise and synthesise research findings using a clear methodology, and summarise the results of primary studies. As such, systematic reviews help translate research findings into clinical practice.

The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reform should be based on evidence and achieved without increasing administrative complexity.","Kisely, Steve; Looi, Jeffrey Cl",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420951255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847374/,139

75771,Medication discrepancies in hospitalized cancer patients: Do we need medication reconciliation?,2020-08-02,"Background Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a collective term for a group of inflammatory conditions of uncertain origin, which causes chronic arthritis in one or more joints. The clinical course of JIA is characterised by episodes of increased activity, termed flares. Vaccinations have previously been proposed as a ""trigger"" for some flares, although evidence supporting this is scant. Objective To explore whether routine childhood vaccinations are associated with an increased risk of flares of arthritis activity in children with JIA. Methods Patients aged below 6 years with a diagnosis of JIA were recruited from the Rheumatology Clinical Database at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, from 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2016. Patient immunisation status was cross-checked with the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The self-controlled case series methodology (Rowhani-Rahbar et al., 2012) was applied to determine whether the risk of arthritis flares in the three months following immunisation was greater than the baseline risk for each patient. Results 138 patients were included in the study. 32 arthritis flares occurred in the 90 days following immunisation. The risk of arthritis flares during the 90 days following immunisation was reduced compared with patients' baseline risk (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.89, p = 0.012)). Conclusion Routine childhood immunisations were not associated with arthritis flare onset in patients with JIA. The risk of arthritis flares in the 90 days following vaccination was lower than the baseline risk. In the context of COVID19, vaccination will not increase interaction with the healthcare system beyond the immunisation encounter.","Alfayadh, Naba M; Gowdie, Peter J; Akikusa, Jonathan D; Easton, Mee Lee; Buttery, Jim P",International journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1078914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831849/,139

Some bacteria that grow poorly or not at all in axenic media used in routine clinical bacteriology laboratory but which can develop inside amoebae may be the agents of these lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of unexplained aetiology. Such amoebae-resisting bacteria, which coevolved with amoebae to resist their microbicidal machinery, may have developed virulence traits that help them survive within human macrophages, i.e. the first line of innate immune defence in the lung. We review here the current evidence for the emerging pathogenic role of various amoebae-resisting microorganisms as agents of RTIs in humans. Specifically, we discuss the emerging pathogenic roles of Legionella-like amoebal pathogens, novel Chlamydiae (Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, Simkania negevensis), waterborne mycobacteria and Bradyrhizobiaceae (Bosea and Afipia spp.).","Lamoth, Frédéric; Greub, Gilbert",FEMS microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00207.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20113355/,139

We present examples of communicable diseases with inequitable distribution among those with poor educational attainment, low income, or other socioeconomic factors in every European country. Because these findings are incompatible with social justice and fairness, we examine strategic interventions targeting upstream causes of communicable disease transmission keeping in mind 10 indispensable public health functions essential to reach marginalized groups.

77456,Synergy between cytokines and risk factors in the cytokine storm of Covid-19: protection from the chronic use of cytokine inhibitors?,2020-07-28,"INTRODUCTION Noninvasive hematocrit monitoring (NIVHM) during pediatric hemodialysis (pedHD) provides data in real time regarding changes in hematocrit and blood volume and also provides venous oxygen saturations. The latter has been proposed to indicate changes in tissue oxygen consumption. It is not known how well NIVHM oxygen saturations (O2sat) approximate blood gas measured oximetry saturation (mO2sat) in the course of pedHD. We aimed to assess the validity and reliability of NIVHM O2sat compared to mO2sat. METHODS This is a prospective study in 15 patients <21 years old with >90 days on hemodialysis (HD) without congenital heart disease. HD access was fistula (AVF) in 4 patients and tunneled catheters in the remainder. Pulse oximetry (spO2) was continuously monitored; mO2sat was measured via oximetry in a blood gas analyzer and NIVHM O2sat values collected at the start, middle, and end of HD treatment. RESULTS A total of 45 dyad measurements were obtained. NIVHM O2sat correlated well with mO2sat (R = 0.89, p < 0.0001); the same was seen at pre, mid, and post HD time points (R = 0.86-0.95, p < 0.001). NIVHM O2sat was lower than mO2sat; with catheter as access, the difference was 9.3 ± 8.6 (CI: 12.3-6.22, p < 0.0001) and with AVF was 2.1 ± 0.78 (CI: 2.6-1.7, p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated the difference but did not show any systematic bias. Continuous monitor of spO2 showed no hypoxia. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Intradialytic NIVHM O2sat correlates well with mO2sat but yield lower values. Future studies can include NIVHM O2sat changes as a surrogate for central venous O2 saturation changes and potentially yield useful information regarding tissue oxygen consumption in pedHD patients.","Idrovo, Alexandra; Geer, Jessica; Solomon, Catharina H; Devaraj, Sridevi; Swartz, Sarah J; Akcan-Arikan, Ayse; Srivaths, Poyyapakkam R",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000508059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640449/,139
77568,The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons lung metastasectomy project.,2010,"BACKGROUND The way in which different communities respond to similar threats to their health can vary, from outrage to indifference and public health agencies are often taken by surprise leading to potential loss of public confidence. The objective of this systematic literature review was to seek to better understand the community-level drivers that might explain the variability in response. METHODS A vigorous systematic cross-disciplinary literature review was undertaken searching thirteen bibliographic databases and a variety of grey sources were screened. The social amplification of risk framework and the risk perception management theoretical models were used to assess evidence and data were synthesised by Narrative review. FINDINGS Sixteen studies meeting the agreed inclusion criteria described eleven different threats ranging from: infectious disease outbreaks to environmental disasters to cancer clusters, affecting two or more communities were identified from medical, psychological, social science and environmental science literature. There was wide heterogeneity between the type and quality of the studies. There was a general absence of theoretical underpinning community responses. Most studies did not report sufficient data to allow an appropriate amount of validity. Very low response rates in particular were common. Potential explanatory drivers suggested included, prior experience and visibility of threat, sociodemographic characteristics, volume and type of media coverage, government reaction and availability of social support. CONCLUSIONS This review confirmed that there are significant differences. Further work is needed to develop theoretical models that apply to the community level and do not assume that a community's response is simply the aggregate of individual level responses.","Greene, Giles; Turley, Ruth; Mann, Mala; Amlôt, Richard; Page, Lisa; Palmer, Stephen",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.10.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24184553/,139

Observational longitudinal study. Participants living in France or Switzerland responded to online questionnaires measuring physical activity, physical and mental health, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during lockdown. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate associations between changes in physical activity and changes in mental and physical health during lockdown. 267 (wave1) and 110 participants (wave2; 2 weeks later) were recruited. Lockdown resulted in higher time spent in walking and moderate physical activity (~10min/day) and in sedentary behaviour (~75min/day), compared to pre COVID-19. Increased physical activity during leisure time from week 2 to week 4 of lockdown was associated with improved physical health (β=.24, p=.002). Additionally, an increase in sedentary behaviour during leisure time was associated with poorer physical health (β=-.35, p=.002), mental health (β=-.25, p=.003), and subjective vitality (β=-.30, p=.004). Ensuring sufficient levels of physical activity and reducing sedentary time can play a vital role in helping people to cope with a major stressful event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheval, Boris; Sivaramakrishnan, Hamsini; Maltagliati, Silvio; Fessler, Layan; Forestier, Cyril; Sarrazin, Philippe; Orsholits, Dan; Chalabaev, Aïna; Sander, David; Ntoumanis, Nikos; Boisgontier, Matthieu P",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1841396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118469/,139

A substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic; however, symptomatic cases might present with fever, cough, and dyspnoea or severe symptoms up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, RNA RT-PCR is the screening tool, while bilateral chest CT is the confirmatory clinical diagnostic test. Several drugs have been repurposed to treat COVID-19, including chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, and EIDD-1931. Recently, Remdesivir gained FDA emergency approval based on promising early findings from the interim analysis of 1063 patients. The recently developed serology testing for SARSCoV-2 antibodies opened the door to evaluate the actual burden of the disease and to determine the rate of the population who have been previously infected (or developed immunity).

78733,Update on antimalarials and systemic lupus erythematosus.,2020-09-02,"CLINICAL QUESTION What is the role of drug interventions in the treatment and prevention of covid-19? RECOMMENDATIONS The first version on this living guidance focuses on corticosteroids. It contains a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical covid-19, and a weak or conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe covid-19. Corticosteroids are inexpensive and are on the World Health Organisation list of essential medicines. HOW: this guideline was created This guideline reflects an innovative collaboration between the WHO and the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation, driven by an urgent need for global collaboration to provide trustworthy and living covid-19 guidance. A standing international panel of content experts, patients, clinicians, and methodologists, free from relevant conflicts of interest, produce recommendations for clinical practice. The panel follows standards, methods, processes, and platforms for trustworthy guideline development using the GRADE approach. We apply an individual patient perspective while considering contextual factors (that is, resources, feasibility, acceptability, equity) for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE A living systematic review and network meta-analysis, supported by a prospective meta-analysis, with data from eight randomised trials (7184 participants) found that systemic corticosteroids probably reduce 28 day mortality in patients with critical covid-19 (moderate certainty evidence; 87 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval 124 fewer to 41 fewer)), and also in those with severe disease (moderate certainty evidence; 67 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (100 fewer to 27 fewer)). In contrast, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of death in patients without severe covid-19 (low certainty evidence; absolute effect estimate 39 more per 1000 patients, (12 fewer to 107 more)). Systemic corticosteroids probably reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and harms are likely to be minor (indirect evidence). UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS The panel made a strong recommendation for use of corticosteroids in severe and critical covid-19 because there is a lower risk of death among people treated with systemic corticosteroids (moderate certainty evidence), and they believe that all or almost all fully informed patients with severe and critical covid-19 would choose this treatment. In contrast, the panel concluded that patients with non-severe covid-19 would decline this treatment because they would be unlikely to benefit and may be harmed. Moreover, taking both a public health and a patient perspective, the panel warned that indiscriminate use of any therapy for covid-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive patients who may benefit from it most as potentially lifesaving therapy. UPDATES This is a living guideline. Work is under way to evaluate other interventions. New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline. READERS NOTE This is version 1 of the living guideline, published on 4 September (BMJ 2020;370:m3379) version 1.

78772,Chylovenous bypass for mesenteric lymphangiomatosis: A case report.,2020-07-15,"Background - Based on inhibition of viral replication and limited reports on clinical efficacy, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is being considered as prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Although HCQ is generally considered safe during pregnancy based on studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematous and other rheumatic conditions, there may still be reluctance to institute this antimalarial during pregnancy for the sole purpose of antiviral therapy. Methods - To provide data regarding any potential fetal/neonatal cardiotoxicity, we leveraged a unique opportunity in which neonatal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and HCQ blood levels were available in a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of HCQ 400mg daily to prevent the recurrence of congenital heart block associated with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Results - Forty-five ECGs were available for QTc measurement, and levels of HCQ were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and in the cord blood, providing unambiguous assurance of drug exposure. Overall, there was no correlation between cord blood levels of HCQ and the neonatal QTc (R = 0.02, P = 0.86) or the mean of HCQ values obtained throughout each individual pregnancy and the QTc (R = 0.04, P = 0.80). In total 5 (11%; 95% CI: 4% - 24%) neonates had prolongation of the QTc > 2SD above historical healthy controls (2 markedly and 3 marginally) but ECGs were otherwise normal. Conclusions - In aggregate, these data provide reassurances that the maternal use of HCQ is associated with a low incidence of infant QTc prolongation. However, if included in clinical COVID-19 studies, early postnatal ECGs should be considered.","Friedman, Deborah M; Kim, Mimi; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie; Clancy, Robert; Copel, Joshua; Phoon, Colin K; Cuneo, Bettina; Cohen, Rebecca; Masson, Mala; Wainwright, Benjamin J; Zahr, Noel; Saxena, Amit; Izmirly, Peter; Buyon, Jill P",Circulation.

METHODS We propose a reproducible method for creating high-resolution, quantitative slice phantoms. The phantoms are created using gels with different concentrations of NiCl2 and MnCl2 to achieve targeted T1 and T2 values. We describe a calibration method for accurately targeting anatomically realistic relaxation pairs. In addition, we developed a method of fabricating slice phantoms by extruding 3D printed walls on acrylic sheets. These procedures are combined to create a physical analog of the Brainweb digital phantom. RESULTS With our method, we are able to target specific T1 /T2 values with less than 10% error. Additionally, our slice phantoms look realistic since their geometries are derived from anatomical data. CONCLUSION Standardized and accurate tools for validating new techniques across sequences, platforms, and different imaging sites are important. Anatomy mimicking, multi-contrast phantoms designed with our procedures could be used for evaluating, testing, and verifying model-based methods.","Gopalan, Karthik; Tamir, Jonathan I; Arias, Ana C; Lustig, Michael",Magnetic resonance in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738824/,139

This was a prospective, single-center, case series of 250 consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent a Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between May 2015 and April 2019. Our primary objective was to report post-operative continence outcomes of patients undergoing this technique. Continence was defined as using zero or one precautionary pad per day. Median follow-up was 24.0 months [interquartile range (IQR) 18.0-30.0 months]. Median age and body mass index were 62.0 years (IQR 57.0-67.0) and 29.0 kg/m2 (IQR 26.0-33.0), respectively. Median PSA was 8.22 ng/ml (IQR 5.74-13.31). 84.8% of patients were intermediate risk or high risk pre-operatively, as per AUA/ASTRO/SUO guidelines. 96.0% had Gleason Score 7 or worse disease on final pathologic analysis. Positive margin incidence was 18.1% and 44.4% in patients with pT2 and pT3 disease, respectively, of which 75.4% were unifocal. Immediate continence (i.e., continence achieved within 1 month post-operatively) was achieved in 45.2% of patients. Three-month and 1-year continence rates were 70.0% and 92.0%, respectively. Caucasian patients experienced earlier return of continence (77% versus 65% at 3 months) compared to African American patients. IPSS scores gradually improved from 8.0 pre-operatively to 4.0 1-year later. Median PSA level was 0.01 ng/ml (IQR 0.01-9.01) post-operatively. Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is an oncologically safe surgical technique with excellent short- and long-term continence outcomes.

79425,Early and unrestricted access to high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies: a consensus to optimize benefits for people living with multiple sclerosis.,2021-10-09,"BACKGROUND Preterm infants are at risk for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. No therapy exists to treat this brain injury and subsequent long-term sequelae. We have previously shown in a well-established pre-clinical model of global hypoxia-ischemia (HI) that mesenchymal stem cells are a promising candidate for the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective capacity of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC®), which are adherent bone marrow-derived cells of an earlier developmental stage than mesenchymal stem cells and exhibiting more potent anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. METHODS Instrumented preterm sheep fetuses were subjected to global hypoxia-ischemia by 25 min of umbilical cord occlusion at a gestational age of 106 (term ~147) days. During a 7-day reperfusion period, vital parameters (e.g., blood pressure and heart rate; baroreceptor reflex) and (amplitude-integrated) electroencephalogram were recorded. At the end of the experiment, the preterm brain was studied by histology. RESULTS Systemic administration of MAPC therapy reduced the number and duration of seizures and prevented decrease in baroreflex sensitivity after global HI. In addition, MAPC cells prevented HI-induced microglial proliferation in the preterm brain. These anti-inflammatory effects were associated with MAPC-induced prevention of hypomyelination after global HI. Besides attenuation of the cerebral inflammatory response, our findings showed that MAPC cells modulated the peripheral splenic inflammatory response, which has been implicated in the etiology of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the preterm brain. CONCLUSIONS In a pre-clinical animal model MAPC cell therapy improved the functional and structural outcome of the preterm brain after global HI. Future studies should establish the mechanism and long-term therapeutic effects of neuroprotection established by MAPC cells in the developing preterm brain exposed to HI. Our study may form the basis for future clinical trials, which will evaluate whether MAPC therapy is capable of reducing neurological sequelae in preterm infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.","Jellema, Reint K; Ophelders, Daan R M G; Zwanenburg, Alex; Nikiforou, Maria; Delhaas, Tammo; Andriessen, Peter; Mays, Robert W; Deans, Robert; Germeraad, Wilfred T V; Wolfs, Tim G A M; Kramer, Boris W",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0459-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700169/,139

IPAA in the elderly has been reported as safe and feasible, but little work to date has assessed outcomes by procedure. The aim of our study was to assess use and short-term outcomes of 2- and 3-stage IPAA in older adults. METHODS The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Database was searched for ≥ 65-year-old patients who underwent IPAA for UC in 2- or 3-stage from 2012 to 2016. The primary endpoint was the rate and trends of the two approaches over time. Secondary endpoints included 30-day adverse events and complication-associated costs. RESULTS Overall, 123 patients were included: 77.5% (n = 83) 2-stage and 40 (32.5%) 3-stage IPAA. Mean age was 68.7 ± 3.9 years, with 43 (34.9%) women. The use of the 3-stage IPAA increased over time (18.8% in 2012 vs. 33.3% in 2016), with decreasing use of 2-stage IPAA (81.3% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.001). The morbidity associated with the procedures decreased over time, overall (81.3% in 2012 and 51.5% in 2016, p < 0.001) and in each group individually. No differences were observed in postoperative complications across groups (45.8% 2-stage, 32.5% 3-stage). The overall mean costs of care when no postoperative complications occurred was $25,910, vs. $38,577 when any complication occurred (p < 0.001), but no differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSION In a national analysis, there was a trend of increasing 3-stage vs. 2-stage IPAA for UC in older Americans. Complications and complication-associated costs were comparable across approaches, suggesting that the choice of procedure type should be based on the specific patient comorbidities and surgeon preferences.","Pellino, G; Reif de Paula, T; Lawlor, G; Keller, D S",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02315-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767169/,139
80091,Comparison of barbed suture versus traditional suture in laparoendoscopic single-site myomectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Hospital falls remain a frequent and debilitating problem worldwide. Most hospital falls prevention strategies have targeted clinician education, environmental modifications, assistive devices, hospital systems and medication reviews. The role that patients can play in preventing falls whilst in hospital has received less attention. This critical review scopes patient falls education interventions for hospitals. The quality of the educational designs under-pinning patient falls education programmes was also evaluated. The outcomes of patient-centred falls prevention programs were considered for a range of hospital settings and diagnoses. METHODS The Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework for scoping reviews was adapted using Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases, including grey literature, were searched from January 2008 until February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and data were extracted and summarised thematically. The quality of falls prevention education programs for patients was also appraised using a modified quality metric tool. RESULTS Forty-three articles were included in the final analysis. The interventions included: (i) direct face-to-face patient education about falls risks and mitigation; (ii) educational tools; (iii) patient-focussed consumer materials such as pamphlets, brochures and handouts; and (iv) hospital systems, policies and procedures to assist patients to prevent falls. The included studies assessed falls or education related outcomes before and after patient falls prevention education. Few studies reported incorporating education design principles or educational theories. When reported, most educational programs were of low to moderate quality from an educational design perspective. CONCLUSIONS There is emerging evidence that hospital falls prevention interventions that incorporate patient education can reduce falls and associated injuries such as bruising, lacerations or fractures. The design, mode of delivery and quality of educational design influence outcomes. Well-designed education programs can improve knowledge and self-perception of risk, empowering patients to reduce their risk of falling whilst in hospital.","Heng, Hazel; Jazayeri, Dana; Shaw, Louise; Kiegaldie, Debra; Hill, Anne-Marie; Morris, Meg E",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01515-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293298/,139

The purpose of this study was to evaluate initial Danish experiences with robot-assisted anti-reflux surgery compared to conventional laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery incorporating follow-up and evaluation of possible learning curve. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients undergoing primary RAAS or CLAS at The Department of Surgery A, Odense University Hospital and The Department of General Surgery, Kolding Hospital from April 2013 to April 2015 was included. Demographic data, comorbidity, docking time, length of procedure, type of fundic wrap as well as perioperative complications and postoperative complications, need for reoperation or any upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from surgery to final follow-up was retrospectively extracted from patient records. RESULTS 103 patients were included in this study. 39 patients underwent RAAS and 64 patients underwent CLAS. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data or comorbidities except distribution of heart disease (RAAS: 5.1% vs. CLAS: 18.8%, p = 0.05) and previous abdominal surgery (RAAS: 28.2% vs. CLAS: 48.4%, p = 0.04). Duration of surgery was significantly increased in patients undergoing RAAS (RAAS: 135 ± 27 min vs. CLAS: 86 ± 19 min, p < 0.01). There was no statistical significant difference in intraoperative complications (p = 0.20), 30-day postoperative complication rate (p = 0.20) or mortality (p = 1.00). At follow-up in April 2016, there were no statistically significant differences in patients having undergone upper endoscopy postoperatively (p = 0.92), the use of anti-secretory drugs (p = 0.46) or patients having undergone reoperation (p = 0.60). Reasons for reoperation were significantly dependent on type of fundic wrap with reoperation of Nissen fundoplication being dysphagia and reoperation of Toupet being recurrent reflux (p = 0.008). There was no clearly determined learning curve. CONCLUSIONS RAAS was safe, feasible and with equal efficacy to CLAS. There were however no particular advantages to performing antireflux surgery as robot-assisted procedures neither intra-operatively nor at follow-up.","Jensen, Jonas Sanberg; Antonsen, Henning Kold; Durup, Jesper",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28216290/,139
80456,"Novel coronavirus(Covid19), Its renal manifestations, and complications.",2020-09-13,"PURPOSE Single-port laparoscopic surgery has the intention to further minimize the access trauma similar to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. While special trocars and instruments are needed, the spectrum of clinical indications corresponds to the conventional laparoscopic surgery. This review gives an overview of the current applications and advances in single-port laparoscopic surgery. METHODS The PubMed database was searched for ""single incision laparoscopic surgery"" or ""single port"" and different operations (e.g., cholecystectomy, colectomy, and appendectomy). The references and our own experiences were considered for historic development and current advances. RESULTS The spreading of single-port laparoscopic surgery is not as fast as expected. References show that operations using a single-port technique are feasible, safe, and efficient. More technical difficulties for the surgeon and higher costs must be considered. A better cosmetic result, less postoperative pain, and a faster recovery could be potential benefits for the patients. CONCLUSIONS Current advances in single-port laparoscopic surgery are difficult to define. The most common procedures are single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies, colectomies, and appendectomies. Significant clinical benefits have not yet been proven even in prospective, randomized studies.","Carus, Th",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-013-1113-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037311/,139

METHODS A decision analytic model using the Markov process was developed covering cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and surgical complications. Clinical effectiveness and safety were based on the literature and data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. Gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were included in the analysis. Cost data were obtained from Swedish sources. RESULTS Bariatric surgery was cost saving in comparison with conservative management. It also led to a substantial reduction in lifetime risk of events: from a 16 % reduction in the risk of transient ischaemic attacks to a 62 % reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of euro 8408 and generated an additional 0.8 years of life and 4.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, which translates into gains of 32,390 quality-adjusted person-years and savings of euro 66 million for the cohort, operated in 2012. Analysis of the consequences of a 3-year delay in surgery provision showed that the overall lifetime cost of treatment may be increased in patients with diabetes or a body mass index >40 kg/m(2). Delays in surgery may also lead to a loss of clinical benefits: up to 0.6 life years and 1.2 QALYs per patient over a lifetime. CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery, over a lifetime horizon, may lead to significant cost savings to health care systems in addition to the known clinical benefits.","Borisenko, Oleg; Adam, Daniel; Funch-Jensen, Peter; Ahmed, Ahmed R; Zhang, Rongrong; Colpan, Zeynep; Hedenbro, Jan",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1567-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25639648/,139

The first prospective study consisted of 75 patients with COVID-19 who were ready for discharge and who had 2 consecutive negative results per nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of viral samples retrieved with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs). Because of detection of potential false negatives in that cohort, the NAAT results of paired OS and NPS samples from 50 additional recruits with COVID-19 during their recovery stage were used in a second prospective study to compare the diagnostic values of the 2 viral RNA sampling methods. For identification of the frequency of inconsistency between the sampling methods, the McNemar's test was used for difference analysis and the kappa statistic for consistency analysis. OSs obtained from 2 of the 75 participants in the first study yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Both were male and aged >60 y. Subsequent chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays indicated that they were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. For parallel NAAT of OS and NPS samples in the second study, McNemar's test indicated that the difference between the frequencies of inconsistent parts of OS and NPS was statistically significant (P = 0.021). Cohen's kappa coefficient for OS and NPS was 0.244, which is indicative of fair consistency. The NPS test has a risk of sending home more patients (59%) who still have the infection, while the OS test will make such an error in fewer patients (14%). Although OS sampling improves the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, it has to be emphasized that this conclusion is based on a very small sample size. Detection of viral RNA from a patient's secretions is not confirmative of viral infectivity.","Yu, C; Li, L; Tuersun, Y; Zhao, X; Feng, Q; Zhang, T; Tay, F R; Ma, J",Journal of dental research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034520940292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32613877/,139
81326,Collateral flow as causative of good outcomes in endovascular stroke therapy.,2016,"T-cell-dependent immunity in the central nervous system (CNS) is beneficial for neuroprotection, neurogenesis and even behavior. As a highly specialized site, the CNS is speculated to possess the means to maintain T-cell immune responses through its own resident cells. Therefore, we investigated whether microglia, the most potent antigen-presenting cells residing in the CNS, could sustain T-cell responses in vitro. We showed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-activated microglia (MG(IFN-gamma)) inducibly expressed an important immune co-stimulatory molecule, OX40 ligand (OX40L). Co-culture of activated CD4(+) T cells with MG(IFN-gamma) significantly increased T-cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, and these effects were markedly inhibited by addition of a neutralizing anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody. In addition, ligation of OX40L in MG(IFN-gamma) enhanced their production of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). These results suggest that the expression of OX40L in microglia provides a molecular basis for the maintenance of T-cell survival, expansion of T cells and increased secretion of remedial growth factor from MG(IFN-gamma), which may contribute to the protective effect in the CNS.","Wang, Yanyan; Li, Maoquan; Song, Min; Xu, Xueqing; Xiong, Jiaxiang; Yang, Xiaoya; Tan, Jun; Bai, Yun",Cellular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2008.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18485335/,139

81926,Response of an oncology unit in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak.,2020-10-22,"Background - Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising new non-thermal ablation technology for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Experimental data suggest that IRE ablation produces large enough lesions without the risk of PV stenosis, artery, nerve or esophageal damage. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of single pulse IRE PV isolation in patients with AF. Methods - Ten patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF underwent single pulse IRE PV isolation under general anesthesia. Three-dimensional reconstruction and electroanatomical voltage mapping (EnSite PrecisionTM, Abbott) of left atrium and PVs were performed using a conventional circular mapping catheter. PV isolation was performed by delivering non-arcing, non-barotraumatic 6 ms, 200 J direct current IRE applications via a custom non-deflectable 14-polar circular IRE ablation catheter with a variable hoop diameter (16-27 mm). A deflectable sheath (AgilisTM, Abbott) was used to maneuver the ablation catheter. A minimum of two IRE applications with slightly different catheter positions were delivered per vein to achieve circular tissue contact, even if PV potentials were abolished after the first application. Bidirectional PV isolation was confirmed with the circular mapping catheter and a post ablation voltage map. After a 30-minute waiting period, adenosine testing (30 mg) was used to reveal dormant PV conduction. Results - All 40 PVs could be successfully isolated with a mean of 2.4±0.4 IRE applications per PV. Mean delivered peak voltage and peak current were 2154 ± 59 V and 33.9 ± 1.6 A, respectively. No PV reconnections occurred during the waiting period and adenosine testing. No periprocedural complications were observed. Conclusions - In the 10 patients of this first-in-human study, acute bidirectional electrical PV isolation could be achieved safely by single pulse IRE ablation.","Loh, Peter; van Es, René; Groen, Marijn H A; Neven, Kars; Kassenberg, Wil; Wittkampf, Fred H M; Doevendans, Pieter A F M",Circulation.

82101,"[Treatment of postoperative anterior mediastinitis, sternal osteomyelitis in a patient with a novel coronavirus infection].",2021,"ABSTRACT Adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) were initially reported as complications associated with metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings; however, there is increasing concern regarding the occurrence of adverse local tissue reactions from mechanically assisted crevice corrosion (MACC) at the femoral head-neck junction or between other modular junctions of the implant containing cobalt chromium parts in patients with metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearings. ALTR due to MACC at the head-neck junction has primarily been reported in association with cobalt chromium alloy femoral heads. As pain following total hip arthroplasty may have various intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a systematic approach to evaluation (risk stratification algorithm) based on the currently available data is recommended to optimize patient management. Evaluation should begin by ruling out common causes of pain, including component loosening and periprosthetic joint infection. While specialized tests such as blood metal analysis and metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MARS MRI) are useful modalities in evaluating for ALTRs, over-reliance on any single investigative tool in the clinical decision-making process should be avoided. There should be a low threshold to perform a systematic evaluation for ALTR due to MACC in patients with metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty as early recognition and diagnosis is critical, as delays in appropriate treatment initiation may result in soft-tissue damage, which complicates surgical treatment and is associated with a higher risk of complications and poorer patient outcomes.","Kwon, Young-Min; Della Valle, Craig J; Lombardi, Adolph V; Garbuz, Donald S; Berry, Daniel J; Jacobs, Joshua J",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The rapid spread of this viral infection, along with many of its unknown aspects, has posed new challenges to the health care systems. The main challenging effects of COVID-19 are rapid dissemination through close contact and varying clinical severity among different individuals. Furthermore, the medical staff in endemic areas are becoming exhausted and deal with a considerable level of job burnout, which can negatively affect their medical decision making. Also, due to the variable pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, some physicians may misdiagnose patients. To overcome these issues, we proposed a web-based software to aid physicians in detecting possible COVID-19 cases through online consultation with different specialists and educate the not-well experienced physicians.

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are responsible for detoxification of these aldehydes protecting the cell.Due to the physiological relevance of these enzymes, it is important to design strategies to modulate their activity. It was previously reported that omeprazole activation of ALDH1A1 protected Escherichia coli cells overexpresing this enzyme, from oxidative stress generated by H2 O2 . In this work, omeprazole cell protection potential was evaluated in eukaryotic cells. AS-30D cell or hepatocytes suspensions were subjected to a treatment with omeprazole and exposure to light, (that is required to activate omeprazole in the active site of ALDH) and then exposed to H2 O2 . Cells showed viability similar to control cells, total activity of ALDH was preserved, while cell levels of lipid aldehydes and oxidative stress markers were maintained low. Cell protection by omeprazole was avoided by inhibition of ALDHs with disulfiram, revealing the key role of these enzymes in the protection. Additionally, omeprazole also preserved ALDH2 (mitochondrial isoform) activity, diminishing lipid aldehydes levels and oxidative stress in this organelle, protecting mitochondrial respiration and transmembrane potential formation capacity, from the stress generated by H2 O2 . These results highlight the important role of ALDHs as part of the antioxidant system of the cell, since if the activity of these enzymes decreases under stress conditions, the viability of the cell is compromised.","Calleja, Luis Francisco; Yoval-Sánchez, Belem; Hernández-Esquivel, Luz; Gallardo-Pérez, Juan Carlos; Sosa-Garrocho, Marcela; Marín-Hernández, Álvaro; Jasso-Chávez, Ricardo; Macías-Silva, Marina; Rodríguez-Zavala, José Salud",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400378/,139

Among the reasons for this failure are methodological flaws in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Their successful resolution might provide a brighter perspective for future studies.

82956,Interstitial pneumonitis and myelosuppression associated to mitomycin C urinary tract instillations: A case report.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Increasing thrombus length (TL) impedes recanalization after intravenous (IV) thrombolysis. We sought to determine whether the clinical benefit of aspiration thrombectomy relative to IV r-tPA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) may be greater at longer TL. METHODS THERAPY was a randomized trial of aspiration thrombectomy plus IV r-tPA versus IV r-tPA alone in large-vessel stroke patients with prospective TL measurement ≥8 mm. In this post hoc study, we evaluated the association of TL with trial end points and potential endovascular treatment effect, using univariate, multivariable, and multiplicative interaction analyses. RESULTS TL data were available for all 108 patients (28% internal carotid artery, 62% M1, and 10% M2). Median TL was 14.0 mm (interquartile range, 9.7-19.5 mm). Longer TL was associated with worse outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale score: odds ratio, 1.24 per 5-mm TL increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.52; P=0.02), even after adjusting for key outcome predictors (adjusted P=0.004). Longer TL was also associated with more serious adverse events (adjusted P=0.01), more symptomatic hemorrhages (adjusted P=0.03), and increased mortality (adjusted P=0.01). No significant relationship was observed between TL and angiographic reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b-3), but greater TL was associated with longer endovascular procedural times (ρ=0.36; P=0.045). Increasing TL was associated with greater aspiration thrombectomy treatment effect (interaction term P=0.03). This might be related to a potentially stronger adverse effect of increasing TL on 90-day modified Rankin Scale for patients treated with IV r-tPA (ρ=0.39; P=0.01) compared with intra-arterial therapy (ρ=0.20; P=0.165). CONCLUSIONS Ischemic stroke patients with longer symptomatic thrombi have worse 90-day clinical outcomes but may have a greater relative benefit of aspiration thrombectomy over IV r-tPA alone.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between February 2013 and August 2014, 17 children [13 girls and four boys, with a median (range) age of 60 (24-120) months] presented with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and were diagnosed with unilateral VUR. They underwent transperitoneal extravesical laparoscopic ureteric re-implantation following the Lich-Gregoir technique. Postoperatively abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was done at 1 month after surgery and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) at 3 months after surgery, and in cases with persistent VUR or de novo contralateral VUR another VCUG was done at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS The median (range) operative time was 90 (80-120) min and the postoperative hospital stay was 2 (2-5) days. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were minimal. Patients were followed-up for a median (range) of 6 (3-21) months. All the children had complete resolution symptomatically and on VCUG, without further intervention. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic extravesical transperitoneal approach for ureteric re-implantation, following the Lich-Gregoir technique, is feasible and very effective in the management of VUR.

We reviewed 464 patients with CLI who underwent diagnostic angiography or endovascular intervention from 2006-2013 at a multidisciplinary vascular center. ACEI or ARB use was assessed at the time of angiography. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), mortality, and major adverse limb events (MALE) were assessed during three-year follow-up. Propensity weighting was used to adjust for baseline differences between patients taking and not taking ACEIs or ARBs. ACEIs or ARBs were prescribed to 269 (58%) patients. Patients prescribed ACEIs or ARBs had more baseline comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension (p<0.05). Patients prescribed ACEIs or ARBs had lower three-year unadjusted rates of MACE (40% versus 47%) and mortality (33% versus 43%).

83730,Staying hepatitis C negative: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cure and reinfection in people who inject drugs.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Fibrocollagen-covered polyester meshes can be used as possible substitutions for tracheal segments if they become integrated into the tissue without complications. The aim of this study was to assess a fibrocollagen-covered polyester prosthesis to be used as a substitution for a tracheal segment. METHODS We performed a blind, randomized experimental assay. Adult Wistar rats were assigned to one of 2 groups. Prostheses were made by implanting polyester tubing in a group of animals to cover them with homologous collagen. They were implanted as substitutions of tracheal segments in the experimental group after creating a defect in the anterior wall of the trachea. Clinical, histomorphologic, and immunohistochemical assessments were made at 4 different time points. RESULTS The experimental group presented some respiratory distress signs during the first 7 to 10 days, such as stertors, hissing, and low motor activity. After this initial period, the symptoms subsided progressively and disappeared at the end of the first month. These respiratory symptoms caused no mortality. Initially undifferentiated monolayer cells predominated on the implant's surface, but during the last 2 months, the proportion of epithelial and ciliated cells was similar to that seen in control animals. Types I, III, and V collagen fibers were identified around the mesh. The intraluminal area of the tracheas with prostheses and prosthesis thickness were larger during the 4 months of the experiment. The increase in thickness was due to angiogenesis without evidence of fibrosis or chronic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS Polyester-collagen prostheses used as substitutions of tracheal segments in rats enabled the proliferation of normal respiratory epithelium and maintained tracheal function without collapse, inflammatory reaction, or secondary stenosis.","Villegas-Alvarez, Fernando; González-Zamora, José F; González-Maciel, Angelica; Soriano-Rosales, Rosa; Pérez-Guille, Beatriz; Padilla-Sánchez, Luis; Reynoso-Robles, Rafael; Ramos-Morales, Andrea; Zenteno-Galindo, Edgar; Pérez-Torres, Armando; Montalvo-Jave, Eduardo E",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2009.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19660403/,139

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.","Sabando, Maria Virginia; Ulbrich, Pavol; Selzer, Matias; Byska, Jan; Mican, Jan; Ponzoni, Ignacio; Soto, Axel J; Ganuza, Maria Lujan; Kozlikova, Barbora",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048734/,139

We investigated serum concentrations of infliximab and the early appearance of antibodies to infliximab (ATI) during induction treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. METHODS We performed a prospective analysis of 19 consecutive patients with moderate-severe UC (endoscopic Mayo ≥ 2) receiving induction therapy with infliximab (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6) at 2 centers in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from July 2012 through March 2014. Serial serum and fecal samples were collected for 6 weeks and concentrations of infliximab, ATI, c-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and fecal calprotectin were measured. Treatment success was defined as endoscopic response (≥ 1 point reduction in the endoscopic Mayo score) at week 8. RESULTS Eleven patients (58%) had an endoscopic response. The median serum concentrations of infliximab at week 6 were 8.1 μg/mL in responders (interquartile range, 3.0-13.7 μg/mL) and 2.9 μg/mL in nonresponders (interquartile range, 0.01-5.8 μg/mL) (P = .03). ATIs were detected in 7 patients as early as day 18 (median, 28 d; interquartile range, 18-42 d). Six of the 8 nonresponders tested positive for ATIs vs 1 of 11 responders (P < .01; odds ratio, 30.0; 95% CI, 2.2-406.2). Patients with a baseline concentration of CRP greater than 50 mg/L had lower drug exposure from weeks 0 to 6 (587 mg/L/d in patients with high levels of CRP vs 1361 mg/L/day in patients with low CRP; P = .001). The median area under the curve for serum concentration of infliximab during induction therapy was 1230 mg/L/d in nonresponders vs 1352 mg/L/d in responders (P = .65). CONCLUSIONS There is a significant difference in serum concentration of infliximab at week 6 of treatment between responders and nonresponders. Early development of ATIs during induction therapy reduces the serum concentration of infliximab and is associated with nonresponse to treatment. Patients with high baseline serum levels of CRP had lower serum concentrations of infliximab.

84931,"Imaging, Intervention, and Workflow in Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Calgary Approach.",2016,"PURPOSE Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a widely used disinfectant and preservative which is effective against a wide range of viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), bacteria and fungi. However, it is toxic to the eye and skin. This study investigated the neutralization of BAK using ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an effort to reduce BAK toxicity potential. METHODS BAK solutions were irradiated with a germicidal UVC lamp at various doses. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) were then exposed to the UVC-irradiated BAK solutions for 5 minutes. After exposure, the cultures were assessed for metabolic activity using PrestoBlue; for cell viability using confocal microscopy with viability dyes; and for tight junction proteins using immunofluorescence staining for zonula occludens (ZO)-1. RESULTS UVC radiation reduced BAK toxicity on cell metabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the solution depth of BAK was 1.7 mm, the UVC doses needed to completely neutralize the toxicity of BAK 0.005% and 0.01% were 2.093 J/cm2 and 8.374 J/cm2, respectively. The cultures treated with UVC-neutralized BAK showed similar cell metabolic activity and cell viability to those treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (p = 0.806 ∼ 1.000). The expression of ZO-1 was greatly disturbed by untreated BAK; in contrast, ZO-1 proteins were well maintained after exposure to UVC-neutralized BAK. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that the cell toxicity of BAK can be neutralized by UVC radiation, which provides a unique way of detoxifying BAK residues. This finding may be of great value in utilizing the antimicrobial efficacy of BAK (e.g. fighting against SARS-CoV-2) while minimizing its potential hazards to human health and the environment.","Xu, Manlong; Sivak, Jacob G; McCanna, David J",Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15569527.2021.1902339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771058/,139

Current clinical practice does not include any specific strategy for lung protection. To compare the anti-inflammatory effects of low-frequency ventilation (LFV), as measured by nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) p65 pathway activation, for the entire cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) vs both lungs left collapsed in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS Two groups parallel randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was inflammation measured by NF-κB p65 activation in pre- and post-CPB lung biopsies. Secondary outcomes were additional inflammatory markers in both biopsy tissue and blood. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients were randomly allocated to LFV (18) and to both lungs left collapsed (19). The mean concentration of NF-κB p65 in the biopsies before chest closure (adjusted for pre-CPB concentration) was higher in the LFV group compared to both lungs left collapsed group but this was not significant (0.102, 95% confidence interval, -0.022 to 0.226, P = 0.104). There were no significant differences between groups in the other inflammatory markers measured in tissue and blood. CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing elective CABG, the use of LFV during CPB when compared to both lungs left collapsed does not seem to reduce inflammation in lung biopsies and blood.","Fiorentino, Francesca; Jaaly, Emad Al; Durham, Andrew L; Adcock, Ian M; Lockwood, Geoffrey; Rogers, Chris; Ascione, Raimondo; Reeves, Barney C; Angelini, Gianni D",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31045289/,139
85871,Ebola Virus Preparedness: Emerging Viruses and Ethics in Laboratory Medicine.,2016,"BACKGROUND The high technical difficulty of using a laparoscopic approach to reach the posterosuperior liver segments is mainly associated with their poor accessibility. This study was performed to analyze correlations between anthropometric data and intraoperative outcomes. STUDY DESIGN All patients who underwent segmentectomy or wedge laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) of segments seven and/or eight from June 2012 to November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The exclusion criteria were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, associated resection, multiple concomitant LLR, redo resection, and lack of preoperative imaging. Anthropometric data were correlated with intraoperative outcomes. RESULTS Forty-one patients (wedge resection, n = 32; segmentectomy, n = 9) were analyzed. A strong correlation was found between the craniocaudal liver diameter (CCliv) and liver volume (r = 0.655, p < 0.001). The anteroposterior liver diameter was moderately correlated with both the laterolateral abdominal diameter (LLabd) (r = 0.372, p = 0.008) and anteroposterior abdominal diameter (r = 0.371, p = 0.008). The body mass index (BMI) was not correlated with liver diameters. Women had a longer CCliv (p = 0.002) and shorter LLabd (p < 0.001) than men. The liver and abdominal measurements were combined to reduce this sex-related disparity. The CCliv/LLabd ratio (CHALLENGE index) was significantly correlated with the time of transection (r = 0.382, p = 0.037) and blood loss (r = 0.352, p = 0.029). The association between the CHALLENGE index and intraoperative blood loss was even stronger when considering only anatomical resection (r = 0.577, p = 0.048). A CHALLENGE index of > 0.4 (area under the curve, 0.757; p = 0.046) indicated a higher bleeding risk. The BMI predicted no intraoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION Anthropometric data rather than the BMI can help anticipate the difficulty of LLR of segments seven and eight.","Russolillo, Nadia; Maina, Cecilia; Langella, Serena; Lo Tesoriere, Roberto; Casella, Michele; Ferrero, Alessandro",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07993-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968919/,139

METHODS Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The calls related to pandemic were divided into four categories: medical, psychological, information and the others. The secondary categories of psychological calls were determined by text analysis. The number of calls were calculated weekly and the number of various types of calls over time were analyzed. We used stratified random sampling method to extract 600 cases of all kinds of calls related to pandemic and conducted a semantic analysis, through marking new, similar combination to form a feature set, then summed up the call content characteristics of each stage. Two hundred callers were followed up to understand how they felt about the call process in four aspects: the waiting time, call duration, the degree of problem-solving and the way to end the call. RESULTS In a total of 13 746 calls, 8978 were related to pandemic, among which 12.59%(1130/8978) were about medical issues, 26.50%(2379/8978) were about mental health, 27.18%(2440/8978) were about information regarding the pandemic and 33.74%(3029/8978) were about other pandemic related issues. Pandemic situation, relevant policy release, frequency of advertising campaigns were predictors of the number of calls per day during the pandemic (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The number of calls differed by gender and identities of callers (both P<0.05). Finally 181 callers accepted telephone follow-up. Among them, 51.38%(93/181) of the callers thought that the waiting time was too long, 33.15%(60/181) of the callers thought that the call time was insufficient, 80.66%(146/181) of callers believed that the hotline could partially or completely resolve their concerns, and 39.23%(71/181) of the callers said the operator proposed to end the call. CONCLUSIONS s The changes of the number and content of the mental health assistance hotline calls reflected that the public mental health status experienced four stages during the pandemic: confusion, panic, boredom, and adjustment. The specialized mental health assistance hotlines should be further strengthened, and the efficiency should be improved. Mental health interventions should be tailored and adopted according to the characteristics of the public mental health status at different stages of the pandemic.","Wang, Weidan; Xu, Fangzhong; Xu, Songquan; Zhang, Jianmin; Zhang, Ning",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

As a result, discharge planning, patient access to local community-based treatment, and safety-net programming were affected. Given structural and intersectional risk vulnerabilities of people with substance use disorders (SUDs), the OHSU members felt that COVID-19 would disproportionately impact chronically marginalized members of our community. These inequities inspired the formation of the Oregon substance use disorder resources collaborative (ORSUD) led by four medical students. ORSUD's mission is to support the efforts of local safety-net organizations that and front-line providers who serve chronically marginalized community members in the midst of the global pandemic. We operationalized our mission through: 1) collecting and disseminating operational and capacity changes in local addiction and harm reduction services to the broader treatment community, and 2) identifying and addressing immediate resource needs for local safety-net programs. Our program uses a real-time public-facing document to collate local programmatic updates and general community resources.

Nowadays, overweight/obesity among childrearing-age women has become rapidly increasing in both urban and rural areas. AIM This study aimed to assess the variation of overweight/obesity among urban and rural reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. METHODS For this study, the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data were used. The survey was a community-based cross-sectional study, which used a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique to select the participants. A total of 13,451 reproductive-age women were included in the analysis. Both descriptive and analytical analysis was performed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as the measure of statistical significance. RESULTS The prevalence of overweight/obesity among urban reproductive-age women was statistically higher (p = 21.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.2-25.1) than the rural women (p = 3.5%; 95% CI: 2.9%-4.2%). Women who attend secondary or above education, women in the age groups 25-34 and ≥ 35 years, and high wealth index (rich) had higher odds of overweight/obesity in both urban and rural women. Moreover, women who were married, who had a large family size, and who have a history of alcohol intake had higher odds of overweight/obesity among urban women. CONCLUSIONS Overweight/obesity among reproductive-age women is a public health problem in Ethiopia, especially for women who are living in urban settings. Therefore, it is important to establish targeted overweight reduction programs with particular emphasis on urban, older aged, educated, and married women. Additionally, encouraging the limitation of the number of family size and alcohol intake can reduce women's overweight/obesity.","Dagnew, Gizachew Worku; Asresie, Melash Belachew",Nutrition and health,https://doi.org/10.1177/0260106020982346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594927/,139

The metabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway and its involvement in mental disorders is an emerging area in psychiatry. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the differences in kynurenine metabolites in major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed metabolites involved in the kynurenine pathway (tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and their associate ratios) in people with MDD, SZ, or BD, compared to controls. We computed the difference in metabolite concentrations between people with MDD, BD, or SZ, and controls, presented as Hedges' g with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 101 studies with 10,912 participants were included. Tryptophan and kynurenine are decreased across MDD, BD, and SZ; kynurenic acid and the kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid ratio are decreased in mood disorders (i.e., MDD and BD), whereas kynurenic acid is not altered in SZ; kynurenic acid to 3-hydroxykynurenine ratio is decreased in MDD but not SZ. Kynurenic acid to kynurenine ratio is decreased in MDD and SZ, and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio is increased in MDD and SZ. Our results suggest that there is a shift in the tryptophan metabolism from serotonin to the kynurenine pathway, across these psychiatric disorders. In addition, a differential pattern exists between mood disorders and SZ, with a preferential metabolism of kynurenine to the potentially neurotoxic quinolinic acid instead of the neuroprotective kynurenic acid in mood disorders but not in SZ.","Marx, Wolfgang; McGuinness, Amelia J; Rocks, Tetyana; Ruusunen, Anu; Cleminson, Jasmine; Walker, Adam J; Gomes-da-Costa, Susana; Lane, Melissa; Sanches, Marsal; Diaz, Alexandre P; Tseng, Ping-Tao; Lin, Pao-Yen; Berk, Michael; Clarke, Gerard; O'Neil, Adrienne; Jacka, Felice; Stubbs, Brendon; Carvalho, André F; Quevedo, João; Soares, Jair C; Fernandes, Brisa S",Molecular psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00951-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230205/,139

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of deep hypothermia (31-32 °C), moderate hypothermia (33-34 °C), mild hypothermia (35-36 °C), and normothermia (37-37.8 °C) during TTM. METHODS We searched six databases from inception to June 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating TTM in comatose OHCA survivors. Two reviewers performed screening, full text review, and extraction independently. The primary outcome of interest was survival with good functional outcome. We used GRADE to rate our certainty in estimates. RESULTS We included 10 RCTs (4218 patients).

Finally, incidence of arrhythmia was higher with moderate hypothermia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08-1.94) and deep hypothermia (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.77-7.26), compared to normothermia (both high certainty). CONCLUSIONS Mild, moderate, or deep hypothermia may not improve survival or functional outcome after OHCA, as compared to normothermia. Moderate and deep hypothermia were associated with higher incidence of arrhythmia. Routine use of moderate or deep hypothermia in comatose survivors of OHCA may potentially be associated with more harm than benefit.","Fernando, Shannon M; Di Santo, Pietro; Sadeghirad, Behnam; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Rochwerg, Bram; Mathew, Rebecca; Sekhon, Mypinder S; Munshi, Laveena; Fan, Eddy; Brodie, Daniel; Rowan, Kathryn M; Hough, Catherine L; McLeod, Shelley L; Vaillancourt, Christian; Cheskes, Sheldon; Ferguson, Niall D; Scales, Damon C; Sandroni, Claudio; Nolan, Jerry P; Hibbert, Benjamin",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06505-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389870/,139
87366,Reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke: how should we react to the Third Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS III) trial?,2013,"BACKGROUND Sleep disturbance is thought to aggravate acute postoperative pain. The influence of preoperative sleep problems on pain control in the long-term and development of chronic postsurgical pain is largely unknown. METHODS This prospective, observational study aimed to examine the links between preoperative sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) and pain severity (Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) 6 months postoperative (primary outcome), objective measures of pain and postoperative pain control variables (secondary outcomes). Patients (n=52) with disabling osteoarthritis (OA) pain undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was performed preoperatively on the day of surgery to evaluate pain objectively. Clinical data, as well as measures of sleep quality and pain, were obtained preoperatively and longitudinally over a six-month period. RESULTS Preoperatively, sleep disturbance (i.e., PSQI score >5) occurred in 73.1% (n=38) of THA patients, and pain severity was high (BPI pain severity 5.4±1.3). Regression models, adjusting for relevant covariates, showed that preoperative PSQI score predicted pain severity 6 months postoperative (β=0.091 (95% CI 0.001-0.181), p=0.048, R2 =0.35). Poor sleep quality was associated with increased pressure pain sensitivity and impaired endogenous pain inhibitory capacity (R2 range 0.14-0.33, all p´s <0.04). Moreover, preoperative sleep disturbance predicted increased opioid treatment during the first 24 hours after surgery (unadjusted β=0.009 (95% CI 0.002-0.015) mg/kg, p=0.007, R2 =0.15). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative sleep disturbance is prevalent in THA patients, is associated with objective measures of pain severity, and independently predicts immediate postoperative opioid treatment and poorer long-term pain control in patients who have undergone THA.","Bjurström, Martin F; Irwin, Michael R; Bodelsson, Mikael; Smith, Michael T; Mattsson-Carlgren, Niklas",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682177/,139
87443,MWA Versus RFA in HCC: Superior? Equivalent? Will We Ever Know?,2020-09-09,"The world's 1063 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) live in two subpopulations at the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The majority of mountain gorillas are human-habituated to facilitate tourism and research, which brings mountain gorillas into close proximity of people daily. Wild great apes are proven to be susceptible to human pathogens, including viruses that have caused fatal respiratory disease in mountain gorillas (e.g., human metapneumovirus1 ). This is the result of the close genetic relatedness of humans and gorillas as species, and the structural and genetic similarity in molecular receptors that allow viruses to infect cells2 . At the time of writing, there is no evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has infected a mountain gorilla. However, due to the significant potential for human-to-gorilla transmission, mountain gorilla range States took immediate steps to minimize the COVID-19 threat. These actions included a combination of preventive practice around gorillas and other great apes (e.g., mandatory face mask use, increased ""social"" minimum distancing from gorillas) as well as human public health measures (e.g., daily health/fever screenings, COVID-19 screening, and quarantines). Minimization of the COVID-19 threat also required socioeconomic decision-making and political will, as all gorilla tourism was suspended by late March 2020 and guidelines developed for tourism reopening. A consortium that collaborates and coordinates on mountain gorilla management and conservation, working within an intergovernmental institutional framework, took a multifaceted One Health approach to address the COVID-19 threat to mountain gorillas by developing a phased contingency plan for prevention and response. The aim of this paper is to describe how range States and partners achieved this collaborative planning effort, with intent that this real-world experience will inform similar actions at other great ape sites.","Gilardi, Kirsten; Nziza, Julius; Ssebide, Benard; Syaluha, Eddy Kambale; Muvunyi, Richard; Aruho, Robert; Shalukoma, Chantal; Seguya, Andrew; Masozera, Anna Behm",American journal of primatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110030/,139

87767,Age ≥80 Years Is Not a Contraindication for Intra-Arterial Therapy after Ischemic Stroke.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Reinterventions after fenestrated or branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/B-EVAR) are sometimes necessary to maintain aneurysm exclusion or endograft and target artery patency. These reinterventions are nontrivial, potentially associated with morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. Whereas rates, types, and outcomes of reintervention after infrarenal EVAR have been well described, they have not been well described for F/B-EVAR. We sought to characterize the morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization due to reinterventions after F/B-EVAR. METHODS All F/B-EVAR variables collected prospectively through a single-institution, Institutional Review Board-approved registry, which included patients enrolled in a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption trial (G130210), were reviewed (November 2010-December 2016). Reinterventions were defined as any procedure that was aneurysm related, device related, or target artery related. For patients with more than one reintervention, each intervention occurrence was treated as a discrete event. Reintervention type, indication, timing (perioperative, days 0-30; short term, days 31-180; midterm, >180 days), inpatient/outpatient, length of stay, and morbidity/mortality were recorded. Reintervention success was defined as resolution of the indication. RESULTS Among 123 consecutive F/B-EVARs (mean follow-up, 25 months), 32 patients (25%) underwent 54 reinterventions (one reintervention, 20 (63%) patients; two reinterventions, 6 (19%) patients; three reinterventions, 4 (13%) patients; four reinterventions, 1 (3.1%) patient; and six reinterventions, 1 (3.1%) patient). The most frequent indications were type III endoleaks (n = 15 [28%]), target artery occlusions (n = 7 [13%]), and stenoses (n = 6 [11%]). These were performed in the perioperative, short-term, and midterm time frames 17%, 41%, and 43% of the time, respectively. Reinterventions were percutaneous (67%), inpatient procedures (61%), with median length of stay of 5 days. Of the 32 reintervention patients, 4 experienced access site complications and 4 died <30 days after reintervention (3 were adjudicated as not aneurysm related/not reintervention related). In 31 of 32 (97%) patients, reintervention success was achieved. CONCLUSIONS Reinterventions after F/B-EVAR were necessary in 26% of patients, most commonly for type III endoleaks and target artery complications. Whereas all but one reintervention was successful, many of these required complex procedures with significant morbidity and mortality. Development of strategies to eliminate type III endoleaks by improving component junction integrity and to ensure target artery primary patency are key next steps in the evolution of F/B-EVAR.","Dossabhoy, Shernaz S; Simons, Jessica P; Diamond, Kyle R; Flahive, Julie M; Aiello, Francesco A; Arous, Edward J; Messina, Louis M; Schanzer, Andres",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.12.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523438/,139

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) serves an important function in metastatic dissemination and determines the aggressiveness of CRC. However, the regulatory mechanism of EMT in CRC has not yet been elucidated. γ-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) is an important enzyme in glutathione metabolism and highly expressed in numerous forms of cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target. In the present study, GGCT was demonstrated to be highly expressed in CRC tissues, and patients with CRC with a higher expression of GGCT exhibited a worse prognosis compared with patients exhibiting a lower expression of GGCT. This result suggests that GGCT may serve as a novel prognostic marker for CRC. Furthermore, GGCT was indicated to promote CRC cell migration and invasion through regulating EMT-associated genes, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, snail family transcriptional repressor 2 and snail family transcriptional repressor 1. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the mechanism governing CRC migration and invasion, and identified GGCT as a promising therapeutic target that may be used in the treatment of CRC.","Huang, Qi; Zhou, Yuanhang; Li, Yue; Liao, Zhiwei",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724344/,139
88563,Multisociety Consensus Quality Improvement Revised Consensus Statement for Endovascular Therapy of Acute Ischemic Stroke.,2018,"BACKGROUND Clinical aggression episodes, that is aggression and externalising behaviours that create risk, in acute care hospitals are increasing. Acute care staff are often not confident or trained in the management of aggression. Various aggression management training formats have been described in practice including face to face training, written learning resources, web- and media-based training resources, and simulation training. The aim of this systematic review is to assess whether simulation-based training is effective in increasing de-escalation knowledge, skills, and behaviour of staff working in the acute care setting. METHODS We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review of studies evaluating simulation-based training for the management of patients with aggression. We will include randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies including health care professionals and trainees in acute health care settings. Comprehensive searches will be conducted in the following databases (from January 1980 onwards): PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. The reference lists of selected studies, trial registers, and leading journals will also be searched. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. The primary outcomes will include patient outcomes (e.g. frequency of clinical aggression), quality of care (e.g. frequency of emergency situations, physical/chemical/mechanical restraint), and adverse effects (e.g. patient/family complaints, patient harms, staff harms). Secondary outcomes will include workplace resource use, health care provider-related outcomes, knowledge (de-escalation techniques), performance, attitudes, and satisfaction. The study methodological risk of bias will be appraised using appropriate tools. A narrative synthesis will be performed for included studies. If feasible, we will conduct random-effects meta-analysis of data. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participant characteristics, interventions, and follow-up). DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence on simulation-based training programmes for acute care health professionals on managing clinical aggression. The results of this study will inform the implementation of effective training strategies. Implications for future research will be discussed.

88670,High-Flow Arterio-Hepatic Venous Shunt in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Use of Multi-Electrode Radiofrequency for Shunt Obliteration.,2015,"Autophagy is a cellular process that sequesters cargo in double-membraned vesicles termed autophagosomes and delivers this cargo to lysosomes to be degraded. It is enhanced during nutrient starvation to increase the rate of amino acid turnover. Diverse roles for autophagy have been reported for viral infections, including the assembly of viral replication complexes on autophagic membranes and protection of host cells from cell death. Here, we show that autophagosomes accumulate in Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected cells. Despite this, disruption of autophagy had no effect on the viral replication rate or formation of viral replication complexes. Also, viral proteins rarely colocalized with autophagosome markers, suggesting that SFV did not utilize autophagic membranes for its replication. Further, we found that SFV infection, unlike nutrient starvation, did not inactivate the constitutive negative regulator of autophagosome formation, mammalian target of rapamycin, suggesting that SFV-dependent accumulation of autophagosomes was not a result of enhanced autophagosome formation. In starved cells, addition of NH(4)Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, caused a dramatic accumulation of starvation-induced autophagosomes, while in SFV-infected cells, NH(4)Cl did not further increase levels of autophagosomes. These results suggest that accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is due to an inhibition of autophagosome degradation rather than enhanced rates of autophagosome formation. Finally, we show that the accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is dependent on the expression of the viral glycoprotein spike complex.","Eng, Kai Er; Panas, Marc D; Murphy, Deirdre; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; McInerney, Gerald M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06581-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438538/,139

89232,COVID-19 infections are also affected by human ACE1 D/I polymorphism.,2020-04-14,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of pig diarrhea, requires a protease(s) for multicycle replication in cultured cells. However, the potential role of proteases in the infection process remains unclear. In order to explore this, we used two different approaches: we infected either Vero cells in the presence of trypsin or Vero cells that constitutively express the membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 (Vero/TMPRSS2 cells). We found that PEDV infection was enhanced, and viruses were efficiently released into the culture fluid, from Vero cells infected in the presence of protease, while in cells without protease, the virus grew, but its release into the culture fluid was strongly hampered. Cell-to-cell fusion of PEDV-infected cells and cleavage of the spike (S) protein were observed in cells with protease. When infected Vero cells were cultured for 3 days in the absence of trypsin but were then treated transiently with trypsin, infectious viruses were immediately released from infected cells. In addition, treatment of infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells with the protease inhibitor leupeptin strongly blocked the release of virus into the culture fluid. Under electron microscopy, PEDV-infected Vero cells, as well as PEDV-infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells treated with leupeptin, retained huge clusters of virions on their surfaces, while such clusters were rarely seen in the presence of trypsin and the absence of leupeptin in Vero and Vero/TMPRSS2 cells, respectively. Thus, the present study indicates that proteases play an important role in the release of PEDV virions clustered on cells after replication occurs. This unique observation in coronavirus infection suggests that the actions of proteases are reminiscent of that of the influenza virus neuraminidase protein.","Shirato, Kazuya; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Ujike, Makoto; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00464-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21613395/,139

METHOD A total of 1871 patients recorded in TReasure registry for whom advanced therapy was prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA) within the 3 months (6-9 months for rituximab) before the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and 1394 (74.5%) responded the survey performed by phone call. Patients? data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics and disease activity before the pandemic were recorded. The patients were inquired for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the rate of continuation on bDMARDs, the reasons for treatment discontinuation, if any, and the current general disease activity (visual analog scale, [VAS]). RESULTS A total of 1,394 patients (493 RA [47.3% on anti-TNF] patients and 901 SpA [90.0% on anti-TNF] patients) were included. Overall, 2.8% of the patients had symptoms suggesting COVID-19, and 2 (0.15%) patients had polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19. Overall, 18.1% of all patients (13.8% of the RA and 20.5% of the SpA; p=0.003) discontinued their bDMARDs. In the SpA group, the patients who discontinued bDMARDs were younger (40 [21-73] vs. 44 years [20-79]; p=0.005) and had higher general disease activity; however, no difference was relevant for RA patients.

Why and how did we arrive at this point? This paper argues that, conceiving each individual human as one cell in the greater human body, we are afflicted by what John McMurtry termed 'the cancer stage of capitalism.' This provocative framing is adopted here in response to growing calls by climate, earth and physical scientists not to 'mince words' in the description and analysis of humanity's current predicament, but rather 'tell it like it is.' METHODS Proceeding from McMurtry's application of the seven defining medical properties of a 'cancer invasion [of] an individual organism' to the broader body politic and the earth's life system, this paper draws on literature from diverse disciplines to investigate the fundamental cause of food systems crises. The paper references several empirical studies and meta-reviews that indicate the hastening decline in the integrity of human and ecological health, with a particular focus on the grain-oilseed-livestock complex and the accompanying social and ecological impacts on the southern cone countries of South America. RESULTS The cause of food system crises is to be found in the core logic of capital accumulation, the profit imperative, and the relentless and expanding processes of commodification and financialization. The key metric of 'economic growth' is problematised and discussed. An embryonic 'social immune response' is now observable, in the diverse practices of de-commodification, proposals for de-growth and commoning that together constitute an emerging 'food as a commons' movement. CONCLUSION As currently framed, the Food as Commons proposal lacks coherence, rigour and a viable strategy to move beyond the current crisis. Its transformative potential can be strengthened through a more explicitly political grounding based on appeals to and support of anti- and post-capitalist movements and initiatives.","Rose, Nick",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904700/,139
90171,Mechanical Thrombectomy in Basilar Artery Occlusion: Clinical Outcomes Related to Posterior Circulation Collateral Score.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Nurses and aides are among the occupational subgroups with the highest injury rates and workdays lost to illness and injury in North America. Many studies have shown that these incidents frequently happen during provision of patient care. Moreover, health care workplaces are a source of numerous safety risks that contribute to worker injuries. These findings identify health care as a high-risk occupation for employee injury or illness. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among patient care, employee safety perceptions, and employee stress. Using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Model of Job Stress and Health as a foundation, we developed and tested a conceptual workplace safety climate-stress model that explicates how caring for high-risk patients is a safety stressor that has negative outcomes for health care providers, including poor workplace safety perceptions and increasing stress levels. We introduced the concept of ""high-risk patients"" and define them as those who put providers at greater risk for injury or illness. METHODOLOGY Using a nonexperimental survey design, we examined patient types and safety perceptions of health care providers (nurses, aides, and allied health) in an acute care hospital. FINDINGS Health care providers who care for high-risk patients more frequently have poor safety climate perceptions and higher stress levels. Safety climate was found to mediate the relationship between high-risk patients and stress. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS These findings bring insight into actions health care organizations can pursue to improve health care provider well-being. Recognizing that different patients present different risks and pursuing staffing, training, and equipment to minimize employee risk of injury will help reduce the staggering injury rates experienced by these employees. Moreover, minimizing employee stress over poor workplace safety is achievable through comprehensive workplace safety climate programs that include supervisor, management, and organizational commitment to safety enhancement.","McCaughey, Deirdre; McGhan, Gwen; DelliFraine, Jami L; Brannon, S Diane",Health care management review,https://doi.org/10.1097/hmr.0b013e3181f3c04c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21157227/,139

We evaluated the outcomes of diabetic patients with moderate and high-risk acute coronary syndrome and multivessel disease managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS AND RESULTS Among 13 819 moderate and high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients enrolled in the Acute Catheterization and Early Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial, 1772 diabetic patients had multivessel disease with left anterior descending artery involvement and were managed by PCI (n=1349) or CABG (n=423). Propensity scoring was applied to adjust for differences in baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics, yielding a total of 326 matched patients (163 managed by PCI and 163 managed by CABG). At 30 days, treatment with PCI compared with CABG was associated with lower rates of major bleeding (15.3% versus 55.6%; P<0.0001), blood transfusions (9.2% versus 43.2%; P<0.0001), and acute kidney injury (13.4% versus 33.6%; P<0.0001), but more unplanned revascularization procedures (6.9% versus 1.9%; P=0.03). At 1 year PCI was associated with higher rates of repeat revascularization procedures (19.5% versus 5.2%; P=0.0001), with nonsignificantly different rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death at either 30 days or 1 year. CONCLUSIONS In the large-scale ACUITY trial, diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome and multivessel disease treated with PCI rather than CABG had less bleeding and acute kidney injury, greater need for repeat revascularization procedures, and comparable rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death through 1-year follow-up.

90944,Thrombectomy versus medical management for large vessel occlusion strokes with minimal symptoms: an analysis from STOPStroke and GESTOR cohorts.,2018,"The biotin metabolism of the Gram-negative facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha (syn. Cupriavidus necator), that is used for production in industry, was investigated. A biotin auxotroph mutant lacking bioF was generated, and biotin depletion in the cells as well as the minimal biotin demand of a biotin auxotroph R. eutropha strain were determined. Three consecutive cultivations in biotin free medium were necessary to prevent growth of the auxotroph mutant, and 40 ng/ml biotin were sufficient to promote cell growth. Nevertheless, 200 ng/ml biotin were necessary to ensure growth comparable to that of the wildtype which is similar to the demand of biotin auxotroph mutants among other prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. A phenotypic complementation of the R. eutropha ΔbioF mutant was only achieved by homologous expression of bioF of R. eutropha or heterologous expression of bioF of Bacillus subtilis but not by bioF of Escherichia coli Together with the results from bioinformatic analysis of BioFs, this leads to the assumption that the intermediate of biotin synthesis in R. eutropha is pimeloyl-CoA instead of pimeloyl-ACP like in the Gram-positive B. subtilis Internal biotin content was enhanced by homologous expression of accB whereas homologous expression of accB and accC2 in combination led to decreased biotin concentrations in the cells. Although a DNA-binding domain of the regulator protein BirA is missing, biotin synthesis seemed to be influenced by the amount of acceptor protein present.Importance Ralstonia eutropha is applied in industry for the production of biopolymers and serves as a research platform for the production of diverse fine chemicals. Due to its ability to grow on hydrogen and carbon dioxide as sole carbon and energy source, R. eutropha is often utilized for metabolic engineering to convert cheap resources into value added products. The understanding of the metabolic pathways in this bacterium is mandatory for further bio-engineering of the strain and for the development of new strategies for biotechnological productions.","Eggers, Jessica; Strittmatter, Carl Simon; Küsters, Kira; Biller, Emre; Steinbüchel, Alexander",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01512-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680858/,139
90949,Duodenoduodenostomy in pancreas transplantation.,2012,"Social media vaccine misinformation can negatively influence vaccine attitudes. It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce the misinformation's impact. This study aimed to test the effects of fact-checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen's d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing the current misinformation threat.","Zhang, Jingwen; Featherstone, Jieyu Ding; Calabrese, Christopher; Wojcieszak, Magdalena",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388335/,139

In this study, three assays, namely a conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR and a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR targeting the highly conserved M gene of PEDV, were developed and evaluated. Then, the analytical specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of these assays were determined and compared. The TaqMan real-time RT-PCR was 100-fold and 10,000-fold more sensitive than that of the SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR and the conventional RT-PCR, respectively. The analytical sensitivity of TaqMan real-time RT-PCR was 10 copies/μl of target gene and no cross amplification with other viruses tested was observed. With the features of high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR established in this study could be a useful tool for clinical diagnosis, epidemiological surveys and outbreak investigations of PED.","Zhou, Xinrong; Zhang, Tiansheng; Song, Deping; Huang, Tao; Peng, Qi; Chen, Yanjun; Li, Anqi; Zhang, Fanfan; Wu, Qiong; Ye, Yu; Tang, Yuxin",Molecular and cellular probes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2017.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28188840/,139

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate markers of arterial disease and their association with the early post-operative AVF outcomes. METHODS We included all patients in whom an AVF had been performed after enrolment to the Renal Impairment In Secondary Care (RIISC) study. Primary AVF failure (PFL) was defined as thrombosis at six-week review. All patients underwent BP Tru and Vicorder pulse wave analysis assessments and also had assays of advanced glycation end-products prior to AVF formation. These were correlated with the short-term AVF outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and eight AVFs were created in 86 patients. The primary patency (PPT) group were found to have significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.01). Intraluminal vein diameter was significantly greater in the PPT group than the PFL group (p≤0.01). Mean augmentation index and augmentation index 75 was significantly higher in the PPT group than the PFL group (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). Aortic pulse wave velocity was slower in the PPT group at 10.2 m/s than the PFL group at 10.8 m/s (p = 0.32). Advanced glycation end-product measurements did not vary significantly between the PPT and PFL groups (p = 0.4). Logistic regression analysis provided a predictive model, which demonstrated a predictive value of 78.1% for AVF patency at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS All patients in this end-stage renal disease cohort have significant aortic stiffness. The results for pulse wave velocity were slower in the PPT group suggesting a tendency towards stiffer vessels and PFL.","McGrogan, Damian G; Stringer, Stephanie; Cockwell, Paul; Jesky, Mark; Ferro, Charlie; Maxwell, Alexander P; Inston, Nicholas G",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29076519/,139

Medical interventions are used initially but when these fail, surgical therapy is often indicated. Surgical options include resection, drainage, and hybrid procedures. Hybrid procedures, such as the Frey procedure are associated with improved outcomes in select patients. These advantages are even greater when the Frey is performed laparoscopically. METHODS A patient with chronic pancreatitis was referred to our clinic. Preoperative imaging revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct with multiple large pancreatic duct stones. She subsequently underwent a laparoscopic Frey procedure. RESULTS The patient did very well with no pancreatic leak, wound infection, or delayed gastric emptying. She was discharged home on postoperative day 6, symptom free with no narcotic requirement.

Human coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63 co-circulated during each of the respiratory seasons but with significant year-to-year variability, and cumulatively accounted for 7.4-15.6 % of all samples tested during the months of peak activity. A total of 79 (0.5 % prevalence) specimens were positive for human betacoronavirus HKU1 RNA. Genotypes HKU1 A and B were both isolated from clinical specimens and propagated on primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface and were neutralized in vitro by human intravenous immunoglobulin and by polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the spike glycoprotein of HKU1. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of seven full-length genomes of Colorado HKU1 viruses and the spike glycoproteins from four additional HKU1 viruses from Colorado and three from Brazil demonstrated remarkable conservation of these sequences with genotypes circulating in Hong Kong and France. Within genotype A, all but one of the Colorado HKU1 sequences formed a unique subclade defined by three amino acid substitutions (W197F, F613Y and S752F) in the spike glycoprotein and exhibited a unique signature in the acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the nsp3 subdomain.

Identifying risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression may inform preventative strategies and early interventions to improve long-term outcomes for individuals at risk of IPJ osteoarthritis progression. The objectives of the study were to describe methods used to measure the progression of IPJ osteoarthritis and identify risk factors for IPJ osteoarthritis progression. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 19th February 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42019121034). Eligible studies assessed potential risk factor/s associated with IPJ osteoarthritis progression. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified QUIPS Tool, and a best evidence synthesis was performed. Of eight eligible studies, all measured osteoarthritis progression radiographically, and none considered symptoms. Eighteen potential risk factors were assessed. Diabetes (adjusted mean difference between 2.06 and 7.78), and larger finger epiphyseal index in males (regression coefficient β = 0.202) and females (β = 0.325) were identified as risk factors (limited evidence). Older age in men and women showed mixed results; 13 variables were not risk factors (all limited evidence). Patients with diabetes and larger finger epiphyseal index might be at higher risk of radiographic IPJ osteoarthritis progression, though evidence is limited and studies are biased.

92894,In-hospital outcomes associated with stent-assisted endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the USA.,2013,"BACKGROUND Individual assessment of the amplitude of a physiologic reflex evoked by a standardized noxious test (SNT) before surgical stimulation has been suggested to predict movement upon the forthcoming surgical stimulation. This study aimed to compare the ability of pupillary dilatation reflex amplitude (PDRA) evoked by an SNT and estimated remifentanil effect-site concentration (Ce) to predict movement upon surgical stimulation. METHODS Eighty female patients were anesthetized for vacuum aspiration with propofol (Ce 4 μg/ml) and remifentanil. Remifentanil Ce was randomized to 0, 1, 3, or 5 ng/ml. SNT was a 60-mA, 5-s, 100-Hz tetanus applied on median nerve before cervix dilatation. PDRA was calculated as the difference in pupillary diameter after and before SNT. Movement upon cervix dilatation was recorded by an independent observer. Ability of PDRA and estimated remifentanil Ce to discriminate movers from non-movers during cervix dilatation was measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. RESULTS Twenty-one of the 76 patients analyzed moved during cervix dilatation. Mean PDRA (±1 SD) evoked by SNT was 2.0 ± 1.2 mm in movers and 0.6 ± 0.7 in non-movers (P < 0.0001). Remifentanil Ce was 0.2 ± 0.4 ng/ml in movers and 3.0 ± 1.7 in non-movers (P < 0.0001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for PDRA was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.96) and for remifentanil Ce 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98), without any significant difference between the two areas. CONCLUSIONS PDRA evoked by an SNT is as accurate as the estimated remifentanil Ce to predict movement upon cervix dilatation. PDRA could be valuable when estimated opioid Ce is not available or reliable.","Guglielminotti, Jean; Grillot, Nicolas; Paule, Marine; Mentré, France; Servin, Fréderique; Montravers, Philippe; Longrois, Dan",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730338/,139

In this paper we show that it is possible to use DIALux to simulate the irradiance distribution provided by a lamp emitting in the UVC range. We will compare the results provided by DIALux with those obtained from Zemax OpticStudio in three different scenarios. We compared the minimum, maximum, and mean irradiance at the detection plane. The differences between the two software were less than 12%, 2%, and 6%, respectively. We also compared the contour maps of isoirradiance lines. We conclude that DIALux is well suited for UVC lighting design in the UVC range.

We aimed at evaluating [18F]FDG PET brain datasets of healthy controls (HC), based on publicly available data, for the extraction of voxel-based brain metabolism maps at the single-subject level. METHODS Selection of HC images was based on visual rating, after Cook's distance and jack-knife analyses, to exclude artefacts and/or outliers. The performance of these HC datasets (ADNI-HC and AIMN-HC) to extract hypometabolism patterns in single patients was tested in comparison with the standard reference HC dataset (HSR-HC) by means of Dice score analysis. We evaluated the performance and comparability of the different HC datasets in the assessment of single-subject SPM-based hypometabolism in three independent cohorts of patients, namely, ADD, bvFTD and DLB. RESULTS Two-step Cook's distance analysis and the subsequent jack-knife analysis resulted in the selection of n = 125 subjects from the AIMN-HC dataset and n = 75 subjects from the ADNI-HC dataset. The average concordance between SPM hypometabolism t-maps in the three patient cohorts, as obtained with the new datasets and compared to the HSR-HC standard reference dataset, was 0.87 for the AIMN-HC dataset and 0.83 for the ADNI-HC dataset. Pattern expression analysis revealed high overall accuracy (> 80%) of the SPM t-map classification according to different statistical thresholds and sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS The applied procedures ensure validity of these HC datasets for the single-subject estimation of brain metabolism using voxel-wise comparisons.

94404,Performance characteristics of an instrument-free point-of-care CD4 test (VISITECT®CD4) for use in resource-limited settings.,2020-09-01,"Native nanostructured lipoproteins such as low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) are powerful tools for the targeted delivery of drugs and imaging agents. While the cellular recognition of well-known HDL-based carriers occurs via interactions with an HDL receptor, the selective delivery and uptake of LDL particles by target cells are more complex. The most well-known mode of LDL-based delivery is via the interaction between apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) - the main protein of LDL - and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). LDLR is expressed in the liver, adipocytes, and macrophages, and thus selectively delivers LDL carriers to these cells and tissues. Moreover, the elevated expression of LDLR in tumor cells indicates a role for LDL in the targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs. In addition, chronic inflammation associated with hypercholesterolemia (i.e., high levels of endogenous LDL) can be abated by LDL carriers, which outcompete the deleterious oxidized LDL for uptake by macrophages. In this case, synthetic LDL nanocarriers act as 'eat-me' signals and exploit mechanisms of native LDL uptake for targeted drug delivery and imaging. Lastly, recent studies have shown that the delivery of LDL-based nanocarriers to macrophages via fluid-phase pinocytosis is a promising tool for atherosclerosis imaging. Hence, the present review summarizes the use of natural and synthetic LDL-based carriers for drug delivery and imaging and discusses various mechanisms of targeting.","Di, Lin; Maiseyeu, Andrei",Drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1886199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594923/,139

94771,Periprocedural cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in the stent retriever era.,2015,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a coronavirus that causes a lethal chronic disease in cats, enters feline monocytes via endocytosis. In this study, the pathway of internalization is characterized by evaluating the effect of chemical inhibitors and/or expression of dominant-negative (DN) proteins on the percentage of internalized virions per cell and infection. Further, co-localization studies were performed to determine the involvement of certain cellular internalization proteins. FIPV is not internalized through a clathrin-mediated pathway, as chlorpromazine, amantadine and DN eps15 did not influence virus uptake and FIPV did not co-localize with clathrin. The caveolae-mediated pathway could be excluded based on the inability of genistein and DN caveolin-1 to inhibit virus uptake and lack of co-localization between FIPV and caveolin-1. Dynamin inhibitory peptide and DN dynamin effectively inhibited virus internalization. The inhibitor strongly reduced uptake to 20.3+/-1.1% of uptake in untreated cells. In the presence of DN dynamin, uptake was 58.7+/-3.9% relative to uptake in untransduced cells. Internalization of FIPV was slightly reduced to 85.0+/-1.4 and 87.4+/-6.1% of internalization in control cells by the sterol-binding drugs nystatin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, respectively. Rho GTPases were inhibited by Clostridium difficile toxin B, but no effect was observed. These results were confirmed with infection studies showing that infection was not influenced by chlorpromazine, amantadine and genistein, but was significantly reduced by dynamin inhibition and nystatin. In conclusion, these results indicate that FIPV enters monocytes through a clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway that strongly depends on dynamin and is slightly sensitive to cholesterol depletion.","Van Hamme, Evelien; Dewerchin, Hannah L; Cornelissen, Els; Verhasselt, Bruno; Nauwynck, Hans J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.2008/001602-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753224/,139

Our objective was to assess stress and coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS During the pandemic in New York City, patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs answered open-ended questions about the pandemic's effects on daily life and their rheumatic condition. Themes of stress and coping were discerned from volunteered responses. Patients also completed the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale/PROMIS Anxiety surveys. Anxiety scores were independent variables in multivariable analyses with stress and coping themes as combined dependent variables. RESULTS Of the 112 patients interviewed (86% women; mean age, 50 years), 72 volunteered COVID-19-related stress on their rheumatic condition, home, work, and finances. Patients volunteering stress were younger, had disease longer, were taking more than 1 medication, had worse GAD-7 scores and a positive anxiety screen, and had worse PROMIS scores that were significantly worse than population norms (all comparisons, p ≤ 0.01; all variables remained associated in multivariable analyses). Fourty-one patients volunteered coping mechanisms including support from others, engaging in activities, and resilience already establish in dealing with rheumatic diseases. Of these, 18 volunteered both coping and stress and 23 volunteered coping and no stress. Patients in the latter (coping-only) group were more likely to be older, taking only 1 medication, and had better GAD-7 and PROMIS scores (all comparisons, p ≤ 0.02). In multivariable analysis, older age (p = 0.02) and lower GAD-7 (p = 0.03) or PROMIS scores (p = 0.03) remained associated. CONCLUSIONS Patients reported stress and coping due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS A prospectively maintained database of all patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer admitted to the operating room for planned fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy was analyzed. Sentinel node mapping was performed via cervical injection of Technetium and blue dye. RESULTS Between 6/2005 and 5/2008, 22 consecutive patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer underwent laparotomy for planned fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy. Median age was 33 years (range, 23-43). Histology included 13 (59%) with adenocarcinoma and 9 (41%) with squamous carcinoma. Lymph-vascular invasion was seen in 9 (41%) cases. Only 3 (14%) needed immediate completion radical hysterectomy due to intraoperative findings (2 for positive nodes, 1 for positive endocervical margin). Median number of nodes evaluated was 23 (range, 11-44); and 6 (27%) patients had positive pelvic nodes on final pathology - all received postoperative chemoradiation. Sixteen (73%) patients agreed to participate in sentinel node mapping which yielded a detection rate of 100%, sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 100% and false-negative rate of 17%. Eighteen of 19 (95%) patients who completed trachelectomy had a cerclage placed, and 9/22 (41%) patients had no residual cervical carcinoma on final pathology. Median time in the operating room was 298 min (range, 180-425). Median estimated blood loss was 250 ml (range, 50-700), and median hospital stay was 4 days (range, 3-6). No recurrences were noted at the time of this report. CONCLUSIONS Cervical adenocarcinoma and lymph-vascular invasion are common features of patients selected for radical abdominal trachelectomy. The majority of patients can undergo the operation successfully; however, nearly 32% of all selected cases will require hysterectomy or postoperative chemoradiation for oncologic reasons. Sentinel node mapping is useful but until lower false-negative rates are achieved total lymphadenectomy remains the gold standard. Investigating alternative fertility-sparing adjuvant therapy in node positive patients is needed.","Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Neubauer, Nikki; Sonoda, Yukio; Park, Kay J; Gemignani, Mary; Alektiar, Kaled M; Tew, William; Leitao, Mario M; Chi, Dennis S; Barakat, Richard R",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2008.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18708244/,139
95217,Case of round pneumonia: pulmonary infarct and a rare situation that is similar with the lung cancer.,2015,"BACKGROUND To compare, in terms of patient-ventilator interaction and performance, a new nasal mask (Respireo, AirLiquide, FR) with the Endotracheal tube (ET) and a commonly used nasal mask (FPM, Fisher and Paykel, NZ) for delivering Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) in an infant model of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF). METHODS An active test lung (ASL 5000) connected to an infant mannequin through 3 different interfaces (Respireo, ET and FPM), was ventilated with a standard ICU ventilator set in PSV. The test lung was set to simulate a 5.5 kg infant with ARF, breathing at 50 and 60 breaths/min). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) mode was not used and the leaks were nearly zero. RESULTS The ET showed the shortest inspiratory trigger delay and pressurization time compared to FPM and Respireo (p < 0.01). At each respiratory rate tested, the FPM showed the shortest Expiratory trigger delay compared to ET and Respireo (p < 0.01). The Respireo presented a lower value of Inspiratory pressure-time product and trigger pressure drop than ET (p < 0.01), while no significant difference was found in terms of pressure-time product at 300 and 500 ms. During all tests, compared with the FPM, ET showed a significantly higher tidal volume (VT) delivered (p < 0.01), while Respireo showed a trend toward an increase of tidal volume delivered compared with FPM. CONCLUSIONS The ET showed a better patient-ventilator interaction and performance compared to both the nasal masks. Despite the higher internal volume, Respireo showed a trend toward an increase of the delivered tidal volume; globally, its efficiency in terms of patient-ventilator interaction was comparable to the FPM, which is the infant NIV mask characterized by the smaller internal volume among the (few) models on the market.","Conti, Giorgio; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Gregoretti, Cesare; Ferrone, Giuliano; Cortegiani, Andrea; Festa, Olimpia; Piastra, Marco; Tortorolo, Luca; Costa, Roberta",BMC pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-018-0620-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625596/,139

However, these results need further confirmation, and the causal relationship has not yet been established. Methods This is a randomized controlled equivalence trial. Permuted block randomization stratified by culprit vessels will be used. Six hundred and forty patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular recanalization will be randomized one to one to receive either general anesthesia or local anesthesia. The primary endpoint is the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after endovascular treatment. The secondary endpoints are the peri-procedural mortality and morbidity. Discussion The study aims to determine the effects of anesthetic choice on neurological outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing intra-arterial recanalization. If the results are positive, the study will indicate that the type of anesthesia does not affect neurological outcome after endovascular treatment.

95533,Time-Dependent Computed Tomographic Perfusion Thresholds for Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.,2015,"PURPOSE To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cytologically Bethesda IV category (B IV) thyroid nodules who opted for active surveillance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated 155 patients with a single thyroid nodule classified as B IV. Immediate molecular testing and/or thyroid surgery was offered, except when the patient (i) could not afford molecular testing/rejected the surgery, (ii) had a high surgical risk, (iii) had other disorders/comorbidities which needed to be addressed with higher priority, and (iv) had undetectable serum calcitonin levels, in whom active surveillance (AS) was performed. RESULTS From 155 patients, only two patients could afford molecular testing; 84% (n = 130) underwent immediate thyroid surgery: lobectomy was performed in only 8% (n = 10). AS was the initial management for 15% (n = 23) of the patients. The frequency of tumor enlargement was 14% (n = 3), after a median of 42 months (range, 7-72) of follow-up, without any evidence of lymph node or clinical distant metastases development. Deferred surgery was performed in 4 patients (17%) after a median of 24 months (range, 12-48) of AS. Follicular adenoma was diagnosed in three and a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in one patient, all of them without evidence of disease after 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Despite current guidelines does not support AS for indeterminate Bethesda IV nodules, our findings showed that most of these patients had excellent outcomes, in a setting where lobectomy was not the preference and the access to molecular testing was limited. Probably AS could be a valid alternative in these low-risk tumors in selected patients.","Smulever, Anabella; Pitoia, Fabián",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-020-02566-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411327/,139

96287,More Comprehensive Care for Miscarriage Needed Worldwide.,2021-06-15,"Sex is a biological variable that contributes to the incidence, clinical course, and treatment outcome of brain disorders. Chief among these are disorders associated with the dopamine system. These include Parkinson's disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, which show stark differences in prevalence and outcome between men and women. In order to reveal the influence of biological sex as a risk factor in these disorders, there is a critical need to collect fundamental information about basic properties of the dopamine system in males and females. In Long Evans rats, we measured dynamic and static properties related to the mesolimbic dopamine system. Static measures included assessing ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine cell number and volume and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. Dynamic measures in behaving animals included assessing (1) VTA neuronal encoding during learning of a cue-action-reward instrumental task and (2) dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to electrical stimulation of the VTA, vesicular depletion of dopamine, and amphetamine. We found little or no sex difference in these measures, suggesting sexual congruency in fundamental static and dynamic properties of dopamine neurons. Thus, dopamine related sex-differences are likely mediated by secondary mechanisms that flexibly influence the function of the dopamine cells and circuits. Finally, we noted that most behavioral sex differences had been reported in Sprague-Dawley rats and repeated some of the above measures in that strain. We found some sex differences in those animals highlighting the importance of considering strain differences in experimental design and result interpretation.","Rivera-Garcia, Maria Teresa; McCane, Aqilah M; Chowdhury, Tara G; Wallin-Miller, Kathryn G; Moghaddam, Bita",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0765-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663840/,139

This qualitative study aimed to examine the lived, psychosocial experiences of individuals with anorexia nervosa from within COVID-19 'lockdown' confinement. METHODS Audio-recorded semi -structured interviews were conducted online during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic during confinement with a purposive sample of 12 participants who identified as having Anorexia Nervosa. Interviews were transcribed and anonymous data analysed using Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). RESULTS Three key themes with six contributory subthemes were identified. Key themes were: loss of control, support during confinement, and time of reflection on recovery. Theme content varied according to stage of recovery and current clinical management. Availability of 'safe' foods, increases in compensatory exercise and symptomology, and enhanced opportunities for ""secrecy"" were described. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide a unique insight for a vulnerable group from within COVID-19 confinement. The data demonstrated that the impact for individuals with anorexia nervosa has been broadly negative, and participants voiced concerns over the long-term effects of the pandemic on their recovery. The findings highlight the risks of tele-health support and an important role for health professionals in enhancing targeted support during, and after confinement.","Hunter, Rachael; Gibson, Chloe",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171411/,139

We aim to describe a simple and unique technique for creating the colpotomy incision and to describe intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. METHODS Fifty patients underwent adnexal specimen retrieval through a posterior colpotomy incision. After devascularization and detachment of the adnexal specimen, the posterior cul-de-sac was visualized. The colpotomy incision was created by introducing a 12- or 15-mm laparoscopic trocar through the vagina into the posterior vaginal fornix under direct visualization. Specimens were placed into laparoscopic bags and removed through the vagina. The colpotomy incision was closed vaginally. Charts were reviewed for intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-nine women underwent adnexal surgery for an adnexal mass, 14 women underwent surgery for pelvic pain, and 7 women underwent adnexal surgery for primary prevention of malignancy. The specimens removed ranged in size from 2 to 16 cm (mean 5.7). The mean time patients were under anesthesia was 103 minutes (SD 57.3). There were no operative complications related to the colpotomy incision and no cases of postoperative vaginal cellulitis or pelvic infection were reported. Only 1 woman with a prior vaginal delivery reported dyspareunia postoperatively. CONCLUSION This simple technique for posterior colpotomy incision can easily be added to the gynecologic surgeon's armamentarium and can be safely used for most women.","Clark, Lindsay E; Menderes, Gulden; Tower, Amanda M; Silasi, Dan-Arin; Azodi, Masoud",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901107/,139

97527,Preliminary experience with the use of low profile visualized intraluminal support device in basilar artery for aneurysm treatment.,2019,"BACKGROUND In England, demand for primary care services is increasing and GP shortages are widespread. Recently introduced primary care networks (PCNs) aim to expand the use of additional practice-based roles such as physician associates (PAs), pharmacists, paramedics, and others through financial incentives for recruitment of these roles. Inequalities in general practice, including additional roles, have not been examined in recent years, which is a meaningful gap in the literature. Previous research has found that workforce inequalities are associated with health outcome inequalities. AIM To examine recent trends in general practice workforce inequalities. DESIGN & SETTING A longitudinal study using quarterly General Practice Workforce datasets from 2015-2020 in England. METHOD The slope indices of inequality (SIIs) for GPs, nurses, total direct patient care (DPC) staff, PAs, pharmacists, and paramedics per 10 000 patients were calculated quarterly, and plotted over time, with and without adjustment for patient need. RESULTS Fewer GPs, total DPC staff, and paramedics per 10 000 patients were employed in more deprived areas. Conversely, more PAs and pharmacists per 10 000 patients were employed in more deprived areas. With the exception of total DPC staff, these observed inequalities widened over time. The unadjusted analysis showed more nurses per 10 000 patients employed in more deprived areas. These values were not significant after adjustment but approached a more equal or pro-poor distribution over time. CONCLUSION Significant workforce inequalities exist and are even increasing for several key general practice roles, with workforce shortages disproportionately affecting more deprived areas. Policy solutions are urgently needed to ensure an equitably distributed workforce and reduce health inequities.","Nussbaum, Claire; Massou, Efthalia; Fisher, Rebecca; Morciano, Marcello; Harmer, Rachel; Ford, John",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404634/,139

METHOD Forty-one PLWH, 41 individuals with PD, and 37 CTL, aged 45-79 years, underwent neuropsychological, psychological, and neurological assessment including depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical (ADL-p) and instrumental (ADL-i) daily activities, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor ADLs (ADL-UPDRS-II), QOL, and cognitive and motor functions. Hierarchical regression analyses assessed the relative contribution of predictors including demographics, disease-related factors, comorbid conditions, and mood-related factors for ADL and QOL scales. RESULTS PLWH and PD participants reported more depressive symptoms and higher anxiety and worse QOL and ADL-i than CTL. The PD group had greater ADL-p and motor-related ADL-UPDRS-II difficulties than PLWH and CTL groups. In PLWH, medical comorbidities and alcohol use disorder (AUD)/substance use disorder (SUD) histories significantly contributed to poor physical and motor ADLs. Mood scores, particularly depressive symptoms, were independent predictors of poor QOL and most ADLs in both clinical groups, above the contribution of cognitive compromise. CONCLUSIONS Mood symptoms contribute significantly to poor ADLs and QOL in people aging with chronic diseases such as long-term HIV infection and PD. Comprehensive assessment and treatment of mood symptoms are recommended for ensuring optimal functional independence and life quality.

BACKGROUND The spread of COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to apply infection prevention and control measures, including interpersonal distancing and the use of personal protective equipment. These measures may impact communication and relationship between nurses, patients and caregivers especially in a complex environment, such as a paediatric setting. DESIGN A qualitative descriptive study design was adopted. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two wards of a maternal and child health hospital in north-east Italy. Data were collected between September and November 2020. Transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS Seventeen caregivers and 17 nurses were recruited using convenience sampling. Three themes were identified, namely: ""Impact on a trustworthy relationship""; ""Impact on common communication resources""; and ""Strategies to overcome barriers"". Participants agreed Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures impacted key elements of family-centred and compassionate care. Communication strategies and play were critical to overcoming the barriers encountered. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 containment measures impact communication and family-centred care in paediatric hospital settings. There is a need for stakeholders to consider family needs in interventions aimed at controlling pandemics' impact. CLINICAL RELEVANCE While COVID-19 pandemic urgency intensified the use of PPE and social distancing, strategies to overcome issues related to family-centred care should be considered in those wards such as oncology or infectious disease paediatric departments where these measures are continuously adopted. Beyond a greater communication awareness, strategies may comprise the implementation of virtual care to guarantee support, continuity of care and information between the child, the healthcare team and the family members that are not admitted to the hospital for safety reasons.","Ferrari, Giada; Dobrina, Raffaella; Buchini, Sara; Rudan, Iva; Schreiber, Silvana; Bicego, Livia",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036654/,139
99330,Hepatocellular carcinoma tumor thrombus entering the inferior vena cava treated with percutaneous RF ablation: a case report.,2019,"PURPOSE To assess the safety and effectiveness of LESS compared to conventional hysterectomy. METHODS The systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the MOOSE guideline, and quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Different databases were searched up to 4th of August 2016. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing LESS to the conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy were considered for inclusion. RESULTS Of the 668 unique articles, 23 were found relevant. We investigated safety by analyzing the complication rate and found no significant differences between both groups [OR 0.94 (0.61, 1.44), I 2 = 19%]. We assessed effectiveness by analyzing conversion risk, postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction. For conversion rates to laparotomy, no differences were identified [OR 1.60 (0.40, 6.38), I 2 = 45%]. In 3.5% of the cases in the LESS group, an additional port was needed during LESS. For postoperative pain scores and patient satisfaction, some of the included studies reported favorable results for LESS, but the clinical relevance was non-significant. Concerning secondary outcomes, only a difference in operative time was found in favor of the conventional group [MD 11.3 min (5.45-17.17), I 2 = 89%]. The quality of evidence for our primary outcomes was low or very low due to the study designs and lack of power for the specified outcomes. Therefore, caution is urged when interpreting the results. CONCLUSION The single-port technique for benign hysterectomy is feasible, safe, and equally effective compared to the conventional technique. No clinically relevant advantages were identified, and as no data on cost effectiveness are available, there are currently not enough valid arguments to broadly implement LESS for hysterectomy.","Sandberg, Evelien M; la Chapelle, Claire F; van den Tweel, Marjolein M; Schoones, Jan W; Jansen, Frank Willem",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-017-4323-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357561/,139
99623,The laboratory tests and host immunity of COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness.,2020-04-23,"Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5' ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses. In this study, the structure-function relationships of the N7-MTase were analyzed by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp14. The results showed that the ExoN domain is closely involved in the activity of the N7-MTase, suggesting that coronavirus N7-MTase is different from all other viral N7-MTases, which are separable from other structural domains located in the same polypeptide. Two of the 12 critical residues identified to be essential for the N7-MTase were located at the N terminus of the core ExoN domain, reinforcing a role of the ExoN domain in the N7-MTase activity of nsp14. The other 10 critical residues were distributed throughout the N7-MTase domain but localized mainly in the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding pocket and key structural elements of the MTase fold of nsp14. The sequence motif DxGxPxA (amino acids [aa] 331 to 338) was identified as the key part of the SAM-binding site. These results provide insights into the structure and functional mechanisms of coronaviral nsp14 N7-MTase.","Chen, Yu; Tao, Jiali; Sun, Ying; Wu, Andong; Su, Ceyang; Gao, Guozhen; Cai, Hui; Qiu, Su; Wu, Yingliang; Ahola, Tero; Guo, Deyin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00061-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536667/,139

Point-of-care ultrasonography is the imaging method of choice for patients at high risk, as it entails minimal risk of exposing providers to the virus.","Mucha, Simon R; Dugar, Siddharth; McCrae, Keith; Joseph, Douglas; Bartholomew, John; Sacha, Gretchen L; Militello, Michael",Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.3949/ccjm.87a.ccc024-up; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323363/,139
100633,Treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.,2020-09-02,"Background: The main theme of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to synthesize the evidence of randomized controlled trial of evidence of Pilates intervention, in comparison to control groups and other forms of exercise, for falls prevention in healthy older adults. Methods: The following electronic databases were searched up to October 2020; EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, MEDLINE (Ovid), Science Direct, Cochrane, and CINAHL. The recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were followed. A PICOS approach was adopted as a framework to formulate the research question and set the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were healthy older adults, defined as older adults who have maintained functional ability, including participants of both genders, those with a falls history, non-fallers, and individuals who were considered to be sedentary or active. Randomized controlled trials studies, written in the English language, from the decade, were included if they focused on specific outcome measures to decrease falls risk; functional mobility, mobility, fear of falling, gait, and postural stability. The PEDro scale was used to assess risk of bias. Results: There were included 12 studies. In total, 702 healthy older adults' participants were included. Pilates showed an effect in mediolateral directions in comparison to control groups (MD = -1.77, 95% CI, -2.84 to -0.70, p = 0.001, heterogeneity: I 2 = 3%), mobility (MD = 9.23, 95% CI, 5.74 to 12.73, p < 0.00001, heterogeneity: I 2 = 75%) and fear of falling (MD = -8.61, 95% CI, -10.16 to -7.07, p < 0.00001, heterogeneity: I 2 = 88%). In relation to other exercises group, Pilates showed positive effects in functional mobility (MD = -1.21, 95% CI, -2.30 to -0.11, p = 0.03, heterogeneity: I 2 = 80%), mobility (MD = 3.25, 95% CI, 1.46 to 5.04, p < 0.0004, heterogeneity: I 2 = 0%). No evidence of an improvement was found between the groups for dynamic gait index (MD = 2.26, 95% CI, -0.05 to 4.56, p = 0.06, heterogeneity: I 2 = 86%), anteroposterior directions of balance (MD = -1.58, 95% CI, -3.74 to -0.59, p = 0.15, heterogeneity: I 2 = 51%) and functional mobility when compared to control groups (no exercise) (MD = -1.24, 95% CI, -2.48 to -0.00, p = 0.05, heterogeneity: I 2 = 87%). Discussion: Pilates may be effective in decreasing the risk of falls in older adults. Pilates intervention was found to improve functional mobility, mobility, gait, fear of falling and postural stability and therefore there is some evidence to suggest that Pilates reduces certain risk factors for falls in healthy older adults. However, there is an absence of high-quality evidence in regards to the impact of Pilates on reducing falls and further robust RCTs are needed.

We describe the development of the comprehensive open Canadian Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (CAN-NPI) data set, which identifies and classifies all NPIs implemented in regions across Canada in response to COVID-19, and provides an accompanying description of geographic and temporal heterogeneity. METHODS We performed an environmental scan of government websites, news media and verified government social media accounts to identify NPIs implemented in Canada between Jan. 1 and Apr. 19, 2020. The CAN-NPI data set contains information about each intervention's timing, location, type, target population and alignment with a response stringency measure. We conducted descriptive analyses to characterize the temporal and geographic variation in early NPI implementation. RESULTS We recorded 2517 NPIs grouped in 63 distinct categories during this period. The median date of NPI implementation in Canada was Mar. 24, 2020. Most jurisdictions heightened the stringency of their response following the World Health Organization's global pandemic declaration on Mar. 11, 2020. However, there was variation among provinces or territories in the timing and stringency of NPI implementation, with 8 out of 13 provinces or territories declaring a state of emergency by Mar. 18, and all by Mar. 22, 2020. INTERPRETATION There was substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity in NPI implementation across Canada, highlighting the importance of a subnational lens in evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic response. Our comprehensive open-access data set will enable researchers to conduct robust interjurisdictional analyses of NPI impact in curtailing COVID-19 transmission.","McCoy, Liam G; Smith, Jonathan; Anchuri, Kavya; Berry, Isha; Pineda, Joanna; Harish, Vinyas; Lam, Andrew T; Yi, Seung Eun; Hu, Sophie; Rosella, Laura; Fine, Benjamin",CMAJ open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873583/,139

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and SYS share several phenotypic features including short stature, muscular hypotonia and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Evidence exists that similar to PWS, Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency may also be a feature of SYS. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) therapy has been approved for PWS, but the effects of rhGH therapy in individuals with SYS have not yet been documented. This retrospective, questionnaire-based study analyzes the prevalence of rhGH therapy in children with SYS, the effects of rhGH therapy on anthropometric measures, and parental perception of the treatment. Twenty-six individuals with SYS were sent a clinical questionnaire and a request for growth charts. We found a significant increase in height z-score (p* = 0.04) as well as a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) six months after rhGH therapy initiation (p* = 0.04). Furthermore, height z-scores of the treated group (mean z-score = -1.00) were significantly higher than those of the untreated group (mean z-score = -3.36, p = 0.01) at time of enrollment. All parents reported an increase in muscle strength and endurance, and several families noted beneficial effects such as improved cognition and motor development.

One attractive strategy is the application of reverse genetics technology to make recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) deliver protective antigens of pathogens. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated that rNDV-vectored vaccines can induce quicker and better humoral and mucosal immune responses than conventional vaccines and are protective against pathogen challenges. With deeper understanding of NDV molecular biology, it is feasible to develop gene-modified rNDV vaccines accompanied by good safety, high efficacy, low toxicity and better immunogenicity. This review summarizes the development of reverse genetics technology in using NDV as a promising vaccine vector to design new vaccines for human and animal use.","Duan, Zhiqiang; Xu, Houqiang; Ji, Xinqin; Zhao, Jiafu",Future microbiology,https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.15.59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234909/,139
102929,New-onset diabetes after adult liver transplantation in the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) study.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Although postoperative esophageal hiatal hernia (EHH) is primarily considered a post-operative complication of esophagectomy, it is also a rare post-operative complication of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG), with a reported incidence rate of 0.5 %. The purpose of this study is to analyze the incidence, clinical features, and prevention of EHH following LTG for gastric cancer. METHODS Between October 2008 and July 2014, 78 patients who underwent LTG for gastric cancer in our hospital were analyzed. We compared the crus incision group (in which the left crus of the diaphragm was incised without suture repair) with the crus conserving or repair group (in which the crus was preserved or the crus was incised and underwent suture repair). The primary endpoint was incidence of postoperative EHH. RESULTS Of the 78 patients, 7 (9.0 %) developed postoperative EHH. Three of seven patients (42.9 %) were symptomatic and required an emergency operation for intestinal obstruction. Four of seven patients (57.1 %) were asymptomatic and did not require an operation. Incising the left crus of the diaphragm without suture repair during LTG was considered the only risk factor for postoperative EHH (0 of 29 for preserving the crus or incising and performing suture repair of the crus vs. 7 of 49 in crus incision without suture repair; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS The present data suggest that incision of the crus without suture repair is associated with EHH after LTG. If crus incision is required, crus repair may be effective for the prevention of postoperative EHH.","Ito, Eisaku; Ohdaira, Hironori; Nakashima, Keigo; Suzuki, Norihiko; Imakita, Tomonori; Tsutsui, Nobuhiro; Yoshida, Masashi; Kitajima, Masaki; Suzuki, Yutaka",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4962-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27177954/,139

They are available in a variety of sizes and styles from several manufacturers. The dimensions of tracheostomy tubes are given by their inner diameter, outer diameter, length, and curvature. Differences in dimensions between tubes with the same inner diameter from different manufacturers are not commonly appreciated but may have important clinical implications. Tracheostomy tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed and may be fenestrated. Some tracheostomy tubes are designed with an inner cannula. It is important for clinicians caring for patients with a tracheostomy tube to appreciate the nuances of various tracheostomy tube designs and to select a tube that appropriately fits the patient. The optimal frequency of changing a chronic tracheostomy tube is controversial. Specialized teams may be useful in managing patients with a tracheostomy. Speech can be facilitated with a speaking valve in patients with a tracheostomy tube who are breathing spontaneously. In mechanically ventilated patients with a tracheostomy, a talking tracheostomy tube, a deflated cuff technique with a speaking valve, or a deflated cuff technique without a speaking valve can be used to facilitate speech.","Hess, Dean R; Altobelli, Neila P",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891201/,139

A consensus guideline for stent retriever size selection has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different diameters of Solitaire retrievers on outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 628 patients enrolled from the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke Registry, 256 were treated with the Solitaire 4-mm device and 372, with the 6-mm device. We matched patients treated with the 2 stent sizes using propensity score analysis. The successful outcome was reperfusion as measured by the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score immediately postprocedure and the dichotomized modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality were also recorded. RESULTS After propensity score analysis, group outcomes did not differ. In addition, in patients with atherosclerosis-related occlusion, a higher reperfusion rate (P = .021) was observed in the Solitaire 4 group, as well as a shorter time interval (P = .002) and fewer passes (P = .025). Independent predictors of successful reperfusion in patients with atherosclerotic disease on logistic analysis were the small stent (OR, 3.217; 95% CI, 1.129-9.162; P = .029) and the propensity score acting as a covariate (OR, 52.84; 95% CI, 3.468-805.018; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a differential effect of intra-arterial therapy based on the size of Solitaire retrievers. In patients with atherosclerotic disease, favorable reperfusion was associated with deployment of a small stent.","Yang, D; Hao, Y; Zi, W; Wang, H; Zheng, D; Li, H; Tu, M; Wan, Y; Jin, P; Xiao, G; Xiong, Y; Xu, G; Liu, X",AJNR.

However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore monitors the entire catchment, encompassing multiple municipalities, and is conducted using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which only quantifies one target. Sequencing methods provide additional strain information and also can identify other pathogens, broadening the applicability of WBE to beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using qPCR, targeted sequencing, and untargeted metatranscriptomics (total RNA sequencing) to provide a refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify other pathogens circulating in the community. We demonstrate feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Targeted wastewater-based sequencing over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population. Clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were monitored and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy. Furthermore, untargeted RNA sequencing identified several other pathogens in the samples. Therefore, untargeted RNA sequencing could be used to identify new outbreaks or emerging pathogens beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Spurbeck, Rachel R; Minard-Smith, Angela; Catlin, Lindsay",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051492/,139
105207,ADAPT technique with ACE68 and ACE64 reperfusion catheters in ischemic stroke treatment: results from the PROMISE study.,2019,"PURPOSE Acute respiratory distress syndrome, with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) remains a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Although venovenous extracorporeal lung support (VV-ECLS) has become a standard of care procedure in neonatal patients with acute pulmonary failure there are no reports regarding the use of a double-lumen cannula for extracorporeal minimal invasive lung support via the umbilical vein. METHODS A neonatal lamb model was used (n = 3). Umbilical vein was cannulated with a double-lumen catheter allowing venovenous extracorporeal gas exchange. Cannula was positioned with its tip in the right atrium. VV-ECLS was started and ventilation was stopped. Providing oxygenation and CO2 removal solely through VV-ECLS hemodynamics, blood gases were measured. RESULTS Total VV-ECLS without MV was applied to all three neonatal lambs. Time on venovenous ECLS was 60, 120 and 120 min. Initial pCO2 was 60, 56 and 65 mmHg compared to 31, 32 and 32 mmHg at the end of VV-ECLS. Initial pO2 was 30, 27 and 26 mmHg compared to 22, 19 and 23 mmHg. Initial lactate was 5, 10 and 3.7 mmol/l compared to 13.3, 12.6 and 11.3 mmol/l at the end of VV-ECLS. MAP at baseline was 51, 52 and 65 mmHg compared to 36, 38 and 41 mmHg at the end of VV-ECLS. In all three lambs inotropes were admitted to maintain MAD >35 mmHg. CONCLUSION Even without mechanical ventilation we were able to sufficiently remove pCO2 with our new minimal invasive VV-ECLS using a double-lumen catheter via the umbilical vein, supporting the idea of a lung protective strategy in neonatal acute respiratory failure. pO2 was measured 22, 19 and 23 mmHg, respectively, at the end of VV-ECLS, at least partially caused by recirculation phenomenon, which could possibly be improved by different cannula design. Inotropic support was necessary during VV-ECLS to achieve targeted MAD > 35 mmHg. While technically feasible, this new approach might allow further research in the field of extracorporeal lung support and therefore will follow the concept of a lung protective strategy in acute neonatal respiratory failure.","Schmidt, Florian; Kuebler, J; Ganter, M; Jack, T; Meschenmoser, L; Sasse, M; Boehne, M; Bertram, H; Beerbaum, P; Koeditz, H",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-015-3815-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507850/,139

Secondary objectives included assessment of apical success, mesh or suture exposure, and postoperative quality of life (QoL) measures 12 months after surgery. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study including women who underwent a hysterectomy with concomitant USLS or SCP with delayed-absorbable suture from January 2011 to December 2015 with 1-year follow-up. Successful anterior vaginal wall support was defined as Ba of less than 0. Successful apical support was defined as no apical descent (point C) greater than one half of the total vaginal length. In addition, 1-year QoL questionnaires were measured postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 282 women were identified. Sixty-two women (31 vaginal USLS and 31 SCP) met inclusion criteria. Demographics were similar between groups except for a higher body mass index in the USLS group (27.5 ± 5.6 kg/m vs 24.1 ± 3.3 kg/m, P < 0.05). Preoperative POP-Q was mostly stage II and III. At 1-year, anatomic success rates for the anterior compartment were 66.7% versus 90.3% for USLS and SCP groups, respectively (P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in apical success (P = 1.00) or QoL scores between groups at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Anatomic success rates at 1 year using delayed-absorbable suture were better for SCP when using the anterior wall as a measure of success, but there were no significant differences in apical success rates, mesh or suture exposure, and QoL measures between groups.","Bastawros, Dina A; Tarr, Megan E; Templin, Megan A; Stepp, Kevin J; Taylor, G Bernard; Myers, Erinn M",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000000647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394992/,139

As healthcare staff can come into contact with viral infections during many healthcare services, it is essential during the epidemic that Hungarian professionals working in various fields receive up-to-date information about the virus and the aspects of the infection that affect patient care and proposed measures. The present paper is a literature review in which the authors have elaborated on the currently available, relevant references, keeping in mind the epidemiological implications of clinical care. Based on the processed publications, it can be stated that during the interventions primarily affecting the head and neck region, especially in the case of interventions requiring the use of a rotating device, it is essential to fully protect all staff in the room with disposable full clothing, goggles and special masks. Replacement of this equipment and cleaning of the surgery should be done after each intervention and the entire supply team should be prepared for this in advance with training.

Three sizes of BIOLOX delta ceramic cups (total hip replacement cup with bearing diameter of 32 mm and two hip resurfacing cups with bearing diameters of 40 and 64mm) were implanted into reamed Sawbones blocks representing acetabulae. Three cups of each size were fully supported by the block and three were implanted with 15° of the cup's outer diameter unsupported by the block. All testing was conducted with the corresponding bearing diameter heads lateralised by approximately 1 mm to represent worst case subluxed hips and all then subjected to test, replicating a lateral fall impact followed by a car crash impact. All cups passed lateral fall conditions without visible damage, although some movement of the cups was measured and damage to the blocks was observed. Five out of six of each cup size survived the car crash impacts with one fracture per size. In all cases, this was in the fully supported condition representing the highest cup inclination angle. The car crash impact force was equivalent to that reported to fracture the acetabulum and in all simulated cases, the Sawbones block showed signs of damage. Survival of five cups per size suggests the pelvis is much more likely to fracture before the cup.

105867,A Patient with Eight Intracranial Aneurysms: Endovascular Treatment in Two Sessions.,2016,"BACKGROUND Flow diversion is an established technique for treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The Pipeline embolization device (PED) is the only FDA-approved flow diverting stent in the USA. A second-generation device, PED Flex, has recently been released with modifications to the delivery system. Published reports of experience with this new device are limited. OBJECTIVE To describe the initial outcomes from the first North American series using the PED Flex-a single-center experience of 44 cases. METHODS All patients consecutively treated with the PED Flex embolization device from February 2015 through April 2015 were included in the study. Data were collected for patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, technical procedural details, and early outcomes. RESULTS PED Flex treatment was attempted in 42 patients (mean 56.6±2.0 years) with 44 aneurysms (mean size 6.5±0.6 mm), 41/44 (93%) of which were anterior circulation and 3/44 (7%) were posterior circulation. PED Flex was successfully implanted in 43/44 cases (98%). A single device was used in 41/43 cases (95%), with a mean of 1.07±0.05 devices implanted per case. Resheathing was performed in 4/44 cases (9%). Mean postprocedure hospital length of stay was 1.3±0.2 days. One significant neurological complication (2.3%) occurred, which was a stroke in a patient non-compliant with the prescribed antiplatelet regimen. CONCLUSIONS Pipeline Flex is a second-generation flow diverter with enhanced features compared with the first-generation PED. These modifications allow for more reliable deployment with continued improvements in procedural safety.","Colby, Geoffrey P; Lin, Li-Mei; Caplan, Justin M; Jiang, Bowen; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26136500/,139

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. METHODS All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 - September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8≥10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7≥10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5≥7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID≥2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable ""disabling"" current mental disorders. RESULTS 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring ""all of the time"" for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). CONCLUSIONS One in seven Spanish healthcare workers screened positive for a disabling mental disorder during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers reporting pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, those frequently exposed to COVID-19 patients, infected or quarantined/isolated, female workers, and auxiliary nurses should be considered groups in need of mental health monitoring and support.","Alonso, Jordi; Vilagut, Gemma; Mortier, Philippe; Ferrer, Montse; Alayo, Itxaso; Aragón-Peña, Andrés; Aragonès, Enric; Campos, Mireia; Cura-González, Isabel D; Emparanza, José I; Espuga, Meritxell; Forjaz, Maria João; González-Pinto, Ana; Haro, Josep M; López-Fresneña, Nieves; Salázar, Alma D Martínez de; Molina, Juan D; Ortí-Lucas, Rafael M; Parellada, Mara; Pelayo-Terán, José Maria; Pérez-Zapata, Aurora; Pijoan, José I; Plana, Nieves; Puig, Maria Teresa; Rius, Cristina; Rodríguez-Blázquez, Carmen; Sanz, Ferran; Serra, Consol; Kessler, Ronald C; Bruffaerts, Ronny; Vieta, Eduard; Pérez-Solà, Víctor",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsmen.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127211/,139

Despite the generosity of health workers, we are undergoing a severe humanitarian crisis that is stressing every aspect of daily life. From outside it is very hard to understand, because houses are closed for lockdown and are not destroyed as they would be in an earthquake. An outbreak is not ""only"" a sudden mass lethal incident, like a natural disaster, neither ""only"" a disease, to be treated by doctors, but a social phenomenon too. Historical and social elements are key factors for development (for example, intensive promiscuity between animals and humans) and spread of an epidemic (for example, health workers and ambulance rapidly become vector of the virus). Can medical responsibility change in times of pandemic? My answer, as anaesthetist and intensive care physician from Bergamo, is yes. When the global medical community is called on to face a pandemic of unprecedented scale, with little scientific evidence and ""crazy numbers"" describing the situation, honest and forthcoming advocacy is an ethical duty.

106855,Incorporating a clinical oncology pharmacist into an ambulatory care pharmacy in pediatric hematology-oncology and transplant clinic: Assessment and significance.,2020-07-06,"INTRODUCTION The identification of more efficient gene delivery vehicles (GDVs) is essential to fulfill the expectations of clinical gene therapy. Bacteriophages, due to their excellent safety profile, extreme stability under a variety of harsh environmental conditions and the capability for being genetically manipulated, have drawn a flurry of interest to be applied as a newly arisen category of gene delivery platforms. AREAS COVERED The incessant evolutionary interaction of bacteriophages with human cells has turned them into a part of our body's natural ecosystem. However, these carriers represent several barriers to gene transduction of mammalian cells. The lack of evolvement of specialized machinery for targeted cellular internalization, endosomal, lysosomal and proteasomal escape, cytoplasmic entry, nuclear localization and intranuclear transcription poses major challenges to the expression of the phage-carried gene. In this review, we describe pros and cons of bacteriophages as GDVs, provide an insight into numerous barriers that bacteriophages face for entry into and subsequent trafficking inside mammalian cells and elaborate on the strategies used to bypass these barriers. EXPERT OPINION Tremendous genetic flexibility of bacteriophages to undergo numerous surface modifications through phage display technology has proven to be a turning point in the uncompromising efforts to surmount the limitations of phage-mediated gene expression. The revelatory outcomes of the studies undertaken within the recent years have been promising for phage-mediated gene delivery to move from concept to reality.","Bakhshinejad, Babak; Sadeghizadeh, Majid",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2014.927437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955860/,139
106975,"Characterization of the DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE Axis on Circulating NK, NKT-Like and T Cell Subsets in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.",2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND Hundreds of variants associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, two common inflammatory skin disorders, have previously been discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The majority of these variants are in non-coding regions and their target genes remain largely unclear. OBJECTIVE We sought to understand the effects of these non-coding variants on the development of AD and psoriasis by linking them to the genes they regulate. METHODS We constructed genomic 3D maps of human keratinocytes during differentiation using capture Hi-C targeting more >20, 000 promoters and 214 GWAS variants and combined this with transcriptome and epigenomic datasets. We validated our results with reporter assays, CRISPR activation and examination of patient gene expression from previous studies. RESULTS We identified 118 target genes of 82 AD and psoriasis GWAS-variants. Differential expression of 49% (58) of the 118 target genes occurred in either AD or psoriatic lesions, many of which were not previously linked to any skin disease. We highlight AFG1L, CLINT1, ADO, LINC00302, and RP1-140J1.1 genes and provide further evidence for their potential roles in AD and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS Our work focuses on skin barrier pathology through investigation of the interaction profile of GWAS-variants during keratinocyte differentiation. We provide a catalogue of candidate genes that could modulate the risk of AD and psoriasis. Given that only 35% of the target genes are the nearest gene to the known GWAS variants, we expect that our work will contribute to the discovery of novel pathways involved in AD and psoriasis.","Sahlén, Pelin; Spalinskas, Rapolas; Asad, Samina; Mahapatra, Kunal Das; Höjer, Pontus; Anil, Anandashankar; Eisfeldt, Jesper; Srivastava, Ankit; Nikamo, Pernilla; Mukherjee, Anaya; Kim, Kyu-Han; Bergman, Otto; Ståhle, Mona; Sonkoly, Enikö; Pivarcsi, Andor; Wahlgren, Carl-Fredrik; Nordenskjöld, Magnus; Taylan, Fulya; Bradley, Maria; Tapia-Páez, Isabel",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069716/,139

Many pharmacists now work collaboratively with other health providers to ensure effective and safe use of medicines, as well as being involved in the prevention and management of chronic health conditions. AIM To explore the role of New Zealand community pharmacists in the provision of opioid substitution treatment and how they perceive their role as part of the wider opioid substitution treatment team. METHODS Semi-structured video interviews with a purposive sample of 13 diverse pharmacists explored their current practices in providing opioid substitution treatment, and their perceived role in the treatment team. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS This study found that pharmacists are providing accessible support to a population with known barriers to accessing health care. However, participants also identified challenges with communication and a perceived lack of understanding of the pharmacist role as barriers to collaboration with the wider opioid substitution treatment team. DISCUSSION Collaboration within health-care teams has been shown to improve health outcomes, and pharmacists are well placed to provide health-care services as well as offer valuable insight into clients' mental and physical wellbeing. Improved communication channels that facilitate information sharing, as well as the opioid substitution treatment team's recognition of a pharmacist's role, may facilitate collaboration and, in turn, improve the quality of health care provided to this vulnerable population.","Lukey, Rebecca; Gray, Ben; Morris, Caroline",Journal of primary health care,https://doi.org/10.1071/hc20108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349324/,139
107246,The 1-minute sit-to-stand test to detect exercise-induced oxygen desaturation in patients with interstitial lung disease.,2018,"BACKGROUND Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. RESULTS Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.","Li, Yuanyuan; Zhao, Jingbo; Ma, Zijuan; McReynolds, Larkin S; Lin, Dihuan; Chen, Zihao; Wang, Tong; Wang, Dongfang; Zhang, Yifan; Zhang, Jinfang; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257043/,139

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is considered to be the most effective procedure for the treatment of tumors of the pancreatic head and periampullary tumors. Postoperative morbidity remains high, reaching 40-50% in some series. Leakage and stricture of hepaticojejunal anastomosis have a special significance and occur in 2.5-5% of cases. The usefulness of mechanical staplers is well established in gastric and colorectal surgery, but their use in creating biliodigestive anastomosis is still a very controversial application. In the last 2 years (Nov 2008-Nov 2010), seven patients who underwent PD and presented at the time of operation, a main bile duct (MBD) greater of 20 mm, received a mechanical biliodigestive anastomosis with surgical stapler. All the patients were postoperatively controlled with an ultrasonography at 3 and 6 months, and a cholangio MRI at 1 year from operation. The follow up of the seven patients ranged from 3 to 18 months. Six patients are still alive and free of oncologic disease. One patient presented a single episode of cholangitis with a significant reduction of caliber of the biliodigestive anastomosis. The remaining five patients showed a good caliber of hepaticojejunal anastomosis. The authors suggest this procedure as a safe, feasible, more rapid and easier technique than traditional suture for bilioenteric anastomosis, when a suitable caliber of MBD allows to perform it.","Tersigni, Roberto; Capaldi, Massimo; Cortese, Andrea",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-011-0102-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21850554/,139

METHODS A total of 40 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline clinical data, CT images, and laboratory testing results were collected from all patients. We defined that ROIs in the absorption group decreased in the density and scope in GGO, and ROIs in the progress group progressed to consolidation. A total of 180 ROIs from absorption group (n = 118) and consolidation group (n = 62) were randomly divided into a training set (n = 145) and a validation set (n = 35) (8:2). Radiomics features were extracted from CT images, and the radiomics-based models were built with three classifiers. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated by a linear combination of selected features. The Rad-score and clinical factors were incorporated into the radiomics nomogram construction. The prediction performance of the clinical factors model and the radiomics nomogram for prognosis was estimated. RESULTS A total of 15 radiomics features with respective coefficients were calculated. The AUC values of radiomics models (kNN, SVM, and LR) were 0.88, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively, showing a good performance. The C-index of the clinical factors model was 0.82 [95% CI (0.75-0.88)] in the training set and 0.77 [95% CI (0.59-0.90)] in the validation set. The radiomics nomogram showed optimal prediction performance. In the training set, the C-index was 0.91 [95% CI (0.85-0.95)], and in the validation set, the C-index was 0.85 [95% CI (0.69-0.95)]. For the training set, the C-index of the radiomics nomogram was significantly higher than the clinical factors model (p = 0.0021). Decision curve analysis showed that radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical model in terms of clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS The radiomics nomogram based on CT images showed favorable prediction performance in the prognosis of COVID-19. The radiomics nomogram could be used as a potential biomarker for more accurate categorization of patients into different stages for clinical decision-making process. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Radiomics features based on chest CT images help clinicians to categorize the patients of COVID-19 into different stages. Radiomics nomogram based on CT images has favorable predictive performance in the prognosis of COVID-19. Radiomics act as a potential modality to supplement conventional medical examinations.","Chen, Hang; Zeng, Ming; Wang, Xinglan; Su, Liping; Xia, Yuwei; Yang, Quan; Liu, Dan",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296222/,139

OBJECTIVES In this literature review, we aim to identify challenges, knowledge gaps, and successes associated with each stage of HBB programming. DATA SOURCES Databases used in the systematic search included Medline, POPLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, African Index Medicus, Cochrane, and Index Medicus. STUDY SELECTION All articles related to HBB, in any language, were included. Article quality was assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted if related to HBB, including its implementation, acquisition and retention of HBB knowledge and skills, changes in provider behavior and clinical care, or the impact on newborn outcomes. RESULTS Ninety-four articles met inclusion criteria. Barriers to HBB implementation include staff turnover and limited time or focus on training and practice. Researchers of several studies found HBB cost-effective. Posttraining decline in knowledge and skills can be prevented with low-dose high-frequency refresher trainings, on-the-job practice, or similar interventions. Impact of HBB training on provider clinical practices varies. Although not universal, researchers in multiple studies have shown a significant association of decreased perinatal mortality with HBB implementation. LIMITATIONS In addition to not conducting a gray literature search, articles relating only to Essential Care for Every Baby or Essential Care for Small Babies were not included in this review. CONCLUSIONS Key challenges and requirements for success associated with each stage of HBB programming were identified.

Despite a number of candidate drugs showing limited efficacy in vitro and/or in non-human primate studies, EVD continues to plaque certain areas of Africa without any efficacious treatments yet available. Recently, we have been exploring the potential for anti-malarial drugs to inhibit an in vitro model of Ebola Zaire replication using a transcription-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) assay. We examined the efficacy of chloroquine, amodiaquine and 36 novel anti-parasite quinoline derivatives at inhibiting Ebola virus replication. Drug efficacy was tested by trVLP assay and toxicity by MTT assay. Both chloroquine and amodiaquine were effective for inhibition of Ebola virus replication without significant toxicity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of chloroquine and amodiaquine to inhibit Ebola virus replication were IC 50, Chl = 3.95 µM and IC 50, Amo = 1.45 µM, respectively. Additionally, three novel quinoline derivatives were identified as having inhibitory activity and low toxicity for Ebola trVLP replication, with 2NH2Q being the most promising derivative, with an IC 50 of 4.66 µM. Quinoline compounds offer many advantages for disease treatment in tropical climates as they are cheap to produce, easy to synthesize and chemically stable.

Furthermore, the effects of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) mixed into milk replacer on the AER were determined. Acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was performed to estimate the AER. Sixty Holstein-Frisian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study and divided into groups as follows: healthy calves (H; n = 16), healthy calves fed with ORS (HORS; n = 14), diarrhoeic calves (D; n = 15) and diarrhoeic calves fed with ORS (DORS; n = 15). For the APAT, the calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen (AP)/kg body weight. Venous blood samples were collected before and after milk replacer and AP intake in 30-60 min intervals for 12 hr. During the APAT, no significant differences in median maximum acetaminophen concentration (Cmax ) were observed among all groups. Time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (Tmax ) in DORS (median 390 min, 25/75 quartiles: 300/480 min) was significantly higher compared with that in H (median: 270 min 25/75 quartiles: 210/315 min) and HORS (median: 300 min (25/75 quartiles: 240/360 min). Non-linear regression revealed that the calculated abomasal half-life (AP t1/2 ) tended to be delayed in DORS (median: 652 min, 25/75 quartiles: 445/795 min, p = .10). The area under the AP curve values (AUC) from 0 to 120 min and 0 to 240 min of the observation period were significantly higher in H than D and DORS. In conclusion, significant differences in the AER indices reflected delayed abomasal emptying in diarrhoeic calves. Furthermore, the hypertonic ORS tended to have an additive delaying impact on the AER, which needs attention for the feeding management of diarrhoeic calves.","Hildebrandt, Thomas; Scheuch, Eberhard; Weitschies, Werner; Schneider, Felix; Grimm, Michael; Bachmann, Lisa; Vervuert, Ingrid",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpn.13306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31943416/,139

METHODS A multiinstitutional robotic surgical consortium was created to evaluate the usefulness of robotics for gynecologic oncology surgery. An analysis of a multiinstitutional database of all patients who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial carcinoma between April 2003 and January 2009 was performed. Records were reviewed for demographic data and perioperative outcomes. Individual surgeon outcomes were analyzed as well in an attempt to evaluate characteristics of learning with incorporation of robotic technology. RESULTS Four hundred five patients were identified who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial cancer. Mean age was 62.2 years and mean body mass index was 32.4. Fifty-five percent of patients reported a prior abdominal surgery. Final pathologic analysis demonstrated that 89.6% of all patients had stage I and II disease. Mean operative time was 170.5 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 87.5 mL. Mean lymph node count was 15.5. Mean hospital stay was 1.8 days. Intraoperative complications occurred in 3.5% of the patients and conversion to laparotomy occurred in 6.7%. Postoperative complications were reported in 14.6% of the patients. For the group, fewer than 10 cases were required to achieve proficiency with the procedure. CONCLUSION Robotic technology may level the playing field between the novice and expert laparoscopist for endometrial cancer staging.

METHODS We performed a realist synthesis and meta-narrative review extracting data in English, French, German and Thai from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Biomed Central, Cochrane Library, and Thai Journals Online, until 1 January 2021. The primary outcome variable was CMF manifestations grouped into 5 categories: (1) mouth and throat, (2) nose, paranasal sinus, and skull base (3) ocular/orbital and periorbital tissue, (4) ear, and (5) craniofacial skin. Appropriate statistics was computed. RESULTS Thirty-seven original articles meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed; all were in English and indexed in PubMed/Medline. Hand searches of their references yielded a total of 101 articles for the review. Most data were in low level of evidence and focused on smell and taste disturbances and non-specific orofacial lesions. Iatrogenic complications may occur in this body region. Conservative measures remained effective and were usually enough for patient care. CONCLUSION Because SARS-CoV-2 infection is new and becomes the stringent worldwide pandemic within a short time period, most of the data on CMF symptoms are of low level evidence. Apart from taste and smell dysfunctions, non-specific CMF lesions can be found and treated conservatively. Treatment complications are possible. Dentists and CMF surgeons are privileged to examine the orofacial region and work closely with colleagues in other specialities to combat this pandemic.","Pitak-Arnnop, Poramate; Meningaud, Jean-Paul; Sirintawat, Nattapong; Subbalekha, Keskanya; Auychai, Prim; Iamaroon, Anak; O-Charoenrat, Pornchai; Suntorntham, Surajit; Messer-Peti, Robert; Neff, Andreas","Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jormas.2021.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524604/,139

108959,Dimensions of the posterior cerebral circulation: an analysis based on advanced non-invasive imaging.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Public health emergencies resulting from major man-made crises and large-scale natural disasters severely impact developing countries, causing unprecedented rates of indirect mortality and morbidity, especially in children and women. Concomitantly, the state of children's health in the least-developed countries is the worst since the 1950s before the Declaration of Alma Ata. Worldwide decline in public health protections, infrastructures, and systems, and a health worker crisis primarily in Africa and Asia, limit the delivery of intensive and critical care services. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subgroups by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS Using pandemics as a model of public health emergencies, steps to improve care to the most vulnerable of populations are outlined, including mandates under the International Health Regulations Treaty of 2007 and World Health Organization guidelines. Recommendations include an emphasis on first improving primary care, prevention, and basic emergency care, where possible. Advances in care should move incrementally without compromising primary care resources. A first step in preparing for a pandemic in developing countries involves building capacity in public health surveillance and proven community containment and mitigation strategies. Given the severe lack of healthcare workers in at least 57 countries, the Task Force also supports World Health Organization's recommendations that planning for a public health emergency include means for health workers to collaborate with staff in the military, transport, and education sectors as well as international healthcare workers to maximize the efficiency of scarce human resources. Rapid response teams can be augmented by international subject matter experts if these do not exist at the country level.","Burkle, Frederick M; Argent, Andrew C; Kissoon, Niranjan",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e318234a906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067927/,139
109080,Endovascular Interventions for Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Review of Recent Trials.,2016,"OBJECTIVES To systematically review Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the management of menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS) to 1) identify those that include Natural Health Products (NHPs); 2) identify which NHPs were included and the evidence supporting the recommendation for the place in therapy; and 3) compare methodological quality of the CPGs. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, BMJ Best Practice, DynaMed Plus and websites of gynecological and menopausal societies were searched (Jan 2000-Nov 2018). Records were screened to identify CPGs that were published in English, since 2000 and were for use in North America. CPGs were reviewed for inclusion of NHPs. Data regarding NHPs (evidence, recommendation) were extracted and analyzed. CPGs were critically appraised using the AGREE II tool. RESULTS Five of six CPGs that met general inclusion criteria included NHPs. Black cohosh, isoflavones, soy food/extracts and phytoestrogens were included in all five CPGs. Comparative analysis of recommendations and level of supporting evidence revealed differences. All CPGs included recommendations regarding the use of NHPs in general, although recommendations differed. Four of five CPGs made recommendations for unique NHPs, however, recommendations differed. Using the AGREE II tool, CPGs scored well on domains for purpose and clarity. Lack of detailed description of methodology and author expertise affected scores in other domains. CONCLUSION Five CPGs included general recommendations for the role of NHPs in treating VMS, with recommendations ranging from use with caution to not recommended. There were inconsistencies among CPGs regarding NHPs included and what evidence was used in making recommendations.","Jurgens, Tannis; Chan, Bridgette; Caron, Carolanne; Whelan, Anne Marie",Complementary therapies in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32147040/,139

Samples obtained from live trapping ( n = 58) or harvested carcasses ( n = 34) were serologically tested for select pathogens. Antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii and canine distemper virus were detected in 58 and 3.4% of samples, respectively. All samples were seronegative for Leptospira spp. and negative for Dirofilaria immitis antigen. Urine samples tested for Leptospira spp. via immunofluorescent antibody assay ( n = 7), polymerase chain reaction ( n = 6) , or both ( n = 3) were all negative. Parvovirus DNA was detected in 9.1% of small intestine samples ( n = 22) collected from carcasses and in 3.7% of fecal samples ( n = 27) collected during live trapping. Complete blood counts ( n = 64) and serum biochemistries ( n = 63) were obtained from 49 live-trapped martens. Biochemical parameters found to be significantly different ( P < 0.05) between genders were calcium, creatinine, glucose, and phosphorus. There was no significant difference between genders for any hematologic parameter. Significant differences ( P < 0.05) between summer and winter seasons were found in total estimated white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, calcium, creatinine, globulin, glucose, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and total protein. There was no significant difference in blood cell count or serum biochemistry values between radio-collared ( n = 17) and noncollared ( n = 47) martens. Animals seropositive for T. gondii were found to have significantly higher ( P < 0.05) eosinophil and globulin levels than seronegative animals. The primary natural cause for mortality of radio-collared American martens was predation. Histologic examinations revealed a high percentage (60%) of martens with verminous or granulomatous pneumonia.","Spriggs, Maria C; Gerhold, Richard W; Wilkes, Rebecca P; Keenlance, Paul; Sanders, Robert L; Witt, Jill; Clark, Eric; Miller, Debra",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0125.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900765/,139

From 1 January 2020, the data capture government policies related to closure and containment, health and economic policy for more than 180 countries, plus several countries' subnational jurisdictions. Policy responses are recorded on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 policy areas, capturing variation in degree of response. We present two motivating applications of the data, highlighting patterns in the timing of policy adoption and subsequent policy easing and reimposition, and illustrating how the data can be combined with behavioural and epidemiological indicators. This database enables researchers and policymakers to explore the empirical effects of policy responses on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as on economic and social welfare.","Hale, Thomas; Angrist, Noam; Goldszmidt, Rafael; Kira, Beatriz; Petherick, Anna; Phillips, Toby; Webster, Samuel; Cameron-Blake, Emily; Hallas, Laura; Majumdar, Saptarshi; Tatlow, Helen",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686204/,139
109373,Expression of concern.,2011,"Due to limited access to more powerful diagnostic tools, there are few data on the burden of fungal infections in Côte d'Ivoire, despite a high HIV and TB burden and many cutaneous diseases. Here we estimate the burden of serious fungal infections in this sub-Saharan country with a health profiling description. National demographics were used and PubMed searches to retrieve all published articles on fungal infections in Côte d'Ivoire and other bordering countries in West Africa. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate frequencies of fungal infections, using previously described methodology by LIFE (www.LIFE-Worldwide.org). The population of Côte d'Ivoire is around 25 million; 37% are children (≤14 years), and 9% are>65 years. Tinea capitis in children is common, measured at 13.9% in 2013. Considering the prevalence of HIV infection (2.6% of the population, a total of ∼500,000) and a hospital incidence of 12.7% of cryptococcosis, it is estimated that 4590 patients per year develop cryptococcosis. For pneumocystosis, it is suggested that 2640 new cases occur each year with the prevalence of 11% of newly diagnosed HIV adults, and 33% of children with HIV/AIDS. Disseminated histoplasmosis is estimated a 1.4% of advanced HIV disease - 513 cases. An estimated 6568 news cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) occur after pulmonary tuberculosis (a 5-year prevalence of 6568 cases [26/100,000]). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) were estimated in 104/100,000 and 151/100,000 respectively, in 1,152,178 adult asthmatics. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common and recurrent VVC affects ∼6% of women in their fertile years - 421,936 women. An unknown number develop candidaemia and invasive aspergillosis. The annual incidence of fungal keratitis is estimated at 3350. No cases of sporotrichosis, mucormycosis and chromoblastomycosis are described, although some cases of mycetoma and Conidiobolus infection have been reported. This study indicates that around to 7.25% (1.8 million) of the population is affected by a serious fungal infection, predominently tinea capitis in children and rVVC in women. These data should be used to inform epidemiological studies, diagnostic needs and therapeutic strategies in Côte d'Ivoire.","Koffi, D; Bonouman, I V; Toure, A O; Kouadjo, F; N'Gou, M R E; Sylla, K; Dosso, M; Denning, D W",Journal de mycologie medicale,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.101086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259981/,139
109383,Management of coeliac disease patients after the confirmation of diagnosis in Central Europe.,2021-01-06,"Objectives: To evaluate patient engagement and usage of a prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) and associated outcomes of opioid use and treatment retention in a large real-world dataset of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) treated with buprenorphine MOUD. PDTs are software-based disease treatments evaluated for safety and effectiveness in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat disease with approved directions for use (label). Methods: A real-world observational evaluation of an all-comer population of patients who redeemed a 12-week prescription for the reSET-O PDT. Engagement and therapeutic use data were collected and analysed on a population level. Substance use was evaluated as a composite of self-reports recorded with reSET-O and urine drug screens. Results: Data from 3,144 individuals with OUD were evaluated. 45.5% were between ages 30 and 39 years. 80% completed at least 8 of 67 possible therapeutic modules, 66% completed half of all modules, and 49% completed all modules. Abstinence during the last 4 weeks of treatment was calculated with two imputation methodologies: 66% abstinent using ""missing data excluded (patients with no data as positive),"" and 91% abstinent with ""missing data removed (patients with no data excluded)."" 91% of patients met the responder definition of ≥80% of self-report or UDS negative. 74.2% of patients were retained through the last 4 weeks of treatment. Subgroup analysis of patients using reSET-O appropriately (4 or more modules per week for the first 4 weeks) showed 88.1% abstinence using ""missing data excluded (patients with no data as positive,"" and retention at weeks 9-12 of 85.8%. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that reSET-O is readily and broadly used by patients with OUD and that high real-world engagement with the therapeutic is positively associated with abstinence and retention in treatment. ReSET-O is a potentially valuable adjunct to buprenorphine MOUD therapy for patients with OUD.","Maricich, Yuri A; Xiong, Xiaorui; Gerwien, Robert; Kuo, Alice; Velez, Fulton; Imbert, Bruce; Boyer, Keely; Luderer, Hilary F; Braun, Stephen; Williams, Karren",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1846023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140981/,139

Approaches to overcoming these issues appear promising via the integration of vaccine technology with biomaterials, which offer sustained-release properties and preserve proteins, prevent conformational changes, and enable storage at room temperature. Sustained release and thermal stabilization of therapeutic biomacromolecules is an emerging area that integrates material science, chemistry, immunology, nanotechnology, and pathology to investigate different biocompatible materials. Biomaterials, including natural sugar polymers, synthetic polyesters produced from biologically derived monomers, hydrogel blends, protein-polymer blends, and metal-organic frameworks, have emerged as early players in the field.

The ability to standardize a technique for TAMIS will lead to the most reproducible outcomes and enable teaching. METHODS A retrospective, IRB-approved chart review was conducted of 32 patients who underwent the TAMIS procedure at one institution over a 3-year period. RESULTS TAMIS was performed for 11 benign and 21 malignant lesions. The majority of resections were full thickness (29/32) and all were R0. Average distance from the anal verge was 7.5 ± 3 cm, defect circumference was 43.7 ± 10%, operative time was 131 ± 80 min, and length of stay was 1.1 ± 1 days. Two patients had morbidities requiring readmission and further treatment for (1) an aspiration pneumonia with CHF exacerbation and (2) a rectal abscess.

We assessed the effectiveness of a novel thrombectomy device that was specifically designed to retrieve resistant fibrin rich clots, the geometric clot extractor (GCE; Neuravi, Galway, Ireland), in an in vitro cerebrovascular occlusion stroke model. METHODS After introducing fibrin rich clot analogues into the middle cerebral artery of the model, we compared the rates of recanalization between GCE and Solitaire flow restoration stent retriever (SR; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; control group) cases. A maximum of three passes of each device was allowed. If the SR failed to recanalize the vessel after three passes, one pass of the GCE was allowed (rescue cases). RESULTS In a total of 26 thrombectomy cases (13 GCE, 13 SR), successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3) was achieved 100% of the time in the GCE cases with an average of 2.13 passes per case. This rate was significantly higher compared with the Solitaire recanalization rate (7.7%, P<0.0001) with an average of three passes per case. After SR failure (in 92% of cases), successful one pass GCE rescue recanalization was achieved 66% of the time (P<0.005). CONCLUSION Application of the GCE in this experimental stroke model to retrieve typically recalcitrant fibrin rich clots resulted in higher successful recanalization rates than the SR.","Fennell, Vernard S; Setlur Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan; Meess, Karen M; Gutierrez, Liza; James, Rhys H; Springer, Michael E; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352061/,139
110356,Acute carotid stenting for treatment of stuttering transient ischemic attacks after recent carotid endarterectomy.,2014,"INTRODUCTION The adequate way of mesh fixation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is still subject to debate. So far, simulation has only been carried out in a static way, thereby omitting dynamic effects of coughing or vomiting. We developed a dynamic model of the anterior abdominal wall. MATERIALS AND METHODS An aluminium cylinder was equipped with a pressure controlled, fluid-filled plastic bag, simulating the abdominal viscera. A computer-controlled system allowed the control of influx and efflux, thus creating pressure peaks of up to 200 mmHg to simulate coughing and 290 mmHg to simulate vomiting. We tested fixation with tacks (Absorbatack, Covidien Deutschland, Neustadt a. D., Germany). The model was controlled for the friction coefficient of the tissue against the mesh and the physiologic elasticity of the abdominal wall surrogate. RESULTS The model was able to create pressure peaks equivalent to physiologic coughs or vomiting. Physiologic elasticity was thereby maintained. We could show that the friction coefficient is crucial to achieve a physiologic situation. The meshes showed a tendency to dislocate with an increasing number of coughs (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, when applied in a plain manner, the meshes withstood more cough cycles than when applied with a bulge as in laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS The dynamic movement of the abdominal wall, the friction between tissue and mesh and the way of mesh application are crucial factors that have to be controlled for in simulation of ventral abdominal hernia closure. We could demonstrate that patient specific factors such as the frequency of coughing as well as the application technique influence the long term stability of the mesh.","Siassi, M; Mahn, A; Baumann, E; Vollmer, M; Huber, G; Morlock, M; Kallinowski, F",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-014-1239-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139068/,139
110694,A Prospective One-Year Microbiologic Survey of Combined Pneumonia and Respiratory Failure.,2017,"Paranasal sinuses (PNS) infections are common in children. They may cause common and well-known complications, but also, unusual and potentially devastating complications. Diagnosing PNS infections and complications in children requires knowledge of the unique anatomy of the nasal cavity and the PNS. In fetal life, nasal mucosa evaginations into the lateral nasal walls initiate the development of the PNS. The PNS continue to develop after birth and complete their maturation and pneumatization at different ages during childhood which makes the pattern of PNS infections determined by patient age. Complications are caused by direct spread of the infection to the orbit, face, intracranial or osseous structures or hematogenous spread of the infection to the intracranial structures. Emergent imaging studies are often necessary in the evaluation of the complications in pediatric patients when the symptoms persist for 10 days and/or if there is evidence of intracranial or orbital complications. In addition, immunocompromised children are especially vulnerable to developing unusual complications. Computed tomography (CT) is excellent for determining whether there is intraorbital extension of PNS disease. However, when the infection approaches the orbital apex, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with contrast is necessary to assess spread into the cavernous sinus and the intracranial compartment. The goal of this manuscript is to review and characterize imaging findings of PNS infections using CT and MRI allowing determination of the extent of PNS infections and their common and unusual complications in children. In addition, a summary of the development of the normal PNS is provided.","Orman, Gunes; Kralik, Stephen F; Desai, Nilesh; Meoded, Avner; Vallejo, Jesus G; Huisman, Thierry A G M; Tran, Brandon H",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472739/,139

The objective of this study was to identify and validate a predictor for post-RFA stenosis. METHODS We consecutively enrolled patients with flat-type 'large' (length no less than 3 cm extending no less than half the circumference of the esophagus), early ESCNs, treated with balloon-based RFA (12 J/cm(2)-clean-12 J/cm(2) regimen). The tumor and technical factors for postoperative stricture were investigated and we validated the results externally with a society-based multicenter cohort using the same ablation regimen. RESULTS A total of 51 patients were enrolled (30 in the development set and 21 in the validation set). The complete remission rate at 12 months was 93%, and the rates of perforation and postoperative stenosis were 0% and 17%, respectively. Patients with post-RFA stenosis had a significantly larger longitudinal tumor size (mean 115 versus 61 mm, p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, tumor circumferential extension, pretreatment histological grade, treatment efficacy or size of balloon catheter between the groups with or without stenosis. The optimal cut-off value was set as 9 cm to predict post-RFA stenosis by receiver operating characteristic curve [area under curve (AUC) = 0.881], which was then confirmed to be a reliable predictor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 12.7, 95% confidence interval, 1.18-136.28, p = 0.03) and have a good predictive performance in the validation set (AUC = 0.876). CONCLUSIONS The most frequent adverse event of RFA was esophageal stenosis, for which the longitudinal tumor size was a significant predictive factor.

111030,"The effect of COVID-19 on liver transplantation: impact, practice patterns, therapeutics, and next steps.",2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Antipsychotic medications are frequently prescribed to people with dementia to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. Using a global federated research network, the objectives were to determine: 1) if COVID-19 is associated with 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality for people with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications; and 2) if the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX, a global federated health research network. The network was searched for people aged ≥65 years with dementia, COVID-19 and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days prior to COVID-19 recorded in electronic medical records between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020. These individuals were compared to historical controls from 2019 with dementia and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days before a visit to a participating healthcare organisation. Propensity score matching for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was used to balance cohorts with and without COVID-19. RESULTS Within the TriNetX network, 8,414 individuals with COVID-19, dementia and use of antipsychotics and 32,693 historical controls were identified. After propensity score matching there were 8,396 individuals with COVID-19 and 8,396 historical controls. The cohorts were well balanced for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants. The odds of 30-day thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality were significantly higher in adults with COVID-19 (Odds Ratios: 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.52) and 1.93 (1.71-2.17), respectively). The number of people with dementia with a visit to a participating healthcare organisation was lower between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020 (n=165,447) compared to the same period in 2019 (n=217,391), but the proportion receiving antipsychotics increased from 14.7% (95%CI: 14.6%-14.9%) to 16.4% (95%CI: 16.2%-16.5%), P<.0001. CONCLUSIONS These findings add to the evidence base that during the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics. The negative effects of antipsychotics in patients with dementia may be compounded by concomitant COVID-19.","Harrison, Stephanie L; Buckley, Benjamin J R; Lane, Deirdre A; Underhill, Paula; Lip, Gregory Y H",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677103/,139

An amphiphilic linear triblock terpolymer of ethylene oxide, N-acryloxysuccinimide, and styrene, PEO(45)-b-PNAS(105)-b-PS(45), which lacks significant incompatibility for the hydrophobic block segments and undergoes gradual hydrolysis of the NAS units, underwent supramolecular assembly in mixtures of organic solvent and water to afford multicompartment micelles (MCMs) with a narrow size distribution. The assembly process was followed over time and found to evolve from individual polymer nanodroplets containing internally phase segregated domains, of increasing definition, and ultimately to dissociate into discrete micelles. Upon covalent cross-linking of the MCMs with pH-insensitive pyrazine-based diamino cross-linkers, pH-responsive, photonic multicompartment nanostructures (MCNs) were produced. These MCNs exhibited significant enhancement of overall structural stability, in comparison with the MCMs, and internal structural tunability through the cross-linking chemistry. Meanwhile, the complex compartmentalized morphology exerted unique pH-responsive fluorescence dual-emission properties, indicating promise in ratiometric pH-sensing applications.","Sun, Guorong; Cui, Honggang; Lin, Lily Yun; Lee, Nam S; Yang, Chao; Neumann, William L; Freskos, John N; Shieh, Jeng J; Dorshow, Richard B; Wooley, Karen L",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/ja200182t; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21574617/,139

Of note, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) induced by OXA has become a key concern for patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy with OXA in recent years. Splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function, and portal hypertension are some of the main clinical characteristics seen in patients with OXA-induced HSOS. Previous studies have suggested that oxidative stress, inflammatory damage, liver fibrosis, and platelet aggregation and adhesion may be involved in the pathogenesis of OXA induced HSOS. Currently, there are no specific drugs for prevention and treatment of OXA-induced HSOS.

111849,Carotid artery stenting outcomes: do they correlate with antiplatelet response assays?,2014,"Italy and Belgium have been among the first western countries to face the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, imposing a total lockdown over the entire national territories. These limitations have proven effective in slowing down the spread of the infection. However, the benefits obtained in public health have come with huge costs in terms of social, economic, and psychological well-being. In the current study, we aimed to investigate how the period of home confinement affected self-reported sleep characteristics in Italians and Belgians, with special regard to sleep timing and subjective quality. Using an online survey we collected data from 2272 participants, 1622 Italians (Mage = 34.1 ± 13.6 years, 1171 F), and 650 Belgian (Mage = 43.0 ± 16.8 years, 509 F). Participants reported their sleep pattern (eg, bedtime, risetime) and perceived sleep quality during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. During the lockdown, sleep timing was significantly delayed, time spent in bed increased, and sleep quality was markedly impaired in both Italians and Belgians. The most vulnerable individuals appeared to be women, subjects experiencing a more negative mood, and those perceiving the pandemic situation as highly stressful. However, the two samples differed in the subgroups most affected by the changes, possibly because of the different welfare systems of the two countries. In fact, in the Italian sample sleep quality and timing underwent significant modifications especially in unemployed participants, whereas in the Belgian sample this category was the one who suffered less from the restrictions. Considering that the novel coronavirus has spread across the whole globe, involving countries with different types of health and welfare systems, understanding which policy measures have the most effective protective role on physical and mental health is of primary importance.","Cellini, Nicola; Conte, Francesca; De Rosa, Oreste; Giganti, Fiorenza; Malloggi, Serena; Reyt, Mathilde; Guillemin, Camille; Schmidt, Christina; Muto, Vincenzo; Ficca, Gianluca",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348298/,139

112079,Viral respiratory infections: a cause of community-acquired pneumonia or a predisposing factor?,2020-02-13,"BACKGROUND Chronic diseases contribute to about half of the adult disease burden in the South Asian region. Meanwhile, physical activity levels are declining despite the global evidence of its role in the prevention of chronic diseases. While there are a plethora of systematic reviews on the effects of physical activity on chronic diseases, there has not yet been a synthesis of the evidence concerning the nature of this relationship among people living in South Asian countries incorporating multiple chronic diseases and a focus on physical activity domains. The aim of this protocol is to describe the rationale and methods for a systematic review of published research to identify the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases and their markers and analysis of the strength of association with a focus on physical activity domains among South Asian adults 40 years and older. METHODS Nine electronic databases including Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus, AgeLine, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Web of Science will be systematically searched for papers reporting the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, vascular diseases and musculoskeletal diseases (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, back and neck pain)) and their markers using predefined search terms. Searches will be limited to peer-reviewed, English language papers with a quantitative design. In addition, a manual search of references of relevant systematic reviews as well as citations and references of eligible studies will also be carried out. The methodological appraisal will be performed using the National Institutes of Health quality assessment checklist for observational studies and the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool for intervention studies. The overall quality of evidence for the study outcomes across the study designs will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, and a random effects meta-analysis is planned depending on the nature of included studies and available data. DISCUSSION This review will summarise the strength of the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases and their markers among South Asian adults 40 years or older. The findings will provide an evidence base to guide public health policy and interventions in the South Asian region and to inform future research to address the rising burden of chronic diseases.

113576,"Reply to: ""Digging mediastinal holes in vigor: a word of caution"".",2021-06-17,"AIM With the emergence of a new virus and the associated pandemic, the ICU started to see a brand new kind of patient with severe ARD. As with any disease, sometimes the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation for any reason can be difficult. As a center specializing in weaning patients after prolonged mechanical ventilation, we wanted to compare our results with weaning patients who had prolonged mechanical ventilation for other reasons than those of patients who had prolonged mechanical ventilation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS We obtained our data from WeanNet register, the weaning register of the German Institute for Lung Research (ILF). In our analysis, we included only patient data from January until July 2020, which was recorded in our in-house study files. RESULTS Our analysis included data on 28 patients; 11 were treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 17 had no SARS-CoV-2 infection. 81.2 % of SARS-CoV-2 patients were successfully weaned from invasive ventilator therapy compared to 76.4 % of patients without SARS-CoV-2. Mortality in the SARS-CoV-2 group was 18.2 % compared to 11.8 % in the other group. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were predominantly males with preexisting cardiovascular disease or a history of nicotine abuse. ARDS was the most common cause of respiratory failure which led to primary intubation. CONCLUSION Even though we were only able to analyze a small number of patient histories due to the novelty of the disease, we were able to show that patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation after SARS-CoV-2 infection can be equally successfully weaned compared to patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation due to other diseases. Risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation after a severe case of SARS-CoV-2 infection seemed to be male gender, nicotine abuse and cardiovascular disease.","Schäfer, H; Michels, I C; Bucher, B; Dock-Rust, D; Hellstern, A",Pneumologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1384-8934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33873221/,139

However, concerns have been raised with regard to its use because it can increase respiratory resistance and dead space. Therefore, this study assessed the safety of N95 use in patients with COPD and air-flow limitation. METHODS This prospective study was performed at a tertiary hospital and enrolled 97 subjects with COPD. The subjects were monitored for symptoms and physiologic variables during a 10-min rest period and 6-min walking test while wearing an N95. RESULTS Of the 97 subjects, 7 with COPD did not wear the N95 for the entire test duration. This mask-failure group showed higher British modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale scores and lower FEV1 percent of predicted values than did the successful mask use group. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score ≥ 3 (odds ratio 167, 95% CI 8.4 to >999.9; P = .008) or a FEV1 < 30% predicted (odds ratio 163, 95% CI 7.4 to >999.9; P = .001) was associated with a risk of failure to wear the N95. Breathing frequency, blood oxygen saturation, and exhaled carbon dioxide levels also showed significant differences before and after N95 use. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that subjects with COPD who had modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale scores ≥ 3 or FEV1 < 30% predicted wear N95s only with care.","Kyung, Sun Young; Kim, Yujin; Hwang, Hyunjoong; Park, Jeong-Woong; Jeong, Sung Hwan",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.06713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31992666/,139

However, there are few reports on the viral load in stools. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the stools of 13 patients with confirmed COVID-19 using as control the pepper mild mottle virus, which was proposed as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination of environmental water. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples from four patients (31%), among whom three presented diarrhea symptoms. One patient experiencing long-term diarrhea (22 days) had high levels of viral RNA in the stools (8.28 log10 copies/g). However, we could not isolate the SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of any patients, using VeroE6/TMPRESS2 cells for four weeks.

METHODS In all, 355 consecutive vein mappings were retrospectively analyzed. A generalized estimating equations approach to linear logistic regression was used to evaluate the variables. RESULTS Among the 312 vein ablation of the GSV, 10 (3.2%) developed EHIT.

114291,Solving the Issue of Restenosis After Stenting of Intracranial Stenoses: Experience with Two Thin-Strut Drug-Eluting Stents (DES)-Taxus Element™ and Resolute Integrity™.,2015,"Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.","Plowright, Raina K; Eby, Peggy; Hudson, Peter J; Smith, Ina L; Westcott, David; Bryden, Wayne L; Middleton, Deborah; Reid, Peter A; McFarlane, Rosemary A; Martin, Gerardo; Tabor, Gary M; Skerratt, Lee F; Anderson, Dale L; Crameri, Gary; Quammen, David; Jordan, David; Freeman, Paul; Wang, Lin-Fa; Epstein, Jonathan H; Marsh, Glenn A; Kung, Nina Y; McCallum, Hamish",Proceedings.

In addition, prenatal environment is known to alter cardiovascular health; however, limited information is available regarding the cerebrovascular consequences of prenatal stress exposure. Vascular disturbances late in life may lead to cerebral hypoperfusion which is linked to a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. The known impact of cerebrovascular compromise on neuronal function and behavior highlights the importance of characterizing the impact of stress on not just neurons and glia, but also cerebrovasculature. Von Willebrand factor has previously been shown to be impacted by prenatal stress and is predictive of cerebrovascular health. Here we assess the impact of prenatal stress on von Willebrand factor and related angiogenic factors. Furthermore, we assess the potential protective effects of concurrent anti-depressant treatment during in utero stress exposure on the assessed cerebrovascular endpoints. Prenatal stress augmented expression of von Willebrand factor which was prevented by concurrent in utero escitalopram treatment. The functional implications of this increase in von Willebrand factor remain elusive, but the presented data demonstrate that although prenatal stress did not independently impact total vascularization, exposure to chronic stress in adulthood decreased blood vessel length. In addition, the current study demonstrates that production of reactive oxygen species in the hippocampus is decreased by prenatal exposure to escitalopram. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the prenatal experience can cause complex changes in adult cerebral vascular structure and function.","Neigh, Gretchen N; Nemeth, Christina L; Kelly, Sean D; Hardy, Emily E; Bourke, Chase; Stowe, Zachary N; Owens, Michael J",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422674/,139

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data of patients with solitary kidney who underwent laparoscopic (n = 52) and robot-assisted (n = 15) partial nephrectomy for renal tumor at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, between June 2000 and April 2012. Patient demographic data, perioperative parameters and follow-up data were compared. RESULTS The two groups were similar in terms of patients and tumor characteristics, including preoperative renal function and etiology of solitary kidney. The median operative time (225 vs 171 min, P = 0.02), warm ischemia time (19 vs 15 min, P = 0.04) and hospital stay (4 vs 3 days, P = 0.03) were significantly shorter in the robotic group. No significant differences were found in terms of estimated blood loss, transfusion, complications, pathological results and margin status. The median percentage change of renal function was not significantly different between two groups. Long-term hemodialysis was required for three patients in the laparoscopic group (6%) and none of the patients in the robotic group. Median follow up was 15.6 and 5.9 months in the laparoscopic and robotic group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy represents a safe and effective minimally-invasive treatment option for renal masses in patients with a solitary kidney. Early comparative outcomes suggest that it offers a significant benefit over the laparoscopic approach in terms of operative time, warm ischemia time and hospital stay. Further studies with a longer follow up are required to confirm the likelihood of better long-term functional and oncological outcomes.","Panumatrassamee, Kamol; Autorino, Riccardo; Laydner, Humberto; Hillyer, Shahab; Khalifeh, Ali; Kassab, Ahmad; Stein, Robert J; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Kaouk, Jihad H",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-2042.2012.03205.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126452/,139

115695,Endovascular treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"Although highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have yet to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently among humans, the increasing genetic diversity among these viruses and continued outbreaks in avian species underscore the need for more effective measures for the control and prevention of human H5N1 virus infection. Additional small animal models with which therapeutic approaches against virulent influenza viruses can be evaluated are needed. In this study, we used the guinea pig model to evaluate the relative virulence of selected avian and human influenza A viruses. We demonstrate that guinea pigs can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses, resulting in high titers of virus shedding in nasal washes for up to 5 days postinoculation (p.i.) and in lung tissue of inoculated animals. However, other physiologic indicators typically associated with virulent influenza virus strains were absent in this species. We evaluated the ability of intranasal treatment with human alpha interferon (alpha-IFN) to reduce lung and nasal wash titers in guinea pigs challenged with the reconstructed 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus or a contemporary H5N1 virus. IFN treatment initiated 1 day prior to challenge significantly reduced or prevented infection of guinea pigs by both viruses, as measured by virus titer determination and seroconversion. The expression of the antiviral Mx protein in lung tissue correlated with the reduction of virus titers. We propose that the guinea pig may serve as a useful small animal model for testing the efficacy of antiviral compounds and that alpha-IFN treatment may be a useful antiviral strategy against highly virulent strains with pandemic potential.","Van Hoeven, Neal; Belser, Jessica A; Szretter, Kristy J; Zeng, Hui; Staeheli, Peter; Swayne, David E; Katz, Jacqueline M; Tumpey, Terrence M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02174-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144714/,139

In particular, the usual task of outpatient care has shifted to the telemedicine format, bringing along all of its attendant advantages and gargantuan challenges. The authors sought to determine the responsiveness of this telemedicine setup to the needs of their disadvantaged patients and explored the application of Bayesian inference to enhance the use of teleconsultation in daily clinical decision-making. METHODS The authors used the following methods to assess the telemedicine setup used in a low-resource setting during the pandemic: 1) a cross-sectional survey of patients who participated in a medical consultation via telemedicine during the 16-week period from March 16, 2020, to July 15, 2020; 2) a cost-benefit analysis of the use of telemedicine by patients; and 3) a case illustration of a Bayesian approach application unique to the teleconsultation scenario. RESULTS Of the 272 patient beneficiaries of telemedicine in a 16-week period, 57 responded to the survey. The survey responses regarding neurosurgical outpatient care through telemedicine yielded high ratings of utility for the patients and their caregivers. According to 64% of respondents, the affordability of the telemedicine setup also prevented them from borrowing money from others, among other adverse life events prevented. There were realized financial gains on the part of the patients in terms of cost savings and protection from further impoverishment. The benefit-cost ratio was 3.51 for the patients, signifying that the benefits outweighed the costs. An actual teleconsultation case vignette was reported that is meant to be instructive and contributory to the preparedness of the neurosurgeon on the provider end of the service delivery. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine holds promise as a viable and safe method for health service delivery during the pandemic. In the setting of a health system that is continually challenged by shortages of resources, this study shows that an effective telemedicine setup can come with high benefit-cost ratios and quality of care, along with the assurance of patient satisfaction. The potential for high-quality care can be enhanced by the inclusion of the Bayesian framework to the basic toolkit of remote clinical assessment. When confronted with choices in terms of differential diagnosis and tests, the rigor of a simple application of the Bayesian framework can minimize costs arising from uncertainties.","Ferraris, Kevin Paul; Golidtum, Jared Paul; Zuñiga, Brian Karlo W; Bautista, Maria Cristina G; Alcazaren, Jose Carlos; Seng, Kenny; Navarro, Joseph Erroll",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260122/,139

In order to meet this challenge, we must translate lessons learnt from assessing and training athletes to the clinical population, utilizing measurable and targeted parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RECENT FINDINGS Critical illness survivors demonstrate a persistent reduction in their physical and metabolic function. This manifests in reduced aerobic exercise capacity and metabolic inflexibility. CPET-guided targeted metabolic conditioning has proved beneficial in several clinical populations, including those undergoing high-risk surgery, and could be successfully applied to the rehabilitation of ICU survivors. SUMMARY CPET shows great promise in the guidance of rehabilitation in functionally limited ICU survivors. Parallels in the physiological response to exercise in athletes and clinical populations with the stress and consequences of critical illness must be investigated and ultimately applied to the burgeoning population of ICU survivors in order to treat the consequences of survival from critical illness.","Whittle, John; San-Millán, Iñigo",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973897/,139

This study examined change in mental health from before to during the pandemic among predominantly Hispanic/Latinx adolescents. METHOD 322 young adolescents (Mage = 11.99, 55% female), with a racial/ethnic composition of 72.7% Hispanic/Latinx, 9.3% Black or African American, 5.9% Multiple Races, 5.0% Asian, 1.6% White, and 1.2% American Indian, completed a mental health screening measure prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and at three points during the pandemic. A subsample also completed a survey about their experience at home during COVID-19. Repeated measures mixed ANCOVA was used to evaluate change in each mental health domain, and whether youth who had elevated symptoms at baseline differed in their level of change, controlling for age and gender. RESULTS For youth who had elevated levels of mental health problems pre-pandemic, symptoms were significantly reduced across domains during the pandemic. Reductions in internalizing, externalizing, and total problems were clinically significant. For other youth, there were statistically significant reductions in internalizing and total problems, and no change in attention or externalizing problems. Post-hoc analyses revealed that better family functioning was consistently related to lower mental health symptoms in youth during COVID-19 follow-ups. CONCLUSION COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations may offer protective effects for youth mental health. Study results may be specific to this population of predominantly Hispanic/Latinx youth from a large city in the southwestern US.","Penner, Francesca; Ortiz, Jessica Hernandez; Sharp, Carla",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359408/,139

A droplet easily rolls off the surface of the wings along the radial outward (RO) direction of the central axis of the body, but is pinned tightly against the RO direction. Interestingly, these two distinct states can be tuned by controlling the posture of the wings (downward or upward) and the direction of airflow across the surface (along or against the RO direction), respectively. Research indicated that these special abilities resulted from the direction-dependent arrangement of nano-tips on ridging nano-stripes and micro-scales overlapped on the wings at the level, where two distinct contact modes of a droplet with orientation-tuneable microstructures occur and thus produce different adhesive forces. We believe that this finding will help the design of smart, fluid-controllable interfaces that may be applied in novel microfluidic devices and directional, easy-cleaning coatings.","Zheng, Yongmei; Gao, Xuefeng; Jiang, Lei",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b612667g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680261/,139

116664,Infectious peritonitis profile in peritoneal dialysis at Ibn Sina University Hospital: a 6-year data report.,2014,"OBJECTIVE To determine: (i) whether the use of ankle-foot orthoses over a period of 26 weeks affects tibialis anterior muscle activity; (ii) whether the timing of provision of ankle-foot orthoses (early or delayed) affects the results; (iii) whether the provision of ankle-foot orthoses affects tibialis anterior muscle activity within a single measurement. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS Unilateral hemiparetic subjects, a maximum of 6 weeks post-stroke. METHODS Subjects were assigned randomly to early (at inclusion; week 1) or delayed provision of ankle-foot orthoses (8 weeks later; week 9). Tibialis anterior electromyography was measured with and without ankle-foot orthoses, in study weeks 1, 9, 17 and 26. RESULTS A total of 26 subjects were analysed. In a single measurement, use of an ankle-foot orthosis significantly reduced the activity levels of the tibialis anterior muscle during the swing phase (p = 0.041) compared with walking without an ankle-foot or-thosis. During the 26-week follow-up, no changes were found in tibialis anterior muscle activity in the swing phase without an ankle-foot orthosis, both within-groups (p = 0.420 early; p = 0.282 delayed), and between-groups (p = 0.987). After 26 weeks, no differences were found in tibialis anterior muscle activity between both groups in the swing phase, with (p = 0.207) or without ankle-foot orthoses (p = 0.310). CONCLUSION Use of ankle-foot orthoses post-stroke reduced tibialis anterior muscle activity in the swing phase within 1 measurement; however, long-term use of ankle-foot orthoses for 26 weeks did not affect such activity. Early or delayed provision of ankle-foot orthoses did not affect the findings. The results indicate that there is no need to fear negative consequences on tibialis anterior-activity because of long-term AFO-use (early) after stroke.","Nikamp, Corien; Buurke, Jaap; Schaake, Leendert; van der Palen, Job; Rietman, Johan; Hermens, Hermie",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30361740/,139

117182,Early diffusion-weighted imaging reversal after endovascular reperfusion is typically transient in patients imaged 3 to 6 hours after onset.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on baseline imaging is an established predictor of acute ischemic stroke outcomes. We analyzed change on serial ASPECTS at baseline and 24-hour imaging in the Solitaire Flow Restoration with the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) study to determine prognostic value and to identify subgroups with extensive injury after intervention. METHODS ASPECTS at baseline and 24 hours was independently scored in all anterior circulation SWIFT cases, blinded to all other trial data. ASPECTS at baseline, at 24 hours, and serial changes were analyzed with univariate and multivariate approaches. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 12] years; 52% women; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 18 [interquartile range, 8-28]) with complete data at both time points were studied. Multivariate analyses showed that higher 24-hour ASPECTS predicted good clinical outcome (day 90 modified Rankin Scale, 0-2; odds ratio, 1.67; P<0.001). Among patients with high baseline ASPECTS (8-10; n=109), dramatic infarct progression (decrease in ASPECTS ≥6 points at 24 hours) was noted in 31 of 109 (28%). Such serial ASPECTS change was predicted by higher baseline systolic blood pressure (P=0.019), higher baseline blood glucose (P=0.133), and failure to achieve Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b/3 reperfusion (P<0.001), culminating in worse day 90 modified Rankin Scale outcomes (mean modified Rankin Scale, 4.4 versus 2.7; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Twenty-four-hour ASPECTS provides better prognostic information compared with baseline ASPECTS. Predictors of dramatic infarct progression on ASPECTS are hyperglycemia, hypertension, and nonreperfusion. Serial ASPECTS change from baseline to 24 hours predicts clinical outcome, providing an early surrogate end point for thrombectomy trials.

Two novel bacteria, designated strains b09i-3(T) and b13i-1, were isolated during the process of fermentation of this tea. These isolates were Gram-positive, endospore-forming, motile rods that grew at 25-42 degrees C and pH 5.5-10.4. The DNA G+C content was 56.6-58.4 mol%, the predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acid was anteiso-C(15 : 0) (49.0-50 % of the total). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains b09i-3(T) and b13i-1 shared 99.9 % similarity and were affiliated with a cluster within the family Paenibacillaceae. Strains b09i-3(T) and b13i-1 were related most closely to Paenibacillus ginsengihumi DCY16(T) (97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity).

This article reports the imaging results of unruptured aneurysms treated electively with the Pipeline Embolization Device for up to 56 months and clinical results for up to 61 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred nineteen aneurysms in 98 patients from 3 centers admitted between August 2009 and June 2011 were followed at 6-month, 1-year, and 2+-year postprocedural timeframes. Analyses on the effects of incorporated vessels, previous stent placement, aneurysm size, and morphology on aneurysm occlusion were performed. RESULTS The 1- and 2+-year imaging follow-ups were performed, on average, 13 and 28 months postprocedure. At 2+-year follow-up, clinical data were 100% complete and imaging data were complete for 103/116 aneurysms (88.8%) with a 93.2% occlusion rate. From 0 to 6 months, TIA, minor stroke, and major stroke rates were 4.2%, 3.4%, and 0.8% respectively. After 6 months, 1 patient had a TIA of uncertain cause, with an overall Pipeline Embolization Device-related mortality rate of 0.8%. An incorporated vessel was significant for a delay in occlusion (P = .009) and nonocclusion at 6 months and 1 year, with a delayed mean time of occlusion from 9.1 months (95% CI, 7.1-11.1 months) to 16.7 months (95% CI, 11.4-22.0 months). Other factors were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Embolization Device demonstrates continued very high closure rates at 2+ years, with few delayed clinical adverse sequelae. The presence of an incorporated vessel in the wall of the aneurysm causes a delay in occlusion that approaches sidewall closure rates by 2 years.","Chiu, A H Y; Cheung, A K; Wenderoth, J D; De Villiers, L; Rice, H; Phatouros, C C; Singh, T P; Phillips, T J; McAuliffe, W",AJNR.

BACKGROUND The optimal technique for crossing coronary CTOs remains controversial. METHODS We retrospectively examined the incidence of PMI among 184 consecutive patients who underwent CTO PCI at our institution between 2012 and 2015. Creatine kinase-myocardial band fraction (CK-MB) and troponin were measured before and after PCI in all patients. PMI was defined as CK-MB increase ≥3× upper limit of normal (ULN). RESULTS Mean age was 65 ± 8 years, 98% of patients were men, 57% had diabetes mellitus, 36% were current smokers, 38% had prior heart failure, 31% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), and 55% had prior PCI. The retrograde approach was used in 38% of cases. As compared with antegrade wire escalation and antegrade dissection/re-entry, use of the retrograde approach was associated with higher J-CTO (Multicenter CTO Registry of Japan) scores (P < 0.0001), higher frequency of moderate or severe calcification (P = 0.0061), longer CTO length (P < 0.0001), more frequent proximal cap ambiguity (P < 0.0001), and lower technical (P = 0.0007) and procedural (P = 0.0014) success. The frequency of PMI for the antegrade-only and retrograde cases was 10% and 33%, respectively (P = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, use of the retrograde approach and moderate/severe calcification were independently associated with higher incidence of PMI. CONCLUSIONS As compared with antegrade-only crossing techniques, the retrograde approach is used in patients with more complex anatomy but may carry higher risk for PMI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Stetler, Jeffrey; Karatasakis, Aris; Christakopoulos, Georgios E; Tarar, Muhammad Nauman J; Amsavelu, Suwetha; Patel, Krishna; Rangan, Bavana V; Roesle, Michele; Resendes, Erica; Grodin, Jerrold; Abdullah, Shuaib; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014962/,139

SUMMARY ANSWER It was possible to produce an international consensus statement on the current management of endometriosis through engagement of representatives of national and international, medical and non-medical societies with an interest in endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Management of endometriosis anywhere in the world has been based partially on evidence-based practices and partially on unsubstantiated therapies and approaches. Several guidelines have been developed by a number of national and international bodies, yet areas of controversy and uncertainty remain, not least due to a paucity of firm evidence. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A consensus meeting, in conjunction with a pre- and post-meeting process, was undertaken. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS A consensus meeting was held on 8 September 2011, in conjunction with the 11th World Congress on Endometriosis in Montpellier, France. A rigorous pre- and post-meeting process, involving 56 representatives of 34 national and international, medical and non-medical organizations from a range of disciplines, led to this consensus statement. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A total of 69 consensus statements were developed. Seven statements had unanimous consensus; however, none of the statements were made without expression of a caveat about the strength of the statement or the statement itself. Only two statements failed to achieve majority consensus. The statements covered global considerations, the role of endometriosis organizations, support groups, centres or networks of expertise, the impact of endometriosis throughout a woman's life course, and a full range of treatment options for pain, infertility and other symptoms related to endometriosis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This consensus process differed from that of formal guideline development. A different group of international experts from those participating in this process would likely have yielded subtly different consensus statements. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This is the first time that a large, global, consortium, representing 34 major stake-holding organizations from five continents, has convened to systematically evaluate the best available current evidence on the management of endometriosis, and to reach consensus. In addition to 18 international medical organizations, representatives from 16 national endometriosis organizations were involved, including lay support groups, thus generating input from women who suffer from endometriosis.","Johnson, Neil P; Hummelshoj, Lone",Human reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/det050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528916/,139
118372,Endovascular treatment of debilitating tinnitus secondary to cerebral venous sinus abnormalities: a literature review and technical illustration.,2019,"Pair approximation models have been used to study the spread of infectious diseases in spatially distributed host populations, and to explore disease control strategies such as vaccination and case isolation. Here we introduce a pair approximation model of individual uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for an acute self-limiting infection, where susceptible individuals can learn the NPIs either from other susceptible individuals who are already practicing NPIs (""social learning""), or their uptake of NPIs can be stimulated by being neighbours of an infectious person (""exposure learning""). NPIs include individual measures such as hand-washing and respiratory etiquette. Individuals can also drop the habit of using NPIs at a certain rate. We derive a spatially defined expression of the basic reproduction number R0 and we also numerically simulate the model equations. We find that exposure learning is generally more efficient than social learning, since exposure learning generates NPI uptake in the individuals at immediate risk of infection. However, if social learning is pre-emptive, beginning a sufficient amount of time before the epidemic, then it can be more effective than exposure learning. Interestingly, varying the initial number of individuals practicing NPIs does not significantly impact the epidemic final size. Also, if initial source infections are surrounded by protective individuals, there are parameter regimes where increasing the initial number of source infections actually decreases the infection peak (instead of increasing it) and makes it occur sooner. The peak prevalence increases with the rate at which individuals drop the habit of using NPIs, but the response of peak prevalence to changes in the forgetting rate are qualitatively different for the two forms of learning. The pair approximation methodology developed here illustrates how analytical approaches for studying interactions between social processes and disease dynamics in a spatially structured population should be further pursued.","Ringa, Notice; Bauch, Chris T",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2018021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161845/,139

In the current study, we examined whether tasks requiring overlapping processing resources may impair the ability to selectively encode information in dual-task conditions. Participants in the divided-attention conditions of Experiment 1 completed auditory tone-distractor tasks that required them to discriminate between tones of different pitches (audio-nonspatial) or auditory channels (audio-spatial), while studying items in different locations in a grid (visual-spatial) differing in reward value. Results indicated that, while reducing overall memory accuracy, neither cross-modal auditory distractor task influenced participants' ability to selectively encode high-value items relative to a full attention condition, suggesting maintained cognitive control. Participants in Experiment 2 studied the same important visual-spatial information while completing demanding color (visual-nonspatial) or pattern (visual-spatial) discrimination tasks during study. While the cross-modal visual-nonspatial task did not influence memory selectivity, the intra-modal visual-spatial secondary task eliminated participants' sensitivity to item value. These results add novel evidence of conditions of impaired cognitive control, suggesting that the effectiveness of top-down, selective encoding processes is attenuated when concurrent tasks rely on overlapping processing resources.","Siegel, Alexander L M; Schwartz, Shawn T; Castel, Alan D",Memory & cognition,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-021-01166-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763815/,139
118684,Guest editorial: endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke: what's next?,2015,"Echinococcosis is endemic in pastoral regions of south, west and mid-Gansu province, China. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of echinococcosis in east Gansu, and analyze its associated risk factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 in 12 villages of Xiaonangou township, Huan County in east Gansu province by ultrasound abdominal scan and auxiliary serotest, and a prevalence surveillance study from 2008 to 2014 was performed in one villages by ultrasonography screening. Questionnaire information analysis indicates that the risk factors are in association with the gender, age, and education level. The cross-sectional survey found a cystic echinococcosis prevalence of 2.21% (107/4837). Higher prevalence was seen in females (χ2 = 4.198, P < 0.05), older ages (> 60 years) (χ2trend = 96.30, P < 0.05), and illiterates (χ2 = 90.101, P < 0.05).

118866,Bridging Therapy Versus Direct Mechanical Thrombectomy in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke due to Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion: A Clinical-Histological Analysis of Retrieved Thrombi.,2019,"AIM Obesity is associated with increased technical difficulty in laparoscopic surgery. However, its impact has been measured mainly for colectomy but not specifically for rectal excision. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on technical feasibility and oncological outcome of laparoscopic rectal excision for cancer. METHOD A total of 490 patients treated by laparoscopic rectal excision for rectal cancer from January 1999 to June 2010 were included. Seventy per cent had had preoperative radiochemotherapy. Patients were separated into four groups according to BMI (kg/m(2) ): < 20, 20-25, 25-30 and ≥ 30. The impact of BMI on conversion, surgical morbidity, quality of excision (Quirke mesorectal grade and circumferential resection margin) and long-term oncological outcome was determined. RESULTS Among the 490 patients BMI was < 20 in 43, 20-25 in 223, 25-30 in 177 and ≥ 30 in 47. Mortality (overall 1%) and morbidity (overall 19%) were similar between the groups. Conversion in the four groups was 5%, 14%, 23% and 32% (P = 0.001). The quality of mesorectal excision and circumferential margins did not differ between the groups. The 5-year local recurrence rates (0%, 4.6%, 5.3% and 5.9% respectively; P = 0.823) and the overall and disease-free survival were not significantly influenced by BMI. CONCLUSION In laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, BMI influenced the risk of conversion but not surgical morbidity, quality of surgery and survival. This suggests that all patients, including obese patients, are suitable for laparoscopic surgery.","Denost, Q; Quintane, L; Buscail, E; Martenot, M; Laurent, C; Rullier, E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23534683/,139
118872,Balloon Guide Catheter in Complex Anterior Circulation Mechanical Thrombectomy: Beyond Proximal Occlusion and Flow Reversal.,2016,"INTRODUCTION A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, previous trials have provided mixed results regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AIS. A meta-analysis of all available trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS A literature search was performed to identify all prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management for AIS. Two datasets were created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the contemporary standard of practice at the majority of centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless of qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A fixed-effect model was used to determine significance. RESULTS Five prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management were included in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six were included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1). This benefit persisted when patients from all six RCTs were included, even in the absence of confirmation of LVO (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54, p=0.019; dataset 2). CONCLUSIONS A meta-analysis of prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management demonstrates superior outcomes in patients randomized to endovascular therapy.","Fargen, Kyle M; Neal, Dan; Fiorella, David J; Turk, Aquilla S; Froehler, Michael; Mocco, J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432979/,139
118892,Treatment of posterior circulation non-saccular aneurysms with flow diverters: a single-center experience and review of 56 patients.,2017,"The Birkenhead drill states that in the time of crisis, the correct action is to prioritise the weakest and most vulnerable, in that example, women and children. Ethically this has been well analysed in terms of the intrinsic value of the human versus any utilitarian calculus of worth to society's function. We do not attempt to re-analyse this but do note that standard pandemic planning often disadvantages the weak and vulnerable in terms of allocation of resources to those with a greater chance of functional survival. We more argue from a debt that society owes its children in terms of the sacrifices they have made in terms of school, social life, healthcare and overall welfare during the pandemic from which they were at markedly less risk than adults. Society owes a debt to its young, and this on top of pre-existing commitments to the them that most nations fail to realise, calls for prioritisation of children and young people's issues as society rebuilds. The effects of poverty and systemic racism on many children must be tackled; so too the existential threats of climate change and pollution. COVID-19 provides a once in a generation opportunity to create a kinder, fairer society. Early signs are not good: Pub re-opening prioritised over school re-opening; no significant investment in children's services or women's health, a significant determinant of children's welfare. We highlight the way COVID-19 has, and continues, to harm children and argue that the contemporary erosion of the Birkenhead principle is simply amoral.","Brierley, Joe; Larcher, Vic",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070115/,139
118905,Coronavirus 2019: clinical and neuropathological aspects.,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND Baseline rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activity is a well-replicated nonspecific predictor of depression improvement. The rACC is a key hub of the default mode network, which prior studies indicate is hyperactive in major depressive disorder. Because default mode network downregulation is reliant on input from the salience network and frontoparietal network, an important question is whether rACC connectivity with these systems contributes to depression improvement. METHODS Our study evaluated this hypothesis in outpatients (N = 238; 151 female) enrolled in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) 8-week randomized clinical trial of sertraline versus placebo for major depressive disorder. Depression severity was measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and electroencephalography was recorded at baseline and week 1. Exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography was used to compute activity from the rACC, and key regions within the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex), frontoparietal network (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and salience network (right anterior insula [rAI]). Connectivity in the theta band (4.5-7 Hz) and beta band (12.5-21 Hz) was computed using lagged phase synchronization. RESULTS Stronger baseline theta-band rACC-rAI (salience network hub) connectivity predicted greater depression improvement across 8 weeks of treatment for both treatment arms (B = -0.57, 95% confidence interval = -1.07, -0.08, p = .03). Early increases in theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity predicted greater likelihood of achieving remission at week 8 (odds ratio = 2.90, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing treatment, theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity is a prognostic, albeit treatment-nonspecific, indicator of depression improvement, and early connectivity changes may predict clinically meaningful outcomes.","Whitton, Alexis E; Webb, Christian A; Dillon, Daniel G; Kayser, Jürgen; Rutherford, Ashleigh; Goer, Franziska; Fava, Maurizio; McGrath, Patrick; Weissman, Myrna; Parsey, Ramin; Adams, Phil; Trombello, Joseph M; Cooper, Crystal; Deldin, Patricia; Oquendo, Maria A; McInnis, Melvin G; Carmody, Thomas; Bruder, Gerard; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Pizzagalli, Diego A",Biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718038/,139
119166,"Pattern, predictors and clustering of handwashing practices in India.",2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) is a safe and effective approach to adrenalectomy, offering less pain and faster recovery than open or laparoscopic surgery. Although the popularity of PRA is increasing, few surgical centres have extensive experience with the procedure. The ideal approach to achieve proficiency with any new technique involves on-site observation of an experienced surgeon-mentor, followed by mentored hands-on experience of the surgeon-learner. However, it is not always feasible for a surgeon-mentor to offer on-site supervision to the surgeon-learner in his or her home institution. Advances in Internet applications have made remote telementoring a viable alternative to on-site mentoring in selected situations. METHODS We describe our experience in safely introducing PRA to Melbourne, Australia, where no highly experienced surgeon-mentors were available. A surgeon with experience of 12 PRA procedures attended from interstate, along with live telementoring via Skype video link by an overseas surgeon who had performed more than 200 PRA procedures, to mentor the surgeon-learner performing her first three cases. RESULTS The operating surgeon's first three PRA procedures proceeded uneventfully, with no complications, relatively short operative times and one-night hospital stays for all three patients. Twenty-two more have been performed since, without complications. CONCLUSION Remote telementoring is a safe and feasible way to assist surgeons in safely introducing new techniques. This strategy is particularly applicable in centres where no surgeon-mentor is locally available. It is important that the surgeon-learner has the skills and experience to complete the procedure using alternative techniques in the case of complications or technical failure.","Miller, Julie A; Kwon, David S; Dkeidek, Amira; Yew, Ming; Hisham Abdullah, An; Walz, Martin K; Perrier, Nancy D",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06188.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013552/,139

After analyzing the band structure of the ladders exposed to the bichromatic optical potentials, we report the existence of quantum spin Hall phase. We further identify a rich phase diagram of the bichromatic chiral ladders, illustrating that our proposal features a large space of system parameters exhibiting quantum phase transitions. Our scheme is within reach of the existing ladder optical lattices and hence provides a new method to engineer the elaborate topological bands for cold atomic gases.","Yu, Hang; Guo Guan, En; Wang, Gang; Hua Jiang, Jian; Hu, Jun; Hui Wu, Jin; Kuang Lee, Ray",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.395756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680154/,139

The most common histologic types of RPS are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Retroperitoneal sarcoma is classified based on the amount of lipid inside the cells, the mucoid lipid and the degree of cell differentiation. It is classified into the well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated types and the commonest is the pleomorphic type. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are defined by the presence of sharply demarcated regions of non-lipogenic sarcomatous tissue within a well-differentiated tumor. This type has a vague prognosis compared to other types of sarcoma and making the histological diagnosis can be difficult. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma commonly develops in the retroperitoneum, limbs, testis, and spermatic cord. Retro peritoneal sarcoma typically produces few symptoms until they are large enough to compress or invade surrounding structures. Most tumors are already large and locally advanced at the time they are first detected. Here, we reported a case that came to medical attention as an incidentally discovered large abdominal mass in an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, later the mass was successfully removed and free from symptoms.","Nadukkandiyil, Navas; Valappil, Sameer; Ramadan, Marwan; Al Sulaiti, Essa; Alhamad, Hanadi Khamis",The aging male : the official journal of the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male,https://doi.org/10.1080/13685538.2020.1813704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912016/,139

120465,Therapeutic targets in childhood B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia: what about HER2/neu?,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND It is reported that several systemic immunoinflammatory measures, including systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR), are associated with survival in patients with various types of cancer. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to clear which systemic immunoinflammatory measures had the greatest prognostic values. In addition, we examined which component had the greatest prognostic power in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS Preoperative systemic immunoinflammatory measures were evaluated in 143 patients undergoing esophageal resection for esophageal cancer from 2009 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of these markers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the area under the ROC curves (AUROCs) were compared to verify the accuracy of each measure in predicting overall survival (OS). RESULTS In univariate analysis, preoperative SII, NLR, and CAR were the predictors of OS in patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (p < 0.05, respectively), whereas in multivariate analysis, CAR and pathological tumor depth were the significant predictors of OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.994, p = 0.03 vs. HR 1.967, p = 0.02, respectively). According to AUROC, the CRP (0.66) and albumin levels (0.66) were more important systemic immunoinflammatory measures than neutrophil (0.58), lymphocyte (0.63), and platelet (0.56) levels. CONCLUSION Among systemic immunoinflammatory measures, CAR was the most significant predictor of OS in patients with esophageal cancer. CRP and albumin levels were more important components of systemic immunoinflammatory measures.","Ishibashi, Yusuke; Tsujimoto, Hironori; Hiraki, Shuichi; Kumano, Isao; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Horiguchi, Hiroyuki; Nomura, Shinsuke; Ito, Nozomi; Shinto, Eiji; Aosasa, Suefumi; Yamamoto, Junji; Ueno, Hideki",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-018-6651-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019304/,139

PATIENTS AND METHODS 54 patients undergoing conventional retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy were compared with 27 patients undergoing LESS-RA. The adrenal tumors were considered to be benign preoperatively and <6 cm. Age, sex, laterality, body mass index, surgical indications, time to resuming oral intake, tumor size, operation time, estimated blood loss, intravenous or intramuscular analgesics (pethidine) and postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups. Analysis of covariance was applied to analyze postoperative hospital stay and time to resuming oral intake. RESULTS The length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly higher in the conventional retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy group in the adjusted and unadjusted model. The time to resuming oral intake was significant shorter in the LESS-RA group, but was not significant after adjusting opioid analgesics dosage. No conversions to an open or conventional retroperitoneoscopic approach were necessary. There were neither complications nor blood transfusions in both groups. CONCLUSIONS LESS-RA for benign adrenal tumors is a feasible surgical procedure when tumors are <6 cm. Further clinical research is warranted to define the role of LESS in adrenal surgery and to prove its efficacy over conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Wen, Sheng-Chen; Yeh, Hsin-Chih; Wu, Wen-Jeng; Chou, Yii-Her; Huang, Chun-Hsiung; Li, Ching-Chia",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000351407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24051557/,139
120623,One-Year Healthcare Utilization for Patients That Received Endovascular Treatment Compared With Control.,2019,"BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopy remains a novel technique in the field of colorectal surgery. Several small series have examined its safety for colon resection. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to analyze our entire experience and short-term outcomes with single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy since its introduction at our institution. We assert that this approach is feasible and safe for the wide array of patients and indications encountered by a colorectal surgeon. DESIGN This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data for all patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with the use of standard laparoscopic instrumentation, for malignant or benign disease, between July 2009 and November 2010 in a high-volume, academic, colorectal surgery practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic, clinical, operative, and pathologic factors were reviewed and analyzed. All conversions to conventional laparoscopic or open operations were considered in this analysis. RESULTS One hundred patients underwent single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy during the study period. Mean age was 63 years, and 61% of the patients were men. Forty-three percent had undergone previous abdominal surgery, and the median body mass index was 26 (range, 18-46). Median ASA classification was 3 (range, 1-4). Five percent of the operations were performed urgently, and 56% were performed for carcinoma, of which half were T3 or T4 tumor stage. Median operative duration was 105 (range, 64-270) minutes. Mean and median blood loss was 106 and 50 mL. Two percent required conversion to multiport laparoscopy, and 4% converted to the open approach. Median postoperative stay was 4 (range, 2-48) days. Median lymph node number was 18 (range, 11-42). There was one mortality in this series. Morbidity, including wound infection, was 13%. CONCLUSIONS This represents the largest experience with single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy to date. This technique was used with acceptable morbidity and mortality and without compromise of conventional oncologic parameters by colorectal surgeons experienced in minimally invasive technique. These findings support the use of a single-port approach for patients requiring right hemicolectomy.","Waters, Joshua A; Rapp, Brian M; Guzman, Michael J; Jester, Andrea L; Selzer, Don J; Robb, Bruce W; Johansen, Blake J; Tsai, Ben M; Maun, Dipen C; George, Virgilio V",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31823c0ae4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22228155/,139

In this study, we discovered a novel gammacoronavirus from fecal samples from three Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), which we named bottlenose dolphin CoV (BdCoV) HKU22. All the three BdCoV HKU22-positive samples were collected on the same date, suggesting a cluster of infection, with viral loads of 1 × 10(3) to 1 × 10(5) copies per ml. Clearance of virus was associated with a specific antibody response against the nucleocapsid of BdCoV HKU22. Complete genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that BdCoV HKU22 and BWCoV SW1 have similar genome characteristics and structures. Their genome size is about 32,000 nucleotides, the largest among all CoVs, as a result of multiple unique open reading frames (NS5a, NS5b, NS5c, NS6, NS7, NS8, NS9, and NS10) between their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes. Although comparative genome analysis showed that BdCoV HKU22 and BWCoV SW1 should belong to the same species, a major difference was observed in the proteins encoded by their spike (S) genes, which showed only 74.3 to 74.7% amino acid identities. The high ratios of the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) to the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) in multiple regions of the genome, especially the S gene (Ka/Ks ratio, 2.5), indicated that BdCoV HKU22 may be evolving rapidly, supporting a recent transmission event to the bottlenose dolphins. We propose a distinct species, Cetacean coronavirus, in Gammacoronavirus, to include BdCoV HKU22 and BWCoV SW1, whereas IBV and its closely related bird CoVs represent another species, Avian coronavirus, in Gammacoronavirus.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Lam, Carol S F; Tsang, Alan K L; Hui, Suk-Wai; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Martelli, Paolo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02351-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24227844/,139
120788,"Prevalence and Severity of Adolescent Asthma in Yazd, Iran: Based on the 2020 Global Asthma Network (GAN) Survey.",2021-02-11,"Wind is one of the main factors affecting people's outdoor thermal sensation. Ongoing urbanization and urban densification are transforming the urban climate and complicating the pedestrian-level wind environment. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the potential wind-cooling effect on human outdoor thermal conditions. Accordingly, the current research attempts determine the best wind directions for thermal comfort at the studied stations and how these factors will be changed under the effects of global warming. Outdoor thermal conditions were modeled based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) thermal index using RayMan software for the decades of the 2000s and the 2040s in different climate types of Iran (Csb, BWh, Csa, and BSh) To estimate the potential cooling effect of wind, the PET was calculated (1) under actual wind conditions, and (2) under calm wind (0.05 m/s) conditions. Then, the ΔPET for these two conditions, which indicates the cooling potential effect (CPE) of the wind, was calculated for four representative stations (Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Gorgan, and Shiraz). In comparison with the 2000s, the results indicated that by the 2040s, the predicted wind cooling potential will have increased in Ardebil, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Gorgan (CPE of 13.2 °C, 13.1 °C, 11.2 °C, and 11 °C, respectively). Based on the overall average of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1) used in this study, the occurrence of ""comfortable"" conditions by the 2040s will have increased in Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, and Ardebil by 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively, while it will have decreased in Gorgan by 1.5%. Accounting for the cooling effect of wind, the comfort cooling potential of wind is predicted to rise by an average of 1.6 °C in the 2040s compared with the 2000s in all the studied stations. Therefore, this will affect the microclimates positively and could reduce the urban heat island effects.","Roshan, Gholamreza; Moghbel, Masoumeh; Attia, Shady",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888564/,139
120887,New HCV Therapies and Liver Transplantation.,2016,"Calvarial bone healing remains difficult but may be improved by stimulating chondrogenesis of implanted stem cells. To simultaneously promote chondrogenesis and repress adipogenesis of stem cells, we built a CRISPRai system that comprised inactive Cas9 (dCas9), two fusion proteins as activation/repression complexes and two single guide RNA (sgRNA) as scaffolds for recruiting activator (sgRNAa) or inhibitor (sgRNAi). By plasmid transfection and co-expression in CHO cells, we validated that dCas9 coordinated with sgRNAa to recruit the activator for mCherry activation and also orchestrated with sgRNAi to recruit the repressor for d2EGFP inhibition, without cross interference. After changing the sgRNA sequence to target endogenous Sox9/PPAR-γ, we packaged the entire CRISPRai system into an all-in-one baculovirus for efficient delivery into rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSC) and verified simultaneous Sox9 activation and PPAR-γ repression. The activation/inhibition effects were further enhanced/prolonged by using the Cre/loxP-based hybrid baculovirus. The CRISPRai system delivered by the hybrid baculovirus stimulated chondrogenesis and repressed adipogenesis of rBMSC in 2D culture and promoted the formation of engineered cartilage in 3D culture. Importantly, implantation of the rBMSC engineered by the CRISPRai improved calvarial bone healing.

Fourteen pediatric patients with brain tumors were scanned on a clinical 3-T MRI scanner. PCASL perfusion imaging was performed using a three-dimensional (3D) fast-spin-echo readout module to determine blood flow. DCE imaging was performed using a 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence, and the K(trans) map was obtained with the extended Tofts model. The numerical analysis demonstrated that the uncertainty of PS was predominantly dependent on that of K(trans) and was relatively insensitive to the flow. The average PS values of the whole tumors ranged from 0.006 to 0.217 min(-1), with a mean of 0.050 min(-1) among the patients. The mean K(trans) value was 18% lower than the PS value, with a maximum discrepancy of 25%. When the parametric maps were compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis, the discrepancies between PS and K(trans) appeared to be heterogeneous within the tumors. The PS values could be more than two-fold higher than the K(trans) values for voxels with high K(trans) levels. This study proposes a method that is easy to implement in clinical practice and has the potential to improve the quantification of the microvascular properties of brain tumors.","Liu, Ho-Ling; Chang, Ting-Ting; Yan, Feng-Xian; Li, Cheng-He; Lin, Yu-Shi; Wong, Alex M",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880892/,139

Information and communication technologies-led developments including social media have previously been discussed as instruments of democratization of knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the promise remains unfulfilled as upper socioeconomic groups acquire information at a faster rate than others. The communication inequalities have only reinforced the existing societal fault lines of race, class and place. As the first pandemic of the social media age, COVID-19 has also given rise to an ""infodemic"", providing fertile ground for the spread of information, misinformation and disinformation. With limited gatekeeping, an immense amount of unprocessed scientific information is being put forward to publics not trained in science. In this commentary, we offer some propositions on how disinformation on COVID-19 has become mainstreamed through social media's spiral of amplification and what role public communication has in an emergency from a lens of equity. We raise the question of whether the tremendous flow of scientific information during the COVID-19 pandemic has a differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. We propose that more systematic research is urgently needed to understand how mis/disinformation originate, spread and what their consequences are. In our view, research in health communication inequalities is foundational to mitigating the current off-line and online ravages of the pandemic.","Viswanath, K; Lee, Edmund W J; Pinnamaneni, Ramya",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1837445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106029/,139

METHODS Twenty college athletes (10 men and 10 women) performed a half-squat exercise consisting of five incremental intensities: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of the one-repetition maximum. Blood samples were collected at rest, 15 min and 24 h post-test. The concentration of lipid peroxidation markers and the activities of a skeletal muscle damage marker and a cardiac muscle damage marker were determined in serum. Serum α-actin was measured as a marker of sarcomere damage. Serum levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined to assess the inflammatory response. RESULTS Interleukin-6 levels were higher at 24 h post-test than at rest and 15 min post-test in men (p < 0.05). Moreover, men showed significantly higher hydroperoxide levels in response to resistance exercise at 24 h post-test than at 15 min post-test (p < 0.05). No differences were found in muscle damage parameters regardless of sex or the time point of the test. No differences regarding the studied variables were found when comparing among different time points in women. CONCLUSION Our results show a larger influence of half-squat exercises on the release of IL6 and on lipid peroxidation in men than in women at equivalent workloads.","Aragón-Vela, Jerónimo; Fontana, Luis; Casuso, Rafael A; Plaza-Díaz, Julio; R Huertas, Jesús",Biomedical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140269/,139

We compare short-term and early oncological outcomes after laparoscopic versus open resection in carefully matched rectal cancer patients. METHODS All consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer were reviewed. Laparoscopic resections were matched 1:1 to open resections by age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, body mass index, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and type of surgery. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact, chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Kaplan-Meier estimates. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Ninety-one rectal cancer patients with laparoscopic resection were included, 59% were male, and median age was 62 years. Conversion rate was 18.7%. Laparoscopic and open surgery had similar 30-day morbidity and mortality except wound infection, which was lower for the laparoscopic group (p = 0.02). Laparoscopic surgery had similar 30-day readmissions but shorter total length of hospital stay (5 versus 7 days, p < 0.01), time to first flatus (3 versus 4.5 days, p = 0.001), and time to first bowel movement (4 versus 5 days, p = 0.05) when compared with open surgery. The 3-year disease-free survival, local recurrence, and distant recurrence rates were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery can be safely performed for rectal cancer, with better postoperative recovery and acceptable early oncological outcomes. Results from large ongoing randomized trials with longer follow-up time are pending to better define oncologic outcomes.","da Luz Moreira, Andre; Mor, Isabella; Geisler, Daniel P; Remzi, Feza H; Kiran, Ravi P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1174-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20585962/,139
122818,Higher infiltration of intratumoral CD25+FOXP3+ lymphocytes correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,2020-09-23,"AIMS During entrainment mapping of macro-reentrant tachycardias, the time difference (dPPI) between post-pacing interval (PPI) and tachycardia cycle length (TCL) is thought to be a function of the distance of the pacing site to the re-entry circuit and dPPI < 30 ms is considered within the re-entry circuit. This study assessed the importance of PPI < TCL as a successful target for atypical flutter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 177 ablation procedures were investigated. Surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) were evaluated and combined activation and entrainment mapping were performed to choose ablation sites. Each entrainment sequence immediately preceding static radiofrequency delivery at the same site was analysed. A total of 545 entrainment sequences were analysed. dPPI < 0 ms was observed in 45.3% (247/545) sequences. Ablation resulted in tachycardia termination more often at sites with dPPI < 0 (27.8% vs. 14.5%, P < 0.001) and with a progressively increasingly inverse correlation between dPPI duration and ablation success [odds ratio (OR): 0.974; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960-0.988; P < 0.001]. Tachycardia termination or cycle length prolongation also occurred more often at sites with dPPI < 0 (50.6% vs. 33.2%, P < 0.001) and with a similar inverse correlation with dPPI duration (OR: 0.972; 95% CI 0.960-0.984; P < 0.001). Twelve-lead synchronous isoelectric intervals were observed in 64.4% (163/253) flutter ECGs and were associated with a dPPI < 0 (75.3% vs. 55.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION When combined with activation mapping, a negative dPPI is a more effective parameter for identifying a target for successful ablation compared to a dPPI = 0-30 ms. Its occurrence is associated with a critical small narrow slow-conducting isthmus at the target site.","Dall'Aglio, Pietro Bernardo; Johner, Nicolas; Namdar, Mehdi; Shah, Dipen C","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197256/,139

In this review, the main transmission routes and causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS A review was carried out to recognize relevant research available until 10 April 2020. RESULTS The main transmission routes of COVID-19 have been the following: animal to human and human-to-human pathways, namely: respiratory transmission; oro-fecal transmission; air, surface-human transmission. Transmission from asymptomatic persons, healthcare transmission, and interfamily transmission have been well documented. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility. It is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and close contact. The most probable transmission pathway is definitely the inter-human one. Asymptomatic patients seem to play a crucial role in spreading the infection. Because of COVID-19 infection pandemic potential, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in order to gain an effective vaccine and flock immunity and reduce mortality as soon and as much as it is possible.","Vella, F; Senia, P; Ceccarelli, M; Vitale, E; Maltezou, H; Taibi, R; Lleshi, A; Venanzi Rullo, E; Pellicanò, G F; Rapisarda, V; Nunnari, G; Ledda, C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_22296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744718/,139

No clear data are available concerning this question based on T-category. METHODS Two groups of patients with esophagectomy and high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy for eAC were analyzed: hybrid (laparoscopy + right thoracotomy) (n = 835) and open (laparotomy + right thoracotomy) (n = 188). Outcome criteria were 30- and 90-day mortality, R0-resection rate (R0), number of resected lymph nodes (rLNs), and 5-year survival rate (5y-SR). For each type of surgery, three patient groups were analyzed: pT1-carcinoma (group-1), cT3Nx and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group-2), and pT3N0-3 without neoadjuvant therapy (group-3). The comparison was based on a propensity score matching in relation of 1:2 for open versus hybrid. RESULTS In group-1 (38 open vs 76 hybrid) R0-resection (100%), 30-day mortality (0%), 90-day mortality (2.6% vs 0%), and rLNs (median 29.5 vs 28.5) were not significantly different. The pN0-rate was 76% in the open and 92% in the hybrid group (p = 0.036). Accordingly, the 5y-SR was 69% and 87% (p = 0.016), but the prognosis of the subgroups pT1pN0 or pT1pN+ was not significantly different between open or hybrid. In group-2 (68 open vs 135 hybrid) R0-resection (97%), 30-day (0% vs 0.7%) and 90-day (4%) mortality, rLNs (28.5 vs 26), and 5y-SR (36% vs 41%) were not significantly different. In group-3 (37 open vs 75 hybrid) R0, postoperative mortality, rLNs, and 5y-SR were not significantly different. CONCLUSION In a propensity score-matched comparison of patients with an open or hybrid esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma the quality of oncologic resection, postoperative mortality and prognosis are not different.","Hölscher, Arnulf H; DeMeester, Tom R; Schmidt, Henner; Berlth, Felix; Bollschweiler, Elfriede",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-01882-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388717/,139
123430,Error in Figure.,2019-11-27,"OBJECTIVE Eating difficulties coupled with cardiorespiratory spells delay acquisition of feeding milestones in convalescing neonates, and the mechanisms are unclear. Aims were to examine and compare the pharyngoesophageal-cardiorespiratory (PECR) response characteristics: (a) in control neonates and those with recurrent bradycardia spells; and (b) during pharyngeal stimulation when bradycardia occurs versus when no bradycardia occurs. METHODS Preterm infants (N = 40, 27 ± 3 weeks gestation), underwent concurrent pharyngoesophageal manometry, electrocardiography, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and nasal airflow thermistor to evaluate pharyngoesophageal motility, heart rate (HR), and respiration during graded abrupt pharyngeal sterile water stimuli. Infants with recurrent bradycardia (N = 28) and controls (N = 12) were evaluated at 38 (38-40) and 39 (38-40) weeks postmenstrual age, respectively. Comparisons were performed (a) between study and control groups; and (b) among HR responses of <80 BPM, 80-100 BPM, and >100 BPM. RESULTS Overall, characteristics of PECR responses in infants with a history of recurrent bradycardia (vs. controls) did not differ (p > .05). However, when pharyngeal stimulus induced severe bradycardia (<80 BPM): prolonged respiratory rhythm change, increased pharyngeal activity, increased esophageal dysmotility (as evidenced by prolonged esophageal inhibition and motor activity), and prolonged lower esophageal sphincter relaxation were noted (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS In control infants and those with recurrent bradycardia, pharyngeal stimulation results in similar PECR response characteristics. However, when severe bradycardia occurs, PECR response characteristics are distinct. The mechanisms of severe bradycardia spells are related to abnormal prolongation of vagal inhibitory effects on cardiorespiratory rhythms in conjunction with prolonged esophageal inhibition and delays with terminal swallow.","Hasenstab-Kenney, Kathryn A; Bellodas Sanchez, Jenny; Prabhakar, Varsha; Lang, Ivan M; Shaker, Reza; Jadcherla, Sudarshan R",Physiological reports,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643296/,139

This study aimed to delineate human midfacial strain patterns under uniform muscle loading. The left sides of 5 fresh-frozen human cadaveric heads were dissected of all soft tissues except the temporalis and masseter muscles. Tensile forces were applied to the free mandibular ends of the muscles. Maxillary alveolar arches were used to restrain the skulls. Eight strain gauges were bonded to the surface of the midface to measure the strain under single muscle loading conditions (100 N). Maxillary strain gauges revealed a biaxial load state for both muscles. Thin antral bone experienced high maximum principal tensile strains (maximum of 685.5 με) and high minimum principal compressive strains (maximum of -722.44 με). Similar biaxial patterns of lower magnitude were measured on the zygoma (maximum of 208.59 με for maximum principal strains and -78.11 με for minimum principal strains). Results, consistent for all specimens and counter to previously accepted concepts of biomechanical behavior of the midface under masticatory muscle loading, included high strain in the thin maxillary antral wall, rotational bending through the maxilla and zygoma, and a previously underestimated contribution of the temporalis muscle. This experimental model produced repeatable strain patterns quantifying the mechanics of the facial skeleton. These new counterintuitive findings underscore the need for accurate characterization of craniofacial strain patterns to address problems in the current treatment methods and develop robust design criteria.","Maloul, Asmaa; Regev, Eran; Whyne, Cari M; Beek, Marteen; Fialkov, Jeffrey A",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0b013e31825e3ccd; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976651/,139

One of the promising approaches was a T cell-based vaccine, but the narrow breadth of T-cell immunity due to the immunodominance hierarchy established by previous influenza infection and efficacy against only mild challenge condition are important hurdles to overcome. To model T-cell immunodominance hierarchy in humans in an experimental setting, influenza-primed C57BL/6 mice were chosen and boosted with a mixture of vaccinia recombinants, individually expressing consensus sequences from avian, swine, and human isolates of influenza internal proteins. As determined by IFN-γ ELISPOT and polyfunctional cytokine secretion, the vaccinia recombinants of influenza expanded the breadth of T-cell responses to include subdominant and even minor epitopes. Vaccine groups were successfully protected against 100 LD50 challenges with PR/8/34 and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which contained the identical dominant NP366 epitope. Interestingly, in challenge with pandemic A/Cal/04/2009 containing mutations in the dominant epitope, only the group vaccinated with rVV-NP + PA showed improved protection. Taken together, a vaccinia-based influenza vaccine expressing conserved internal proteins improved the breadth of influenza-specific T-cell immunity and provided heterosubtypic protection against immunologically close as well as distant influenza strains.","Kwon, Ji-Sun; Yoon, Jungsoon; Kim, Yeon-Jung; Kang, Kyuho; Woo, Sunje; Jung, Dea-Im; Song, Man Ki; Kim, Eun-Ha; Kwon, Hyeok-Il; Choi, Young Ki; Kim, Jihye; Lee, Jeewon; Yoon, Yeup; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Youn, Jin-Won",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201344005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825439/,139

With global fatalities of the pandemic exceeding 4.57 million, it becomes crucial to identify effective therapeutics against the virus. A protease, 3CLpro, is responsible for the proteolysis of viral polypeptides into functional proteins, which is essential for viral pathogenesis. This indispensable activity of 3CLpro makes it an attractive target for inhibition studies. The current study aimed to identify potential lead molecules against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 using a manually curated in-house library of antiviral compounds from mangrove plants. This study employed the structure-based virtual screening technique to evaluate an in-house library of antiviral compounds against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. The library was comprised of thirty-three experimentally proven antiviral molecules extracted from different species of tropical mangrove plants. The molecules in the library were virtually screened using AutoDock Vina, and subsequently, the top five promising 3CLpro-ligand complexes along with 3CLpro-N3 (control molecule) complex were subjected to MD simulations to comprehend their dynamic behaviour and structural stabilities. Finally, the MM/PBSA approach was used to calculate the binding free energies of 3CLpro complexes. Among all the studied compounds, Catechin achieved the most significant binding free energy (-40.3 ± 3.1 kcal/mol), and was closest to the control molecule (-42.8 ± 5.1 kcal/mol), and its complex with 3CLpro exhibited the highest structural stability.

126118,IV Thrombolysis prior to Mechanical Thrombectomy in Large Vessel Occlusions.,2019,"Introduction Intubation can sometimes be difficult in patients with lesions in the mouth floor. Ameloblastoma is a frequently encountered tumor of the maxillofacial area. An extensive lesion might occupy the floor of the mouth, prevent displacement of the tongue, limiting the space for inserting a laryngoscope blade and resulting in difficult intubation even with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Case presentation A 66-year-old man (67 kg; 171 cm) with a mental swelling was diagnosed with ameloblastoma and scheduled for surgical resection. The tumor was extensive, occupying most of the anterior floor of the mouth. We were concerned about impossible direct laryngoscopy because the massive tumor in the floor of the mouth compressed the base of the tongue against the posterior wall of the pharynx, restricting the space for inserting the laryngoscope blade. Therefore, we planned to perform awake nasal fiberoptic intubation to secure the airway. Although the procedure was complicated by the massive tumor, successful intubation was achieved by hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the endotracheal tube (ETT) under direct laryngoscopy. Discussion Awake fiberoptic intubation was complicated by the tumor protrusion to deviate the ETT. Discovering of the ETT deviation by the insufficient blade insertion facilitated visualizing the vocal cords with the fiberoptic scope. Conclusion Identification of ETT deviation even with insufficient blade insertion and hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the ETT might raise the chances of successful fiberoptic intubation. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the likelihood of failed fiberoptic intubation and plan for alternative approaches to secure the airway.","Shindo, Yuki; Toda, Shinichi; Kido, Kanta; Masaki, Eiji",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2018.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013771/,139

During the past 2 decades, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have changed the playing field of molecular methods. Today, it is within reach to completely sequence the total microbiological content of a clinical sample, creating a metagenome, in a single week of laboratory work. As new technologies emerge, their dissemination and capacity building must be facilitated, and criteria for use, as well as guidelines on how to report results, must be established. This article focuses on the use of metagenomics, from sample collection to data analysis and to some extent NGS, for the detection of pathogens, the integration of the technique in outbreak response systems, and the risk-based evaluation of sample processing in routine diagnostics labs. The article covers recent advances in the field, current debate, gaps in research, and future directions. Examples of metagenomic detection, as well as possible applications of the methods, are described in various biopreparedness outbreak scenarios.","Karlsson, Oskar Erik; Hansen, Trine; Knutsson, Rickard; Löfström, Charlotta; Granberg, Fredrik; Berg, Mikael","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2012.0077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23971800/,139
126734,Impact of procedural time on clinical and angiographic outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving endovascular treatment.,2019,"Background Pneumonia is a major complication leading to death after stroke. The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. Methods To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens' characteristics and drug resistance. Results Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance (χ2(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. Conclusions The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs.","Xu, Jia; Yang, Zhiling",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410809/,139
126737,Initial experience with a new distal intermediate and aspiration catheter in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: clinical safety and efficacy.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in infants. Renal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used to evaluate regional oximetry in a non-invasive continuous real-time fashion, and reflects tissue perfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between renal oximetry and development of AKI in the operative and post-operative setting in infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. METHODS In this prospective study, we enrolled 59 infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart disease for univentricular (n = 26) or biventricular (n = 33) repair. Renal NIRS was continuously measured intraoperatively and for at least 24 hours postoperatively and analysed for the intraoperative and first 12 hours, first 24 hours and first 48 hours postoperatively. The renal oximetry values were correlated with the paediatric risk, injury, failure, loss, end (pRIFLE) classification for AKI, renal biomarkers and the postoperative course. RESULTS Twenty-eight (48%) infants developed AKI based on pRIFLE classification. Already during intraoperative renal oximetry and further in the first 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively, significantly lower renal oximetry values in AKI patients compared with patients with normal renal function were recorded (P < 0.05). Of the 28 patients who developed AKI, 3 (11%) needed renal replacement therapy and 2 (7%) died. In the non-AKI group, no deaths occurred. Infants with decreased renal oximetry values developed significantly higher lactate levels 24 hours after surgery. Cystatin C was a late parameter of AKI, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values were not correlated with AKI occurrence. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that prolonged low renal oximetry values during cardiac surgery correlate with the development of AKI and may be superior to conventional biochemical markers. Renal NIRS might be a promising non-invasive tool of multimodal monitoring of kidney function and developing AKI in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.","Ruf, Bettina; Bonelli, Vittorio; Balling, Gunter; Hörer, Jürgen; Nagdyman, Nicole; Braun, Siegmund Lorenz; Ewert, Peter; Reiter, Karl",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-015-0760-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631390/,139
126878,Clinical and Procedural Predictors of Outcomes From the Endovascular Treatment of Posterior Circulation Strokes.,2016,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that appeared in China in December 2019 and spread globally, evolving into the currently observed pandemic. The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and imaging cannot replace genetic testing in patients suspected of COVID-19. However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity. The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT-PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease. In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary changes. In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in COVID-19 patients.","Jędrusik, Piotr; Gaciong, Zbigniew; Sklinda, Katarzyna; Sierpiński, Radosław; Walecki, Jerzy; Gujski, Mariusz",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385976/,139

Community-based NSI aim for incremental normative change and complement other social and behaviour change strategies, addressing gender, other inequalities, and the power structures that hold inequalities in place. Consequently, they demand that designers and implementers-many who are outsiders-grapple with power, history, and community agency operating in complicated social contexts. Ethical questions include whose voices and values, at which levels, should inform intervention design; who should be accountable for managing resistance that arises during implementation? As interest and funding for NSI increases in lower and middle-income countries, their potential to yield sustained change is balanced by unintentionally reinforcing inequities that violate human rights and social justice pillars guiding health promotion efforts. A review of 125 articles on ethical considerations in public health, social justice, and human rights-where NSI actions intersect-indicated little guidance on practice. To begin to address this gap, we propose ten ethical values and practical ways to engage ethically with the social complexities of NSI and the social change they seek, and a way forward.","Igras, Susan; Kohli, Anjalee; Bukuluki, Paul; Cislaghi, Beniamino; Khan, Sonali; Tier, Catherine",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1820550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985366/,139

The aim of this study was to examine the antiviral effect of CH25H on pseudorabies virus (PRV), a swine pathogen that can cause devastating disease and economic losses worldwide. The results showed that porcine ch25h was induced by either interferon or PRV infection. PRV infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21 cells) was attenuated by CH25H overexpression and enhanced by silencing of CH25H. Furthermore, treatment of 3D4/21 cells with 25HC inhibited the growth of PRV in vitro, suggesting that CH25H may restrict PRV replication by 25HC production. We further identified that the anti-PRV role of CH25H and 25HC was subject to their inhibitory effect on PRV attachment and entry. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CH25H is an intrinsic host restriction factor in PRV infection of porcine alveolar macrophages.","Wang, Jiang; Zeng, Lei; Zhang, Li; Guo, Zhen-Zhen; Lu, Shao-Fang; Ming, Sheng-Li; Li, Guo-Li; Wan, Bo; Tian, Ke-Gong; Yang, Guo-Yu; Chu, Bei-Bei",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28631596/,139

Direct comparisons between NM and conventional materials (CM) in terms of local morbidity and need for prosthesis removal are lacking. METHODS Between January 2005 and July 2013, 109 procedures were performed to remove chest wall tumors in 86 patients. Of these, 32 underwent complex chest wall reconstructions owing to either recurrence, defect extension (greater than 3 ribs or >100 cm2) or local conditions (ie, previous irradiation or infection). New materials and CM (ie, polytetrafluoroethylene and methyl methacrylate) were used in 17 (53%) and 15 (47%) patients, respectively. Of the 32 patients included in the high complexity group, 23 patients did not exhibit any postoperative complications (72%). However, 9 patients (28%) underwent both a first and a second reoperation after a median interval of 4 months from the first procedure (range, 7 days to 60 months). Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was instituted in all patients as a means to control sepsis and facilitate space obliteration with healthy tissue. RESULTS In 7 patients the reason for reintervention was local wound complications. In 4 of 7 patients, the prosthesis had to be removed (3 CM and 1 NM, 4.6% of the whole series; 12.5% in the high complexity group, 5.9% for NM and 20% for CM). The median time to complete chest wall healing after VAC in patients with local sepsis was 14 months (range, 5 to 60 months). All patients are currently alive and well except for 1 who died 11 months after complete chest wall healing as a result of dissemination of metastatic chondrosarcoma. At univariate analysis, predictors of overall and grade 2 or less morbidity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 were first (p=0.038) and second (p=0.015) redo operations. Conversely, patients with a body mass index of less than 25 kg/m2 (p=0.049) undergoing one (p=0.032) or two reconstructions (p=0.00047) with combined materials (p=0.00029) were more likely to experience local wound complications and require VAC. On multiple regression analysis, redo operations (first, p=0.032; second, p=0.00047) and the use of combined (synthetic and biologic) materials (p=0.0029) were confirmed to be related to an increased incidence of wound complications. CONCLUSIONS Multiple redo operations after complex chest wall reconstruction performed with a combination of NM and CM may be associated with an increased incidence of local wound complications. Nevertheless, in these cases, the use of NM and VAC yielded a low rate (5.8% versus 20% with CM) of prosthesis removal while achieving complete wound healing.","Rocco, Gaetano; Martucci, Nicola; La Rocca, Antonello; La Manna, Carmine; De Luca, Giuseppe; Fazioli, Flavio; Mori, Stefano",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.04.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857855/,139

Transfusion of blood and blood products remains the corner stone of anaemia and coagulopathy treatment in critical care. However, determining when the benefits of transfusion outweigh the risks of anaemia may be challenging in some critically ill patients. Therefore, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine prioritised the development of a clinical practice guideline to address anaemia and coagulopathy in non-bleeding critically ill patients. The aims of this article are to: (1) review the evolution of transfusion practice in critical care and the direction for future developments in this important area of transfusion medicine and (2) to provide a brief synopsis of the guideline development process and recommendations in a format designed for busy clinicians and blood bank staff. These clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations to clinicians on how best to manage non-bleeding critically ill patients at the bedside. More research is needed on alternative transfusion targets, use of transfusions in special populations (e.g., acute neurological injury, acute coronary syndromes), use of anaemia prevention strategies and point-of-care interventions to guide transfusion strategies.","Shah, Akshay; Oczkowski, Simon; Aubron, Cecile; Vlaar, Alexander P; Dionne, Joanna C",Transfusion medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/tme.12738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207388/,139

Given that the Association of American Medical Colleges and Society of Neurological Surgeons have recommended neurosurgery residency programs for the 2021 residency application cycle cancel away rotations and in-person interviews, our objective was to evaluate cost savings to medical students applying during this time and the implications. METHODS Utilizing the 2019-2020 Texas STAR Dashboard database, we queried responses from neurosurgery residency applicants. We recorded application costs, away rotation costs, interview costs, and total costs for medical school seniors applying to neurosurgery residency. Demographic information for applicants was also recorded. Mean and median costs were reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was utilized to determine differences in mean costs by medical school region. RESULTS Our cohort included 121 US allopathic applicants to neurosurgery residency. Mean application costs were $1,711, away rotation costs were $3,840, interview costs were $6,400, and total costs were $11,882. No significant difference was observed for mean total costs for applicants from schools in the central ($10,525/applicant), northeast ($11,311/applicant), south ($12,660/applicant) and west ($12,404/applicant) (p=0.181). There was no significant difference between the mean application fees, away rotation costs, or interview costs between regions. CONCLUSION In the COVID-19 era, neurosurgery residency applicants could save over $10,000 through the use of virtual interviews and lack of away rotations. There are potential geographic trends, however further evaluation should be performed.","Gordon, Adam M; Malik, Azeem Tariq",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.03.149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33831614/,139

However, its effects on angiogenesis following ischemic stroke are unclear. Here, we explored the effect of microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p on angiogenesis and neurogenesis after brain ischemia. We demonstrated that both microRNA (miRNA)-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p increased the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared with the scrambled miRNA control (p < 0.05). Transferring microRNA-126 into a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model via lentivirus, we found that microRNA-126 overexpression increased the number of CD31+/BrdU+ (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive) proliferating endothelial cells and DCX+/BrdU+ neuroblasts in the ischemic mouse brain, improved neurobehavioral outcomes (p < 0.05), and reduced brain atrophy volume (p < 0.05) compared with control mice. Western blot results showed that AKT and ERK signaling pathways were activated in the lentiviral-microRNA-126-treated group (p < 0.05). Both PCR and western blot results demonstrated that tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 9 (PTPN9) was decreased in the lentiviral-microRNA-126-treated group (p < 0.05). Dual-luciferase gene reporter assay also showed that PTPN9 was the direct target of microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p in the ischemic brain. We demonstrated that microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis in ischemic mouse brain, and further improved neurobehavioral outcomes. Our mechanistic study further showed that microRNA-126 mediated angiogenesis through directly inhibiting its target PTPN9 and activating AKT and ERK signaling pathways.","Qu, Meijie; Pan, Jiaji; Wang, Liping; Zhou, Panting; Song, Yaying; Wang, Shuhong; Jiang, Lu; Geng, Jieli; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Tang, Yaohui; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Molecular therapy.

128197,Comparison of intravascular ultrasound with conventional venography for detection of extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency.,2013,"BACKGROUND School nutrition programs mitigate child food insecurity across the United States. With the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, kindergarten through grade 12 physical school campuses closed, which led to those programs transitioning to emergency feeding. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has 4 action priorities that guided the assessment of school nutrition employees' emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to explore the experience of school nutrition employees as they provided emergency feeding services during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate their actions based on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction . DESIGN A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews (n = 34) was conducted via videoconferencing software. A purposive sample of school nutrition employees across all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions who were involved in the COVID-19 emergency feeding response participated during April and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING School nutrition employees were selected randomly for participation from those indicating willingness to be interviewed during their participation in a related survey. Recruitment continued until all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions were represented. Participants held various roles, ranging from state agency leaders to front-line supervisors, although most were district-level directors or assistant directors. ANALYSIS Data were analyzed using a phenomenological qualitative analytic approach. RESULTS Four themes emerged. First, participants described the progression of the initial shock associated with the pandemic and service disruption, the flexibility they practiced, and the development of new routines. Second, keeping people (children, coworkers, and the community) safe was highlighted. The next theme captured participants' feeling that they came ""out of the shadows"" as communities and stakeholders recognized their important contribution to children's food security. Finally, they shared insight on communication and accountability during the emergency feeding response. CONCLUSIONS These programs demonstrated flexibility, resilience, and commitment to children during this crisis. As the pandemic continues and future disasters are considered, school nutrition programs and leaders can use the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction's ""build back better"" concept to refine disaster preparedness plans and advocate for changes that will continue to combat child food insecurity in the United States.","Patten, Emily Vaterlaus; Spruance, Lori; Vaterlaus, J Mitchell; Jones, Mckenna; Beckstead, Emma",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2021.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994141/,139
129093,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: a single institution experience of 28 patients.,2012,"BACKGROUND Microparticles (MP) are submicron, phosphatidylserine (PS)-bearing lipid vesicles with physiologic and pathologic roles in coagulation and inflammation. Microparticles accumulate in packed RBC (pRBC) stored for transfusion, potentially increasing recipient morbidity. Historically, canine MP have been detected with the PS label annexin V in supernatant samples. Other detection methods are available but have not been evaluated in dogs. OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to detect and enumerate MP in canine pRBC using annexin V, lactadherin, and bio-maleimide to compare label performance and assess microparticle accumulation under standard storage conditions. METHODS Microparticles (0.5-1.0 μm) in canine dog erythrocyte antigen 1.1 positive, nonleukoreduced pRBC were labeled with FITC-annexin V, FITC-lactadherin, and the fluorescent dye bio-maleimide, and were counted using flow cytometry at 3 time points (days 7, 21, and 35) of storage. Unprocessed pRBC, rather than supernatant, were used. RESULTS Annexin V and bio-maleimide labeling produced comparable microparticle counts (P = .16), while lactadherin labeling resulted in higher microparticle counts than annexin V (P = .002) and bio-maleimide (P = .006), particularly on day 7. Bio-maleimide- and annexin V-based microparticle counts increased significantly from day 7 to 35 (P = .04), and increases from day 21 to 35 approached statistical significance (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS Bio-maleimide- and annexin V-mediated microparticle counts were comparable in unprocessed canine pRBC using flow cytometry. Whether the increased microparticle counts with lactadherin were due to increased sensitivity for small, PS-bearing MP or due to labeling of membrane fragments and debris requires further investigation.","McEntire, Meredeth C; Wardrop, K Jane; Davis, William C",Veterinary clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935625/,139

However, only recently COVID-19 confinement measures provided a context to test whether such detrimental effects exist in the human sexuality domain. AIM This study was aimed at testing the relationship between COVID-19 confinement levels and sexual functioning domains in men and women, while accounting for the mediating role of psychological adjustment during lockdown. METHODS Two hundred and forty five men and 417 women completed a web survey on the effects of COVID-19 in sexual health. The reference period includes the first confinement in Portugal (March 19-June 1, 2020). Data were handled under Hays' procedures for simple mediation analysis. OUTCOMES Measurement outcomes included self-reported levels of confinement, IIEF and FSFI scores, and psychological adjustment during lockdown. RESULTS Psychological adjustment during lockdown mediated the relationship between confinement levels and most sexual functioning domains in men but not in women. Also, while confinement levels were not directly related with most sexual functioning domains, psychological adjustment during lockdown did predict lower sexual functioning in both genders. CLINICAL TRANSLATION Findings support that human sexual functioning should be framed within a contextual perspective, emphasizing how psychological adjustment and situational life stressors, such as lockdown situations, shape individuals' sexuality. Such perspective should be considered in treatment protocols implemented during current pandemic. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS Data add to the literature on the effects of lockdown in the sexuality domain. However, the study precludes inference of causality and targets only a little proportion of all the dynamics involved in sexuality during the current historical moment.

BACKGROUND Leaks after bariatric surgery remain a major source of morbidity and mortality. The association of surgical technique and devices with leaks after gastric bypass is poorly understood. SETTING Multi-centered study that included teaching and non-teaching hospitals that participate in a statewide consortium for quality improvement using a payer-funded outcome registry. METHODS We analyzed data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative and performed a case-control study comparing patients who sustained a leak with those who did not after primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A total of 71 (.44%) patients with leaks were identified between January 2007 and December 2011. The leak group was matched 1:2 to a control group (nonleak) based on procedure type, age, body mass index, sex, and the year in which the procedure was performed. Technique-specific case characteristics and device-specific factors were assessed by reviewing operative notes from all primary bariatric procedures in our study population. RESULTS The rate of leak decreased during the study period, and there was a significant downward trend (slope estimate: -.19961%, P = .0372). After performing multivariate analysis, the type of anastomosis (circular stapler, hand-sewn, or linear stapler) and stapler manufacturer were not associated with leaks. The use of buttressing material was associated with a higher rate of leaks (odds ratio: 8.79 [95% confidence interval: 2.49-31.01], P = .0007), whereas the use of fibrin sealant was associated with a lower rate of leaks (odds ratio .11 [95% confidence interval: .03-.41], P = .0013). These findings could not be explained by differences in measures of surgeon performance. CONCLUSION Leak rates after laparoscopic gastric bypass have fallen in Michigan despite variations in technique and device utilization. Although the type of anastomosis and stapler manufacturer do not appear to be significantly associated with leaks, it appears that the use of buttressing material was more common in cases in which leaks occurred, whereas the use of fibrin sealant was not. Given the complex interplay of multiple variables that affect surgical outcomes, future studies justifying the benefits of operative devices should be evaluated prospectively in the context of surgeon technique and skill.","Varban, Oliver A; Cassidy, Ruth B; Sheetz, Kyle H; Cain-Nielsen, Ann; Carlin, Arthur M; Schram, Jon L; Weiner, Matthew J; Bacal, Daniel; Stricklen, Amanda; Finks, Jonathan F",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2015.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525367/,139

Health education campaigns for avoidance of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have been relatively unsuccessful in this population. This systematic review examines interventions aimed at post-secondary school young adults on college and university campuses for skin cancer awareness, photoprotection, and change in UV-exposure-related behavior. Fifty-nine studies were identified for inclusion according to predetermined criteria. Study heterogeneity was high; methods of intervention were individual or group-based, and were mostly visually delivered and/or passive learning. Most interventions occurred at a single time point. Intervention success was assessed by evaluating subject behavior, intention, attitudes, knowledge, and emotion. Multicomponent interventions, generally consisting of UV photography and a passively delivered educational component, may be more effective than a single component alone. Overall, study quality was poor. Sample size of the majority of studies was <150 subjects. Most studies used self-report of behavior and had a short follow-up time. Generalizability of findings may be impacted as women, particularly white/Caucasian women, were overrepresented in the studies identified by this systematic review. For this specific target population, themes arising from the review include the importance of self-relevance and message framing. Self-affirmation was identified as a potential challenge in designing interventions for this target group, which can lead to defensiveness and a negative reaction to the health message. The findings of this systematic review may inform future research in this field, as well as guide planning of effective interventions in this target population.","Asai, Yuka; Armstrong, Dawn; McPhie, Meghan L; Xue, Chao; Rosen, Cheryl F",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1203475420988863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566702/,139

The present study examined a moderated model that links conditions of uncertainty with psychological distress during the coronavirus 2019 lockdown. METHOD Married parents in Israel (N = 186), all of whom were working at home during the lockdown, completed several measures, including those assessing intolerance of uncertainty (IU), psychological distress, dispositional optimism, and work arrangements at home. RESULTS Data analysis supported the association between IU and psychological distress. Two additional measures, optimism and work schedule, were found to act as moderators. Whereas optimism buffered IU's negative ramifications, the inability to schedule proper work arrangements at home during the lockdown comprised a risk factor for IU and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that IU is associated with psychological distress. Theoretical and practical ramifications of the study findings are presented.

METHODS Retrospective case report. SD-OCT, fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography were performed. RESULTS A 21-year-old healthy man described the acute onset of superior visual field loss in his right eye. He admitted smoking approximately 15 grams daily of cannabis for several weeks during COVID-19 confinement. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye showed inferotemporal retinal whitening. SD-OCT illustrated evidence of the ischemic cascade with diffuse hyperreflectivity of the inner and middle retinal layers within the central region of the retinal infarct and paracentral acute middle maculopathy at the border of the infarct. Optical coherence tomography angiography demonstrated predominant flow signal loss at the level of the deep retinal capillary plexus. Fluorescein angiography and complete systemic workup were unremarkable. CONCLUSION Branch retinal artery occlusion and paracentral acute middle maculopathy may be related to heavy cannabis use as the result of transient arterial vasospasm.","Ramtohul, Prithvi; Bailey Freund, K; Sarraf, David",Retinal cases & brief reports,https://doi.org/10.1097/icb.0000000000001051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947368/,139

To tackle this issue, we propose an approach based on sensitivity analyses of a spatiotemporal stochastic model simulating the spread of a plant epidemic. This work is motivated by the spread of sharka, caused by plum pox virus, in a real landscape. We first carried out a broad-range sensitivity analysis, ignoring any prior information on six epidemiological parameters, to assess their intrinsic influence on model behaviour. A second analysis benefited from the available knowledge on sharka epidemiology and was thus restricted to more realistic values. The broad-range analysis revealed that the mean duration of the latent period is the most influential parameter of the model, whereas the sharka-specific analysis uncovered the strong impact of the connectivity of the first infected orchard. In addition to demonstrating the interest of sensitivity analyses for a stochastic model, this study highlights the impact of variation ranges of target parameters on the outcome of a sensitivity analysis. With regard to sharka management, our results suggest that sharka surveillance may benefit from paying closer attention to highly connected patches whose infection could trigger serious epidemics.","Rimbaud, Loup; Bruchou, Claude; Dallot, Sylvie; Pleydell, David R J; Jacquot, Emmanuel; Soubeyrand, Samuel; Thébaud, Gaël",Royal Society open science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410846/,139

Adding to the background, medical isotope production (MIP) by fission releases several important xenon isotopes including xenon-133 and iodine-133 that decays to xenon-133. The amount of xenon released from these facilities may be equivalent to or exceed that released from an underground nuclear explosion. Thus the release of gaseous fission products within days of irradiation makes it difficult to distinguish MIP emissions from a nuclear explosion. In addition, recent shortages in molybdenum-99 have created interest and investment opportunities to design and build new MIP facilities in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the potential increase in the number of MIP facilities, a discussion of abatement technologies provides insight into how the problem of emission control from MIP facilities can be tackled. A review of practices is provided to delineate methods useful for abatement of medical isotopes.","Doll, Charles G; Sorensen, Christina M; Bowyer, Theodore W; Friese, Judah I; Hayes, James C; Hoffmann, Emmy; Kephart, Rosara",Journal of environmental radioactivity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418952/,139

131926,Endovascular (intraarterial) treatment of acute ischemic stroke: efficacy not supported by clinical trials.,2014,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly. Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs). Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting. METHODS Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact. The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure. RESULTS Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case. Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days. None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset. All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms. Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of >15 minutes. Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact. The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department. CONCLUSION We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting. These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts. The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.","Canova, Vera; Lederer Schläpfer, Heidi; Piso, Rein Jan; Droll, Armin; Fenner, Lukas; Hoffmann, Tobias; Hoffmann, Matthias",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333603/,139

Objective To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors. Results Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. Conclusions and Relevance This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Juyi; Wang, Xiufang; Chen, Jian; Zhang, Hongmei; Deng, Aiping",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324209/,139

The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. PATIENTS AND METHODS The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS This translational diagnostic tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2.","Pham, V H; Gargiulo Isacco, C; Nguyen, K C D; Le, S H; Tran, D K; Nguyen, Q V; Pham, H T; Aityan, S; Pham, S T; Cantore, S; Inchingolo, A M; Inchingolo, A D; Dipalma, G; Ballini, A; Inchingolo, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202006_21713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633414/,139

Using data from long-term standardized surveys, we analyzed temporal changes in fish assemblages in the Yangtze River upstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) before, during and after its construction. Our analysis indicated fish assemblage regime shifts in the two closer reaches in 2008, in accordance with the filling to 172.5 m in 2008; and in the other reach, farthest from the TGD, in 2011, indicating timing of the effects being related to distance. These shifts were evident in relative abundance of native fish species rather than non-native species and have altered community structures and functional groups. Relative abundance of the lotic guilds declined in the two closer reaches, but increased in the farthest. Invertivores declined, but piscivores and opportunistic life-history strategists increased in all reaches. We conclude that construction of TGD had led to significant changes in species distributions influenced by species functional traits. Our findings emphasize the need for long-term monitoring of fish assemblages before and after dam construction in order to understand ecological responses to hydrological changes for effective resource management in regulated rivers.","Gao, Xin; Fujiwara, Masami; Winemiller, Kirk O; Lin, Pengcheng; Li, Mingzheng; Liu, Huanzhang",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38993-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862788/,139

Resilience, defined as a dynamic process of positively responding to adversity, could protect against depressive symptoms in cardiac disease. No systematic review has been conducted on the relationship between these variables in this population. OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to explore the association between psychological resilience and depressive symptoms in adults with cardiac disease. METHODS Seven databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to December 2019 using the search terms ""cardiac disease,"" ""depressive symptoms,"" ""depression,"" and ""resilience."" Inclusion criteria dictated that studies reported original research on the association between resilience and depressive symptoms in adults with a cardiac disease broadly defined. Quality ratings were performed by 2 independent raters. RESULTS We identified 13 studies for final review. Study sample sizes ranged from 30 to 1022 participants, average age ranged from 52 to 72 years, and all studies had majority male participants (64%-100%). Resilience and depressive symptoms were inversely related in 10 of 13 studies. The 3 studies with poor-quality sampling techniques or significant loss to follow-up found no relationship.

Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. In this study we aimed to compare results of SILS cholecystectomy and three port conventional laparoscopic (TPCL) cholecystectomy prospectively. METHODS In this prospective study, 100 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease were randomly allocated to SILS cholecystectomy (group 1) or TPCL cholecystectomy (group 2). Demographics, pathologic diagnosis, operating time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, pain score, conversion rate, and satisfaction of cosmetic outcome were recorded. RESULTS Forty-four SILS cholesystectomies (88%) and 42 TPCL cholecystectomies (84%) were completed successfully. Conversion to open surgery was required for 4 cases in group 1 and 6 cases in group 2. Operating time was significantly longer in group 1 compared with group 2 (73 minutes vs. 48 minutes; P < 0.05). Higher pain scores were observed in group 1 versus group 2 in postoperative day 1 (P < 0.05). There was higher cosmetic satisfaction in group 1 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION SILS cholecystectomy performed by experienced surgeons is at least as successful, feasible, effective and safe as a TPCL cholecystectomy. Surgeons performing SILS should have a firm foundation of advanced minimal access surgical skills and a cautious, gradated approach to attempt the various procedures. Prospective randomized studies comparing single access versus conventional multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with large volumes and long-term follow-up, are needed to confirm our initial experience.

134271,'Drip-and-drive': shipping the neurointerventionalist to provide mechanical thrombectomy in primary stroke centers.,2018,"Background The Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) are commonly used neurological rating scales in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). The modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) has been accepted as an appropriate outcome measure for clinical trials in FRDA. Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited face-to-face interactions with individuals involved in natural history studies and clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of conducting the mFARS and SARA through video. Methods Individuals who had the mFARS administered face-to-face in the previous 6 months were invited to participate. Participants were sent instructions and asked to have a carer present to assist. The mFARS and SARA were then administered by video. Differences between face-to-face and video scores and the reliability between scores obtained face-to-face and by video were examined. Results The mFARS and SARA were conducted by video with 19 individuals. Excellent test-retest reliability was seen in the mFARS lower limb coordination (ICC = 0.96, 95% CI 0.90-0.98) and upright stability sections (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-0.99), total mFARS (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-0.99) and SARA scores (ICC = 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-0.99). Conclusions Excellent test-retest reliability was demonstrated in the majority of the mFARS sections, and in the total mFARS and SARA scores, suggesting that video is a valid method of conducting these scales. This method enables inclusion of participants who are unable to travel to study sites. A larger cohort will be required to further validate the use of video mFARS and SARA for future studies.","Tai, Geneieve; Corben, Louise A; Woodcock, Ian R; Yiu, Eppie M; Delatycki, Martin B",Movement disorders clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.13204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307740/,139

135646,Cholesterol Crystals in Embolic Debris are Associated with Postoperative Cerebral Embolism after Carotid Artery Stenting.,2018,"BACKGROUND Total hip arthroplasty (THA) relieves pain and improves physical function in patients with hip osteoarthritis, but requires a year or more for full postoperative recovery. Proponents of intermuscular surgical approaches believe that the direct-anterior approach may restore physical function more quickly than transgluteal approaches, perhaps because of diminished muscle trauma. To evaluate this, we compared patient-reported physical function and other outcome metrics during the first year after surgery between groups of patients who underwent primary THA either through the direct-anterior approach or posterior approach. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We asked: (1) Is a primary THA using a direct-anterior approach associated with better patient-reported physical function at early postoperative times (1 and 3 months) compared with a THA performed through the posterior approach? (2) Is the direct-anterior approach THA associated with shorter operative times and higher rates of noninstitutional discharge than a posterior approach THA? METHODS Between October 2008 and February 2010, an arthroplasty fellowship-trained surgeon performed 135 THAs. All 135 were performed using the posterior approach. During that period, we used this approach when patients had any moderate to severe degenerative joint disease of the hip attributable to any type of arthritis refractory to nonoperative treatment measures. Of the patients who were treated with this approach, 21 (17%; 23 hips) were lost to followup, whereas 109 (83%; 112 hips) were available for followup at 1 year. Between February and September 2011, the same surgeon performed 86 THAs. All 86 were performed using the direct-anterior approach. During that period, we used this approach when patients with all types of moderate to severe degenerative joint disease had nonoperative treatment measures fail. Of the patients who were treated with this approach, 35 (41%; 35 hips) were lost to followup, whereas 51 (59%; 51 hips) were available for followup at 1 year. THAs during the surgeon's direct-anterior approach learning period (February 2010 through January 2011) were excluded because both approaches were being used selectively depending on patient characteristics. Clinical outcomes included operative blood loss; allogeneic transfusion; adverse events; patient-reported Veterans RAND-12 Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scores at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Resource utilization outcomes included operative time, length of stay, and discharge disposition (home versus institution). Outcomes were compared using logistic and linear regression techniques. RESULTS After controlling for relevant confounding variables including age, sex, and BMI, the direct-anterior approach was associated with worse adjusted MCS changes 1 and 3 months after surgery (1-month score change, -9; 95% CI, -13 to -5; standard error, 2), compared with the posterior approach (3-month score change, -9; 95% CI, -14 to -3; standard error, 3) (both p < 0.001), while the direct-anterior approach was associated with greater PCS improvement at 3 months compared with the posterior approach (score change, 6; 95% CI, 2-10; standard error, 2; p = 0.008). There were no differences in adjusted PCS at either 1 month or 12 months, and no clinically important differences in UCLA scores. Although the PCS score differences are greater than the minimum clinically important difference of 5 points for this endpoint, the clinical importance of such a small effect is questionable. At 1 year after THA, there were no intergroup differences in self-reported physical function, although both groups had significant loss-to-followup at that time. Operative time (skin incision to skin closure) between the two groups did not differ (81 versus 79 minutes; p = 0.411). Mean surgical blood loss (403 versus 293 mL; p < 0.001; adjusted, 119 more mL; 95% CI, 79-160; p < 0.001) and in-hospital transfusion rates (direct-anterior approach, 20% [17/86] versus posterior approach, 10% [14/135], p = 0.050; adjusted odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-10.1; p = 0.016) were higher in the direct-anterior approach group. With the numbers available, there was no difference in the frequency of adverse events between groups when comparing intraoperative complications, perioperative Technical Expert Panel complications, and other non-Technical Expert Panel complications within 1 year of surgery, although this study was not adequately powered to detect differences in rare adverse events. CONCLUSIONS With suitable experience, the direct-anterior approach can be performed with expected results similar to those of the posterior approach. There may be transient and small benefits to the direct-anterior approach, including improved physical function at 3 months after surgery. However, the greater operative blood loss and greater likelihood of blood transfusions, even when the surgeon is experienced, may be a disadvantage. Given some of the kinds of bias present that we found, including loss to followup, the conclusions we present should be considered preliminary, but it appears that any benefits that accrue to the patients who had the direct-anterior approach would be transient and modest. Prospective randomized studies on the topic are needed to address the differences between surgical approaches more definitively.

The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES™) is a high-stakes examination of the knowledge and skills required to perform flexible endoscopy. The objective of this study was to establish additional evidence for the validity of the FES™ hands-on test as a measure of flexible endoscopy skills by correlating clinical colonoscopy performance with FES™ score. METHODS Participants included FES™-naïve general surgery residents, gastroenterology fellows at all levels of training and attending physicians who regularly perform colonoscopy. Each participant completed a live colonoscopy and the FES™ hands-on test within 2 weeks. Performance on live colonoscopy was measured using the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills-Colonoscopy (GAGES-C, maximum score 20), and performance on the FES™ hands-on test was assessed by the simulator's computerized scoring system. The clinical assessor was blinded to simulator performance. Scores were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS A total of 24 participants were enrolled (mean age 30; 54 % male) with a broad range of endoscopy experience; 17 % reported no experience, 54 % had <25 previous colonoscopies; and 21 % had >100. The FES™ and GAGES scores reflected the broad range of endoscopy experience of the study group (FES™ score range 32-105; GAGES score range 5-20). Pearson's correlation coefficient between GAGES-C scores and FES™ hands-on test scores was 0.78 (0.54-0.90, p < 0.0001). All eight participants with GAGES-C score >15/20 achieved a passing score on the FES™ hands-on test. CONCLUSION There is a strong correlation between clinical colonoscopy performance and scores achieved on the FES™ hands-on test. These data support the validity of FES™ as a measure of colonoscopy skills.","Mueller, C L; Kaneva, P; Fried, G M; Feldman, L S; Vassiliou, M C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3583-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902817/,139
136539,Mechanical characterization of thromboemboli in acute ischemic stroke and laboratory embolus analogs.,2011,"PURPOSE To investigate the value of nonabsorbable sutures in reducing the incidence of consecutive exotropia after large, ""hang-back"" medial rectus recessions. METHODS The medical records of patients who underwent medial rectus recession of ≥6.5 mm in individuals ≤2 years of age, or ≥7.0 mm in those >2 years were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on suture material used: absorbable, polyglactin 910 sutures (44 patients); nonabsorbable, polyester sutures (50 patients). Preoperative measurements, ductions, strabismus surgery, and postoperative results were analyzed. Inadequate anchoring of the medial rectus muscle was suspected when consecutive exotropia developed 4-7 weeks after surgery after initial satisfactory alignment and was confirmed if during reoperation the medial rectus muscle appeared recessed >2 mm beyond the originally intended recession. RESULTS Consecutive exotropia due to inadequate anchoring of the medial rectus muscle occurred in 11 of 66 muscles (17%) in the absorbable suture group. The muscle was found 6-10 mm posterior to the intended recession. Limited duction in the field of action of the involved medial rectus muscle occurred in 9 of the 11 muscles (82%). None of the eyes with nonabsorbable sutures showed inadequate anchoring. The incidence of consecutive exotropia was higher in the absorbable suture group (30%) than in the nonabsorbable suture group (6%) (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Using nonabsorbable suture for large, hang-back medial rectus recessions greatly reduces the incidence of consecutive exotropia that can occur when absorbable suture dissolves.","Awadein, Ahmed; Marsh, Justin D; Guyton, David L",Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2016.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138809/,139

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only available vaccine against TB but its efficacy varies throughout the world. Subunit vaccine candidates, based on recombinant viral vectors expressing mycobacterial antigens, are one of the strategies being developed to boost BCG-primed host immune responses and efficacy. A promising vaccination regimen composed of intradermal (i.d.) BCG prime, followed by intranasally (i.n.) administered chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) and i.n. or i.d. modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), both expressing Ag85A, has been previously reported to significantly improve BCG efficacy in mice. Effector and memory immune responses induced by BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A (B-C-M), were evaluated to identify immune correlates of protection in mice. This protective regime induced strong Ag85A-specific cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, both in the systemic and pulmonary compartments. Lung parenchymal CXCR3+ KLRG1- Ag85A-specific memory CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in B-C-M compared to BCG immunised mice at 4, 8 and 20 weeks post vaccination, but the number of these cells decreased at the latter time point.

Systemic efforts to address the use of firearms in suicide had been largely evaded. In June 2020, the White House published the Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End the National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) task force report, which verified the link between, and the need to address, at-risk veterans and their access to firearms. This paper reviews the literature on the intersection of veterans, firearms, and suicide, then explores existing VA prevention initiatives aimed at reducing at-risk veterans' access to lethal means and offers policy recommendations to expand efforts in the context of the PREVENTS Roadmap. Observations The PREVENTS report recommends widespread distribution of safety education materials that encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily transfer or store their guns safely and the expansion of free or affordable options for storing weapons. Recommended policy actions to accomplish this goal include delaying access to firearms for at-risk veterans, facilitating temporary storage out of the home, improving in-home safe storage options, requiring that health care providers who care for high-risk veterans are trained in lethal means safety counseling, and creating campaigns to shift cultural norms for firearms' storage during crises. Conclusions Suicide prevention requires a multimodal approach, and attention to firearms access must become a more salient component. The high rate of veteran suicides involving firearms requires far-reaching interventions at societal, institutional, community, family, and individual levels.","Lemle, Russell B","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",https://doi.org/10.12788/fp.0041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029068/,139

The development of these and other psychiatric disorders may be related to changes in immune, endocrine, autonomic/physiological, cognitive, and affective processes induced by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, many of these same changes can be triggered by psychosocial stressors such as social isolation and rejection, which have become increasingly common due to public policies aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to shed light on these issues by describing how viral infections and stress affect mental health. First, we describe the multi-level mechanisms linking viral infection and life stress exposure with risk for psychopathology. Then, we summarize how resilience can be enhanced by targeting vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and targeting lifestyle factors, such as exercise. With these biopsychosocial insights in mind, researchers and healthcare professionals will be better equipped to reduce risk for psychopathology and increase resilience during this challenging pandemic period and beyond.","Dedoncker, Josefien; Vanderhasselt, Marie-Anne; Ottaviani, Cristina; Slavich, George M",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582230/,139

We aimed to study whether using ACEIs or ARBs had protective effects for community acquired pneumonia. METHODS This database cohort study was conducted retrospectively in Taiwan. The hypertensive patients were the target population of this study. Patients with ARB use were defined as our first study cohort. The second study cohort comprised patients who used ACEI. Propensity-score matching at 1:1 was used between ARB users and non-ARB users. We recruited 67 944 participants for the ARB study and 58 062 participants for the ACEI study. The same matching was also performed between ACEI users and non-ACEI users. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to analyze the risk of the outcome of viral pneumonia. RESULTS The hazard ratio of community acquired pneumonia for ARB users relative to non-ARB users was 0.33. The hazard ratio of community acquired pneumonia was 0.71 times in ACEI users compared with ACEI nonusers. In stratification analysis, both ARB and ACEI both exhibited a protective effect for community acquired pneumonia in each age and sex group. In the analysis of the effects of therapy duration, patients using ARB for fewer than 100 days exhibited a greater reduction in the risk of community acquired pneumonia (adjusted HR = 0.58) compared with the non-ARB cohort. For the ACEI study, patients who used ACEI for 121 to 450 days were more likely to exhibit reduced risks of community acquired pneumonia (adjusted HR = 0.5). CONCLUSION Both ACEI and ARB uses were associated with decreased risk of community acquired pneumonia infection.","Lin, Shih-Yi; Chang, Shih-Sheng; Lin, Cheng-Li; Lin, Cheng-Chieh; Hsu, Wu-Huei; Chou, Chia-Hui; Chi, Chih-Yu; Lin, Chia-Der; Tu, Chih-Yen; Hsu, Chung-Y; Kao, Chia-Hung",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107133/,139

For some women this decision-making can be associated with anxiety. AIM To provide rich, surface level descriptions by exploring women's experiences of their involvement in decision-making during a subsequent pregnancy after a previous caesarean birth. METHODS A descriptive qualitative study was performed between May 2018 and February 2019 using Braun and Clarke's six steps guided analysis. Pregnant women with a previous caesarean birth, receiving antenatal care at a tertiary maternity hospital in Western Australia, and self-reported low to moderate levels of anxiety were invited to participate in a telephone interview. FINDINGS Women's (n = 17) experiences revealed four themes: 1) Learning from past experiences (two sub-themes loss of control and coming to terms), 2) Claiming ownership in decisions (two sub-themes challenging professional judgement and prioritising her needs, wishes and preferences), 3) Being empowered (three sub-themes getting a full picture, speaking out, and not just the baby or a number), 4) Moving forward (two sub-themes building trust in health professionals and establishing guardrails to minimise loss of control). DISCUSSION Women's experiences around decision-making in a subsequent pregnancy can vary according to whether their fears and anxieties are acknowledged and addressed. Women who are informed, and receive support and respect are empowered to move forward. CONCLUSION Continuity of care may provide women with more opportunities to build trusting relationships with clinicians and be truly known as an individual with unique preferences and desires.","Chan, Maria Hakyung; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Lewis, Lucy",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004288/,139
140245,Management of COVID-19 Virus Infection by Convalescent Plasma.,2020-05-17,"BACKGROUND Blood-brain barrier impairment is a major indicator of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Studies showed that endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) transplantation promoted angiogenesis and improved function recovery after hind limb ischemia in diabetic mice. The effect of EPC transplantation on blood-brain barrier integrity after cerebral ischemia in diabetic animals is unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of EPC transplantation on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier after cerebral ischemia in diabetic mice. METHODS EPCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and characterized by flow cytometry and immunostaining. Diabetes was induced in adult male C57BL/6 mice by a single injection of streptozotocin at 4 weeks before surgery. Diabetic mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery and received 1 × 106 EPCs transplantation immediately after reperfusion. Brain infarct volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, tight junction protein expression, and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mRNA level were examined after treatment. RESULTS We demonstrated that neurological deficits were attenuated and brain infarct volume was reduced in EPC-transplanted diabetic mice after transient cerebral ischemia compared to the controls (p < 0.05). Blood-brain barrier leakage and tight junction protein degradation were reduced in EPC-transplanted mice (p <0.05). EPCs upregulated HIF-1α expression while HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478 abolished the beneficial effect of EPCs. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that EPCs protected blood-brain barrier integrity after focal ischemia in diabetic mice through upregulation of HIF-1α signaling.","Geng, Jieli; Wang, Liping; Qu, Meijie; Song, Yaying; Lin, Xiaojie; Chen, Yajing; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Chen, Shengdi; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-017-0605-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697748/,139

This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The χ2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference. Electronic clinic utilization patterns also demonstrate racial disparities. Successful electronic clinic program implementation requires understanding the factors that contribute to failed visits to address them and improve access.","Kemp, Michael T; Williams, Aaron M; Sharma, Sriganesh B; Biesterveld, Ben E; Wakam, Glenn K; Matusko, Niki; Wilson, Jesse K; Cohen, Mark S; Alam, Hasan B",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.06.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782115/,139

MATERIAL AND METHOD Altogether 27 907 patients registered in the Norwegian Arthritis Registry (NorArthritis) were linked to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases and the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry in order to find the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020, and the proportion of patients who were hospitalised. A standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated by comparing with sex and age-specific incidence in the general population. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate whether diagnosis, age, sex, disease activity, comorbidity or drug therapy had any bearing on the incidence. RESULTS A total of 185 of the patients in NorArthritis tested positive for COVID-19, of whom 10 % were hospitalised. The incidence was lower than in the general population (SIR 0.84; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.72-0.97, P = 0.02). Young age and low disease activity were associated with higher incidence of infection. The other factors had no significant effect. INTERPRETATION The fact that the incidence of COVID-19 was lower than in the general population, and that within the group it was lower in those with moderate/high disease activity and greater age, is most likely attributable to patients of advanced age with chronic active disease having protected themselves against infection to a greater degree.","Nystad, Tone Wikene; Hufthammer, Karl Ove; Buanes, Eirik Alnes; Bryne, Kjartan; Fevang, Bjørg-Tilde Svanes","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.21.0362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641647/,139

I study a community of parents and practitioners who contend that autism spectrum disorder is caused by harmful environmental exposures - notably, early childhood vaccinations - and that there are worthwhile alternative or experimental treatments. Despite objections from dominant experts, these actors maintain their disputed ideas. This study identifies a set of strategies that help maintain internal legitimacy. In particular, actors protect internal legitimacy through professional alignment and contrastive boundary work. Professional alignment mobilizes resemblances to conventional counterparts (i.e. mainstream doctors) to defend unorthodox practices. Meanwhile, contrastive boundary-work performances convey the defining values and strengths that actors associate with their knowledge community and concomitantly, the weaknesses they ascribe to competing groups. Through these activities, actors respond to perceived threats and construct a distinct group identity anchored in shared knowledge, ways of knowing and practice.","Tan, Catherine D",Social studies of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312721992543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618580/,139

COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19.

143211,Utilizing type I interferon expression in the identification of antiphospholipid syndrome subsets.,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND Many studies have failed to demonstrate significant differences between single- and two-staged approaches for the management of choledocholithiasis with concomitant gallstones in terms of post-operative morbidity. However, none of these studies paid specific attention to the differences between the methods of accessing the bile duct during laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of transcystic versus transductal laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) from our experience of over four hundred cases. METHODS Retrospective review of 416 consecutive patients who underwent LCBDE at a single-centre between 1998 and 2018 was performed. Data collected included pre-operative demographic information, medical co-morbidity, pre-operative investigations, intra-operative findings (including negative choledochoscopy rates, use of holmium laser lithotripsy and operative time) and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS Transductal LCBDE via choledochotomy was achieved in 242 patients (58.2%), whereas 174 patients (41.8%) underwent transcystic LCBDE. Stone clearance rates, conversion to open surgery and mortality were similar between the two groups. Overall morbidity as well as minor and major post-operative complications were significantly higher in the transductal group. The main surgery-related complications were bile leak (5.8% vs 1.1%, p = 0.0181) and pancreatitis (7.4% vs 0.6%, p = 0.0005). Median length of post-operative stay was also significantly greater in the transductal group. CONCLUSION This study represents the largest single study to date comparing outcomes from transcystic and transductal LCBDE. Where possibly, the transcystic route should be used for LCBDE and this approach can be augmented with various techniques to increase successful stone clearance and reduce the need for choledochotomy.","Navaratne, Lalin; Martinez Isla, Alberto",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07522-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246237/,139

With tens of thousands of adults and children in more than 200 immigration detention centers across the United States, immigration detention centers are likely to experience COVID-19 outbreaks and add substantially to the population of those infected.Despite compelling evidence indicating a heightened risk of infection among detainees, state and federal governments have done little to protect the health of detained im-migrants. An evidence-based public health framework must guide the COVID-19 response in immigration detention centers.We draw on the hierarchy of controls framework to demonstrate how immigration detention centers are failing to implement even the least effective control strategies. Drawing on this framework and recent legal and medical advocacy efforts, we argue that safely releasing detainees from immigration detention centers into their communities is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in immigration detention settings. Failure to do so will result in infection and death among those detained and deepen existing health and social inequities. (Am J Public Health.

METHODS The study sample consisted of children who are treated in the pediatric intensive care unit, University of Istanbul Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Hospital. A total of 60 children who met the criteria of the sample group were included in the study. The children were given bed bathing with plain warm water of 32°C to 38°C on 3 different days. The vital signs and oxygen saturation values of the children were measured before bathing, just after bathing, and 30 minutes after bathing them. RESULTS Most of the children (65%) were on mechanical ventilation because of respiratory system diseases; 91.7% of them were connected to mechanical ventilation with endotracheal tube. The first bed bathing of children was given mean of 1.54 ± 3.57 days after their hospitalization, and bathing durations were mean of 18.3 minutes. The vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body temperature) were compared before and after bed bathing, and it was observed that the values before bathing, just after bathing, and 30 minutes after bathing had advanced level of difference (P < .001). The lowest values of all signs except body temperature were obtained 30 minutes after bed bathing. When oxygen saturation measurement values before bathing (94.5%) and after bathing were compared, it was found that the highest values (97.3%) were obtained 30 minutes after bed bathing. CONCLUSION The bed bathing positively affected the vital signs and oxygen saturation values in intubated children connected to the mechanical ventilation. Yet, there is still a need for more research to test the effects of bed bathing on respiratory and circulatory function.","Kzl, Hamiyet; Şendir, Merdiye",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcc.0000000000000312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063523/,139

We assessed, in adult DMD with home mechanical ventilation (HMV) and cough assist device, its prevalence and the relationships with respiratory muscle strength and long-term respiratory prognosis. We reviewed the patients (n = 117, age 18-39 years [median 24]), followed in a reference center, from 2006 to 2015, to obtain clinical baseline, nutritional status, vital capacity (VC), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). The median body mass index (BMI) was low (15.6 kg/m²). Included patients had severe restrictive respiratory function with a median VC of 10.5% [7-17] of the predicted value. All patients were on HMV. Prevalence of malnutrition, swallowing disorders, and gastrostomy were respectively 62%, 34%, and 11%. BMI and serum albumin level were significantly associated with MIP, MEP, and VC. The 1-year/5-years cumulative incidences of respiratory events (pulmonary sepsis and acute respiratory distress) were, respectively, 20.7%/44.5%. Using univariate analysis, predictive factors for respiratory events were swallowing disorders (p = .001), transthyretinemia (p = .034), MIP (p = .039), and MEP (p = .03) but not BMI or albuminemia. Using multivariate analysis, only swallowing disorders remained significantly associated with respiratory events (OR = 4.2, IC 95% 1.31-12.2, p = .01). In conclusion, this study highlights the interrelationships between nutritional intake, swallowing function, airway clearance, and respiratory function in adult DMD.

Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.","Lyu, Jinglu; Miao, Tianyu; Dong, Jiajia; Cao, Ranran; Li, Yan; Chen, Qianming",Medical hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32460207/,139

At T4, all patients showed a significant reduction of PASI; MicroV showed reduction in vascularisation of responsive plaques in 85% of cases, only in 15%, the vascularisation degree remained stable; and SWE values of target plaques were significantly lower compared with T0. Only in 7.7%, there was a relapse at T12. CONCLUSIONS Calcipotriol+betamethasone foam is a very effective topical treatment in a short-medium term follow-up in patients with PsO. MicroV and SWE evaluate response to treatment (in term of plaque vascularisation and stiffness), so they could represent promising early indicators of therapeutic response and help the physician to establish a better clinical-therapeutic management of patients with PsO.","Guazzaroni, Manlio; Ferrari, Donatella; Lamacchia, Feliciana; Marisi, Vanessa; Tatulli, Doriana; Marsico, Salvatore; Orlacchio, Antonio; Floris, Roberto; Bianchi, Luca; Dattola, Annunziata",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646970/,139

146998,Prevention and control of COVID-19 in the penitentiary of Florence.,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a safe procedure with variable outcomes and large standard deviations. LAGB with gastric plication (LAGBP) is a new restrictive procedure that combines the lap band with gastric plication. This procedure, with its mechanism being below the band anatomically, should augment the weaknesses of the lap band: slips and inadequate weight loss. OBJECTIVE Compare the weight loss results and complication rates between the LAGB and LAGBP. SETTING Private practice. METHODS Data was analyzed data from 120 patients retrospectively from 2 surgeons at a single private institution. Seventy-six patients underwent LAGB, and 44 other patients underwent LAGBP between February 2011 and July 2013. All 120 patients are beyond the 1-year postoperative mark and 110 patients are beyond the 2-year postoperative mark. A subset analysis was performed comparing data from both procedures to evaluate weight loss and complications. RESULTS There were no significant differences between preoperative age, weight, and body mass index between the patients who underwent either procedure. We had 47.4% and 52.3% follow-up at 1 year for LAGB and LAGBP, respectively, with 91.5% and 92.3% follow-up at 2 year for LAGB and LAGBP, respectively. Complications were low with LAGBP; however, it was not statistically significant (P = .54). The LAGBP had a greater percent excess weight loss, percent total weight loss, and percent excess body mass index lost compared with the LAGB at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, and these differences were statistically significant. Mean percent excess weight loss for LAGB and LAGBP was 28.3% and 34.5% (P<.05) at 1 year and 32.1% and 39.2% (P<.05) at 2 years, respectively. CONCLUSION LAGBP is a safe, feasible, and reproducible bariatric procedure. The LAGBP performs significantly better than the LAGB for weight loss. The complication and revision rates were slightly higher with LAGB than LAGBP. However, it was not statistically significant.","Surve, Amit; Zaveri, Hinali; Cottam, Daniel; Richards, Christina; Cottam, Samuel; Cottam, Austin",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2016.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865812/,139

To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental distress in US adults.Methods. Participants were 5065 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet panel representative of the US adult population. The main exposure was survey completion date (March 10-16, 2020). The outcome was mental distress measured via the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire.Results. Among states with 50 or more COVID-19 cases as of March 10, each additional day was significantly associated with an 11% increase in the odds of moving up a category of distress (odds ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.01, 1.21; P = .02). Perceptions about the likelihood of getting infected, death from the virus, and steps taken to avoid infecting others were associated with increased mental distress in the model that included all states. Individuals with higher consumption of alcohol or cannabis or with history of depressive symptoms were at significantly higher risk for mental distress.Conclusions. These data suggest that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mental distress may continue to increase and should be regularly monitored. Specific populations are at high risk for mental distress, particularly those with preexisting depressive symptoms. (Am J Public Health.

The model allows for the susceptibles to the unconscious and conscious susceptible compartment. First, mathematical analyses establish that the global dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 infectious disease are completely determined by the basic reproduction number R0. If R0 ≤ 1, then the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. If R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Second, the unknown parameters of model are estimated by the MCMC algorithm on the basis of the total confirmed new cases from February 1, 2020 to March 23, 2020 in the UK. We also estimate that the basic reproduction number is R0 = 4.2816(95%CI: (3.8882, 4.6750)). Without the most restrictive measures, we forecast that the COVID-19 epidemic will peak on June 2 (95%CI: (May 23, June 13)) (Figure 3a) and the number of infected individuals is more than 70% of UK population. In order to determine the key parameters of the model, sensitivity analysis are also explored. Finally, our results show reducing contact is effective against the spread of the disease. We suggest that the stringent containment strategies should be adopted in the UK.","Feng, Li-Xiang; Jing, Shuang-Lin; Hu, Shi-Ke; Wang, De-Fen; Huo, Hai-Feng",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987547/,139
147334,The semiotics of distal thrombectomy: towards a TICI score for the target vessel.,2019,"BACKGROUND Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) can help providers deliver better quality care. We aimed to understand recent trends in use of CPOE by health system-affiliated ambulatory clinics. METHODS We analyzed longitudinal data (2014-2016) for 19,109 ambulatory clinics that participated in all 3 years of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics survey to assess use of CPOE and identify characteristics of clinics associated with CPOE use. We calculated descriptive statistics to examine overall trends in use, location of order entry (bedside vs. clinical station), and system-level use CPOE across all clinics. We used linear probability models to explore the association between clinic characteristics (practice size, practice type, and health system type) and two outcomes of interest: CPOE use at any point between 2014 and 2016, and CPOE use beginning in 2015 or 2016. RESULTS Between 2014 and 2016, use of CPOE increased more than 9 percentage points from 58 to 67%. Larger clinics and those affiliated with multi-hospital health systems were more likely to have reported use of CPOE. We found no difference in CPOE use by primary care versus specialty care clinics. When used, most clinics reported using CPOE for most or all of their orders. Health systems that used CPOE usually did so for all system-affiliated clinics. CONCLUSIONS Small practice size or not being part of a multi-hospital system are associated with lower use of CPOE between 2014 and 2016. Less than optimal use in these environments may be harming patient outcomes.","Fischer, Shira H; Rudin, Robert S; Shi, Yunfeng; Shekelle, Paul; Amill-Rosario, Alejandro; Scanlon, Dennis; Damberg, Cheryl L",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05679-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894110/,139

147524,Negative Susceptibility Vessel Sign and Underlying Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis in Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion.,2015,"A series of Zr-25Ti-xMo (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 wt %) as-cast alloys were designed to advance a new-brand Zr-based alloy with low Young's elastic, moderate compression strength, superior corrosion resistance and good wear behavior for the application of dental implant materials. In the present study, the microstructures of the alloys were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microhardness and uniaxial compression measurement were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the alloys. The electrochemical behaviors of the alloys was investigated in artificial saliva solution. The friction and wear performances of the Zr-25Ti-xMo alloys were examined by pin-on-disk under the load of 15 N. The results shows that the crystalline structure transforms from hexagonal close-pack (α phase, x = 0 wt %) to body-centered cubic structure (β phase, 5 ≤ x ≤ 12.5 wt %) through a α + β dual-phase region (x = 2.5 wt %). They exhibits excellent mechanical properties with low elastic modulus (from 17.7 to 24.4 GPa) and moderate compression strength (from 1154.4 to 1310.8 MPa). The Zr-25Ti-xMo alloys possess good corrosion resistance due to the formation of a protective passive film consisting mainly of ZrO2, TiO2 and minor MoO3. Especially, the polarization curves demonstrates that the Zr-25Ti-7.5Mo alloy has a wider passive region than the other five alloys and it possesses the lower corrosion current density and corrosion rate. Furthermore, this alloy exhibits good abrasion resistance with the lowest coefficients of friction and volume wear loss. Thus, the Zr-25Ti-7.5Mo alloy has a combination of excellent mechanical properties such as low elastic modulus, moderate yield strength and the compression strength, good electrochemical stability and well wear resistance, it is considered a promising candidate for orthopedic materials as dental implant.","Wei, Chengxia; Luo, Liying; Wu, Zhangxi; Zhang, Jiakai; Su, Shi; Zhan, Yongzhong",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.104017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818772/,139
147534,Minor Stroke Syndromes in Large-Vessel Occlusions: Mechanical Thrombectomy or Thrombolysis Only?,2017,"Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Ag) that can be performed at point-of-care (POC) can supplement molecular testing and help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts (MA) using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.Methods: Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (≤ 18 years) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess inter-operator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.Results: Of 2482 participants, 1380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. 974/1380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0- 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (98.6-100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms, and 84.6% (65.1-95.6) sensitivity and 100% (94.5-100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (56.6-81.6) and 99.6% (98.9-99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children were 65.4% (55.6-74.4) and 99.0% (98.0-99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (Ct) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n=292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with Ct ≤25, 95.8% with ≤30, and 81.2% with ≤35. Twelve false positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2308 tests) were observed; in all twelve, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal, and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Inter-operator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2230/2230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms ≤7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer's recommended range (46-58.5°F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%.Conclusions: BinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with Ct ≤ 30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for ≤7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent inter-operator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour. Careful attention to temperature is critical.","Pollock, Nira R; Jacobs, Jesica R; Tran, Kristine; Cranston, Amber E; Smith, Sita; O'Kane, Claire Y; Roady, Tyler J; Moran, Anne; Scarry, Alison; Carroll, Melissa; Volinsky, Leila; Perez, Gloria; Patel, Pinal; Gabriel, Stacey; Lennon, Niall J; Madoff, Lawrence C; Brown, Catherine; Smole, Sandra C",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00083-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622768/,139

METHODS Counts of the number of patients filling and number of providers prescribing buprenorphine were calculated for each weekday between November 4, 2019 and May 12, 2020. The change in daily patients and prescribers between March 2, 2020 and May 12, 2020, was modeled as a change in slope compared to the baseline period using autoregressive, interrupted time series regression. RESULTS The rate of change of daily buprenorphine prescriptions (β = -1.75, 95% CI = -5.8-2.34) and prescribers (β = -0.32, 95% CI = -1.47-0.82) declined insignificantly during the COVID-19 period compared to the baseline. CONCLUSIONS Despite a 57% decline in ambulatory care utilization in the south-central US during March and April of 2020, health services utilization related to buprenorphine in Texas remained robust. Protecting access to buprenorphine as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold will require intensive efforts from clinicians and policy makers alike. While the presented results are promising, researchers must continue monitoring and exploring the clinical and humanistic impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of substance use disorders.","Thornton, James Douglas; Varisco, Tyler J; Bapat, Shweta S; Downs, Callie G; Shen, Chan",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031213/,139

Methods Eighty patients scheduled for septorhinoplasty under general anaesthesia with controlled hypotension were randomised into two groups: minimal-flow (MF) or high-flow (HF). Both groups received desflurane anaesthesia to maintain bispectral index values at 40%-50% and 0.25-0.5 μg kg-1 min-1 i.v. remifentanyl infusion to maintain mean arterial blood pressure between 55 and 65 mmHg. The MF group received 5 L min-1 of fresh gas flow for the first 10 mins then the gas flow was reduced 0.4 L min-1. The HF group received 2 L min-1 of fresh gas flow throughout. Haemodynamic parameters and cerebral oxygen saturation were measured. Results There were no statistical differences in demographic variables, duration of anaesthesia and surgery, time to extubation and proceeding to an Aldrete score of 9. There were no statistical differences in haemodynamic parameters, end-tidal CO2 and cerebral oxygen saturation. The amount of desflurane used in the MF group was significantly lower than that used in the HF group (30.5±9.8 mL vs. 48.5±12.1 mL; p<0.05). Conclusion MF and HF anaesthesia did not lead to any difference in cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty with controlled hypotension. MF anaesthesia may thus be used as safely as HF anaesthesia is.","Kazancıoğlu, Leyla; Batçık, Şule; Erdivanlı, Başar; Şen, Ahmet; Dursun, Engin",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,https://doi.org/10.5152/tjar.2018.36786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080947/,139
148275,"Authors' reply to Soljak, Robson and colleagues, and Kelly.",2021-01-22,"Recurrent mentions of a forensic science crisis are reported in the literature. Some 15 years ago, the discussion was focused on the backlog problem. Other issues have been regularly debated since then, including the risk of error, need for independence, importance and risk of contextualisation, increasing fragmentation into separate processes and specialisations. Proposed solutions to solve one problem often led to other issues in other parts of the process. This paper attempts to address the apparent crisis using a different perspective, through a comparison with established disciplines, namely material science, medicine and historical science. The comparison with material science shows that, despite the varied organisational and legal models and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, a common element to all forensic science endeavours exists: the trace. A greater focus on the trace might thus help the development of a holistic approach in forensic science. The comparison with medicine demonstrates that, through the overall process, the main risk shifts from the risk to overlook important hypotheses or traces at the beginning of the process (e.g. problems in the detection of traces/symptoms and formulation of hypotheses) to the risk of supporting the wrong hypothesis at the end of the process (e.g. erroneous test of the hypotheses/diagnostic). Further, in medicine, symptoms are rarely evaluated in isolation, while traces are often evaluated separately. By analogy, epidemiology illustrates forensic science's critical role in preventing crime through forensic intelligence, supporting a more extensive and more collaborative application of forensic science in security issues. The comparison with historical science also indicates that a single trace (i.e. the observed effect) is rarely sufficient to reason on its cause. Retrodiction (abduction) is proposed as an alternative reasoning approach to reconstruct events from the past based on signs uncovered in the present. Finally, the impact of science in investigating crimes is presented as an evolving process. A new trace or information can bring an entirely different light on the reconstruction of past events or prevention of future issues. Thus, issues or challenges in the first stages of the process (i.e., crime scene investigation) should be addressed in priority for subsequent stages to function correctly.","Weyermann, Céline; Roux, Claude",Forensic science international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.110779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887571/,139

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether dermoscopic features of psoriatic plaques differ with anatomic location or any clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical evaluation and videodermoscopy of psoriatic plaques located on the face, chest, abdomen, forearms, lower legs, back, and scalp were performed in 50 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. RESULTS A total of 306 plaques were evaluated. Videodermoscopy with a 20-fold magnification revealed red dots and globules in 306/306 (100%) plaques, arranged in diffuse (170/306, 56%), patchy (117/306, 38%), or polygonal (19/306, 6%) pattern. A 70 fold magnification of these vessels revealed the presence of bushy vessels (213/306, 70%) and twisted loops (107/306, 35%), with the latter occurring more commonly on the scalp and face (P < .001). In lesions lasting less or equal 5 weeks on forearms and scalp, patchy distribution of the scale predominated, whereas in older lesions-diffuse type (forearm P = .005, scalp P = .017). Diffuse distribution of the scale in lesions located on the face was more common in women, than men (P = .003).

This study aimed to characterize the middle ear microbiota in children with otitis media with effusion and establish whether a correlation exists between the middle ear and adenoid microbiota. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, controlled study. METHODS Middle ear aspirates adenoid pad swabs were collected from 23 children undergoing ventilation tube insertion. Adenoid swabs from patients without ear disease were controls. Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. RESULTS Thirty-five middle ear samples were collected. The middle ear effusion microbiota was dominated by Alloiococcus otitidis (23% mean relative abundance), Haemophilus (22%), Moraxella (5%), and Streptococcus (5%). Alloiococcus shared an inverse correlation with Haemophilus (P = .049) and was found in greater relative abundance in unilateral effusion (P = .004). The microbiota of bilateral effusions from the same patient were similar (P < .001). However, the otitis media with effusion microbiota were found to be dissimilar to that of the adenoid (P = .01), whereas the adenoid microbiota of otitis media with effusion and control patients were similar (P > .05) (permutational multivariate analysis of the variance). CONCLUSIONS Dissimilarities between the local microbiota of the adenoid and the middle ear question the theory that the adenoid pad is a significant reservoir to the middle ear in children with otitis media with effusion. A otitidis had the greatest cumulative relative abundance, particularly in unilateral effusions, and shares an inverse correlation with the relative abundance of Haemophilus.

Only women presenting with an acute coronary syndrome were included. Study population was categorized according to presentation with unstable angina (UA) vs acute MI. Acute MI included non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) or ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). Interventions Randomization to early- (sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents) vs new-generation (everolimus-, zotarolimus-, or biolimus-eluting stents) DES. Main Outcomes and Measures Composite of death, MI or target lesion revascularization, and definite or probable stent thrombosis at 3-year follow-up. Results Overall, the mean age of participants was 66.8 years. Of 11 577 women included in the pooled data set, 4373 (37.8%) had an acute coronary syndrome as clinical presentation. Of these 4373 women, 2176 (49.8%) presented with an acute MI. In women with acute MI, new-generation DES were associated with lower risk of death, MI or target lesion revascularization (14.9% vs 18.4%; absolute risk difference, -3.5%; number needed to treat [NNT], 29; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99), and definite or probable stent thrombosis (1.4% vs 4.0%; absolute risk difference, -2.6%; NNT, 46; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69) without evidence of interaction for both end points compared with women without acute MI (P for interaction = .59 and P for interaction = .31, respectively). A graded absolute benefit with use of new-generation DES was observed in the transition from UA, to NSTEMI, and to STEMI (for death, MI, or target lesion revascularization: UA, -0.5% [NNT, 222]; NSTEMI, -3.1% [NNT, 33]; STEMI, -4.0% [NNT, 25] and for definite or probable ST: UA, -0.4% [NNT, 278]; NSTEMI, -2.2% [NNT, 46]; STEMI, -4.0% [NNT, 25]). Conclusions and Relevance New-generation DES are associated with consistent and durable benefits over 3 years in women presenting with acute MI. The magnitude of these benefits appeared to be greater per increase in severity of acute coronary syndrome.","Giustino, Gennaro; Harari, Rafael; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Stone, Gregg W; Leon, Martin B; Windecker, Stephan; Serruys, Patrick W; Kastrati, Adnan; Von Birgelen, Clemens; Kimura, Takeshi; Stefanini, Giulio G; Dangas, George D; Wijns, William; Steg, P Gabriel; Morice, Marie-Claude; Camenzind, Edoardo; Weisz, Giora; Smits, Pieter C; Sorrentino, Sabato; Sharma, Madhav; Farhan, Serdar; Faggioni, Michela; Kandzari, David; Galatius, Soren; Jeger, Raban V; Valgimigli, Marco; Itchhaporia, Dipti; Mehta, Laxmi; Kim, Hyo-Soo; Chieffo, Alaide; Mehran, Roxana",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2017.1978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28658478/,139

149845,A high-throughput multiplexed microfluidic device for COVID-19 serology assays.,2020-12-15,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. Therefore, it is critically important to identify new useful markers that can be easily obtained in routine practice. Inflammation is a crucial issue in the pathogenesis and development of cancer. AIM To evaluate the prognostic value of absolute monocyte count, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), the combination of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR-PLR), and combined platelet and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLT-NLR) in peripheral blood samples of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 160 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery, and 42 healthy controls. The status of absolute monocyte count, MLR, NLR-PLR and PLT-NLR was calculated on the basis of blood samples obtained before and after surgery. Haematologic factors were examined in correlation with the type of tumour growth, tumour size, histological type, percentage of mucinous component, grade of malignancy, Tumour-Node-Metastasis stage, venous, lymphatic and perineural invasion of cancer cells, status of lymph node invasion and the presence of cancer cell deposits. The Kaplan-Meier method and the long-rank test were used to compare survival curves. To determine independent prognostic factors, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied. RESULTS The PLT-NLR status was correlated with tumour size and the presence of perineural invasion (P = 0.015; P = -0.174, P = 0.037). Moreover, high NLR-PLR and PLR-NLR ratios in the blood samples obtained after surgery were positively associated with histological type of cancer and percentage of the mucinous component (NLR-PLR: P = 0.002; P = 0.009; PLR-NLR status: P = 0.002; P = 0.007). The analysis of 5-year disease-free survival showed that the MLR of whole blood obtained after surgery [HR = 2.903, 95%CI: (1.368-6.158), P = 0.005] and the status of lymph node metastasis [HR = 0.813, 95%CI: (0.653-1.013), P = 0.050] were independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. CONCLUSION The postoperative MLR in whole blood samples can be used as an independent prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer.","Jakubowska, Katarzyna; Koda, Mariusz; Grudzińska, Małgorzata; Kańczuga-Koda, Luiza; Famulski, Waldemar",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884222/,139
149961,Antiplatelet drug resistance did not increase the thromboembolic events after stent-assisted coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysm: a single center experience of 99 cases.,2017,"BACKGROUND Changes in hepatosplanchnic lactate exchange are likely to contribute to hyperlactatemia in sepsis. We hypothesized that septic and cardiogenic shock have different effects on hepatosplanchnic lactate exchange and its contribution to hyperlactatemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS 24 anesthetized pigs were randomized to fecal peritonitis (P), cardiac tamponade (CT), and to controls (n = 8 per group). Oxygen transport and lactate exchange were calculated during 24 hours. RESULTS While hepatic lactate influx increased in P and in CT, hepatic lactate uptake remained unchanged in P and decreased in CT. Hepatic lactate efflux contributed 20% (P) and 33% (CT), respectively, to whole body venous efflux. Despite maintained hepatic arterial blood flow, hepatic oxygen extraction did not increase in CT. CONCLUSIONS Whole body venous lactate efflux is of similar magnitude in hyperdynamic sepsis and in cardiogenic shock. Although jejunal mucosal pCO2 gradients are increased, enhanced lactate production from other tissues is more relevant to the increased arterial lactate. Nevertheless, the liver fails to increase hepatic lactate extraction in response to rising hepatic lactate influx, despite maintained hepatic oxygen consumption. In cardiac tamponade, regional, extrasplanchnic lactate production is accompanied by hepatic failure to increase oxygen extraction and net hepatic lactate output, despite maintained hepatic arterial perfusion.","Gorrasi, José; Eleftheriadis, Anestis; Takala, Jukka; Brandt, Sebastian; Djafarzadeh, Siamak; Bruegger, Lukas E; Bracht, Hendrik; Jakob, Stephan M",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/251084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24228242/,139
150022,Successful Mechanical Thrombectomy for Subocclusive Thrombus at the Origin of Lenticulostriate Artery.,2020,"OBJECTIVE We examine how human operators adjust their trust in automation as a result of their moment-to-moment interaction with automation. BACKGROUND Most existing studies measured trust by administering questionnaires at the end of an experiment. Only a limited number of studies viewed trust as a dynamic variable that can strengthen or decay over time. METHOD Seventy-five participants took part in an aided memory recognition task. In the task, participants viewed a series of images and later on performed 40 trials of the recognition task to identify a target image when it was presented with a distractor. In each trial, participants performed the initial recognition by themselves, received a recommendation from an automated decision aid, and performed the final recognition. After each trial, participants reported their trust on a visual analog scale. RESULTS Outcome bias and contrast effect significantly influence human operators' trust adjustments. An automation failure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome is undesirable, and a marginally larger trust decrement if the human operator succeeds the task by him/herself. An automation success engenders a greater trust increment if the human operator fails the task. Additionally, automation failures have a larger effect on trust adjustment than automation successes. CONCLUSION Human operators adjust their trust in automation as a result of their moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Their trust adjustments are significantly influenced by decision-making heuristics/biases. APPLICATION Understanding the trust adjustment process enables accurate prediction of the operators' moment-to-moment trust in automation and informs the design of trust-aware adaptive automation.","Jessie Yang, X; Schemanske, Christopher; Searle, Christine",Human factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/00187208211034716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459266/,139

150880,Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation and Syndecan-1 Shedding are Increased after Trauma.,2021-01-28,"Current immunosuppression regimens in organ transplantation primarily inhibit T cells. However, T cells are also critical in protective immunity, especially in immune-compromised patients. In this study, we examined the association of T cell dysfunction, as marked by expression of T cell exhaustion molecules, and posttransplant infections in a cohort of liver transplant patients. We focused on Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and T cell Ig- and mucin-domain molecule 3 (Tim-3), which are potent co-inhibitory receptors, and their persistent expression often leads to T cell dysfunction and compromised protective immunity. We found that patients with the highest expression of PD-1 +Tim-3+ T cells in the memory compartment before transplantation had increased incidence of infections after liver transplantation, especially within the first 90 days. Longitudinal analysis in the first year showed a strong association between variability of PD-1 and Tim-3 expression by T cells and infectious episodes in transplant patients. Furthermore, T cells that expressed PD-1 and Tim-3 had a significantly reduced capacity in producing interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro, and this reduced IFN-γ production could be partially reversed by blocking PD-1 and Tim-3. Interestingly, the percentage of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in liver transplant patients was stable in the study period. We concluded that the functional status of T cells before and after liver transplantation, as shown by PD-1 and Tim-3 expression, may be valuable in prognosis and management of posttransplant infections.","Mysore, Krupa R; Ghobrial, Rafik M; Kannanganat, Sunil; Minze, Laurie J; Graviss, Edward A; Nguyen, Duc T; Perez, Katherine K; Li, Xian C",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.14546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29068155/,139
151046,ASL MRI and 18F-FDG-PET in autoimmune limbic encephalitis: clues from two paradigmatic cases.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND The use of energy-based tissue-sealing and cutting instruments is becoming more and more popular in visceral, urological, and gynecological surgery. For their safe and efficacious use in clinical practice, such instruments have to reliably seal vessels with a minimal sealing failure rate, cause minimal thermal damage to adjacent tissue, and have good cutting qualities. METHODS The efficacy and safety of the novel energy-based instrument for dissection, hemostasis and cutting (BiCision(®), ERBE) was compared to a commercially available device (EnSeal(®), Ethicon Endo-Surgery). We investigated vessel-sealing reliability (success rate), sealing quality and sealing time, lateral thermal damage cutting quality, tissue sticking to the instrument, burst pressure and delayed complications in an acute and chronic pig model after splenectomy, small bowel resection, nephrectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, and sealing of peripheral vessels. RESULTS For all parameters investigated, BiCision(®) was at least equivalent to EnSeal(®). BiCision(®) was even superior to EnSeal(®) with respect to the burst pressure in arteries (p = 0.044) and veins (p = 0.023) and the cut quality in all locations (arteries, p = 0.0009; veins, p = 0.043). The course of the 7-day chronic study was uneventful except for one animal that developed an intestinal obstruction. None of the animals showed any signs of postoperative bleeding. On second-look laparotomy at day 7, macroscopic inspection of the sealed tissue and vessels did not show any signs of complications or evidence that bleeding had occurred. Histologically, the integrity of vessel wall fusion, thermal alterations, and inflammatory reactions were comparable, confirming substantial equivalence. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the efficacy and quality of vessel sealing with BiCision(®) is at least equivalent to those of EnSeal(®) for vessel diameters up to 7 mm. Since EnSeal(®) has already been shown to be safe in clinical practice, BiCision(®) should be as reliable as EnSeal(®) under clinical conditions.","Rothmund, Ralf; Kraemer, Bernhard; Neis, Felix; Brucker, Sara; Wallwiener, Markus; Reda, Ali; Hausch, Andrea; Scharpf, Marcus; Szyrach, Mara Natascha",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2337-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22678171/,139
151064,Standards of practice for superficial femoral and popliteal artery angioplasty and stenting.,2014,"Many cancer types reprogram their metabolism to become addicted to glutamine. One of the critical enzymes in the utilization of glutamine in these cells is glutaminase. CB-839 (telaglenastat) is a drug that targets glutaminase that is currently being evaluated in many clinical trials for efficacy in various cancer types that are known to be driven by glutamine metabolism. Despite its use, there are limited assays available for testing the pharmacodynamic on-target effects of CB-839 on the limited, small-volume patient samples that are obtained in early-phase clinical trials. Thus, we developed an assay based on the cellular thermal shift assay technique using AlphaLISA technology to show that CB-839 specifically engages glutaminase in colon cancer cell lines in vitro and in minute quantities of mouse xenograft tumors. Notably, we show that this assay detects CB-839 binding to glutaminase in platelets of patients collected while receiving CB-839 on a clinical trial. This assay may be used to study the pharmacodynamic profile of CB-839 in very small tissue samples obtained from patients on a clinical trial and may be useful in future studies designed to screen other inhibitors of glutaminase.","Chen, Yicheng; Zhao, Yiqing; Bajor, David L; Wang, Zhenghe; Selfridge, J Eva",Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2020.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004309/,139

OBJECTIVE This study utilized high-sensitivity thermal imaging technology to predict the core temperature of human subjects at a distance while performing simulated field operations wearing thermal protective garments. METHODS Six male subjects participating in a study of precooling prior to exertion in wildland firefighter thermal protective clothing had thermal images of the face captured with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera concomitant with measures of core and skin temperature before, during, and after treadmill exercise in a heated room. Correlations and measures of agreement between core temperature and thermal imaging-based temperature were performed. RESULTS The subjects walked an average (± standard deviation) of 42.6 (±5.9) minutes and a distance of 4.2 (±0.6) km on the treadmill. Mean heart rate at the end of exercise was 152 (±33) bpm and core body temperature at the end of exercise was 38.3°C (±0.7°C). A visual relationship and a strong correlation between core temperature and thermal imaging of the face were identified in all subjects, with the closest relationship and best agreement occurring during exercise. The Bland-Altman test of agreement during exercise revealed the majority of measurement pairs to be within two standard deviations of the measured temperature. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution thermal imaging in the middle-wave infrared spectrum (3-5 μm) can be used to accurately estimate core body temperature during exertion in a hot room while participants are wearing wildland firefighting garments. Although this technology is promising, it must be refined. Using alternative measurement sites such as the skin over the carotid artery, using multiple measurement sites, or adding pulse detection may improve the estimation of body temperature by thermal imagery.","Bourlai, Thirimachos; Pryor, Riana R; Suyama, Joe; Reis, Steven E; Hostler, David",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.3109/10903127.2012.670689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510022/,139

As influential information sources, mainstream news media have a unique opportunity to use their platform to debunk and educate the public about misinformation. Despite evidence lending support to the potential for mainstream news media to play a larger role in combating misinformation in society, empirical explorations of how they have contributed to the management of misinformation remain scant. This study aims to address these major gaps in research by investigating how mainstream news dailies gatekeep and correct COVID-19 related misinformation in Singapore. The content of 164 news articles published by the mainstream news dailies in Singapore from January 1 to April 30, 2020 on COVID-19 misinformation was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results show that the two main types of misinformation, fabricated and reconfigured misinformation, were covered almost equally by mainstream news media. Misinformation related to science and health were most frequently reported, followed by scams, and government policy. Statistically significant differences were found between how mainstream news media corrected the various types and topics of misinformation. Significant differences were also found within the various types, topics, and corrections of misinformation across the early stages of the pandemic. Taken together, these findings shed light on the critical role of mainstream news media as public education tools to correct misinformation during public health crises. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the understanding of media misinformation gatekeeping, and misinformation correction. From a practical perspective, it highlights the capacity and potential roles of the press in supporting government efforts to combat misinformation.","Lwin, May O; Lee, Si Yu; Panchapakesan, Chitra; Tandoc, Edson",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1937842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157919/,139
151581,The effect of aerobic exercises on lipid profile of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy: a protocol for a systematic review.,2018,"AIM The aim was to assess whether complete mesocolic excision (CME) in patients with right-sided colon cancer is related to short-term mortality or postoperative adverse events requiring reoperation. The complete mobilization of an integral mesocolon and central ligation of blood vessels are essential steps in CME surgery. The resultant specimen, with an intact mesocolic fascia and a high number of harvested lymph nodes, is believed to be oncologically favourable. However, it has been suggested that CME surgery may increase the risk of intra-operative severe adverse events, due to exposure of vital retroperitoneal organs and large blood vessels. METHOD In a population-based, nested case-control study, all residents in the Stockholm County operated for right-sided colon cancer from 2004 until 2012 were identified from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry. Patients who died within 90 days after surgery or were reoperated within 30 days after surgery, or during the index hospital stay, were defined as cases. Two controls per case were randomly sampled and individually matched for age, sex, TNM stage and emergency vs elective surgery. Exposure status (CME surgery) was assessed from original surgical reports. RESULTS The estimated proportion of CME surgery was 14.8% (35 of 236) for cases and 19.5% (92 of 473) for controls. The unadjusted OR for short-term mortality or reoperation after CME surgery was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.47-1.10; P = 0.15). The ORs were lower in the late part of the study (0.51; 95% CI: 0.26-1.01) and in high volume hospitals (0.61, 95% CI: 0.35-1.06). CONCLUSIONS The present study does not indicate that CME surgery is associated with an increased risk of severe adverse events such as 90-day mortality or reoperation.","Bernhoff, R; Sjövall, A; Buchli, C; Granath, F; Holm, T; Martling, A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.13950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091337/,139

More than 130 types of herbal injections are used clinically for 400 million patients annually with total sales of over four billion US dollars per year. However, the current quality control (QC) methods relying mainly on chemical fingerprints (CF) can hardly ensure quality and safety of the herbal injections with complex chemical composition and have resulted in an increase in serious adverse drug reactions. In this study, a comprehensive approach for the QC of a controversial herbal injection Shuang-Huang-Lian lyophilized powder (SHL) was established based on the quality fluctuation detection by a combination of CF and biological fingerprint (BF). High-performance liquid chromatography and the impedance-based xCELLigence system were applied to establish the CF and BF, respectively. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminant ability of the two methods. The results showed that being subjected to environmental influence like oxygen/air, high temperature, and extreme illumination could lead to quality fluctuation of SHL. The combination of chemical and biological fingerprint method is a more powerful tool for the QC of SHL because it can clearly discriminate different groups of abnormal samples. This method can be used for the detection of quality fluctuation of SHL and can provide reference for the quality control of other herbal injections.","Zhang, Lele; Ma, Lina; Feng, Wuwen; Zhang, Congen; Sheng, Feiya; Zhang, Yi; Xu, Chen; Dong, Gang; Dong, Xiaoping; Xiao, Xiaohe; Yan, Dan",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7918-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908410/,139

Robotic surgery might enable the transition of these procedures to minimally invasive surgery. METHODS Pre-, peri- and post-operative data of all patients who underwent a liver resection from 2009/2012 to 2001/2015, were collected prospectively. All robotic resection patients were matched 1:1 to patients who underwent open surgery. Pre- and perioperative data, up to 30 days, were analyzed. RESULTS Sixteen robotic and open hepatic resections were identified. Fewer complication events and shorter lengths of stay (LOS, 7.9 versus 11 days, P = 0.0603) were observed for robotic resections. Length of stay in the intermediate care unit (IMC) was shorter after the robotic procedure (10 h vs 16.6 h, P = 0.0699). Operating room (OR) time was significantly longer in the robotic resection cohort (352.8 vs 239.6 min, P = 0.0215). All tumor margins were negative.

Death is occurring because it is a new virus and human body has no specific antibodies for it. Presently there is no approved vaccine so everyone is susceptible but people with co-morbidities appear to be in more risk and the best way for protection is social distancing and increasing one's natural immunity by taking healthy diet and exercise. When a person is infected the clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe ARDS, sudden onset of anosmia, headache, cough may be the initial symptoms. This review is focused on immunopathology and effect of COVID-19 on neurological disorders and also the neurological manifestations and the treatment.","Singh, Shivani; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Asia, Priyanka; Gopal, Niranjan; Kaim, Kirti; Ahirwar, Pradeep",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2020-0069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617700/,139
152950,Impact of bedside bronchoscopy in critically ill lung transplant recipients.,2014,"Pediatric population have been affected by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to a much smaller scale compared with the adult population. The severity of the disease is variable ranging from mild form of pneumonia to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring a maximal level of organ support. Failure of the maximum support through mechanical ventilation can lead to the consideration of a higher level of organ support through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present a case of an 8 years old girl, who presented with severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia for which a venovenous-ECMO (VV ECMO) was initiated. This was followed by the patient developing cardiac arrest, which was managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). The patient was also given thrombolytic therapy during the ECPR because of high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Venovenous-arterial ECMO was then continued and the patient was successfully weaned off both VA and VV ECMO and discharged home with full neurologic recovery. This encouraging result will hopefully lead to more consideration of this lifesaving therapy for severe cardiac and respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 in pediatric patients.","Alfoudri, Huda; Shamsah, Mohammad; Yousuf, Beena; AlQuraini, Nasayem",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627597/,139
152983,Impaired Quality of Working Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.,2020-10-16,"OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that administration of vaginal progesterone in women with arrested preterm labor would result in lower rates of preterm birth <37 weeks compared to placebo. STUDY DESIGN We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing vaginal progesterone to placebo in women with arrested preterm labor. Our trial included women with a singleton or twin gestation at 240/7-336/7 weeks' gestation who presented with preterm labor with cervical dilation ≥1 centimeter but remained undelivered. Participants were randomized to receive vaginal progesterone 200 mg daily or an identical placebo. The primary outcome was preterm birth <37 weeks. We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials, including our results. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the key terms to identify relevant trials. The risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data were synthesized using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2. RESULTS The randomized trial was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment. There were 18 women randomized to receive vaginal progesterone who had complete follow-up data and 18 women in the placebo group. The risk of preterm birth <37 weeks was not significantly different in the groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.63-1.19). Secondary outcomes were also similar. Thirteen trials with 1658 women (835 in the vaginal progesterone and 823 in the control groups) were included in the meta-analysis. Risk of preterm birth <37 weeks was similar in women who received progesterone and those in the control group (pooled RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.35). Latency was significantly longer among women with arrested preterm labor who received vaginal progesterone (weighted mean difference: 9.2 d, 95% CI 3.2-15.1), but further analysis showed that prolonged latency was only observed in the subgroup of studies that were not placebo-controlled. CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis do not support the use of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth in women who present in preterm labor.","Frey, Heather A; Stout, Molly J; Abdelwahab, Mahmoud; Tuuli, Methodius G; Woolfolk, Candice; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Macones, George A; Cahill, Alison G","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1963705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407736/,139

In this study, we focused on risk factor of additional port in this surgery. We performed single-incision cholecystectomy in 75 patients with acute cholecystitis or after cholecystitis between 2010 and 2014 at Gunma University Hospital. Surgical indications followed the TG13 guidelines. Our standard procedure for single-incision cholecystectomy routinely uses two needlescopic devices. We used logistic regression analysis to identify the risk factors associated with use of an additional full-size port (5 or 10 mm). Surgical outcome was acceptable without biliary injury. Nine patients (12.0%) required an additional port, and one patient (1.3%) required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of severe adhesions around the cystic duct and common bile duct. In multivariate analysis, high C-reactive protein (CRP) values (>7.0 mg/dl) during cholecystitis attacks were significantly correlated with the need for an additional port (P = 0.009), with a sensitivity of 55.6%, specificity of 98.5%, and accuracy of 93.3%. This study indicated that the severe inflammation indicated by high CRP values during cholecystitis attacks predicts the need for an additional port. J. Med.

153902,Reply.,2018,"Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an alarming rise in domestic violence worldwide. Factors believed to be fueling this escalation in domestic violence include increasing social confinement at home during lockdowns and mounting stress levels from unemployment that have resulted from the economic uncertainties of these times. This contribution explores some of the challenges faced by physicians in clinically assessing victims of domestic violence during the COVID-19 era. One such challenge is the increased reliance on telemedicine during the pandemic, a medium of communication that offers a narrower clinical view of patients than is what is usually provided by an in-person examination. In this contribution, we offer suggestions on how best to screen for domestic violence, whether through telemedicine or during an in-person encounter. The history and physical findings that suggest domestic violence are reviewed along with recommendations on how to make the clinical examination more sensitive and compassionate to the needs of the victims. One of the authors of this contribution (L.C.H.) is herself a survivor of domestic violence and has courageously shared, in these pages, details of her harrowing near murder by an abusing husband. From this case history, it is hoped that readers will gain wider insights into what domestic violence means from the perspective of a victim and how we can better help save victims from this widespread and devastating social problem.","Hudson, Laura C; Lowenstein, Eve J; Hoenig, Leonard J",Clinics in dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341207/,139

There is considerable inter-patient variability in disease onset and progression, which can confound the results of clinical trials. Here we show that a common null polymorphism (R577X) in ACTN3 results in significantly reduced muscle strength and a longer 10 m walk test time in young, ambulant patients with DMD; both of which are primary outcome measures in clinical trials. We have developed a double knockout mouse model, which also shows reduced muscle strength, but is protected from stretch-induced eccentric damage with age. This suggests that α-actinin-3 deficiency reduces muscle performance at baseline, but ameliorates the progression of dystrophic pathology. Mechanistically, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency triggers an increase in oxidative muscle metabolism through activation of calcineurin, which likely confers the protective effect. Our studies suggest that ACTN3 R577X genotype is a modifier of clinical phenotype in DMD patients.","Hogarth, Marshall W; Houweling, Peter J; Thomas, Kristen C; Gordish-Dressman, Heather; Bello, Luca; Pegoraro, Elena; Hoffman, Eric P; Head, Stewart I; North, Kathryn N",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28139640/,139

Historically, China used too little Nr in its agriculture to feed its population. However, with the rapid increase in N fertilizer use for food production and fossil fuel consumption for energy supply over the last four decades, increasing gaseous Nr species (e.g. NH3 and NOx) have been emitted to the atmosphere and then deposited as wet and dry deposition, with adverse impacts on air, water and soil quality as well as plant biodiversity and human health. This paper reviews the issues associated with this in a holistic way. The emissions, deposition, impacts, actions and regulations for the mitigation of atmospheric Nr are discussed systematically. Both NH3 and NOx make major contributions to environmental pollution but especially to the formation of secondary fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which impacts human health and light scattering (haze). In addition, atmospheric deposition of NH3 and NOx causes adverse impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to acidification and eutrophication. Regulations and practices introduced by China that meet the urgent need to reduce Nr emissions are explained and resulting effects on emissions are discussed. Recommendations for improving future N management for achieving 'win-win' outcomes for Chinese agricultural production and food supply, and human and environmental health, are described.

154781,Postinterventional subarachnoid haemorrhage after endovascular stroke treatment with stent retrievers.,2014,"Pectic substances, one of the cell wall polysaccharides, exist widespread in vegetables and fruits. A surge of recent research has revealed that pectic substances can inhibit gut inflammation and relieve inflammatory bowel disease symptoms. However, physiological functions of pectins are strongly structure dependent. Pectic substances are essentially heteropolysaccharides composed of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan backbones substituted by various neutral sugar sidechains. Subtle changes in the architecture of pectic substances may remarkably influence the nutritional function of gut microbiota and the host homeostasis of immune system. In this context, developing a structure-function understanding of how pectic substances have an impact on an inflammatory bowel is of primary importance for diet therapy and new drugs. Therefore, the present review has summarized the polycomponent nature of pectic substances, the activities of different pectic polymers, the effects of molecular characteristics and the underlying mechanisms of pectic substances. The immunomodulated property of pectic substances depends on not only the chemical composition but also the physical structure characteristics, such as molecular weight (Mw ) and chain conformation. The potential mechanisms by which pectic substances exert their protective effects are mainly reversing the disordered gut microbiota, regulating immune cells, enhancing barrier function, and inhibiting pathogen adhesion. The manipulation of pectic substances on gut health is sophisticated, and the link between structural specificity of pectins and selective regulation needs further exploration.","Wu, Dongmei; Ye, Xingqian; Linhardt, Robert J; Liu, Xuwei; Zhu, Kai; Yu, Chengxiao; Ding, Tian; Liu, Donghong; He, Qiaojun; Chen, Shiguo",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594822/,139

Previous work showed that mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) with a mutated catalytic site (N1348A) replicated similarly to wild-type virus but was unable to cause acute hepatitis in mice. To determine whether this attenuated phenotype is applicable to multiple disease models, we mutated the catalytic residue in the JHM strain of MHV (JHMV), which causes acute and chronic encephalomyelitis, using a newly developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based MHV reverse genetics system. Infection of mice with the macrodomain catalytic point mutant virus (N1347A) resulted in reductions in lethality, weight loss, viral titers, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration in the brain compared to mice infected with wild-type virus. Specifically, macrophages were most affected, with approximately 2.5-fold fewer macrophages at day 5 postinfection in N1347A-infected brains. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) signaling were not required for effective host control of mutant virus as all N1347A virus-infected mice survived the infection. However, the adaptive immune system was required for protection since N1347A virus was able to cause lethal encephalitis in RAG1(-/-) (recombination activation gene 1 knockout) mice although disease onset was modestly delayed. Overall, these results indicate that the BAC-based MHV reverse genetics system will be useful for studies of JHMV and expand upon previous studies, showing that the macrodomain is critical for the ability of coronaviruses to evade the immune system and promote viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are an important cause of human and veterinary diseases worldwide. Viral processes that are conserved across a family are likely to be good targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. The macrodomain is a ubiquitous structural domain and is also conserved among all coronaviruses. The coronavirus macrodomain has ADP-ribose-1""-phosphatase activity; however, its function during infection remains unclear as does the reason that coronaviruses have maintained this enzymatic activity throughout evolution. For MHV, this domain has now been shown to promote multiple types of disease, including hepatitis and encephalitis. These data indicate that this domain is vital for the virus to replicate and cause disease. Understanding the mechanism used by this enzyme to promote viral pathogenesis will open up novel avenues for therapies and may give further insight into the role of macrodomain proteins in the host cell since these proteins are found in all living organisms.","Fehr, Anthony R; Athmer, Jeremiah; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Phillips, Judith M; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02596-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25428866/,139

While the grant of patents is subject to establishing novelty and inventive step, it further indicates the technological development and helpful for researchers working in the same technical domain. The aim of the present research work is to map the existing work through analysis of patent literature, in the field of Coronaviruses (CoV), particularly COVID-19 (2019-nCoV). CoV is a large family of viruses known to cause illness in human and animals, particularly known for causing respiratory infections as evidenced in earlier times such as in MERS i.e. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; SRS i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently identified novel-coronavirus has known as COVID-19 which has currently caused pandemic situation across the globe. OBJECTIVE To expand analysis of patents related to CoV and 2019-nCoV. Evaluation has been conducted by patenting trends of particular strains of identified CoV diseases by present legal status, main concerned countries via earliest priority years and its assignee types and inventors of identified relevant patents. We analyzed the global patent documents to check the scope of claims along with focuses and trends of the published patent documents for the entire CoV family including 2019- nCoV through the present landscape. METHODS To extract the results, Derwent Innovation database is used by a combination of different key-strings. Approximately 3800 patents were obtained and further scrutinized and analyzed. The present write-up also discusses the recent progress of patent applications in a period of the year 2010 to 2020 (present) along with the recent developments in India for the treatment options for CoV and 2019-nCoV. RESULTS Present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions have been focused on vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for treatment of CoV. We also observed that no specific vaccine treatments is available for treatment of 2019-nCov, however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention and disease management is the primarily governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSION The present paper analyzes the existing patents in the field of Coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV and suggests a way forward for the effective contribution in this upcoming research area. From the trend analysis, it was observed an increase in filing of the overall trend of patent families for a period of 2010 to the current year. This multifaceted analysis of identified patent literature provides an understanding of the focuses on present ongoing research and grey area in terms of the trends of technological innovations in disease management in patients with CoV and 2019-nCoV. Further, the findings and outcome of the present study offer insights for the proposed research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information in order to facilitate policymakers, academia, research driven institutes and also investors to make better decisions regarding programmed steps for research and development for the diagnosis, treatment and taking preventive measures for CoV and 2019-nCoV.

METHODS Using random digit dialing, we sampled 12,965 Hong Kong residents in 13 cross-sectional telephone surveys between April and November 2009, covering the entire first wave of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. We examined trends in anxiety, risk perception, knowledge on modes of transmission, and preventive behaviors. RESULTS Respondents reported low anxiety levels throughout the epidemic. Perceived susceptibility to infection and perceived severity of H1N1 were initially high but declined early in the epidemic and remained stable thereafter. As the epidemic grew, knowledge on modes of transmission did not improve, the adoption of hygiene measures and use of face masks did not change, and social distancing declined. Greater anxiety was associated with lower reported use of hygiene measures but greater social distancing. Knowledge that H1N1 could be spread by indirect contact was associated with greater use of hygiene measures and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS The lack of substantial change in preventive measures or knowledge about the modes of H1N1 transmission in the general population suggests that community mitigation measures played little role in mitigating the impact of the first wave of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in Hong Kong.","Cowling, Benjamin J; Ng, Diane M W; Ip, Dennis K M; Liao, Quiyan; Lam, Wendy W T; Wu, Joseph T; Lau, Joseph T F; Griffiths, Sian M; Fielding, Richard",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1086/655811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20677945/,139

This study aimed to evaluate effects of an early progressive rehabilitation intervention in mechanically ventilated adults at risk. METHODS This was a parallel, two-arm, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial with 6-months follow-up that was conducted in a mixed ICU of an academic centre in Switzerland. Previously independent, mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults with expected critical care stay ≥72 hours (n = 115) were randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy including early mobilisation or to an experimental group with early endurance and resistance training combined with mobilisation. Primary endpoints were functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Distance) and functional independence (Functional Independence Measure) at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints including muscle strength were assessed at critical care discharge. Safety was monitored closely by standard monitoring and predefined adverse events. RESULTS Physiotherapy started within 48 hours of critical care admission while 97% of participants were still ventilated and 68% on inotropes. Compared to the control group (n = 57), the experimental group (n = 58) received significantly more physiotherapy (sessions: 407 vs 377, p<0.001; time/session: 25min vs 18min, p<0.001) and had less days with sedation (p<0.001). Adverse events were rare (0.6%) and without consequences. There were no significant between-group differences in 6-Minute Walk Distance (experimental 123m (IQR 25-280) vs control 100m (IQR 0-300); p = 0.542) or functional independence (98 (IQR 66-119) vs 98 (IQR 18-115); p = 0.308). Likewise, no differences were found for the secondary outcomes, except a trend towards improved mental health in the experimental group after 6 months (84 (IQR 68-88) vs 70 (IQR 64-76); p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS Early endurance and resistance training in mechanically ventilated, intensive care patients does not improve functional capacity or independence at hospital discharge compared to early standard physiotherapy but may improve mental health 6-months after critical care discharge.

Here we show that the LacI/GalR transcriptional regulator MalR, the maltose genes regulator, is also the main regulator of the operons encoding an ABC transporter (mdxEFG) and three metabolic enzymes (mmdH-gmdH-mmgT) required for the uptake and catabolism of maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins. The utilization of maltose and maltodextrins is consequently coordinated and induced by the disaccharide maltose, which binds to MalR. Carbon catabolite repression of the mdxEFG and mmdH-gmdH-mmgT operons is mediated by both, P-Ser-HPr/MalR and P-Ser-HPr/CcpA. The latter complex exerts only moderate catabolite repression which became visible when comparing maltodextrin operon expression in a malR- and a malR-ΔccpA double mutant grown in the presence of maltose, which is transported via a phosphotransferase system and thus favours the formation of P-Ser-HPr. Moreover, maltodextrin transport via MdxEFG slows rapidly when glucose is added, suggesting an additional regulation via inducer exclusion. This complex regulation of metabolic operons likely allows E. faecalis to fine-tune gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis represents a leading cause of hospital acquired infections worldwide. Several studies highlighted the importance of carbohydrate metabolism in the infection process of this bacterium. The genes required for maltodextrin metabolism are particularly induced during mice infection and therefore should play an important role for pathogenesis. Since no data were hitherto available concerning the regulation of expression of the maltodextrin operons, we have conducted experiments to study the underlying mechanisms.","Grand, Maxime; Riboulet-Bisson, Eliette; Deutscher, Josef; Hartke, Axel; Sauvageot, Nicolas",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01147-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680872/,139

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-nine patients who developed gastric leakage out of 4294 patients who underwent LSG from 2010 to 2018 were considered in this study. Patients' outcomes in terms of incidence of resolution and time to leakage resolution were compared by leakage characteristics and type of treatment. Three patients were lost to follow up. RESULTS Leakage occurred in a median of 6 days from surgery, and for majority of patients (80.3%), it was in the upper part of the sleeve. The median dimension of leakage was 6.5 mm. Low level leakage resulted in a lower time of resolution (p < 0.001). Patients with clinical leakage were treated with surgery or endoscopic placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS). The median time of leakage resolution was 42 days. The hospitalization time for SEMS was shorter with a 68.3% of complete resolution compared with the 29.4% of surgery. In patients with subclinical and small leakage, a conservative treatment was successful in 87.5%. Overall 39.4% of patients needed a second line treatment after that the first failed. CONCLUSION Leakage could be treated conservatively if subclinical and < 5 mm. Surgery is mandatory if a perigastric collection is present or an organ lesion is suspected. SEMS seems to be the best option to treat high level leakage.","Olmi, Stefano; Cesana, Giovanni; Rubicondo, Carolina; Oldani, Alberto; Uccelli, Matteo; De Carli, Stefano; Ciccarese, Francesca; Giorgi, Riccardo; Villa, Roberta; Zanoni, Adelinda; Ismail, Ayman",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04658-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382961/,139

156779,How did we get a COVID-19 vaccine in less than one year?,2021-02-04,"INTRODUCTION The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MetS-related stroke is set to increase dramatically in coming decades. MetS is a complex disease that includes endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, ectopic obesity, and dyslipidaemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. One function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) is the cholesterol-efflux pathway, which is the pathway where cholesterol is removed from macrophages within the arterial walls back into the bloodstream and out to the liver. As one of the key functions of HDL, their hypothesis was that if they could measure HDL-C-efflux capacity, they would have a better handle on the role of HDL in atherosclerosis. However, there are no systematic analyses or well-conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship between HDL-C functionality and MetS. The aim of this study is to examine this association of HDL-C functionality with MetS in different ages and sex. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The update systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted using published studies that will be identified from electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar). Studies that examined the association between HDL-C functionality and MetS; focused on cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies; were conducted among in adults aged 40 to 70 years; provided sufficient data for calculating odds ratio or relative risk with a 95% confidence interval; were published as original articles written in English or other languages; and have been published until January 2018 will be included. Study selection, data collection, quality assessment, and statistical syntheses will be conducted based on discussions among investigators. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval was not required for this study because it was based on published studies. The results and findings of this study will be submitted and published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal.

This study aims to provide further understanding of structural characteristics of hernia prostheses, and better comprehensive evaluation. Weight, porosity, pore size and other physical characteristics were evaluated; warp knitting structures were thoroughly discussed. Two methods referring to ISO 7198:1998, i.e., weight method and area method, were employed to calculate porosity. Porosity ranged from 37.3% to 69.7% measured by the area method, and 81.1% to 89.6% by the weight method. Devices with two-guide bar structures displayed both higher porosity (57.7%-69.7%) and effective porosity (30.8%-60.1%) than single-guide bar structure (37.3%-62.4% and 0%-5.9%, respectively). Filament diameter, stitch density and loop structure combined determined the thickness, weight and characteristics of pores. They must be well designed to avoid zero effective porosity regarding a single-bar structure. The area method was more effective in characterizing flat sheet meshes while the weight method was perhaps more accurate in describing stereoscopic void space for 3D structure devices. This article will give instructive clues for engineers to improve mesh structures, and better understanding of warp knitting meshes for surgeons.","Miao, Linli; Wang, Fang; Wang, Lu; Zou, Ting; Brochu, Gaétan; Guidoin, Robert",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma8125453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793704/,139

157274,Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Setting of Anticoagulation.,2015,"Survivin is one of the rare proteins that is differentially expressed in normal and cancer cells and is directly or indirectly involved in numerous pathways required for tumor maintenance. It is expressed in almost all cancers and its expression has been detected at early stages of cancer. These traits make survivin an exceptionally attractive target for cancer therapeutics. Even with these promising features to be an oncotherapeutic target, there has been limited success in the clinical trials targeting survivin. Only recently it has emerged that survivin was not being specifically targeted which could have resulted in the negative clinical outcome. Also, focus of research has now shifted from survivin expression in the overall heterogeneous tumor cell populations to survivin expression in cancer stem cells as these cells have proved to be the major drivers of tumors. Therefore, in this review we have analyzed the expression of survivin in normal and cancer cells with a particular focus on its expression in cancer stem cell compartment. We have discussed the major signaling pathways involved in regulation of survivin. We have explored the current development status of various types of interventions for inhibition of survivin. Furthermore, we have discussed the challenges involving the development of potent and specific survivin inhibitors for cancer therapeutics. Finally we have given insights for some of the promising future anticancer treatments.","Warrier, Neerada Meenakshi; Agarwal, Prasoon; Kumar, Praveen",Stem cell reviews and reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-09995-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691369/,139

For many viruses, a definitive demonstration of receptor function has been achieved when nonpermissive cells are rendered susceptible to infection following transfection of the gene encoding a putative receptor. For influenza virus, such approaches have been confounded by the abundance of SA on mammalian cells so that it has been difficult to identify cell lines that are not susceptible to infection. We examined influenza virus infection of Lec2 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a mutant cell line deficient in SA. Lec2 CHO cells were resistant to influenza virus infection, and stable cell lines expressing either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN were generated to assess the potential of each molecule to function as SA-independent receptors for influenza A viruses. Virus strain BJx109 (H3N2) bound to Lec2 CHO cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and transfected cells were susceptible to virus infection. Treatment of Lec2-DC-SIGN and Lec2-L-SIGN cells with mannan, but not bacterial neuraminidase, blocked infection, a finding consistent with SA-independent virus attachment and entry. Moreover, virus strain PR8 (H1N1) bears low levels of mannose-rich glycans and was inefficient at infecting Lec2 CHO cells expressing either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN, whereas other glycosylated H1N1 subtype viruses could infect cells efficiently. Together, these data indicate that human C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) can mediate attachment and entry of influenza viruses independently of cell surface SA.","Londrigan, Sarah L; Turville, Stuart G; Tate, Michelle D; Deng, Yi-Mo; Brooks, Andrew G; Reading, Patrick C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01705-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21191006/,139

RESULTS Prior to review, these patients had a combined total of 2841 diagnoses recorded in their EHR problem lists. 1722 additional diagnoses were identified, increasing the mean number of recorded problems per patient from 5.51 to 8.84. The overall percentage of diagnoses originally included in the problem list was 62.3% (2841 / 4563, 95% confidence interval 60.8%, 63.7%). CONCLUSIONS Diagnoses and other clinical information stored in a structured way in electronic health records is extremely useful for supporting clinical decisions, improving patient care and enabling better research.

However, the ability to provide these intensive, in-person services was abruptly disrupted by the necessary institutional, state, and national coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation strategies. As most of our YHIV are from marginalized communities (racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities) with existing health and social inequities that impede successful clinical outcomes and increase HIV disparities, there was heightened concern that COVID-19 would exacerbate these inequities and amplify the known HIV disparities.

At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","Sun, M L; Yang, J M; Sun, Y P; Su, G H",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164092/,139

Approximately a quarter of these strokes are recurrent strokes, and there is compelling evidence of the benefit of supervised exercise and risk factor modification programming in the secondary prevention of these strokes. However, there is insufficient time in inpatient and outpatient stroke rehabilitation for focused exercise interventions. General lifestyle interventions on their own, without guidance and supervision, are insufficient for improving physical activity levels. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a setting where cardiac patients, and increasingly stroke patients, receive comprehensive secondary prevention programming, including structured exercise. Unfortunately, not all CR programs accept referrals for people following a stroke and for those that do, only a few patients participate. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to report the barriers and facilitators to improving linkage between health services, with a focus on increasing access to CR. In the next two decades, it is projected that there will be a marked increase in stroke prevalence globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to create cross-program collaborations between hospitals, outpatient stroke rehabilitation, CR, and community programs.

Methods A total of 79 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. Demographic characteristics, clinical data (past history, vital signs, therapeutic management, and outcomes), and results of laboratory findings and cardiac investigations were collected. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results The median age was 65±12 years, and 53 patients (67%) were male. A total of 57 (72%) patients died, and compared with survivors, these patients were older and had significantly higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and fewer lymphocytes as well as higher heart rate (P<0.05). Autopsy findings did not suggest severe myocarditis. A total of 19 (24%) patients had tachyarrhythmias, including 10 (13%) with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 9 (11%) with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The incidence of tachyarrhythmias in non-survivor was much higher than in survivors (P=0.04). In a Cox regression model, older patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTAs) age were at a higher risk of death, with hazard ratio (HR) of 3.302 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.524-7.154, P=0.002] and 1.045 (95% CI, 1.020-1.071, P=0.000), respectively. The use of beta-blockers [HR, 0.219 (95% CI, 0.066-0.722); P=0.013] was associated with a lower risk of death. Conclusions Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had a poor prognosis.

159826,Percutaneous ablation of renal masses measuring 3.0 cm and smaller: comparative local control and complications after radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation.,2013,"North Korea's health care system during the Korean War has a significant meaning in North Korean medical history and is also an appropriate research topic for understanding North Korea's wartime system. However, previous studies on North Korean medical history has been focused on before and after the war. This study traces the formation and operation of North Korea's wartime health system to fill the gap in the literature, aiming to identify that the support of the North Korean community in China's Yanbian community was key to North Korea's wartime health system. North Korea reorganized its health care system, centered on the military, such as establishing field hospitals concurrently with the outbreak of the war. However, as time went on, the North Korean health care project began to put an emphasis on protecting the lives and health of the civilians behind the frontline. In addition to the primary need to prevent infectious diseases, the hygiene and prevention project functioned as a means to control and mobilize the public by emphasizing broad public participation. Although North Korea tried to meet the demand for a large medical personnel through short-term training, medical personnel were always in short supply during the war. During the war, it was the Korean society in Yanbian that replenished medical personnel in North Korea and provided a space for a relatively stable hospital operation. Numerous Koreans in Yanbian participated in the Korean War as nurses, paramedic staff, transfusion donors, and army surgeons for North Korea. Such large-scale participation of medical personnel in Yanbian was based on the long-established medical exchanges between Yanbian and North Korea. Koreans in Yanbian also accommodated North Korean wounded, refugees, and war orphans and provided various medical assistance to them. During the war, Yanbian was a ""secure rear"" capable of performing medical actions that could not be done in North Korea. This study has confirmed that North Korea's current participation in public health projects, which is a characteristic of its health care sector, has its origins in the Korean War. Moreover, it demonstrates that North Korea's medical history needs to be viewed from an East Asian perspective, including the Korean society in Yanbian, rather than a national-only perspective. The application of this view to the analysis of North Korean's health care system in other historical periods would facilitate richer discussions.","Moon, Mira",Ui sahak,https://doi.org/10.13081/kjmh.2020.29.503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937641/,139

METHODS We added an external filter to the expiratory limb and measured tidal volume (VT) from 6 ICU ventilators: 2 with built-in expiratory filter (Avea, Puritan Bennett 840), and 4 without (Engström Carestation, Evita XL, Evita V500, and Servo-i), set in volume controlled mode, at BTPS (body temperature and pressure saturated) condition, with a heated humidifier and a lung model (compliance 16 mL/cm H2O, resistance 20 cm H2O/L/s) placed inside a neonatal incubator. The temperature was targeted at 37°C for both the heated humidifier and the incubator. The setup was run continuously for 24 hours. In the latter 4 ICU ventilators, a Hygrobac or Sterivent S external filter was placed upstream from the expiratory valve for an additional 24-hour period for each. At the end of this period, VT was measured at 4 nominal VT values (300, 400, 500, and 800 mL) with a pneumotachograph. The volume error computed from the ratio of set to measured VT (% set VT) was the primary end point. RESULTS In these warm and wet conditions, volume error averaged 96 ± 3% for Avea, 100 ± 7% for Puritan Bennett 840, 90 ± 2% for Evita XL, 100 ± 7% for Evita V500, 105 ± 2% for Servo-i, and 108 ± 4% for Engström Carestation (P < .001). With the Hygrobac the values were 93 ± 1% for Evita XL, 94 ± 4% for Evita V500, 110 ± 4% for Servo-i, and 99 ± 2% for Engström Carestation (P < .001). With the Sterivent the corresponding values were 95 ± 2%, 105 ± 2%, 112 ± 5%, and 98 ± 2%, respectively (P < .001).

159940,Acute Endovascular Treatment of Patients With Ischemic Stroke From Intracranial Large Vessel Occlusion and Extracranial Carotid Dissection.,2019,"The COVID-19 pandemic pressurizes the healthcare system. Protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection, like social distancing or isolation, are being taken too late and COVID-19 symptoms are non-specific and can resemble those from rhinoviral infection or influenza, causing a rush of anxious patients with (mild) symptoms to the hospitals. Furthermore, COVID-19 diagnosis is made by taking swabs from the upper of lower respiratory tract, which is not only an unpleasant experience for the patient, but is also time-consuming. Therefore, a fast differential diagnosis between SARS-COV-2, influenza or rhinovirus infection would allow to optimize the hospital management and hospitalize those patients with proven COVID-19 disease, where other patients can easily recover at home. Breath analysis could therefore be explored investigating both volatile organic compounds (VOC) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and aerosols (EBA) in a non-invasive manner, without discomforting the patient. However, breath research is highly affected since human-mediated transmission of viral particles through breath is of high concern. Nevertheless, breathomics can provide fast results and the sampling materials can be cleaned and autoclaved thoroughly, minimizing the risk for cross-contamination. Breath analysis also allows the breath sample to be taken by the patient himself, hence, considering the social distancing measures and protecting health care workers. In this article, we summarize 3 pathways in which SARS-CoV-2 could generate specific VOCs. In that way, breath analysis could allow a fast differential diagnosis as first line screening, optimizing COVID-19 management.","Lamote, Kevin; Janssens, Eline; Schillebeeckx, Eline; Lapperre, Therese S; De Winter, Benedicte Y; van Meerbeeck, Jan P",Journal of breath research,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/aba105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599571/,139

Methods A systemic literature review was performed using online database from January 2004 to January 2017. Primary outcomes were successful recanalization seen on finial angiography and good outcome at three months. Secondary outcomes were mortality and the development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (S-ICH) after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used when heterogeneity was less than 50%. Egger's regression test was used to assess publication bias. Results Five studies were included for final analysis. Between EVT with IVT and EVT alone group, successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.467, p=0.216), good clinical outcome at three months (OR 1.199, p=0.385), mortality (OR 0.776, p=0.371), and S-ICH (OR 1.820, p=0.280) did not differ significantly. Egger's regression intercept with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.99 (95% CI -2.91 to 6.89) in successful recanalization and -0.27 (95% CI -6.35 to 5.80) in good clinical outcome, respectively. Conclusion The two treatment modalities, EVT with IVT and EVT alone, could be comparable in treating acute anterior circulation stroke. Studies to find specific beneficiary group for EVT alone, without primary IVT, are needed further.","Kim, Chul Ho; Jeon, Jin Pyeong; Kim, Sung-Eun; Choi, Hyuk Jai; Cho, Yong Jun",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2017.0505.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631383/,139
160276,Reperfusion of very low cerebral blood volume lesion predicts parenchymal hematoma after endovascular therapy.,2015,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of coronal reformatted images obtained from 64-slice multi-detector computed tomography to assess the ablative margin (AM) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radio frequency ablation (RFA). METHODS Ninety-five HCC nodules were analyzed in 66 HCC patients treated with RFA. Two radiologists and one hepatologist independently reviewed axial CT images with or without coronal reformatted images in HCC treated with RFA. Nodules were determined as AM-sufficient (≥5 mm) or AM-insufficient (<5 mm). The level of interobserver agreement was measured using the weighted kappa test. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (NPVs) of an insufficient AM (<5 mm) to predict local recurrence were evaluated. RESULTS The numbers of AM-sufficient nodules judged by readers 1-3 based on axial images and both axial and coronal images were 56, 49, and 58, and 47, 33, and 48, respectively. Excellent agreement and good to excellent agreement were obtained among the three readers on axial image readings and both axial and coronal image readings, respectively. The mean sensitivity, specificity, and positive and NPVs of an insufficient AM on axial images and both axial and coronal images to predict local recurrence were 64%, 60%, 17%, and 93%, and 95%, 50%, 20%, and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Coronal reformatted CT images should be utilized to evaluate the AM in HCC treated with RFA in order to decrease the risk of local recurrence following treatment.","Motoyama, Tenyu; Ogasawara, Sadahisa; Chiba, Tetsuhiro; Higashide, Takashi; Yokota, Hajime; Kanogawa, Naoya; Suzuki, Eiichiro; Ooka, Yoshihiko; Tawada, Akinobu; Irie, Ryosuke; Ochi, Shigehiro; Masuda, Yoshitada; Uno, Takashi; Yokosuka, Osamu",Abdominal imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-013-0054-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24346490/,139

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients were treated using this technique, in three patients as a bailout option after failed posterior tibial vein puncture and in four as a first option. Antegrade popliteal venous access was performed according to the usual technique using duplex ultrasound (DUS) guidance and thrombolysis (CDT), or thrombectomy (PMT) was performed. Following this, the retrograde sheath was placed under DUS guidance, a tibial vein was selectively catheterized and CDT, and/or a PMT was performed. RESULTS Three patients underwent isolated CDT, another three had associated PMT, and one patient underwent iliofemoral PMT and catheter thromboaspiration of the popliteal and calf veins. Median thrombolysis duration was 72 h (24-72 h). SIR grade III thrombolysis was achieved in six patients and grade II in one patient. All patients underwent subsequent stenting of their iliac vein lesions. Minor complications were observed in two patients (ecchymosis), while one patient developed a hematoma on the popliteal fossa. CONCLUSION This ""criss-cross"" technique represents a safe alternative to the distal (anterior or posterior tibial) vein access both as a bailout option after failed distal venous access as well as a primary approach due to its potential advantage of clearing larger thrombus volume. Experience in ultrasound-guided popliteal vein puncture is crucial to avoid complications.

160582,Hyperinflammation: on the pathogenesis and treatment of macrophage activation syndrome.,2021-05-02,"The threat posed by emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases and, more recently, by the intentional release of infectious agents in a susceptible population, has been receiving considerable attention at the national and international levels. Public health efforts to strengthen disease detection, surveillance and control have been intensified. However, clinicians and clinical microbiology laboratories play an important role in the early detection of disease, the identification of the putative agent, and notification of the appropriate authorities. To be effective in this role, laboratories must be specially prepared to handle viral agents safely, and need, among other things, the appropriate rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests. In 1998 the European Network for Diagnostics of ""Imported"" Viral Diseases (ENIVD) was established. ENIVD presently comprises, as permanent members, 44 expert laboratories in 21 European Union (EU) member states and 4 non-EU countries and is one of the networks on infectious diseases funded by the European Commission. ENIVD fulfils many of the important tasks required for the surveillance and control of imported, rare and emerging viral infections such as the exchange of expertise and the organisation of external quality assurance (EQA) programmes, both of which are needed to improve diagnostics. Here, we summarise the data generated by recent EQA activities focussed on the diagnostics of infections with hantavirus, dengue virus, filovirus, Lassa virus, orthopox virus and the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These were carried out between 1999 and 2004 and involved 93 laboratories from 41 countries, including laboratories from additional countries outside of Europe. Particularly the EU-candidate countries and Eastern neighbouring countries will be invited to join the network in the near future.

This branching abnormality can cause unexpected vertebral artery damage and bleeding during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. There are few reports of abnormal branching of the vertebral artery associated with neurosurgery but none related to esophagectomy. We report the case together with the results of the evaluation of vertebral artery bifurcation and length in 50 patients with esophageal cancer in our hospital. CASE PRESENTATION Thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed on a 70-year-old patient with esophageal cancer. During lymph node dissection around the right reccurent laryngeal nerve, an unusual blood vessel was found running along the right subclavian artery. We determined this blood vessel to be the right vertebral artery branching far more centrally than usual. Because this anatomical abnormality was clarified, we could then recognize that the right reccurent laryngeal nerve coursed around the right vertebral artery and the right subclavian artery and thus was running in a larger arch than usual. CONCLUSION Long right vertebral artery may appear in the surgical field of the thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Knowledge of such anatomical variation is important to prevent iatrogenic injury of the right vertebral artery and the right reccurent laryngeal nerve.","Sato, Yuta; Tanaka, Yoshihiro; Imai, Takeharu; Hatanaka, Yuji; Okumura, Naoki; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Takahashi, Takao; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-021-01216-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906625/,139

Results revealed that nearly half of participants reported that abusers threatening to shoot victims or others became more frequent since the start of the pandemic, while nearly 30% reported that homicide involving firearms became more frequent during the pandemic. Further, nearly 40% of participants indicated an increase in firearm sales during pandemic-with higher sales in non-rural versus rural areas. Common themes related to safety planning with firearms included advising the victim to contact the system for help, assessing the location of firearms and/or remove the firearms, and leaving the abuser. The results stress the importance for safety planning around firearms when victims are isolated with an abuser at home and potential impact of abuser firearm access on public safety.","Lynch, Kellie R; Logan, T K",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211046270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634953/,139

During it’s existence, the hospital received 104 admissions, 1183 patient/days. The creation of a new hospital in such a short space of time presented many challenges for those in leadership positions, necessitating diverse and experienced management. This project sought to capture these unique experiences to highlight lessons learnt from the senior leadership team at NNW.MethodUsing a semi-structured format, interviews were conducted with four consultants and nine members of the senior leadership team. Responses were summarised into transcripts using an interview-based format. Consensus coding of the transcripts was performed using domains/themes to establish common themes that occurred in the interviews and how this related to the hospital workforce.ResultsThe interviews explored what leadership qualities the staff were required to demonstrate. The following themes were identified: adaptability, bringing people together, reassuring staff, keeping calm and being visible. A key element was transparency and sharing information particularly relating to an openness about lack of knowledge, which was pertinent in the climate that COVID-19 created. A flat hierarchy facilitated staff to easily voice their opinion and promote change. Leadership challenges included working with new people, managing uncertainty and the rapid pace of change.ConclusionsThe project established some key learning points for the NHS to take forward, including a greater focus on staff wellbeing, less bureaucracy and the need for clinicians to be involved in leadership roles. This will benefit staff at all levels of care by facilitating the creation of an environment which makes them feel valued and supported.","Riley, Sophie Baird Hannah Holt Lewis Griff Jack Khan Fozia",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.92,139

Therefore, ethanol is topping the social-demanding, although the three generations of production, from molasses/starch, lignocelluloses, and algae. Owing to the limited-availability of fermentable sugars from these resources, we addressed glycerol as a fourth bio-based carbon resource from biodiesel, soap, and fatty acid industries, which considers as a non-applicable source for bioethanol production. Here, we show the full strategy to generate efficient glycerol fermenting yeast by innovative rewriting the oxidation of cytosolic nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NADH) by O2-dependent dynamic shuttle while abolishing glycerol biosynthesis route. Besides, imposing a vigorous glycerol-oxidative pathway, the engineered strain demonstrated a breakthrough in conversion efficiency (up to 98%). Its capacity extending to produce up to 90g /l ethanol and > 2 g 1-1 h-1, which promoting the industrial view. Visionary metabolic engineering here provides horizons for further tremendous economic and health benefits with assuring for its enhancing for the other scenarios of biorefineries.

165580,Face Mask Fit Hacks: Improving the Fit of KN95 Masks and Surgical Masks with Fit Alteration Techniques,2020-11-03,"A number of COVID-19 outbreak classification and prediction methods have been proposed and are being applied around the globe to make the right decision and to enforce proper control measures. Among these methods, simple statistical and epidemiological methods have received much attention whereas, for the long term prediction, the standard methods do not perform well due to the lack of essential data and high-level of uncertainty. Thus, the essential robustness and generalization abilities of these methods need to be improved. Therefore, this work proposed a new hybrid Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) combined with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method called HHO-SVM. The HHO-SVM is applied on a big Gene Expression Cancer (RNA-Seq) dataset which comprises more than 20531 features to identify the critical Gene that causes the COVID-19. The experimental results revealed that HHO-SVM outperformed than Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Slap Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA’s). We further investigate that the most critical Gene is Tmprss2 which causes Prostate Cancer is the same Gene that causes COVID-19 through the ACE2 receptor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Houssein, E.

165805,Stenting of intracranial stenosis through an angioplasty balloon catheter-a case series,2021,"Background: This study aimed to screen a wide range of emotional and behavioural variables emerging during the first COVID-19 pandemic-lockdown in a sample of parents and children, residents in the southern part of Italy, and explore which variables could predict children's wellbeing. We hypothesised that difficulties in adapting routines to pandemic restrictions, parents' emotional wellbeing, and attitude towards the pandemic could influence the children's behavioural attitudes. Methods: 221 parents completed the survey and gave information about 246 children. Ad hoc questionnaires were created and then exploratory reduced in factors. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for parents assessed positive and negative behavioural attitudes in children. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Italian DASS-21) scored depression, anxiety and stress in parents. Results: Children presented higher emotional distress (Mean difference (M-diff)=0.6, 95% C.I. 0.2, 0.9, p=0.013) and better prosocial behaviour (M-diff=0.5, 95% C.I. 0.1, 0.9, p=0.011) than the Italian normative sample. Parents were more depressed than expected in the general population (M-diff=1.0, 95% C.I. 0.3, 1.6, p=0.005). Having developed a morbid attachment to an adult (B=0.37, 95% CI 0.05, 0.69, p=0.024), a higher parental depression (B=0.1, 95% CI 0.02, 0.18, p=0.014), and children's suffering from nightmares (B=0.35, 95% CI 0.03, 0.67, p=0.032) explained the 31.9% of the total variance in children's emotional distress. Children's anxiety was related to parents' fear of the pandemic effects (r=0.32, p=0.001) and avoiding communicative approach (r=0.24, p=0.011). Conclusion: The first lockdown determined emotional distress and regressive mechanisms in children in the contest of higher parental discomfort, fear of the infection and avoidant communication.

167488,Stool banking for fecal microbiota transplantation: methods and operations at a large stool bank,2020-09-09,"Summary Background The health impacts of ambient air pollution impose large costs on society. While all people are exposed to air pollution, older individuals tend to be disproportionally affected. As a result, there is growing concern about the public health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the health economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution, and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. Methods We developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life year (VSLY) to estimate the health economic cost attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution using the Global Burden of Disease 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age- and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model (GEMM) and global estimates of exposure derived from ground monitoring, satellite retrievals and chemical transport model simulations at 0.1 by 0.1 degree (~11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLL within each age-group into a health-related economic cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM2.5. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity test to analyze the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and exposure-response functions by age, cause, country and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing-power-parity-adjusted US dollars. Findings Globally, 8.42 million (95% UI: 6.50, 10.52) deaths and 163.68 million (116.03, 219.44) YLL were attributable to ambient PM2.5 in 2016. The average attributable mortality for the older population was 12 times higher than for those younger than 60 years old. In 2016, the global health economic cost of ambient PM2.5 pollution for the older population was US$2.40 trillion (1.89, 2.93) accounting for 59% of the cost for the total population. The health cost for the older population alone was equivalent to 2.1% (1.7%, 2.6%) of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. While the economic cost per capita for the older population was US$2739 (2160, 3345) in 2016, the cost per capita for the younger population was only US$268 (205, 335). From 2000 to 2016, the annual global health economic cost for the total population increased from US$2.37 trillion (1.88, 2.87) to US$4.09 trillion (3.19, 5.05). Decomposing the factors that contributed to the rise in health economic costs, we found that increases in GDP per capita, population ageing, population growth, age-specific mortality reduction, and PM2.5 exposure changed the total health economic cost by 77%, 21.2%, 15.6%, -41.1% and -0.2%, respectively. Compared to using an age-invariant VSLY or an age-invariant value of a statistical life (VSL), the estimates of the older population share of the total health economic cost using an age-adjusted VSLY was 2 and 18 percentage points lower, respectively. Interpretation The health economic cost borne by the older population almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population ageing and population growth. Compared to younger individuals, air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs amongst the older population, even after accounting for their relatively shorter remaining life expectancy and increased disability. The age-specific estimates of health economic cost inform the optimal design of air pollution reduction strategies and allocation of healthcare resources. The positive relationship between age and economic costs suggests that countries with severe air pollution and rapid aging rates would particularly benefit from improving their air quality. In addition, strategies aimed at enhancing healthcare services, especially for the older population, may be beneficial for reducing the costs of ambient air pollution.","Yin, H.; Brauer, M.; Zhang, J.; Cai, W.; Navrud, S.; Burnett, R.; Howard, C.; Deng, Z.; Kammen, D.

However, the extent of availability and use of mHealth among healthcare professionals in Ghana is not known. The main objective of this study is to determine the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by health professionals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 285 healthcare professionals across 100 primary healthcare clinics in the Ashanti Region, Ghana. We obtained data on the participants' background, available health infrastructure, healthcare workforce competency, ownership of a mobile wireless device, usefulness of mHealth, ease of use of mHealth, user satisfaction, and behavioural intention to use mHealth. Descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize healthcare professionals' demographics and clinical features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the influence of the demographic factors on the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support. STATA version 15 was used to compute all the statistical analyses. Findings: Out of the 285 healthcare professionals, 62.8% indicated that mHealth applications are available to them, while 37.2% had no access to mHealth. Of the 185 healthcare professionals who had access to mHealth, 98.4% are currently using mHealth to support healthcare delivery. Logistic regression model analysis significantly (p< 0.05) identified factors associated with the availability and use of mHealth applications for disease diagnosis and treatment support. There was a significant association between the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support from the chi-square test analysis. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a low-level use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by healthcare professionals at the rural primary healthcare clinics. We encourage policymakers to promote the implementation of mHealth in rural primary health clinics.","Osei, E.; Agyei, K.; Tlou, B.; Mashamba-Thompson, T.

In order to explore this phenomenon, we sought to compare the early immune responses against AZD1222 and BNT162b2. SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants received a single dose of either vaccine and were analyzed for immune cell, effector T cell and antibody dynamics. AZD1222 induced transient leukopenia and major changes among innate and adaptive subpopulations. Both vaccines induced spike protein specific effector T cells which were dominated by Th1 responses following AZD1222 vaccination. A significant reduction of anti-inflammatory T cells upon re-stimulation was also restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees. While IgM and IgG were the dominant isotypes elicited by AZD1222, BNT162b2 led to a significant production of IgG and IgA. Our results suggest that the strategy for spike antigen delivery impacts on how and to what extent immune priming against the main SARS-CoV-2 antigen proceeds.","MuÌller, M.; Volzke, J.; Subin, B.; MuÌller, S.; Sombetzki, M.; Reisinger, E.

A causal relationship between the composition of the respiratory microbiota and the likelihood of development and the severity of COVID-19 may be hypothesized. We analyze biomaterial from nasopharyngeal smears from 336 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, selected during the first and second waves of the epidemic in Russia. Sequences from a similar study conducted in Spain were also included in the analysis. We investigated associations between disease severity and microbiota at the level of microbial community (community types) and individual microbes (differentially represented species). To search for associations, we performed multivariate analysis, taking into account comorbidities, type of community and lineage of the virus. We found that two out of six community types are associated with a more severe course of the disease, and one of the community types is characterized by high stability (very similar microbiota profiles in different patients) and low level of lung damage. Differential abundance analysis with respect to comorbidities and community type suggested association of Rothia and Streptococcus genera representatives with more severe lung damage, and Leptotrichia, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Prevotella with milder forms of the disease.","Babenko, V.; Bakhtyev, R.; Baklaushev, V.; Balykova, L.; Bashkirov, P.; Bespyatykh, J.; Blagonravova, A.; Boldyreva, D.; Fedorov, D.; Gafurov, I.; Gaifullina, R.; Galeeva, J.; Galova, E.; Gospodaryk, A.; Ilina, E.; Ivanov, K.; Kharlampieva, D.; Khromova, P.; Klimina, K.; Kolontarev, K.; Kolyshkina, N.; Koritsky, A.; Kuropatkin, V.; Lazarev, V.; Manolov, A.; Manuvera, V.; Matyushkina, D.; Morozov, M.; Moskaleva, E.; Musarova, V.; Ogarkov, O.; Orlova, E.; Pavlenko, A.; Petrova, A.; Pozhenko, N.; Pushkar, D.; Rumyantsev, A.; Rumyantsev, S.; Rumyantsev, V.; Rychkova, L.; Samoilov, A.; Shirokova, I.; Sinkov, V.; Solovieva, S.; Starikova, E.; Tikhonova, P.; Trifonova, G.; Troitsky, A.; Tulichev, A.; Udalov, Y.; Varizhuk, A.; Vasiliev, A.; Vereshchagin, R.; Veselovsky, V.; Volnukhin, A.; Yusubalieva, G.; Govorun, V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461025,139

Amongst all the industries impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, travel and tourism has been the hardest hit. Operators across the value chain are trying to innovate and improvise in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on cash flows and working capital. The primary purpose of this paper then is to take a closer look at the measures adopted by the Indian hotel industry to restore revenues, conserve resources and attain greater operational and cost efficiencies in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. The article also brings to the fore the growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of a ""new normal"" in the post-Covid world. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on primary data collected via a survey, followed by a series of interviews with a select group of senior finance managers from a wide spectrum of hotels based in India. Findings Our findings suggest that Indian hotels have adopted several measures to enhance cash flows/revenues, reduce operating costs and cash outflows and conserve resources in order to tide themselves over during the crisis. Prominent cash flow-enhancing measures include price drops on special offers and reductions on list prices. Cost-cutting measures include economizing on energy consumption, reductions in labour costs and the postponement of maintenance expenses and discretionary spending. Resource conservation measures that have been adopted focus on postponement of capital expenditure and an increasing shift to localizing supply chains. Growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of the long-term ""new normal"" include restructuring of the workforce and measures aimed at attracting domestic tourists and increasing product diversity. Originality/value This study attempts to understand the short-term and long-term financial management strategies adopted by Indian hotels in the face of unprecedented disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The ADA standards of care recommend integration of psychosocial screening into comprehensive medical care, but this is challenging in settings with limited mental health services. Here, we describe our quality improvement (QI) process for implementing depression screening in a pediatric diabetes center with limited mental health services. Methods: This QI project took place in a pediatric children's hospital that includes 3 satellite clinics. Routine diabetes care does not include integrated social work or psychology providers. Our goal is to increase PHQ-9 screening from 0% to 80% over 2 years in patients with diabetes (T1 or T2D) >11 yrs old across all 4 sites and to provide appropriate follow-up services for 100% of positive screens. We began our QI project in Dec. 2019 and present data through Oct. 2020. This includes 4 Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles ranging from trialing PHQ-9 screening with a single provider (Cycle 1) to implementing PHQ-9 screening across all providers and sites utilizing more efficient EMR processes (Cycle 4). Results: Cycle 1 demonstrated a baseline screening average of 35.7%, of which 11.4% had a positive PHQ-9 screen. Screening rates improved by the end of Cycle 4 to 46-88% across the 4 sites. 100% of patients with positive screens were referred to Behavioral Health for further evaluation and treatment. Of note, screening rates decreased in April/May 2020 (Cycle 2), due to COVID and subsequent clinic closure. Conclusions: Our QI methodology was effective in implementing depression screening in adolescent patients with rates of screening increasing over time and at all of our sites as more efficient methods were utilized. Continued efforts to screen and follow-up will focus on addressing barriers to evaluating and obtaining treatment for depression.","Gurnurkar, Shilpa Vyas Neha V.; Patel, Unnati Pierce Jessica",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-832-p,139
177711,Practice Notes from the AAAI,2021,"In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have witnessed immense growth in popularity. Now, due to the recent Covid19 pandemic situation, it is important to push the limits of online education. Discussion forums are primary means of interaction among learners and instructors. However, with growing class size, students face the challenge of finding useful and informative discussion forums. This problem can be solved by matching the interest of students with thread contents. The fundamental challenge is that the student interests drift as they progress through the course, and forum contents evolve as students or instructors update them. In our paper, we propose to predict future interest trajectories of students. Our model consists of two key operations: 1) Update operation and 2) Projection operation. Update operation models the interdependency between the evolution of student and thread using coupled Recurrent Neural Networks when the student posts on the thread. The projection operation learns to estimate future embedding of students and threads. For students, the projection operation learns the drift in their interests caused by the change in the course topic they study. The projection operation for threads exploits how different posts induce varying interest levels in a student according to the thread structure. Extensive experimentation on three real-world MOOC datasets shows that our model significantly outperforms other baselines for thread recommendation.","Pandey, S.; Lan, A.; Karypis, G.; Srivastava, J.",20th Ieee International Conference on Data Mining Workshops,https://doi.org/10.1109/icdmw51313.2020.00062,139

Imagine a nursing home housing 28 seniors and 7 staff workers, in which one of the staff has tested positive for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the results of this test are 3 days late and the infected person had not been quarantining while waiting for their test results. What is now the individual risk to the different people living in this nursing home? If the home has access to two rapid COVID-19 viral tests, who should they be given to and why? In order to answer questions like this, we need to study stochastic models rather than deterministic ones. Unlike the vast majority of works that analyze various deterministic models, stochastic models are required when analyzing the risk of COVID-19 to individual people rather than tracking aggregate numbers in a given region. More specifically, this paper compares the results provided by analyzing stochastic and deterministic models and investigating when it is suitable to use the different models. In particular, we show why it is not suitable to use deterministic models when analyzing the spread in small communities and how these questions can be better addressed using stochastic ones. Finally, we show the added complications that arise due to the relatively long incubation period of COVID-19, and how it can be addressed.

They are a major reason for poor overall health and decreased quality of life. Sleep medicine education is limited at most medical schools, resulting in limited awareness of this important aspect of healthcare. The aim of the study is to assess sleep medicine knowledge of graduating medical students in Lebanon and to assess their readiness to tackle sleep health issues in a country during an unprecedented crisis. Methods Final-year medical students at 7 medical schools in Lebanon were invited to fill a survey between January 2020 and March 2021. The Assessment of Sleep Knowledge in Medical Education survey was used to assess their knowledge in sleep medicine. The curriculum organizers at the medical schools were also surveyed. Student’s t-test was used for analysis. Results 158 and 58 students completed the survey during 2020 and 2021, with a mean overall score on sleep knowledge of was 17.5 and 15.9 /30, respectively. There was no difference in mean knowledge scores by gender, age, American versus European medical school systems, and between medical schools that included sleep medicine in their curriculum versus those that did not. Conclusions Presence of sleep medicine education in the curriculum was associated with higher scores on ASKME among graduating Lebanese medical students. Overall, the new crop of physicians in Lebanon possesses a relatively good knowledge base in sleep medicine. Nevertheless, more effort should be made to uniformly maintain this level of sleep education.","Aoun, Raissa; Zibara, Victor; Costanian, Christy; Attarian, Hrayr; Bahous, Sola Aoun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.09.451820,139

Several institutions launched remote patient monitoring programs (RPMPs) to care for patients with COVID-19. We describe patients' perspectives on a COVID-19 RPMP at a National Comprehensive Cancer Center. Methods: Adult patients who had either tested positive for COVID-19 on an outpatient microbiology test or were discharged after hospitalization for the virus were eligible. Patients enrolled in the RPMP received a daily 10-question electronic patient-reported outcome assessment of COVID-19 symptoms and their responses generated alerts to a centralized monitoring team for new or worsening symptoms. A subset of high-risk patients also received a pulse oximeter which alerted when blood oxygen levels dropped below 93%. RPM was discontinued 14 days after a patient's positive test result and following 3 days without worsening symptoms or fever. Patients who exited the program and had completed at least one assessment were sent a patient engagement survey. The objective of the survey was to evaluate the patient's experience with digital monitoring and symptom management for COVID-19. The assessment was structured with objective response questions, including a net promoter score, and free text questions to elicit patient perspectives on RPM value. Free text responses were analyzed using grounded theory to identify primary themes regarding perceived value. Results: The survey was distributed to 452 patients;241 responded as of June 10, 2020 (53% completion rate). The net promoter score was 91%. The table provides responses to objective questions. Qualitative analysis of free text responses identified the primary themes regarding patient perceived value which included: 1) Security: patients appreciated that the RPMP provided a clinical safety net;2) Connection: patients appreciated the link to their clinical team during a period of isolation;3) Empowerment: patients appreciated that the RPMP provided education on the virus and symptom management. Conclusions: RPMPs are perceived to be of value to oncology patients with COVID-19. A key barrier to maintaining these programs is cost. Policymakers should consider how these programs can be reimbursed in the future so that they can continue to provide care to vulnerable patients and keep them at home out of the acute care setting.","Daly, R.

It is widely accepted that the quality of cryoEM maps varies locally; therefore, the evaluation of the maps-derived structural models must be done locally as well. In this article, a method for the local analysis of the map-to-model fit is presented. The algorithm uses a comparison of two local resolution maps. The first is the local FSC (Fourier shell correlation) between the full map and the model, while the second is calculated between the half maps normally used in typical single particle analysis workflows. We call the new quality measure “FSC-Q”, and it is a quantitative estimation of how much of the model is supported by the signal content of the map. Furthermore, we show that FSC-Q may be helpful to avoid overfitting.

In the Maternity Department at St Thomas’s hospital in London, COVID-19 positive patients were cared for separately on Hospital Birth Centre and cancellation of elective theatre lists led to empty theatres and under-utilised surgical wards.Over a 6 week period, we looked at the relocation of the low risk elective caesarean section (ELCS) pathway or ‘green’ according to a devised Traffic light Criteria, to a separate floor and evaluated the impact on relevant process measures. This involved strong leadership and multidisciplinary team involvement to ensure that the new pathway was integrated smoothly, without disruption to patient care.We compared our data related to this pathway to baseline data from previous work on the ELCS pathway and discussed the pandemic changes and how this created an opportunity to address challenges. We evaluated patient and staff experience using specifically designed questionnaires.On 56% of the days, the average time to discharge was less than 36 hours compared to 48 hours prior to relocation during COVID-19. 67% of cases were completed in less than 45 minutes. On 33% of days during the relocation period, all cases were in theatre before 09:15am compared to 20% prior to relocation. There were no HDU admissions and 7 postpartum haemorrhages (EBL &lt;1000mls).Overall positive patient feedback was obtained from the 17 completed questionnaires during the relocation. However, only 65% of women felt they were given adequate information about the birth of their baby and 53% about their postnatal recovery. 50% of trainees felt that their learning experience had improved with respect to performing ELCS.This work has shown that challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic can present opportunities for innovative solutions to be developed and implemented at short notice.","Mitchell, Sian Kuhrt Katharine Wachtendorff Sylvia McMicking Jess Lloyd Jillian",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.192,139

Despite having high standards of knowledge and practices, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety or fear. Being on the list of high-risk professions, dentists are very much expected to develop stress due to the current pandemic situation indicating a need to evaluate the effect of COVID 19 on the psychological status of Indian dentists. Methodology: The data was collected through well-structured Google form from 500 dentists working in Delhi NCR. The entire form had two components. The first part of the form collected the information regarding the demographic profile of the dentists whereas the second part of questionnaire consisted of psychological evaluation using well established psychological scale DASS 21. Result: The results showed that 8% of Indian dentist showed signs of severe depression and 17% had moderate signs. 9% showed moderate and 13% showed mild anxiety. 8% showed severe stress and 24% had moderate signs of stress. Significant correlation was found between depression and anxiety with stress. Conclusion: Dentists are undergoing stress which in turn can have adverse effects on their physical and mental well-being in a long run. There is a need to evolve with the current COVID 19 pandemic and brainstorming the ways to encourage the safer practice and decrease the levels of depression, anxiety and stress among dentist.","Golchha, V.; Sharma, P.; Gupta, B.

The settling times of a droplet cloud and its suspended viral dose are significantly affected by the droplet composition. The aerosol (defined as droplets smaller than 5 m resulting from 30 seconds of continued speech has o(1h) settling time and a viable viral dose an order-of-magnitude higher than in a short cough. The time-of-flight to reach 2m is only a few seconds resulting in a viral dose above the minimum required for infection, implying that physical distancing in the absence of ventilation is not sufficient to provide safety for long exposure times. The suspended aerosol emitted by continuous speaking for 1 hour in a poorly ventilated room gives 0.1-11% infection risk for initial viral loads of 10^8-10^10 copies/ml, respectively, decreasing to 0.03-3% for 10 air changes per hour by ventilation.

Non-invasive test to assess IFTA is not available. Methods: We trained, validated and tested a deep learning (DL) system to classify IFTA grade from 6,135 ultrasound images obtained from 352 patients who underwent kidney biopsy. Of 6,135 ultrasound images, 5,523 were used for training (n = 5,122) and validation (n = 401) and 612 to test the accuracy of the DL system. IFTA grade scored by nephropathologist on trichrome stained kidney biopsy slide was used as reference standard. Results: There were 159 patients (2,701 ultrasound images), 74 patients (1,239 ultrasound images), 41 patients (701 ultrasound images) and 78 patients (1,494 ultrasound images) with IFTA grades 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The deep-learning classification system used masked images based on a 91% accurate kidney segmentation routine. The performance matrices for the deep learning classifier algorithm in the validation set showed excellent precision (90%), recall (76%), accuracy (84%) and F1-score (80%). In the independent test set also, performance matrices showed excellent precision (90%), recall (80%), accuracy (87%) and F1-score of (84%).

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.","Hao, Junheng; Ju, Chelsea; Chen, Muhao; Sun, Yizhou; Zaniolo, Carlo; Wang, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04283v1.pdf,139

Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects (terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc.). Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the major subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and computational logic. These algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields, including software science, which covers a broad range of topics about software construction and analysis. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning algorithms are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in particular, combined with symbolic computation. Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and symbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known as cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that interact with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale. The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern artificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper by Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program included three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a special session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online.

185731,Functional Independence following Endovascular Treatment for Basilar Artery Occlusion despite Extensive Bilateral Pontine Infarcts on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging: Refuting a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.,2016,"This paper analyzes the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a small tourism dependent open economy. The lockdown affected both the demand side and the supply side of the economy, as production of goods and services dramatically dropped due to firms' shutdowns, broken supply chains, or bankruptcies, and aggregate demand diminished due to lower consumer confidence and investment cutbacks, accompanied by a dramatic fall in international tourism demand, in particular due to travel restrictions. We look on these sup-ply and demand changes through the lens of a macroeconomic model of a small open econ-omy, comprising an industrial and a tourism sector. For this purpose, we modify Schubert's (2013) model by introducing a multiple shock which reflects (i) reduced sectoral productivi-ties due to, e.g., broken supply chains, (ii) a drop in employment due to firms' lockdowns, and (iii) a sharp decline in international tourism demand. We find that the multiple shock leads to an immediate drop in GDP and a boost of the short-run unemployment rate, followed by a gradual transition back to steady state. The adverse effects on the tourism sector are the more severe the slower international tourism demand reverts to pre-crisis levels, but they do not strongly spill over to the industrial sector. Furthermore, even if international tourism demand recovers quickly, the effects on the industrial sector barely change. The length of the industrial sector's recovery basically depends on the speed of restoring its sectoral productivity rather than on international tourism demand. The reason for this result can be found in the absorbing effect of the relative price of tourism services in terms of the industrial good.","Schubert, S.

The condition is usually precipitated by a viral infection or vaccination. The presenting features include an acute encephalopathy with multifocal neurologic signs and deficits. Children are preferentially affected. In the absence of specific biologic markers, the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on the clinical and radiologic features. Although ADEM usually has a monophasic course, recurrent or multiphasic forms have been reported, raising diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing these cases from multiple sclerosis (MS).

However, according to the literature, 2% of patients who received plasma from convalescents developed Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI). The most common causes of TRALI are anti-leukocyte antibodies directed against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) class I and II and against Human Neutrophil Antigens (HNA). Therefore, patients with COVID-19 may only be transfused with plasma from convalescent women with a history of pregnancy after testing negative for anti-leucocyte antibodies in the pre-plasmapheresis blood sample.","Wendlocha, Dominika; Janusz, Aleksandra; Janusz, Joanna; Krolewska-Daszczynska, Patrycja; Englisz, Aleksandra; Smycz-Kubanska, Marta; Mielczarek-Palacz, Aleksandra",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218245/,139
187757,Respiratory tract viral infections in inner-city asthmatic adults.,1998,"BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome that is often fatal despite treatment. It is caused by a dysregulation in natural killer T-cell function, resulting in activation and proliferation of histiocytes with uncontrolled hemophagocytosis and cytokines overproduction. The syndrome is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and hyperferritinemia. HLH can be either primary, with a genetic aetiology, or secondary, associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, or infections. AIM To focus on secondary HLH complicating zoonotic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed search of human cases of HLH occurring during zoonotic diseases was performed combining the terms (haemophagocytic or haemophagocytosis or hemophagocytosis or hemophagocytic or erythrophagocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome) with each one of the etiological agents of zoonoses. RESULTS Among bacterial diseases, most papers reported cases occurring during brucellosis, rickettsial diseases and Q fever. Regarding viral diseases, most of the cases were reported in patients with avian influenza A subtype H5N1. Among the protozoan zoonoses, most of the cases were reported in patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Regarding zoonotic fungi, most of the cases were reported in AIDS patient with histoplasmosis. No cases of secondary HLH were reported in patient with zoonotic helminthes. CONCLUSIONS Zoonotic diseases are an important cause of HLH. Secondary HLH can delay the correct diagnosis of the zoonotic disease, and can contribute to an adverse outcome.","Cascio, A; Pernice, L M; Barberi, G; Delfino, D; Biondo, C; Beninati, C; Mancuso, G; Rodriguez-Morales, A J; Iaria, C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104648/,139

This study characterizes the inhibitory effect of ATA on vaccinia virus replication in HeLa, Huh7, and AD293 cells. Vaccinia virus replication is significantly abrogated upon ATA treatment, which is associated with the inhibition of early viral gene transcription. This inhibitory effect may be attributed to two findings. First, ATA blocks the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, an event shown to be essential for vaccinia virus replication. Second, ATA inhibits the phosphatase activity of the viral enzyme H1L, which is required to initiate viral transcription. Thus, ATA inhibits vaccinia virus replication by targeting both cellular and viral factors essential for the early stage of replication.","Myskiw, Chad; Deschambault, Yvon; Jefferies, Kristel; He, Runtao; Cao, Jingxin",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17192307/,139
188135,Nursing2007 infection control survey report.,2007,"PROBLEM/CONDITION In 2012, the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide was projected to reach a new high of 1 billion arrivals, a 48% increase from 674 million arrivals in 2000. International travel also is increasing among U.S. residents. In 2009, U.S. residents made approximately 61 million trips outside the country, a 5% increase from 1999. Travel-related morbidity can occur during or after travel. Worldwide, 8% of travelers from industrialized to developing countries report becoming ill enough to seek health care during or after travel. Travelers have contributed to the global spread of infectious diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens. Therefore, surveillance of travel-related morbidity is an essential component of global public health surveillance and will be of greater importance as international travel increases worldwide. REPORTING PERIOD September 1997-December 2011. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM GeoSentinel is a clinic-based global surveillance system that tracks infectious diseases and other adverse health outcomes in returned travelers, foreign visitors, and immigrants. GeoSentinel comprises 54 travel/tropical medicine clinics worldwide that electronically submit demographic, travel, and clinical diagnosis data for all patients evaluated for an illness or other health condition that is presumed to be related to international travel. Clinical information is collected by physicians with expertise or experience in travel/tropical medicine. Data collected at all sites are entered electronically into a database, which is housed at and maintained by CDC. The GeoSentinel network membership program comprises 235 additional clinics in 40 countries on six continents. Although these network members do not report surveillance data systematically, they can report unusual or concerning diagnoses in travelers and might be asked to perform enhanced surveillance in response to specific health events or concerns. RESULTS During September 1997-December 2011, data were collected on 141,789 patients with confirmed or probable travel-related diagnoses. Of these, 23,006 (16%) patients were evaluated in the United States, 10,032 (44%) of whom were evaluated after returning from travel outside of the United States (i.e., after-travel patients). Of the 10,032 after-travel patients, 4,977 (50%) were female, 4,856 (48%) were male, and 199 (2%) did not report sex; the median age was 34 years. Most were evaluated in outpatient settings (84%), were born in the United States (76%), and reported current U.S. residence (99%). The most common reasons for travel were tourism (38%), missionary/volunteer/research/aid work (24%), visiting friends and relatives (17%), and business (15%). The most common regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan Africa (23%), Central America (15%), and South America (12%). Fewer than half (44%) reported having had a pretravel visit with a health-care provider. Of the 13,059 diagnoses among the 10,032 after-travel patients, the most common diagnoses were acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%), postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (5%), giardiasis (3%), and chronic unknown diarrhea (3%). The most common diagnostic groupings were acute diarrhea (22%), nondiarrheal gastrointestinal (15%), febrile/systemic illness (14%), and dermatologic (12%). Among 1,802 patients with febrile/systemic illness diagnoses, the most common diagnosis was Plasmodium falciparum malaria (19%). The rapid communication component of the GeoSentinel network has allowed prompt responses to important health events affecting travelers; during 2010 and 2011, the notification capability of the GeoSentinel network was used in the identification and public health response to East African trypanosomiasis in Eastern Zambia and North Central Zimbabwe, P. vivax malaria in Greece, and muscular sarcocystosis on Tioman Island, Malaysia. INTERPRETATION The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance System is the largest repository of provider-based data on travel-related illness. Among ill travelers evaluated in U.S. GeoSentinel sites after returning from international travel, gastrointestinal diagnoses were most frequent, suggesting that U.S. travelers might be exposed to unsafe food and water while traveling internationally. The most common febrile/systemic diagnosis was P. falciparum malaria, suggesting that some U.S. travelers to malarial areas are not receiving or using proper malaria chemoprophylaxis or mosquito-bite avoidance measures. The finding that fewer than half of all patients reported having made a pretravel visit with a health-care provider indicates that a substantial portion of U.S. travelers might not be following CDC travelers' health recommendations for international travel. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION GeoSentinel surveillance data have helped researchers define an evidence base for travel medicine that has informed travelers' health guidelines and the medical evaluation of ill international travelers. These data suggest that persons traveling internationally from the United States to developing countries remain at risk for illness. Health-care providers should help prepare travelers properly for safe travel and provide destination-specific medical evaluation of returning ill travelers. Training for health-care providers should focus on preventing and treating a variety of travel-related conditions, particularly traveler's diarrhea and malaria.","Harvey, Kira; Esposito, Douglas H; Han, Pauline; Kozarsky, Phyllis; Freedman, David O; Plier, D Adam; Sotir, Mark J",Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Ten of the monoclonal antibodies were of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, one was IgG2a, and one was IgM. All had kappa light chains. By immunohistochemistry four monoclonal antibodies detected bovine coronavirus and elk coronavirus in formalin-fixed intestinal tissues. Antinucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies were found to be better at ruminant coronavirus detection than the anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies. Because nucleoprotein is a more abundant antigen than spike protein in infected cells, this was not an unexpected finding.","Daginakatte, G C; Chard-Bergstrom, C; Andrews, G A; Kapil, S",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10225833/,139

In healthcare, outpatient care is a high-risk frontline of infection transmission in both patients and healthcare professionals. The presence of routine digital communication, remote data management and the availability of glucose monitoring and insulin delivery devices have given diabetology a certain advantage in this situation. However, the potential of these modalities has not been fully utilized so far. We provide an overview of practical methods of distance patient management, which can be used in most diabetes outpatient clinics without any difficult adjustments or additional investments. This approach can be used in different patients according to their treatment strategies and individual abilities.","Saudek, František; Picková, Klára",Vnitrni lekarstvi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972177/,139
192086,Mechanical Thrombectomy Using Solitaire in a 6-Year-Old Child.,2015,"OBJECTIVE To study the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 34 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing. METHODS All patients were admitted to the isolation wards. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Eight patients came from a family, and 15 patients were medical staff. The mean age of patients was (33.4 +/- 13.4) years. The latent period varied from 2 to 14 days (median 4 days). The most common symptoms were fever (100%), palpitation (91.7%), myalgia (79.2%), headache (70.8%), diarrhea (73.9%) and cough (58.3%). The mean leucocyte count was (4.6 +/- 1.4) x 10(9)/L, and the mean lymphocyte ratio was 0.27 +/- 0.11. 68.4% of the patients had lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 1.3 x 10(9)/L). Other common findings included elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation (76.2%, 28.6% and 47.8%, respectively), and decreased levels of serum iron and albumin (63.2% and 47.8%, respectively). Thirty-two cases had abnormal chest radiographs. In 2 cases in whom typical lung opacities could not be found on the initial plain chest radiographs, thoracic CT proved to be useful. Postmortem examination of 1 patient revealed marked edema with foci of hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, hemorrhage necrosis and a obvious decline of cells in lymph glands. In a multivariate analysis (Stata 7.0), the independent predictor of an adverse outcome was advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.63; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS Fever, lymphopenia, low serum iron and chest radiograph are helpful to diagnose SARS early; age is the independent predictor of an outcome.","Jiang, Tian-jun; Zhou, Xian-zhi; Zhao, Min; Zhou, Zhi-ping; Jiang, Su-chun; Ye, Wen-hua; Li, Yong-gang; Zhao, Jing-min; Mao, Yuan-li; Ma, Wei; Qu, Fen; Wang, Ye; He, Jing; Nie, Wei-min; Zhang, Yun-hui; Xie, Yang-xin; Yan, Hui-ying",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12895317/,139

This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA), Pahang, Malaysia and to identify the clinical and laboratory markers for severe disease, complications and virologic clearance according to clinical staging. METHODS This was a single-centre, retrospective, descriptive study. All COVID-19 patients admitted to HTAA from March 9 to April 15, 2020, were included in the study. Patients were categorised according to clinical staging. Data obtained from the medical report includes baseline characteristics of patients, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments, complications, and outcomes. RESULTS Of the total of 247 patients hospitalised, the majority consisted at clinical-stage 1 (43%) and stage 2 (39%) disease. Older patients, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney disease were found more common among patients with severe disease. Fever was uncommon and the majority had normal haemoglobin levels, white cell counts, and platelet counts. C-reactive protein (CRP) was found statistically significant to predict pneumonia or hypoxia at a cut-off value of 14mg/L (sensitivity 73.8%, specificity 91.3%) and 50mg/L (sensitivity 100%, specificity 96.4%) respectively. Pneumonia was mostly diagnosed radiologically using chest radiography, especially among clinical stage 3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a significant complication, with 31% of clinical stage 3 and above developed AKI and 44% of them requiring haemodialysis. Median virologic clearance time was 15 days from onset of illness, and asymptomatic patients had longer clearance time. CONCLUSION COVID-19 presented with a wide spectrum of clinical patterns. CRP was a valuable predictor of severe disease. In this study risk and severity of acute kidney injury were found to be higher. A longer duration of virologic clearance was observed among the asymptomatic patients.","Soh, T V; Dzawani, M; Noorlina, N; Nik, F; Norazmi, A",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918413/,139

It is not known whether these coronaviruses are endocytosed before fusion with a membrane of the target cell, causing a productive infection, or whether they fuse directly with the plasma membrane. We have studied the interaction between TGEV and a cell line (MDCK) stably expressing recombinant pig aminopeptidase N (pAPN). By electron microscopy and flow cytometry, TGEV was found to be associated with the plasma membrane after adsorption to the pAPN-MDCK cells. TGEV was also observed in endocytic pits and apical vesicles after 3 to 10 min of incubation at 38 degrees C. The number of pits and apical vesicles was increased by the TGEV incubation, indicating an increase in endocytosis. After 10 min of incubation, a distinct TGEV-pAPN-containing population of large intracellular vesicles, morphologically compatible with endosomes, was found. A higher density of pAPN receptors was observed in the pits beneath the virus particles than in the surrounding plasma membrane, indicating that TGEV recruits pAPN receptors before endocytosis. Ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 markedly inhibited the TGEV infection as judged from virus production and protein biosynthesis analyses but did so only when added early in the course of the infection, i.e., about 1 h after the start of endocytosis. Together our results point to an acid intracellular compartment as the site of fusion for TGEV.","Hansen, G H; Delmas, B; Besnardeau, L; Vogel, L K; Laude, H; Sjöström, H; Norén, O",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420255/,139

Early manifestations of infection include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. Left untreated, late manifestations involving the joints, heart, and nervous system can occur. A Healthy People 2010 objective (14-8) is to reduce the annual incidence of Lyme disease to 9.7 new cases per 100,000 population in 10 reference states where the disease is endemic (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). This report summarizes surveillance data for 64,382 Lyme disease cases reported to CDC during 2003-2005, of which 59,770 cases (93%) were reported from the 10 reference states. The average annual rate in these 10 reference states for the 3-year period (29.2 cases per 100,000 population) was approximately three times the Healthy People 2010 target.

Determination of the 870-aa structure reveals that it has four domains similar to the tricorn-interacting factor F3. The thermolysin-like active site is enclosed within a large cavity with a volume of 2,200 A(3), which is inaccessible to substrates except for a small opening of approximately 8-10 A. The substrate-based inhibitor bestatin binds to the protein with minimal changes, suggesting that this is the active form of the enzyme. The previously described structure of F3 had three distinct conformations that were described as ""closed,"" ""intermediate,"" and ""open."" The structure of aminopeptidase N from E. coli, however, is substantially more closed than any of these. Taken together, the results suggest that these proteases, which are involved in intracellular peptide degradation, prevent inadvertent hydrolysis of inappropriate substrates by enclosing the active site within a large cavity. There is also some evidence that the open form of the enzyme, which admits substrates, remains inactive until it adopts the closed form.","Addlagatta, Anthony; Gay, Leslie; Matthews, Brian W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16938892/,139

On a global level, approximately two-thirds of those individuals living on less than US$2 per day keep livestock. Consequently, there is a need to better target animal health interventions for poverty reduction using an evidence-based approach. Therefore, the paper offers a three-step prioritisation framework using calculations derived from standard poverty measures: the poverty gap and the head count ratio. Data from 265 poor livestock-keeping households in Kenya informed the study. The results demonstrate that, across a spectrum of producers, the dependence upon particular species varies. Furthermore, the same livestock disease has differing impacts on the depth and severity of poverty. Consequently, animal health interventions need to account for variability in income effects at the species and disease levels.","Heffernan, C",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462148/,139

The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. Methods In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. Results A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. Conclusion Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery. For confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.","Panahi, Latif; Amiri, Marzieh; Pouy, Somaye",Archives of academic emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232217/,139

These are the replicase gene 1a/1b and the four structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E), and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the virus. In addition, this genome also contains nine other potential ORFs varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids. The largest among these is the first ORF of the second longest subgenomic RNA, and this protein (termed U274 in the present study) consists of 274 amino acids and contains three putative transmembrane domains. Using antibody specific for the C terminus of U274, we show U274 to be expressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and, in addition to the full-length protein, two other processed forms were also detected. By indirect immunofluorescence, U274 was localized to the perinuclear region, as well as to the plasma membrane, in both transfected and infected cells. Using an N terminus myc-tagged U274, the topology of U274 and its expression on the cell surface were confirmed. Deletion of a cytoplasmic domain of U274, which contains Yxxphi and diacidic motifs, abolished its transport to the cell surface. In addition, U274 expressed on the cell surface can internalize antibodies from the culture medium into the cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also showed that U274 could interact specifically with the M, E, and S structural proteins, as well as with U122, another protein that is unique to SARS-CoV.","Tan, Yee-Joo; Teng, Eileen; Shen, Shuo; Tan, Timothy H P; Goh, Phuay-Yee; Fielding, Burtram C; Ooi, Eng-Eong; Tan, Hwee-Cheng; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194747/,139
198754,Aberrant expression of CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors in patients with asthma.,2006,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are common causes of diarrhea in children in developing countries. Dual infections with both pathogens have been noted fairly frequently in studies of diarrhea around the world. In previous laboratory work, we noted that cholera toxin and forskolin markedly potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release from the host cell, and this potentiated release was found to be mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. In this study, we examined whether the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) or the heat-stable toxin (STa, also known as ST) potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release. We found that crude ETEC culture filtrates, as well as purified ETEC toxins, did potentiate EPEC-induced ATP release in cultured T84 cells. Coinfection of T84 cells with live ETEC plus EPEC bacteria also resulted in enhanced ATP release compared to EPEC alone. In Ussing chamber studies of chloride secretion, adenine nucleotides released from the host by EPEC also significantly enhanced the chloride secretory responses that were triggered by crude ETEC filtrates, purified STa, and the peptide hormone guanylin. In addition, adenosine and LT had additive or synergistic effects in inducing vacuole formation in T84 cells. Therefore, ETEC toxins and EPEC-induced damage to the host cell both enhance the virulence of the other type of E. coli. Our in vitro data demonstrate a molecular basis for a microbial interaction, which could result in increased severity of disease in vivo in individuals who are coinfected with ETEC and EPEC.","Crane, John K; Choudhari, Shilpa S; Naeher, Tonniele M; Duffey, Michael E",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495521/,139

The viral nucleocapsid protein encoded by the PCV2 ORF2 gene has recently been identified as the most immunoreactive viral protein that carries type-specific antigenic determinants. The ORF2 sequence of the IAF-2897 strain of PCV2 has been cloned into a pCEP5 eucaryotic expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, downstream of a polyhistidine sequence tag. The recombinant plasmid was used in transfection experiments with human epithelial kidney 293 cells that were further tested, and positive expression of the viral nucleocapsid protein was confirmed by IFA and Western blotting. Strong, specific fluorescence was observed in the nuclei of transfected cells. Test specificity to PCV2 was verified with several related infectious agents. Sensitivity was compared to that of standard IFA using PCV2-infected cells by evaluating the reactivities of 44 field serum samples from pigs on farms with a porcine population suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. The recombinant nucleocapsid-based test was able to detect 15 more positive-testing pigs than the PCV2-based IFA. Therefore, the relative sensitivity of the latter test was estimated at only 57.1% compared to that of the recombinant nucleocapsid-based test. The recombinant fusion protein has been purified by affinity chromatography and is being used to develop further sensitive serological tests.","Racine, Sébastien; Kheyar, Ali; Gagnon, Carl A; Charbonneau, Benoît; Dea, Serge",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15242949/,139

The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of patients who initially tested negative, and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS This retrospective observational study utilised data from the LabPlus Virology laboratory, Auckland City Hospital, to identify cases (hospital and community) with initial negative and subsequent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. Their clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarised. RESULTS From 1 February to 13 April a total of 20,089 samples were received for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of 2,011 samples from patients with multiple tests, 25 samples were positive. Nine samples were from patients who initially tested negative then tested positive. Reasons for the initial negative test results, which were all from upper respiratory tract samples, included pre-symptomatic presentation or late presentation. All patients had significant risk factors and ongoing or evolving symptoms, which warranted repeat testing. CONCLUSION Few patients had discordant test results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.

205408,"Exploring the utility of extracellular vesicles in ameliorating viral infection-associated inflammation, cytokine storm and tissue damage",2021,"Inpainting-based compression methods are qualitatively promising alternatives to transform-based codecs, but they suffer from the high computational cost of the inpainting step. This prevents them from being applicable to time-critical scenarios such as real-time inpainting of 4K images. As a remedy, we adapt state-of-the-art numerical algorithms of domain decomposition type to this problem. They decompose the image domain into multiple overlapping blocks that can be inpainted in parallel by means of modern GPUs. In contrast to classical block decompositions such as the ones in JPEG, the global inpainting problem is solved without creating block artefacts. We consider the popular homogeneous diffusion inpainting and supplement it with a multilevel version of an optimised restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) method that solves the local problems with a conjugate gradient algorithm. This enables us to perform real-time inpainting of 4K colour images on contemporary GPUs, which is substantially more efficient than previous algorithms for diffusion-based inpainting.","Kamper, Niklas; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03946v2.pdf,139

209005,Agent-Based Campus Novel Coronavirus Infection and Control Simulation,2021-02-22,"A raiva é uma zoonose que afeta todos os mamíferos e causa cerca de 55.000 mortes humanas por ano, causada pelo vírus da raiva. O vírus da raiva pertence à Ordem Mononegavirales, Família Rhabdoviridae e o Gênero Lissavirus. Atualmente, o tratamento humano se baseia no uso do Protocolo de Milwaukee composto de indução do paciente ao coma e uso de massiva terapia antiviral. O protocolo, apesar de ter sido utilizado duas vezes com sucesso, inclusive em um caso brasileiro, ainda requer aprimoramentos. Neste sentido, a interferência por RNA (RNAi) é uma nova abordagem para terapia de doenças virais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a inibição da replicação do vírus da raiva in vitro e in vivo utilizando RNAi. Para tanto, foram utilizados três siRNAs (siRNA 124, siRNA 750, siRNA B) com a fita antisenso complementar ao mRNA da nucleoproteína (N) do vírus da raiva. Para o ensaio in vitro foram utilizadas a cepa PV do vírus da raiva e as células de BHK-21 (Baby hamster kidney). As monocamadas celulares foram infectadas com a cepa PV e depois de 2 horas de incubação transfectadas com cada um dos siRNAs em combinação com Lipofectamine 2000®. Depois de 22 horas as placas teste e controle foram submetidas à imunofluorescência direta (IFD) com conjugado globulina de coelho anti-nucleocapsídeo do vírus da raiva/isotiocianato de fluoresceína (BIO-RADTM). Os resultados revelaram títulos de 5,71logTCID50/ml, 5,56logTCID50/ml e 5,65logTCID50/ml para os siRNAs 124, B e 750, respectivamente, enquanto que, para a placa controle, o título foi 6,43logTCID50/ml. Para o ensaio in vivo, foram usados camundongos albino suíços de 21 dias com peso entre 11 e 14g, infectados com a cepa PV via intracerebral. Duas horas depois da infecção foi inoculada por via intracerebral uma solução do ""pool"" dos três siRNAs com Lipofectamine 2000® . Os animais com paralisia foram sacrificados e aqueles sobreviventes foram observados até completar 30 dias de observação quando foram, então, sacrificados. O sistema nervoso central de todos os animas foi recolhido e submetido a IFD. O título viral do grupo teste foi 7.03logLD50%/ml e do grupo controle 7.13logLD50%/ml. O resultado do ensaio in vitro demonstra que os siRNAs utilizados são efetivos em inibir a replicação do vírus da raiva, com eficiências equivalentes. A utilização do ""pool"" dos três siRNA em camundongos resultou em 30% de animais sobreviventes frente a 100 DL50% do vírus PV, enquanto que a mesma dose levou a 100% de mortalidade nos animais não tratados. Pode-se atribuir a menor eficiência em inibir a replicação do vírus da raiva in vivo quando se compara com os resultados in vitro possivelmente às elevadas doses virais utilizadas. Estes resultados, ainda que indiquem a necessidade de mais estudos, permitem concluir que a RNAi é uma tecnologia promissora como antiviral contra a raiva","Ono, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Durymanova",,,139
209466,Four moments for healthcare facility visitor hand hygiene,2020,"Abstract Circulating nucleic acids, encapsulated within small extracellular vesicles (EVs), provide a remote cellular snapshot of biomarkers derived from diseased tissues, however selective isolation is critical. Current laboratory-based purification techniques rely on the physical properties of small-EVs rather than their inherited cellular fingerprints. We established a highly-selective purification assay, termed EV-CATCHER, initially designed for high-throughput analysis of low-abundance small-RNA cargos by next-generation sequencing. We demonstrated its selectivity by specifically isolating and sequencing small-RNAs from mouse small-EVs spiked into human plasma. Western blotting, nanoparticle tracking, and transmission electron microscopy were used to validate and quantify the capture and release of intact small-EVs. As proof-of-principle for sensitive detection of circulating miRNAs, we compared small-RNA sequencing data from a subset of small-EVs serum-purified with EV-CATCHER to data from whole serum, using samples from a small cohort of recently hospitalized Covid-19 patients. We identified and validated, only in small-EVs, hsa-miR-146a and hsa-miR-126-3p to be significantly downregulated with disease severity. Separately, using convalescent sera from recovered Covid-19 patients with high anti-spike IgG titers, we confirmed the neutralizing properties, against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, of a subset of small-EVs serum-purified by EV-CATCHER, as initially observed with ultracentrifuged small-EVs. Altogether our data highlight the sensitivity and versatility of EV-CATCHER.","Mitchell, Megan I.; Ben-Dov, Iddo Z.; Liu, Christina Ye Kenny Chow Kar Kramer Yael Gangadharan Anju Park Steven Fitzgerald Sean Ramnauth Andrew Perlin David S.; Donato, Michele Bhoy Emily Manouchehri Doulabi Ehsan Poulos Michael Kamali-Moghaddam Masood Loudig Olivier",Journal of Extracellular Vesicles,,139

Seven polypropylene-based fiber filter materials were also measured, including surgical masks and N95 respirators. Additional measurements were performed on both multi-layered and mixed-material samples of natural, synthetic, or natural-synthetic blends to mimic cloth mask construction methods. Materials were micro-imaged and tested against size selected NaCl aerosol with particle mobility diameters between 50 nm and 825 nm. Three of the top five best performing samples were woven 100% cotton with high to moderate yarn counts and the other two were woven synthetics of moderate yarn counts. In contrast to recently published studies, samples utilizing mixed materials did not exhibit a significant difference in the measured FE when compared to the product of the individual FE for the components. The FE and &#916;P increased monotonically with the number of cloth layers for a lightweight flannel, suggesting that multi-layered cloth masks may offer increased protection from nanometer-sized aerosol with a maximum FE dictated by breathability (i.e. &#916;P).","Zangmeister, Christopher D; Radney, James G; Vicenzi, Edward P; Weaver, Jamie Lynn",ACS nano,,139

Here, we studied a COVID-19 subject who represented the symptoms following the full recovery of the first infection. COVID-19 specific IgM and IgG were evaluated in both steps. The viral samples from oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal were subjected to RT-PCR and full sequencing was done in both incidences. The sequencing data was fully investigated with the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes were detected. The obtained data is in favor of re-infection with 128 days of interval. SARS-CoV-2 presented more severely in the second episode of the disease and the specific antibodies against COVID-19 were not detectable. Both infections were caused by the same clade 20G, however, the mutation rates were higher in the second incidence including 10 nucleotide substitutions which had rarely been reported before.

Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.","Silva, Tiago Tiburcio da; Francisquini, Rodrigo; Nascimento, Mari'a C.

231420,Novel coronavirus pneumonia detection and segmentation based on the deep-learning method,2021,"During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, older people were discharged from hospitals to care homes to release NHS beds. This influx of new residents whose COVID-19 status was largely unknown added to the many challenges already experienced by care homes, with serious consequences including an increased number of deaths among residents. The social care sector has been fragile for several years and the pandemic has brought the challenges experienced by care homes to the forefront, prompting renewed calls for improved funding and reform. This article describes the ongoing challenges and additional challenges caused by the pandemic in the care home sector. The authors argue for urgent reform to enhance the status and education of care home staff, move towards registration of the social care workforce in England, and achieve integration of health and social care services for older people.","Wild, Deidre Joan; Szczepura, Ala",Nurs. older people,,139

Patients in cohort 1 presented significant differences in comparison with the other cohorts, including reduced frequencies of lymphocytes, reduced CD8+T-cell count, reduced percentage of activated and intermediate monocytes and an increased B/T8 cell ratio. Over time, patients in cohort 1 who died presented with lower counts of B, T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, NK cells, and activated monocytes. The B/T8 ratio was significantly lower in the group of survivors. In cohort 1, significantly higher levels of IgG1 and IgG3 were found, whereas cohort 3 presented higher levels of IgG3 compared to controls.

These critical factors will help to increase the efficiency of future development and deployment of online learning systems. Through a literature review, this study employed the technology acceptance model, social support, and task–technology fit as the theoretical basis to establish the framework of the online learning environment with regards to the technology acceptance model in the context of emergency management. A questionnaire survey was administered to students in universities that had implemented online teaching during the pandemic, and 552 valid responses were collected. The survey explored the factors affecting the willingness of higher education institution students to continue using online learning, and the following conclusions were drawn. (1) The easier an online learning platform was to navigate, the better it was perceived by the students, and thus the students were more willing to use it. (2) Ease of use and usefulness were associated with the teachers’ choice of platform and their ability to achieve a satisfactory fit between the course design and platform navigation, which thereby affected the students’ learning outcomes and attitude towards use. (3) The positive attitude of teachers towards teaching increased the students’ perceived ease of use of online learning. (4) During the pandemic, family support—a major support for teachers in online teaching—enhanced teachers’ attitudes towards, and willingness to provide, online teaching. A high level of support showed that the parents urged the students to learn and complete online learning tasks as instructed by the teachers, implying that family support could affect the students’ habits towards, adaptation to, and identification of online learning. The study results provide insights into the factors affecting the willingness of teachers and students to continue using e-learning platforms.","Mo, Chuan-Yu Hsieh Te-Hsin Lin Chien-Liang Jin Yuan Qin Su Yu-Sheng",Sustainability,,139

236380,Respiratory viruses and febrile response in children with febrile seizures: A cohort study and embedded case-control study,2020,"Cell migration is an essential systemic behavior, tightly regulated, of all living cells endowed with directional motility that is involved in the major developmental stages of all complex organisms such as morphogenesis, embryogenesis, organogenesis, adult tissue remodeling, wound healing, immunological cell activities, angiogenesis, tissue repair, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration as well as in a myriad of pathological conditions. However, how cells efficiently regulate their locomotion movements is still unclear. Since migration is also a crucial issue in cancer development, the goal of this narrative is to show the connection between basic findings in cell locomotion of unicellular eukaryotic organisms and the regulatory mechanisms of cell migration necessary for tumor invasion and metastases. More specifically, the review focuses on three main issues, (i) the regulation of the locomotion system in unicellular eukaryotic organisms and human cells, (ii) how the nucleus does not significantly affect the migratory trajectories of cells in two-dimension (2D) surfaces and (iii) the conditioned behavior detected in single cells as a primitive form of learning and adaptation to different contexts during cell migration. New findings in the control of cell motility both in unicellular organisms and mammalian cells open up a new framework in the understanding of the complex processes involved in systemic cellular locomotion and adaptation of a wide spectrum of diseases with high impact in the society such as cancer.","De la Fuente, Ildefonso M; López, José I",,,139

MethodsThe cross-sectional survey conducted in January 2021 included males and females aged 10 years and above, selected by multi-stage random sampling. 9363 samples were collected from 30 wards distributed over 6 zones of Hyderabad and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. ResultsOverall seropositivity was 54.2%, ranging from 50-60% in most wards. Highest exposure appeared to be among 30-39y and 50-59y olds, with women showing greater seropositivity. Seropositivity increased with family size, with only marginal differences among people with varying levels of education. Seroprevalence was significantly lower among smokers.

Also, the infection-induced inflammatory changes are found in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of previous immunity to COVID-19 has caused infection of a large number of patients worldwide and unpredictability regarding the management of the complications that appear in the course of this viral illness. Lungs are the most important target organ of the SARS-COV-2. In COVID-19 patients, acute lung injury leads to respiratory failure. However, multiorgan failure can also occur in these patients. The primary coagulopathy of COVID-19 is marked by a considerable elevation of D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen degradation products. In comparison, abnormalities in platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time are partly uncommon in initial presentations. Inflammatory biomarkers including CRP, LDH, and IL-6 are significantly elevated in the early stages of the disease. In this regard, inflammation-associated biomarkers and coagulation test screening, including the assessment of IL-6, CRP, LDH, D-dimer, platelet count, PT&PTT time, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels are suggested for detecting infection by this virus. Overall, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed like other patients with critical conditions, and supportive care and thromboembolic prophylaxis should be used for severe patients.","Hong, Ling-Zhi; Shou, Zhang-Xuan; Zheng, De-Ming; Jin, Xue",Mol. cell. biochem,,139

Whether CNNs could also inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 analysing street images has been understudied, though it could identify high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. We trained CNNs to classify bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk. MethodsWe used five images per bus stop. The outcome label (moderate or extreme) for each bus stop was extracted from the local transport authority. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2, and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing network which was further tuned to increase performance. ResultsThere were 1,788 bus stops (1,173 moderate and 615 extreme), totalling 8,940 images. NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the extreme label: 57% versus 59% in NASNetLarge and ResNet152V2, respectively. NASNetLarge was further tuned and reached: training loss of 0.50; training accuracy of 75%; precision, recall and F1 score for the moderate label of 80%, 83% and 82%, respectively; these metrics for the extreme label were 65%, 51% and 63%. ConclusionsCNNs has the potential to accurately classify street images into levels of COVID-19 risk.

So far, different pathological pathways for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been introduced in which the excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 1 ß [IL-1ß], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; [TNF&#945;]) has earned most of the attentions. However, recent studies have identified new pathways with at least the same level of importance as cytokine storm in which endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is one of them. In COVID-19, two main pathologic phenomena have been seen as a result of EC dysfunction: hyper-coagulation state and pathologic angiogenesis. The EC dysfunction-induced hypercoagulation state seems to be caused by alteration in the levels of different factors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). As data have shown, these thromboembolic events are associated with severity of disease severity or even death in COVID-19 patients. Other than thromboembolic events, pathologic angiogenesis is among the recent findings. Furthermore, over-expression/higher levels of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 &#945; (HIF-1&#945;), IL-6, TNF receptor super family 1A and 12, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been found in the lung biopsies/sera of both survived and non-survived COVID-19 patients. Also, there are some hypotheses regarding the role of nitric oxide in EC dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been demonstrated that different pathways involved in inflammation are generally common with EC dysfunction and angiogenesis. Altogether, considering the common possible upstream pathways in cytokine storm, pathologic angiogenesis, and EC dysfunction, it seems that targeting these molecules (such as nuclear factor &#954;B) could be more effective in the management of patients with COVID-19.","Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Mansouri, Kamran",Microvasc Res,,139

Furthermore, over-expression/higher levels of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 &#945; (HIF-1&#945;), IL-6, TNF receptor super family 1A and 12, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been found in the lung biopsies/sera of both survived and non-survived COVID-19 patients. Also, there are some hypotheses regarding the role of nitric oxide in EC dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been demonstrated that different pathways involved in inflammation are generally common with EC dysfunction and angiogenesis. Altogether, considering the common possible upstream pathways in cytokine storm, pathologic angiogenesis, and EC dysfunction, it seems that targeting these molecules (such as nuclear factor &#954;B) could be more effective in the management of patients with COVID-19.","Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Mansouri, Kamran",Microvasc Res,,139

In this sub-study of the ODIN-study, the objectives were to determine whether the Danish lockdown and home confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic affected changes in emotional-behavioral functioning of pre-school-aged children using the validated Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) answered by parents shortly before lockdown and 3 weeks into lockdown, and moreover, to examine whether baseline family and social characteristics could predict change in child emotional-behavioral functioning during lockdown. Parents of 40 (82%) children with a mean(SD) age of 5.0(0.7) completed the baseline questionnaire and the lockdown follow-up questionnaire. The SDQ-Total difficulties score (SDQ-TD) and Prosocial Behavioral score (PSB) changed significantly from pre- to lockdown [SDQ-TD mean(SD): 6.0(3.8) and 7.9(5.2);P = 0.02, respectively and PSB mean(SD): 8.5(1.4) and 7.9(1.5);P = 0.03, respectively]. Attending leisure time activities before lockdown was a predicting factor of changes to the worse in the children's SDQ-TD scores, with a mean difference in SDQ-TD between those with and without activities of 3.16 (95%CI 0.27-6.12);P = 0.03. In conclusion, the study showed a modest decrease in child-emotional behavioral functioning during the COVID-19 lockdown, potentially due to parental stress. Although these results might not be generalizable due to small sample size and selected population, the results point to a need of a greater awareness of child mental wellbeing during a lockdown situation.","Specht, I.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered an era of unprecedented ""infodemic."" There has never been a more urgent time to address the long-standing question of how to overcome the deleterious influence of exposure to online mis/disinformation on vaccine uptake. eHealth literacy, a skill set including media literacy, is key to navigating the web in search for health information and processing the one encountered through social media. Studies assessing the impact of increasing eHealth literacy on behavioral attitudes and health outcomes in the general population are relatively scarce to date. Yet for many reasons, leveraging eHealth literacy skills, and more specifically, media literacy, could be of great value to help mitigate the detrimental effects of erroneous information on vaccination decision-making.

249307,"Early Transmissibility Assessment of a Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China",2020,"While there is clinical evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 multiorgan tropism in severely infected coronavirus 19 patients, its unclear if there is differential multiorgan biodistribution and organ uptake in healthy young individuals, a group that usually has asymptomatic to moderate coronavirus 19 symptoms. In addition, for antibody therapies and vaccines that target the spike protein, its unclear if these reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or spike protein multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled spike protein near infrared fluorescence to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system, in young mice. We found a spike protein body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. Spike protein uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of spike protein into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and anti-spike protein antibodies suppressed spike protein biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-spike protein antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biodistribution kinetics and multiorgan tropism that could determine coronavirus 19 organ-specific outcomes.","Brady, Molly; Combs, Abigail; Venkatraman, Chethana; Solorzano, Alexander; Johnson, Angelique; McQuaid, Conor; Rahman, Akib; Leyva, Hannah; Kwok, Wing-Chi Edmund; Wood, Ronald W; Deane, Rashid",,,139

252126,"The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo-temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22-59 years. RESULTS: Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten-day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11-20) to 14.4% (Jan 21-31) to 8.7% (Feb 1-11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity, with Wuhan being the most severe (17.3%), followed by Hubei Province (10.2%), and the rest of China (6.6%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20-59 years-0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively. CONCLUSION: The disease severity among infected healthcare workers improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID-19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.","Gao, Wayne; Sanna, Mattia; Tsai, Min Kuang; Wen, Chi Pang",PLoS One,,139

There is an urgent need, therefore, to find a proper treatment for the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent. This paper focuses on identifying inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 proteases, PLPRO and 3CLPRO, which control the duplication and manages the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PLPRO and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CLPRO. These compounds are stable within the protease proteins' active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions. Our study results also reveal that the selected five compounds against PLPRO and the six compounds against 3CLPRO bind to their active sites with good binding free energy. These compounds that inhibit the activity of PLPRO and 3CLPRO may, therefore, be used for treating COVID-19 infection.","Jade, Dhananjay; Ayyamperumal, Selvaraj; Tallapaneni, Vyshnavi; Joghee Nanjan, Chandrasekar Moola; Barge, Sagar; Mohan, Surender; Nanjan, Moola Joghee",Eur J Pharmacol,,139

To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction.

However, access to LVAs is often limited by the quantity and geographic distribution of low-vision providers, as well as patient-centred transportation challenges. A tablet-based LVA tool kit, delivered virtually, has the potential to overcome many of these barriers. The purpose of this research was to validate a key component of the tablet-based tool kit - a commercially available iPad visual acuity (VA) test (Eye Chart Pro) iPad app - in a low-vision population. METHODS: Participants with low vision (n = 26) and those who were normally sighted (n = 25) underwent VA testing with both the iPad VA test application and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The VA data were compared using a t-test, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean absolute difference in VA (log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)=0.11; p = 0.82). Eye Chart Pro and Standard ETDRS Chart measures were also not significantly different (p = 0.98). However, there were significant differences between test methods in the low-vision group and the normally sighted group (p > 0.0001 and p = 0.007, respectively). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias (difference) of -0.0005 logMAR between methods, and 95% limits of agreement of 0.298 and -0.299 logMAR. DISCUSSION: The ETDRS chart function on the Eye Chart Pro application can reliably measure VA across a range, from normally sighted patients to those with low vision.","Hazari, Hassan; Curtis, Rachel; Eden, Karen; Hopman, Wilma M; Irrcher, Isabella; Bona, Mark D",J Telemed Telecare,,139

256440,Can nanotechnology help in the fight against COVID-19?,2020,"Some have suggested solar geoengineering, cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight, could be deployed temporarily to shave the peak of global temperatures. This would use limited deployment to keep global mean temperatures below a given threshold, buying time for emissions reductions and negative emissions to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. However, we suggest the trade-offs inherent in such scenarios are not widely appreciated. In this study, we explore general features of such scenarios, using a combination of simple analytical relationships between emissions and temperatures and modelling to illustrate the strong trade-off between the duration of geoengineering deployment and the temperature overshoot that is suppressed by geoengineering, as well as the scale of negative emissions that are required. Our results indicate that, unless climate sensitivity is at the high end of estimates, shaving a substantial peak, say, of 2K to 1.5K, would require at least a century of deployment of solar geoengineering and large-scale negative emissions, under a broad range of emissions trajectories. If negative emissions are not available at the scale of tens of gigatonnes of C02 per year, substantial peak-shaving will require deployment of geoengineering for multiple centuries. Our analysis emphasise the importance of factoring in the scale, feasibility, and cost of the negative emissions required to avoid indefinite commitment to solar geoengineering.","Hornigold, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00096v1.pdf,139

METHODS: We examined changes in presentations and referrals to the primary provider of mental health and community health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK (population ~0·86 million), plus service activity and deaths. We conducted interrupted time series analyses with respect to the time of UK ""lockdown"", which was shortly before the peak of COVID-19 infections in this area. We examined changes in standardized mortality ratio for those with and without severe mental illness (SMI). RESULTS: Referrals and presentations to nearly all mental and physical health services dropped at lockdown, with evidence for changes in both supply (service provision) and demand (help-seeking). This was followed by an increase in demand for some services. This pattern was seen for all major forms of presentation to liaison psychiatry services, except for eating disorders, for which there was no evidence of change. Inpatient numbers fell, but new detentions under the Mental Health Act were unchanged. Many services shifted from face-to-face to remote contacts. Excess mortality was primarily in the over-70s. There was a much greater increase in mortality for patients with SMI, which was not explained by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been associated with a system-wide drop in the use of mental health services, with some subsequent return in activity.

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 infection was first reported in people exposed to a seafood market in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. It has been suggested that the infection is likely to be of zoonotic origin and transmitted to humans through a not-yet-known intermediary. As of 22 May 2020, the World Health Organization reported that there were approximately 4,995,996 confirmed cases and 327,821 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via inhalation or direct contact with droplets from infected people. It has an incubation period ranging from 2 to &#8805;14 days. The rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 is greater than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory coronavirus. The symptoms are similar to influenza (i.e. breathlessness, sore throat and fatigue) and infected cases are isolated and treated. Infection is mild in most cases, but in elderly (>50 years) patients and those with cardiac and respiratory disorders, it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. People with strong immunity or those who have developed herd immunity are asymptomatic. The fatality rate ranges from 3% to 4%. Recommended methods for diagnosis of COVID-19 are molecular tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction) on respiratory secretions, chest scan and common laboratory diagnosis. Currently, treatment is essentially supportive, and the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established as a vaccine is not yet available. This review will focus on epidemiology, symptoms, transmission, pathogenesis, ongoing available treatments and future perspectives of SARS-CoV-2.","Sharma, Atul; Tiwari, Swapnil; Deb, Manas Kanti; Marty, Jean Louis",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,139

268195,A fast and low-cost approach to quality control of alcohol-based hand sanitizer using portable near infrared spectrometer and chemometrics,2021,"The objectives of this evidence scoping review were to identify and characterize studies investigating weight management interventions provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist or international equivalent (RDN) among adults with overweight or obesity. A medical librarian conducted an electronic literature search in 6 databases-MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PyscINFO (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ebsco). Except for narrative review, gray literature, and case study or report, all types of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2008 and April 26, 2019 were eligible. Two content advisors, who are experts in adult weight management, guided the process and reviewed the search plan and findings. The literature search resulted in 30,551 records with 16 additional records identified through other sources. A total of 29,756 records were excluded during the first round of screening due to duplication or irrelevancy. Of the 811 full-text articles that were screened, 139 met the criteria and were included. Approximately 51% and 43% of the studies were conducted in the community setting and in the United States or Canada, respectively. Over 97% of the studies were clinical or quasi-experimental trials. A total of 6 different intervention delivery modes were reported, which resulted in 22 combinations of the modes of delivery. RDNs delivered the weight management intervention (especially the nutrition component) in all studies, but some (61%) also involved an interdisciplinary team to deliver other components of the intervention. The average length of the intervention was about 10 months with a follow-up that ranged from 0 to 9 years. The commonly reported outcomes were anthropometrics, endocrine, and cardiovascular measures; dietary intake; and physical activity. Based on the scoping review, there were systematic reviews and evidence-based practice guidelines on weight management interventions but none of them met the a priori inclusion or exclusion criteria. Therefore, it would be beneficial to conduct a systematic review and develop an evidence-based practice guideline on adult weight management interventions provided by an RDN to guide practitioners and to evaluate their effects on health and nutrition-related outcomes.","Cheng, Feon W; Garay, Jessica L; Handu, Deepa",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,,139
268238,Clusters of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Chinese tour groups,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a serious adverse impact on the lives of people across the world. COVID-19 has exacerbated community-wide depression, and has led to increased drug abuse brought about by isolation of individuals as a result of lockdown. Further, apart from providing informative content to the public, the incessant media coverage of COVID-19 crisis in terms of news broadcasts, published articles and sharing of information on social media have had the undesired snowballing effect on stress levels (further elevating depression and drug use) due to uncertain future. In this position paper, we propose a novel framework for assessing the spatio-temporal-thematic progression of depression, drug abuse, and informativeness of the underlying news content across the different states in the United States. Our framework employs an attention-based transfer learning technique to apply knowledge learned on a social media domain to a target domain of media exposure. To extract news articles that are related to COVID-19 communications from the streaming news content on the web, we use neural semantic parsing, and background knowledge bases in a sequence of steps called semantic filtering. We achieve promising preliminary results on three variations of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. We compare our findings against a report from Mental Health America and the results show that our fine-tuned BERT models perform better than vanilla BERT. Our study can benefit epidemiologists by offering actionable insights on COVID-19 and its regional impact. Further, our solution can be integrated into end-user applications to tailor news for users based on their emotional tone measured on the scale of depressiveness, drug abusiveness, and informativeness.","Alambo, Amanuel; Gaur, Manas; Thirunarayan, Krishnaprasad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15209v2.pdf,139

269448,High Resolution CT Imaging Dynamic Follow-Up Study of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia,2020,"With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital. This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.","Zhou, L; Liu, K; Liu, H G",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,139
269607,Implementation study: Challenges of rapid telemedicineimplementation into a small community pediatric allergy-asthma practice,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome (CWS) is a key feature of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). The CWS causes significant distress and disability. While the relationship between CUD and psychosis has been extensively studied, the potential connection between CWS and psychosis has not received as much attention. CASE PRESENTATION: The CARE guideline's methodology is followed in the presentation of this case report. During the national lockdown decreed by the Spanish government for the containment of the CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a 29-year-old man suffers a CWS and a subsequent psychotic episode. He is admitted to a psychiatric unit, obtaining a rapid and complete response to treatment. DISCUSSION: Clinical and pathophysiological data that support the hypothesis of CWS-induced psychosis are discussed. Due to the increasing use of cannabis worldwide, we believe that more research is needed on the mental disturbances associated with CUD, including CWS and psychosis. On the other hand, the confinement and social distancing measures adopted in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic could have restricted the availability and consumption of certain drugs, precipitating the emergence of withdrawal syndromes such as CWS.","Marín, Julen; Pérez de Mendiola, Xabier; Fernández, Sergio; Chart, Juan Pablo",J Addict Dis,,139

272696,"Eliminating HCV: a marathon, not a sprint",2020,"Antiviral drugs are a class of medicines particularly used for the treatment of viral infections. Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. Viruses are among the major pathogenic agents that cause number of serious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Viruses cause many diseases in humans, from self resolving diseases to acute fatal diseases. Developing strategies for the antiviral drugs are focused on two different approaches: Targeting the viruses themselves or the host cell factors. Antiviral drugs that directly target the viruses include the inhibitors of virus attachment, inhibitors of virus entry, uncoating inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, inhibitors of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase and the inhibitors of integrase. The inhibitors of protease (ritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir), viral DNA polymerase (acyclovir, tenofovir, valganciclovir and valacyclovir) and of integrase (raltegravir) are listed among the Top 200 Drugs by sales during 2010s. Still no effective antiviral drugs are available for many viral infections. Though, there are a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, many for influenza and some new antiviral drugs for treating hepatitis C infection and HIV. Action mechanism of antiviral drugs consists of its transformation to triphosphate following the viral DNA synthesis inhibition. An analysis of the action mechanism of known antiviral drugs concluded that they can increase the cell's resistance to a virus (interferons), suppress the virus adsorption in the cell or its diffusion into the cell and its deproteinisation process in the cell (amantadine) along with antimetabolites that causes the inhibition of nucleic acids synthesis. This review will address currently used antiviral drugs, mechanism of action and antiviral agents reported against COVID-19.","Kausar, Shamaila; Said Khan, Fahad; Ishaq Mujeeb Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Akram, Muhammad; Riaz, Muhammad; Rasool, Ghulam; Hamid Khan, Abdul; Saleem, Iqra; Shamim, Saba; Malik, Arif",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,,139
273089,The management of biologics in dermatologic patients in the 2019-nCoV era,2020,"We consider a best arm identification (BAI) problem for stochastic bandits with adversarial corruptions in the fixed-budget setting of T steps. We design a novel randomized algorithm, Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking($u$) (PSS($u$)), which is agnostic to the amount of corruptions. When the amount of corruptions per step (CPS) is below a threshold, PSS($u$) identifies the best arm or item with probability tending to $1$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$. Otherwise, the optimality gap of the identified item degrades gracefully with the CPS.We argue that such a bifurcation is necessary. In PSS($u$), the parameter $u$ serves to balance between the optimality gap and success probability. The injection of randomization is shown to be essential to mitigate the impact of corruptions. To demonstrate this, we design two attack strategies that are applicable to any algorithm. We apply one of them to a deterministic analogue of PSS($u$) known as Successive Halving (SH) by Karnin et al. (2013). The attack strategy results in a high failure probability for SH, but PSS($u$) remains robust. In the absence of corruptions, PSS($2$)'s performance guarantee matches SH's. We show that when the CPS is sufficiently large, no algorithm can achieve a BAI probability tending to $1$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.","Zhong, Zixin; Cheung, Wang Chi; Tan, Vincent Y. F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07904v4.pdf,139

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and EuropePMC) were searched on January 6, 2021. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review was conducted, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. The quality of individual trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool 2, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. DATA SYNTHESIS: The collective search retrieved 3818 citations. Eight trials relating to 9 pharmacological interventions were identified. No evidence for nonpharmacological interventions was identified. Low certainty evidence of effectiveness in preventing severe disease was found for fluvoxamine (absolute difference: -8.7%; 95% CI: -1.8% to -16.4%) and bamlanivimab plus etesevimab (absolute difference: -4.9%; 95% CI: -0.8% to -8.9%). Both trials were limited by small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up. In addition, very low certainty evidence of effect was found for ivermectin plus doxycycline and sulodexide. Based on published data, insufficient evidence of effect was found for bamlanivimab (monotherapy), casirivimab plus imdevimab, ivermectin (monotherapy), nitazoxanide, and peginterferon lambda. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review assessed all ambulatory treatments for COVID-19 that may improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Recent trials have shown promising results for a number of pharmacological agents to treat COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting. However, larger, more robust trials are needed to support the routine use of these agents outside of monitored clinical trials.","O Murchu, Eamon; Spillane, Susan; Byrne, Paula; O039,; Neill, Michelle; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Máirín",Ann Pharmacother,,139

275449,Falsified COVID-19 vaccine recently identified in Mexico,2021,"The lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may have exacerbated mental health problems. To what degree mental health may be affected by social isolation is still poorly known. We collected prospective data on students' mental health in two instances: (i) in October and December 2019, and (ii) 6 months later, in April 2020 amidst the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and in mid-May/June 2020, after the lifting of lockdown. A total of 358 Italian students aged 18-30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory - 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = -3, 6; ß = 0.09 ± 0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.","Meda, Nicola; Pardini, Susanna; Slongo, Irene; Bodini, Luca; Zordan, Mauro Agostino; Rigobello, Paolo; Visioli, Francesco; Novara, Caterina",J Psychiatr Res,,139
276215,Clinical characteristics of skin manifestations with the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 caused by SARS-COV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Although the initial reports of COVID-19 cases in children described that children were largely protected from severe manifestations, clusters of paediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection began to be reported in the latter half of April 2020. A novel syndrome called ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology, haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.","Emeksiz, Serhat; Çelikel Acar, Banu; Kibar, Ayse Esin; Özkaya Parlakay, Aslinur; Perk, Oktay; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Cinel, Güzin; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Çelikel, Elif; Akça, Halise; Dibek Misirlioglu, Emine; Bayrakçi, Umut Selda; Çetin, Ibrahim Ilker; Nese Çitak Kurt, Aysegül; Boyraz, Mehmet; Hizli, Samil; Senel, Emrah",Int J Clin Pract,,139
276580,Miasmas and Other False Beliefs: The Road to Sickness and Death,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has tragically resulted in over 2.5 million deaths globally. Despite this, there is a lack of research on how to care for patients dying of COVID-19, specifically pharmacological management of symptoms. AIM: The aim was to determine the dose ranges of pharmacological interventions commonly used to manage symptoms in adult patients dying of COVID-19, establish how effectiveness of these interventions was measured, and whether the pharmacological interventions were effective. DESIGN: This was a rapid systematic review with narrative synthesis of evidence, prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020210892). DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL via the NICE Evidence Health Databases Advanced Search interface; medRxiv; the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; and Google Scholar with no date limits. We included primary studies which documented care of patients dying of COVID-19 under the care of a specialist palliative care team. RESULTS: Seven studies, documenting the care of 493 patients met the inclusion criteria. Approximately two thirds of patients required a continuous subcutaneous infusion with median doses of 15 mg morphine and 10 mg midazolam in the last 24 h of life. Four studies described effectiveness by retrospective review of documentation. One study detailed the effectiveness of individual medications. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of patients required continuous subcutaneous infusion than is typically encountered in palliative care. Doses of medications required to manage symptoms were generally modest. There was no evidence of a standardised yet holistic approach to measure effectiveness of these medications and this needs to be urgently addressed.","Heath, Laura; Carey, Matthew; Lowney, Aoife C; Harriss, Eli; Miller, Mary",Palliat Med,,139
276756,"Māori perceptions of ‘home’: Māori housing needs, wellbeing and policy",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put the world economy at an unprecedented position and protecting society from the infection is at the core of all measures. As the COVID-19 virus stays longer on plastic and stainless steel materials, hence the healthcare wastes (HCW), coming out of the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients can be one of the potential route for transmission of infection. Therefore, the present study analyses the dimensions of sustainable HCWM by using a multi-method approach: PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal) analysis, TISM (total interpretive structural modeling) and fuzzy- MICMAC (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) analysis. The opted research framework yields 17 PESTEL dimensions of sustainable HCWM during the COVID-19 outbreak through the literature survey and experts' discussions. Then, the TISM methodology developed a hierarchical digraph of all the 17 dimensions of sustainable HCWM based on the interrelationships. Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis classified all 17 PESTEL dimensions into four groups depending upon their driving and dependence powers. The study concluded that the policy framework for targeting political, legal and environmental issues should be the immediate concern of the worldwide governments and health officials. The effluent control and compliance to environmental laws being the output dimensions should be tracked regularly for ensuring the cleaner production in healthcare services. The PESTEL analysis will help the hospitals' managers and policymakers to understand the macro-environment surrounding the HCWM.","Thakur, Dr Vikas",J Clean Prod,,139
277153,Probing the epigenetic signatures in subjects with coronary artery disease,2020,"Wireless sex toys are new technologies that enable sexual partners to connect remotely across long distances.

Inspired by the concept of the 'sexuality-assemblage', we pose teledildonic-enhanced sex as a 'sexuotechnical-assemblage', a term that highlights the uniquely technological dimensions of sex in the age of teledildonics. Approaching these devices as sexuotechnical-assemblages highlights the generative role of data as lubricants of long-distance intimacy, and central actors in the (re)making of sexual subjects, and by extension, 'healthy' sexuality.","Flore, Jacinthe; Pienaar, Kiran",Health Sociol Rev,,139
277900,CT chest analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia: An Indian perspective,2021,"Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics is a powerful tool for investigating the hemodynamic risk in coronary arteries. Proper setting of flow boundary conditions in computational hemodynamic models of coronary arteries is one of the sources of uncertainty weakening the findings of in silico experiments, in consequence of the challenging task of obtaining in vivo 3D flow measurements within the clinical framework. Accordingly, in this study we evaluated the influence of assumptions on inflow velocity profile shape on coronary artery hemodynamics. To do that, (1) ten left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) geometries were reconstructed from clinical angiography, and (2) eleven velocity profiles with realistic 3D features such as eccentricity and differently shaped (single- and double-vortex) secondary flows were generated analytically and imposed as inflow boundary conditions. Wall shear stress and helicity-based descriptors obtained prescribing the commonly used parabolic velocity profile were compared with those obtained with the other velocity profiles. Our findings indicated that the imposition of idealized velocity profiles as inflow boundary condition is acceptable as long the results of the proximal vessel segment are not considered, in LAD coronary arteries. As a pragmatic rule of thumb, a conservative estimation of the length of influence of the shape of the inflow velocity profile on LAD local hemodynamics can be given by the theoretical entrance length for cylindrical conduits in laminar flow conditions.","Lodi Rizzini, Maurizio; Gallo, Diego; De Nisco, Giuseppe; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Chiastra, Claudio; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Piroli, Francesco; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Morbiducci, Umberto",Med Eng Phys,,139

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained. SUMMARY: There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.","Chand, Ranjeeta; Swenson, Erik R; Goldfarb, David S",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,139

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an immunochromatography-based immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody assay (GenBody&#8482; COVI040) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion in COVID-19 patients. A total of 130 samples, serially collected from patients with confirmed COVID-19, and 100 negative control samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG using the GenBody&#8482; COVI040 assay following the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety guidelines on the review and approval of in vitro diagnostic devices for COVID-19. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction results were used as the comparator. The overall sensitivity of the GenBody&#8482; COVI040 assay was 97.69% (95% confidence interval (CI): 93.40-99.52%). The sensitivity of the assay increased with time post symptom onset (PSO) (sensitivity &#8804;6 days PSO: 78.57%, 95% CI: 49.20-95.34%; sensitivity 7-13 days PSO: 100%, 95% CI: 87.23-100%; and sensitivity &#8805;14 days PSO: 100%, 95% CI: 95.94-100%). The specificity of the assay was 100% (95% CI: 96.38-100%). The GenBody&#8482; COVI040 assay showed high sensitivity and specificity, making it a promising diagnostic test to monitor COVID-19.","Kim, Doyeong; Lee, Jihoo; Bal, Jyotiranjan; Chong, Chom-Kyu; Lee, Jong Ho; Park, Hyun",Diagnostics (Basel),,139

292789,LPD-12: a promising lipopeptide to control COVID-19,2020,"Public health and care policies across OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries increasingly encourage aging in place, enabled by both formal care networks, and informal (family) care and social solidarity in the neighborhood. However, little is known about how a person's neighborhood might affect their aging in place. The COVID-19 crisis unintendedly offered a good opportunity to observe the neighborhood's role in the provision of care. Since formal care services were often limited during the lockdown, informal caregiving may have increased. However, intergenerational contacts in and outside of the household were strongly discouraged by governments worldwide, adding another layer of complexity to caregiving. The aim of this qualitative study was to assess how informal caregivers in Flanders managed to provide care to their care receivers, and what role the neighborhood played in this provision of care. Sixteen qualitative Skype and telephone interviews with informal caregivers were conducted between June and December 2020 to understand their experiences and coping strategies. Overall, most respondents increased their frequency of caregiving during the first lockdown. They took on the extra care needs during the lockdown themselves, and did not actively invoke any kind of neighborhood support. The significance of the neighborhood seemingly remained limited. This was often not because no help was offered, but rather due to a sense of pride or the fear of infection, and an increased effort by family caregivers.","D039,; herde, Jakob; Gruijthuijsen, Wesley; Vanneste, Dominique; Draulans, Veerle; Heynen, Hilde",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,139

295586,Can the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Cause Parkinson's Disease?,2020,"Many individuals prescribed osteoporosis pharmacotherapy either do not start or do not persist with treatment. In this study, women who attended a group medical visit at an osteoporosis center which involved fracture risk assessment and focused on autonomous decision-making made treatment decisions with high confidence. Those who started pharmacotherapy were highly persistent. PURPOSE: Adherence and persistence with osteoporosis pharmacotherapy is low, possibly reflecting lack of confidence in physicians' treatment recommendations. We evaluated treatment decisions, decisional confidence, and 12-month treatment adherence among women who attended a group bone health consultation that fostered autonomous decision-making. METHODS: We prospectively assessed postmenopausal women referred to an osteoporosis clinic who chose to attend a group medical visit in lieu of one-on-one consultation. The group visit was facilitated by a specialist physician and nurse, involving estimation of 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk (using FRAX®) and extensive education regarding fracture consequences and potential advantages and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. No direct advice was given by the specialist. Post-consult, participants made an autonomous decision regarding treatment intent and followed up with their family physician to enact their chosen plan. Intentions to initiate pharmacotherapy were assessed immediately post-consult. Treatment status and decisional confidence were evaluated 3 and 12 months later. Three-month treatment status was considered to reflect final treatment decision. Persistence was defined as proportion of participants on treatment at 3 months who remained treated at 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred one women (mean (SD) age, 62.7 years (5.8); median (IQR) FRAX®, 10.7% (8.3-17.6)) participated. Immediately post-consult, 27 (26.7%) intended to initiate treatment. At 3 months, 23 (22.8%) were treated, and at 12 months, 21 (91.3%) remained persistent. Of 89 questionnaire respondents at 12 months, 85 (95.5%) reported confidence in their treatment decision. CONCLUSION: When postmenopausal women are provided with individualized fracture risk estimates and enabled to make autonomous decisions regarding pharmacotherapy, ultimate decisions to receive treatment are made with confidence and result in high persistence at 12 months.","Wilton-Clark, Madeline S; Feasel, A Lynn; Kline, Gregory A; Billington, Emma O",Arch Osteoporos,,139

301830,Efficacy and safety of vitamin C in the management of acute respiratory infection and disease: A rapid review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified. METHODS: Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed. RESULTS: Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity - network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes, while the data from rank I-III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I-III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The geo-temporal progression of epidemics seems to be highly structured. Epidemic network properties can distinguish regions that differ in mortality.

302360,Novel Coronavirus Infection in Febrile Infants Aged 60 Days and Younger,2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 in people with diabetes is associated with a disproportionately worse prognosis. DKA is an acute complication of diabetes with a mortality rate of approximately 0.67%. Little is known about the natural history of DKA in the presence of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on presentation, clinical course and outcome in patients presenting with DKA. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All patients treated for DKA between 1 March 2020 and 30 May 2020 were included. Patients were categorised as COVID-positive or COVID-negative based on swab test. A pre-COVID group was established using data from 01 March 2019 to 30 May 2019 as external control. Data regarding demographics, diabetes type, pH, bicarbonate, lactate, glucose, DKA duration, complications and outcome were collected. RESULTS: A total of 88 DKA episodes were included in this study. There was no significant difference in the severity or duration of DKA between the three groups. COVID-positive T1DM were more hyperglycaemic on admission compared to COVID-negative and pre-COVID patients. There was an over representation of T2DM in COVID-positive patients with DKA than in pre-COVID or COVID-negative groups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to influence the natural history of DKA differently in T1DM and T2DM. Patients with T1DM and COVID-19 presented with more hyperglycaemia (60mmol/l (35.9-60.0) vs. 31.4mmol/l (28.0-39.1) vs. 24mmol/l (20.2-33.75), respectively). Patients with T2DM were unusually presenting in DKA when infected with COVID-19 with greater ICU need and higher mortality rates. A collaborative, multi-centre study is needed to provide more definitive results.","Kempegowda, Punith; Melson, Eka; Johnson, Agnes; Wallett, Lucy; Thomas, Lucretia; Zhou, Dengyi; Holmes, Catherine; Juszczak, Agata; Karamat, Mohammed Ali; Ghosh, Sandip; Hanif, Wasim; Narendran, Parth; Bellary, Srikanth",,,139

The clinical features and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children with DS, and risk factors for severe outcomes, must be established to inform COVID-19 shielding advice and vaccination priority. ObjectiveTo determine risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 in pediatric DS patients and to compare the prevalence of severe COVID-19 between pediatric patients with and without DS. DesignThis retrospective cohort study included pediatric cases (aged <18 years) with DS from the Trisomy 21 Research Society international survey and pediatric cases from the general population published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (COVID-NET) collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (controls). SettingCohorts included 328 children with DS (127 hospitalized, 39%) and 224 children without DS (all hospitalized) with COVID-19. Of the pediatric DS patients, 64.1% were from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), and 35.9% from high-income countries (HICs). ParticipantsClinicians, family members, or caregivers completed the survey on behalf of children with DS affected by COVID-19. ResultsAmong the 328 COVID-19 patients with DS; older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalization; and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 127 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with DS had a higher incidence of cough, fever, nasal signs and shortness of breath than controls. Compared with controls, hospitalized children with DS (especially those from LMICs) had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related medical complications (pneumonia, ARDS, acute renal failure). Conclusions and relevanceChildren with DS are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 than the general pediatric population. Efforts should be made to monitor the health of children and young people with DS during the ongoing pandemic and to report any COVID-19 signs and symptoms in a timely manner, especially for those who have comorbidities which are risk factors for severe COVID-19. When vaccination rollout for pediatric populations begins, children with DS should be prioritised. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in paediatric patients with Down syndrome (DS)? FindingsHospitalised COVID-19 patients <18 years of age with DS from a range of countries had a higher incidence of respiratory symptoms, fever, and several medical complications from COVID-19 than patients without DS <18 years from the United States (US). Older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalisation among paediatric COVID-19 patients with DS; and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality rates were low in all paediatric COVID-19 patients (with and without DS), in contrast to previous findings in adults with DS (who exhibit higher mortality than those without DS). SignificanceChildren with DS are at increased risk for more severe presentations of COVID-19. Efforts should be made to ensure comprehensive and early detection of COVID-19 in this population, and to identify children with DS who present comorbidities that pose a risk for a severe course of COVID-19. Children with DS should be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination as part of childrens vaccination programmes.","Emes, David Tresco; Hüls, Anke; Baumer, Nicole; Dierssen, Mara; Puri, Shiela; Russel, Lauren; Sherman, Stephanie L; Strydom, Andre; Bargagna, Stefania; Brandão, Ana Cláudia; Costa, Alberto C.S.; Chicoine, Brian Allen; Ghosh, Sujay; Rebillat, Anne-Sophie; Sgandurra, Giuseppina; Valentini, Diletta; Rohrer, Tilman R; Levin, Johannes; Lakhanpaul, Monica",,,139

307597,"What Does the Economic Burden of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment Look Like for the Next Decade? An Analysis of Key Findings, Challenges and Recommendations",2021,"Rationale: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has led to a global health crisis unlike any our contemporaries have witnessed before. SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University was designated as one of three COVID-19-only hospitals on March 28, 2020. This retrospective, single-center observational study grants a unique perspective surrounding the experience of the critical care service at a public institution serving a predominantly Afro-Caribbean, inner city population. Methods: Between March 11 and April 30, 2020, the critical care service was consulted for a total of 271 COVID-19 patients. We queried the electronic medical record for patient visits with critical care consult notes and collected data on demographics, comorbidities, ICU acceptance, treatment strategies, and clinical outcomes. Non-COVIDrelated consults were excluded. Chi-squared tests compared categorical variables, and independent samples ttest assessed differences in continuous variables based on mortality and ICU admission status. Logistic regression models determined if various factors independently predicted the odds of mortality. We conducted retrospective analyses to identify factors associated with survival and ICU acceptance. Results: Of the 271 patients with critical care consults, 33% (n=89) survived and 67% (n=182) expired. At the bivariate level, age, BUN, and neutrophil percentage were significantly associated with mortality, with age showing the strongest correlation (age: survivors, 61.62±1.50 vs. non-survivors, 68.98±0.85, p&lt;0.001). There was a significant association between neutrophil percentage and mortality in the univariate logistic regression model (Q4 vs. Q1, OR 2.73, 95% CI (1.28-5.82), p trend = 0.044). In the multivariate analyses, procalcitonin exhibited a positive correlation with the odds of mortality, adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (procalcitonin: Q4 vs. Q1, OR 5.65, 95% CI (2.14-14.9), p trend &lt;0.001). Adjusting for the same covariates, platelets exhibited a negative correlation with the odds of mortality (Q4 vs. Q1, OR 0.47, 95% CI (0.22-0.998), p trend = 0.010). Interestingly, of these factors, only elevated procalcitonin levels were associated with an increased likelihood of ICU acceptance. Conclusions: This retrospective, observational study during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic identified key factors linked to disease severity and outcomes. Of note, procalcitonin was the factor most strongly associated with both mortality and likelihood of ICU acceptance at the bivariate level. Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in COVID-19, and our data suggests that procalcitonin is a useful marker that accurately reflects the severity of lung involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Feng, T.; James, A.; Doumlele, K.; White, S.; Twardzik, W.; Zahid, K.; Sattar, Z.; Foronjy, R.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of asthma on adverse clinical outcomes in a COVID-19 hospitalized cohort. METHODS: Retrospective, propensity-matched observational study of consecutive COVID-19-positive patients between February 24, 2020, and November 3, 2020 at a single health care system. RESULTS: In the initial population of 1925 patients, 4.4% presented with asthma. Propensity score matching reduced the total sample to n = 1045: 88 (8.4%) with asthma and n = 957 without asthma. A total of 164 (15.7%) patients died during the hospitalization, including 7 (8.0%) in the asthma group and 157 (16.4%), p = .037, in the non-asthmatic cohort. There was no difference between these groups in need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay on a ventilator, or hospital length of stay.Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that asthma was an independent predictor of lower mortality, while older age, BMI > 30 kg/m2, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and admission National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. There were no significant differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts with respect to need for mechanical ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, serum markers of severe COVID-19 disease, or overall length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: We conclude that asthma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a lower risk of mortality and no increase in disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Mather, Jeffrey F; Mosleh, Wassim; McKay, Raymond G",J Asthma,,139
308851,Abstract No. 234 Interventional radiology case mix changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Physical activity is an important determinant of health in later life. The public health restrictions in response to COVID-19 have interrupted habitual physical activity behaviours in older adults. In response, numerous exercise programmes have been developed for older adults, many involving chair-based exercise. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the effects of chair-based exercise on the health of older adults. Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PyscInfo and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to 1 April 2020. Chair-based exercise programmes in adults &#8805;50 years, lasting for at least 2 weeks and measuring the impact on physical function were included. Risk of bias of included studies were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool v2. Intervention content was described using TiDieR Criteria. Where sufficient studies (&#8805;3 studies) reported data on an outcome, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. In total, 25 studies were included, with 19 studies in the meta-analyses. Seventeen studies had a low risk of bias and five had a high risk of bias. In this systematic review including 1388 participants, results demonstrated that chair-based exercise programmes improve upper extremity (handgrip strength: MD = 2.10; 95% CI = 0.76, 3.43 and 30 s arm curl test: MD = 2.82; 95% CI = 1.34, 4.31) and lower extremity function (30 s chair stand: MD 2.25; 95% CI = 0.64, 3.86). The findings suggest that chair-based exercises are effective and should be promoted as simple and easily implemented activities to maintain and develop strength for older adults.","Klempel, Natalie; Blackburn, Nicole E; McMullan, Ilona L; Wilson, Jason J; Smith, Lee; Cunningham, Conor; O039,; Sullivan, Roger; Caserotti, Paolo; Tully, Mark A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,139

We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; M age = 41.7, SD age = 16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORu = .36 and .41, p < .05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORu = 1.67 to 1.87, p < .05) and probable anxiety (ORu = 1.54 to 2.10, p < .05). Our findings suggest protective effects of perceived trust and satisfaction regarding government's pandemic responses against mental distress and the potential mental health threats from three pandemic-specific lifestyle-changing stressors. These findings can inform clinicians and policymakers to better prepare for the mental health impacts of the current and future pandemics.","Chen, Juliet Honglei; Yu, Eilo Wing-Yat; Su, Xiaoyu; Tong, Kwok Kit; Wu, Anise M S",Curr Psychol,,139

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Northwestern Memorial Hospital ICUs. Patients: All patients intubated for coronavirus disease 2019 between March 2020 and June 2020. Interventions: Patients were stratified by time to intubation: 30 subjects were intubated 4-24 hours after presentation and 24 subjects were intubated 5-10 days after presentation. Baseline characteristics, hospitalization, ventilator mechanics, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Ten clinically available CT scans were manually reviewed to identify evidence of pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Measurements and Main Results: Median time from symptom onset to intubation was significantly different between the early and late intubation cohorts, with the latter being intubated later in the course of their illness (7.9 vs 11.8 d;p = 0.04). The early intubation cohort had a lower mortality rate than the late intubation cohort (6% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.001) without significantly different respiratory mechanics at the time of intubation. The late intubation cohort was noted to have higher dead space ratio (0.40 vs 0.52;p = 0.03). On review of CT scans, the late intubation cohort also had more dilated peripheral segments on imaging (two segments vs five segments). Conclusions: The question as to whether delaying intubation is beneficial or harmful for patients with coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure has yet to be answered. As our approaches to coronavirus disease 2019 continue to evolve, the decision of timing of intubation remains paramount. Although noninvasive ventilation may allow for delaying intubation, it is possible that there are downstream effects of delayed intubation that should be considered, including the potential for pulmonary vascular thrombosis and intussusceptive angiogenesis with delayed intubation.","Bavishi, A.

312623,"The Value of ""The Three Classical Texts"" in Fighting Against the Novel Coronavirus",2020,"CONTEXT: This article aims to highlight challenges and adaptations made by local health officials in Tanzania in working to contain and manage COVID-19. METHODS: The study takes an inductive approach, drawing on the reported experiences of 40 officials at different levels of government across four purposefully selected regions in July 2020. Interviewees were asked about the guidance they received to contain COVID-19, the source of that guidance, their challenges and successes in implementing the guidance, and if and how they adapted the guidance to their particular setting. FINDINGS: The interviews depict considerable challenges, including a lack of supplies and resources; enforcing physical distancing, contact tracing and surveillance; and dealing with fear and stigma. At the same time, they also provide evidence of innovation and adaptation among street-level bureaucrats. Respondents overwhelmingly praise the President, whose limited national response is seen as helpful to reduce fear and stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Other scholars have highlighted the potential dangers of street-level discretion if local officials may ""make policy"" in ways that contradict their agencies' stated goals. In contrast, our study suggests benefits of autonomy at the street level-particularly in contexts where the central state is relatively weak and/or acting against the public interest.","Carlitz, Ruth; Yamanis, Thespina; Mollel, Henry",J. health polit. policy law,,139

Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISK-2), and a self-report questionnaire for COVID-19 pandemic-related data. From a total of 5,116 adults included in the study, 5.20% reported suicidal thoughts, 14.17% were potential clinical cases of anxiety, and 26.51% of depression. Participants presented significantly higher suicidal ideation rates during the last two weeks of the lockdown compared to its previous two weeks. Unmarried or divorced marital status, mental health history, poor perceived quality of physical health, impaired family functioning, anxiety and depression symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation, whereas higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being were associated with lower suicidal ideation odds. According to the findings, suicidal ideation prevalence might be considered elevated and its increase during the lockdown period alarming. The risk and protective factors identified in the study offer valuable information for the development of preventive strategies against suicidal ideation, especially in times of crisis.","Papadopoulou, Athanasia; Efstathiou, Vasiliki; Yotsidi, Vasiliki; Pomini, Valeria; Michopoulos, Ioannis; Markopoulou, Evaggelia; Papadopoulou, Marianna; Tsigkaropoulou, Evdoxia; Kalemi, Georgia; Tournikioti, Kalliopi; Douzenis, Athanasios; Gournellis, Rossetos",Psychiatry Res,,139

Here we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the activity of the main inhibitory intracortical circuits within the primary motor cortex (M1) in a sample of patients complaining of fatigue and presenting executive dysfunction after resolution of COVID-19 with neurological manifestations. METHODS: Twelve patients who recovered from typical COVID-19 pneumonia with neurological complications and complained of profound physical and mental fatigue underwent, 9 to 13 weeks from disease onset, a psychometric evaluation including a self-reported fatigue numeric-rating scale (FRS, Fatigue Rating Scale) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Intracortical activity was evaluated by means of well-established TMS protocols including short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), reflecting GABAA-mediated inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), a marker of GABAB receptor activity, and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) that indexes central cholinergic transmission. TMS data were compared to those obtained in a control group of ten healthy subjects (HS) matched by age, sex and education level. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 patients reported marked fatigue according to FRS score (8.1 ± 1.7) and presented pathological scores at the FAB based on Italian normative data (12.2 ± 0.7). TMS revealed marked reduction of SICI, and disruption of LICI as compared to HS. SAI was also slightly diminished. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents for the first time reduced GABAergic inhibition in the M1 in patients who recovered from COVID-19 with neurological complications and manifested fatigue and dysexecutive syndrome.

Through an unbiased, reporter-based high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, as a -1 PRF inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on -1 PRF of other betacoronaviruses.

ResultsSAM was found to be a potential marker of lung damage risk in COVID-19 patients (SAM > 80 nM; CT3,4 vs. CT 0-2: relative ratio (RR) was 3.0; p = 0.0029). SAM/SAH > 6.0 was also found to be a marker of lung injury (CT2-4 vs. CT0,1: RR = 3.47, p = 0.0004). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were associated with SAM ({rho} = 0.44, p = 0.01) and SAH ({rho} = 0.534, p = 0.001) levels. ConclusionsHigh SAM levels and high methylation index are associated with the risk of lung injury in COVID-19 patients. The association of SAM and SAH with IL-6 indicates an important role of transmethylation in the development of cytokine imbalance in COVID-19 cases.","Kryukov, Evgeny; Ivanov, Alexander; Karpov, Vladimir; Alexandrin, Valery; Dygai, Alexander; Kruglova, Maria; Kostiuchenko, Gennady; Kazakov, Sergei; Kubatiev, Aslan",,,139

This review was conducted to evaluate the impact of CPT in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported to date. A robust screening of electronic databases was conducted up to 10th July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of CPT reduces mortality (odd's ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77), increases viral clearance (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.9-25.9) and improves clinically (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9). However, the evidence is of low quality (mortality reduction, and viral clearance), and very low quality (clinical improvement). CPT may be beneficial for reducing mortality, viral shedding and improving clinical conditions in COVID-19 patients. However, further randomized control trials (RCT) are required to substantiate the safety margin, initiation, optimal dosage, titre and duration of CPT.","Sarkar, Soumya; Soni, Kapil D; Khanna, Puneet",J Med Virol,,139

322228,Clinical Pathway for Early Diagnosis of COVID-19: Updates from Experience to Evidence-Based Practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions. METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates. FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions.

324211,The Impact of Social Distancing for COVID-19 Upon Diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Entertainment-education (E-E) media can improve behavioral intent toward health-related practices. In the era of COVID-19, millions of people can be reached by E-E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, animated video about COVID-19 hygiene practices-such as social distancing and frequent hand washing-that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global audience. The E-E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. The study aims to achieve the following objectives. To: 1.Quantify people's interest in watching a short, animated video about COVID-19 hygiene (abbreviated to CoVideo).2.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioural intent toward COVID-19 hygiene.3.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID-19 hygiene knowledge. TRIAL DESIGN: The present study is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo), placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Arm 1: the CoVideo, list experiment, and questionnaire survey. Arm 2: the APC video, list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. Arm 3: the list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. For each list experiment, participants will be randomized to a control or treatment group. The control group will receive a list of five items and the treatment group will receive the same five items plus one item about COVID-19 hygiene. We will use the list experiment to reduce response bias associated with socially desirable answers to COVID-19 questions. The questionnaire survey will include items about the participant's age, sex, country of residence, highest education, and knowledge of COVID-19 spread. After completing the list experiment and questionnaire survey, participants in Arms 2 and 3 will receive the CoVideo to ensure post-trial access to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: https://www.prolific.co) to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla&#8482; platform (www.gorilla.sc). To be eligible, participants must be between the age of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, or France. Participants will be excluded from the study if they cannot speak English, German, French, or Spanish (since the instructions and survey questions will be available in these 4 languages only). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention is an E-E video about COVID-19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co-author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes the public's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home (e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8. The comparators are an APC video (Arm 2) or no video (Arm 3). The APC video is similar in style to the CoVideo; it is also animated with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no words, speech, or text. The video message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a way of life. It is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw. Each list experiment will have a control list as the comparator. The control list is needed to measure the prevalence of behavioral intent toward COVID-19 hygiene. MAIN OUTCOMES: This study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID-19 hygiene. By hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essential goods. As a secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. RANDOMIZATION: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list experiments will also be randomized. BLINDING: Because ProA handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED: The Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is 18 May 2020. Recruitment is expected to end by 22 June 2020. Thus far, the study investigators have recruited 2,500 participants on ProA. Of these participants, 800 have completed the study on the Gorilla platform. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study and its outcomes were registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020, protocol number: #DRKS00021582. The study was registered before any data was collected. FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.","Vandormael, Alain; Adam, Maya; Greuel, Merlin; Bärnighausen, Till",Trials,,139

Furthermore, the pandemic led to a need to cancel clinics and inpatient rotations, with a major impact on training for health professions and interprofessional health delivery, the long-term effects of which are currently unknown. While problematic, this also presents an opportunity to reflect on challenges facing the traditional clinical training paradigm in a rapidly changing and complex health care system and develop sustainable, high-quality competency-based educational models that incorporate rapidly progressing technologies.

324936,Effects of Pulmonary Fibrosis and Surface Tension on Alveolar Sac Mechanics in Diffuse Alveolar Damage,2021,"Hand hygiene is one of the effective measures for reducing the transmission of infections. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing ethanol or isopropanol are considered efficient alternatives to handwashing with water and soap. Despite being effective against a broad-spectrum of microbes, fining an effective alternative to the alcohol-based hand sanitizers became a necessity owning to the limitations associated with their use, such as skin dryness, irritant contact dermatitis, and intoxication upon their accidental ingestion. Furthermore, in certain circumstances when the demand for alcohol exceeds the supply, like in the current COVID19 pandemic, formulating an effective non-alcoholic hand sanitizer would be a potential solution. Therefore, in this study, a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer containing benzalkonium chloride (BKC) as an active ingredient was prepared and evaluated as a less irritant and more persistent hand sanitizer gel. The hand gel was characterized by pH, viscosity, and spreadability. Results showed that this product has low viscosity, high spreadability and pH of 6.3, which is less likely to cause skin irritation. The antibacterial assessment (zone of inhibition) of the BKC-based hand sanitizer demonstrated antibacterial activities against nine out of eleven gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, while the acceptability study on ten participants showed no signs of skin irritation nor redness upon its application. Consequently, this non-alcoholic based hand sanitizer is suggested as a potential alternative to alcohol-based hand gels.","Aodah, Alhassan H.; Bakr, Abrar A.; Booq, Rayan Y.; Rahman, Mohammed J.; Alzahrani, Dunia A.; Alsulami, Khulud A.; Alshaya, Hassa A.; Alsuabeyl, Mohammed S.; Alyamani, Essam J.; Tawfik, Essam A.",Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal,,139

325555,Development and delivery of a real-time hospital-onset COVID-19 surveillance system using network analysis,2020,"A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has made its way across the globe to affect over 180 countries. SARS-CoV-2 has infected humans in all age groups, of all ethnicities, both males and females while spreading through communities at an alarming rate. Given the nature of this virus, there is much still to be learned; however, we know that the clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death. It is believed that COVID-19, in those with underlying health conditions or comorbidities, has an increasingly rapid and severe progression, often leading to death. This paper examined the comorbid conditions, the progression of the disease, and mortality rates in patients of all ages, infected with the ongoing COVID-19 disease. An electronic literature review search was performed, and applicable data was then collected from peer-reviewed articles published from January to April 20, 2020. From what is known at the moment, patients with COVID-19 disease who have comorbidities, such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus, are more likely to develop a more severe course and progression of the disease. Furthermore, older patients, especially those 65 years old and above who have comorbidities and are infected, have an increased admission rate into the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality from the COVID-19 disease. Patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with SARS CoV-2, as they usually have the worst prognosis.","Sanyaolu, Adekunle; Okorie, Chuku; Marinkovic, Aleksandra; Patidar, Risha; Younis, Kokab; Desai, Priyank; Hosein, Zaheeda; Padda, Inderbir; Mangat, Jasmine; Altaf, Mohsin",SN Compr Clin Med,,139

METHODS: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. RESULTS: The majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, PreDM and obesity. Covid-19 is asociated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism.

This had an immediate major effect on the job market, with millions of Americans forced to find alternative ways to make a living from home. As online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) play a major role in social science research, concerns have been raised that the pandemic may be reducing the diversity of subjects participating in experiments. Here, we investigate this possibility empirically. Specifically, we look at 15,539 responses gathered in 23 studies run on MTurk between February and July 2020, examining the distribution of gender, age, ethnicity, political preference, and analytic cognitive style. We find notable changes on some of the measures following the imposition of nationwide social distancing: participants are more likely to be less reflective (as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test), and somewhat less likely to be white, Democrats (traditionally over-represented on MTurk), and experienced with MTurk. Most of these differences are explained by an influx of new participants into the MTurk subject pool who are more diverse and representative - but also less attentive - than previous MTurkers.","Arechar, Antonio A; Rand, David G",Behav. res. meth,,139
329672,"Advice on the use of point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests for COVID-19: scientific brief, 8 April 2020",2020,"There is current debate concerning the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), for hypertension management, during COVID-19 infection. Specifically, the suggestion has been made that ACE inhibitors or ARBs could theoretically contribute to infection via increasing ACE2 receptor expression and hence increase viral load. The ACE2 receptor is responsible for binding the SAR-CoV2 viral spike and causing COVID-19 infection. What makes the argument somewhat obtuse for ACE inhibitors or ARBs is that ACE2 receptor expression can be increased by compounds that activate or increase the expression of SIRT1. Henceforth common dietary interventions, vitamins and nutrients may directly or indirectly influence the cellular expression of the ACE2 receptor. There are many common compounds that can increase the expression of the ACE2 receptor including Vitamin C, Metformin, Resveratrol, Vitamin B3 and Vitamin D. It is important to acknowledge that down-regulation or blocking the cellular ACE2 receptor will likely be pro-inflammatory and may contribute to end organ pathology and mortality in COVID-19. In conclusion from the perspective of the ACE2 receptor, COVID-19 prevention and treatment are distinctly different. This letter reflects on this current debate and suggests angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are likely beneficial during COVID-19 infection for hypertensive and normotensive patients.","McLachlan, Craig Steven",Clin.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders expressed frustration and bewilderment about PB. Psychological explanatory concepts, including those from social learning theory and the concept of the behavioral immune system, along with recent research, suggests the following account of pandemic-related PB. PB arises when people are told to go into self-isolation as part of pandemic containment interventions. Empirically, episodes of PB typically last 7-10 days and are likely initiated by highly fearful people. PB by an anxious minority of shoppers leads to fear contagion among other shoppers, amplified by widespread dissemination, via social media, of images and videos of PB and empty shelves in stores. Thus, a snow-balling effect arises where fear of scarcity creates real but short-term scarcity. People who are highly frightened of infection tend to have heightened disgust proneness. Toilet paper is a means of escaping disgust stimuli, and for this and other reasons, toilet paper became a target of PB for people frightened of contracting COVID-19. Exploitative or selfish over-purchasing also occurred, motivated by ""dark"" (e.g., psychopathic) personality traits. ""Don't panic!"" messages from community leaders were ineffective or counter-productive. Alternative forms of messaging are discussed.","Taylor, Steven",J Anxiety Disord,,139

However, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 kidney injury is difficult to estimate worldwide. Several pathophysiological mechanisms are involved, including decreased renal perfusion related to mechanical ventilation, sepsis and cytokines release, as well as direct virus toxicity on proximal tubular cells and podocytes, mediated by angiotensin 2 conversion receptors (ACE 2) and TMPRSS proteases. More than 20 % of ICU COVID-19 patients require extra renal replacement therapy (ERT) for acute renal failure that is made difficult by the hypercoagulable state of these patients, responsible for filter thrombosis.","Darriverre, Lucie; Fieux, Fabienne; de la Jonquière, Christophe",Le Praticien en anesthesie reanimation,,139

Data are reviewed from new geochronological datasets using radiogenic and stable isotopes, and from traditional geochronological methods, including sedimentology, structural mapping, sonic and seismic logging, and biostratigraphy. The modern Amazon River and the continental-scale Amazon drainage basin were assembled during the late Miocene and Pliocene, via some of the largest purported river capture events in Earth history. Andean sediments are first recorded in the Amazon Fan at about 10.1-9.4 Ma, with a large increase in sedimentation at about 4.5 Ma. The transcontinental Amazon River therefore formed over a period of about 4.9-5.6 million years, by means of several river capture events. The origins of the modern Amazon River are hypothesized to be linked with that of mega-wetland landscapes of tropical South America (e.g. várzeas, pantanals, seasonally flooded savannahs). Mega-wetlands have persisted over about 10% northern South America under different configurations for >15 million years. Although the paleogeographic reconstructions presented are simplistic and coarse-grained, they are offered to inspire the collection and analysis of new sedimentological and geochronological datasets.(AU)","Albert, James S; Val, Pedro; Hoorn, Carina",Neotrop. ichthyol,,139

343617,Is teicoplanin a complementary treatment option for COVID-19? The question remains,2020,"Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are highly sulfated polysaccharides covalently bound to cell surface proteins, which directly interact with many extracellular proteins, including the transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) family ligand antagonist, follistatin 288 (FS288). Follistatin neutralizes the TGFß ligands, myostatin and activin A, by forming a nearly irreversible non-signaling complex by surrounding the ligand and preventing interaction with TGFß receptors. The FS288-ligand complex has higher affinity than unbound FS288 for heparin/HS, which accelerates ligand internalization and lysosomal degradation; however, limited information is available for how FS288 interactions with heparin affect ligand binding. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we show that preincubation of FS288 with heparin/HS significantly decreased the association kinetics for both myostatin and activin A with seemingly no effect on the dissociation rate. This observation is dependent on the heparin/HS chain length where small chain lengths less than degree of polymerization 10 (dp10) did not alter association rates but chain lengths >dp10 decreased association rates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism for this observation, we uncovered that heparin induced dimerization of follistatin. Consistent with our SPR results, we found that dimerization only occurs with heparin molecules >dp10. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the FS288 heparin complex supports that FS288 adopts a dimeric configuration that is similar to the FS288 dimer in the ligand-bound state. These results indicate that heparin mediates dimerization of FS288 in a chain-length-dependent manner that reduces the ligand association rate, but not the dissociation rate or antagonistic activity of FS288.","Walker, Ryan G; Kattamuri, Chandramohan; Goebel, Erich J; Zhang, Fuming; Hammel, Michal; Tainer, John A; Linhardt, Robert J; Thompson, Thomas B",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,139

Understanding and defining the biology of this specific coronavirus infection may lead to targeted therapies to lessen its virulence and expand the host resistance. This study's objective was to apply morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from a forensic autopsy of an untreated COVID-19 victim, so that we may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the host and provide options for therapeutic targets. DESIGN: Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this COVID-19 pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect phosphorylated p-STAT3 (Tyr 705), as part of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway; cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, Programmed Death (PD)-1 receptor+ lymphoid cells, CD56+ NK lymphoid cells, CD163+ (M2 polarized monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part of the host response to interaction with the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: Representative sections of the COVID-19 victim's lung showed: nuclear expression of p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in many of the alveolar pneumocytes and in occasional endothelial cells; COX-2 expression in the alveolar pneumocytes; a relative paucity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes; absence of CD56+ NK lymphoid cells; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ macrophages/monocytes; PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes, and on cells in the alveolar interstitium; and rare PD-1+ lymphocytes in similar regions as CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the etiopathogenic features of pulmonary coronavirus infection and the host response. This suggests that a targeted therapy could address the biology of COVID-19 pneumonia, enhance the host immune response and prevent its progression to a life-threatening, ventilator-dependent clinical situation.","Brown, Robert E; Wolf, Dwayne A; Hunter, Robert L; Zhao, Bihong; Buja, L Maximilian",Ann Clin Lab Sci,,139

353607,Best of the other journals,2020,"INTRODUCTION: It is expected that future nurses have high levels of emotional intelligence and empathy, because of their everyday interaction with people in a clinical environment. Thus, nursing students must show interest in nursing studies and in work with people. Moreover, it is desired that they have good communication skills. On the other hand, students who choose nursing as their future career may have high expectations from nursing education. The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' reasons for pursuing nursing studies. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate nursing students in Slovenia and Croatia. RESULTS: A total of 314 students participated in the study. General satisfaction with their studies is higher among those students who are satisfied with their chosen study programme. The most important reasons to enter nursing studies were interest in the subject and good employment possibilities. As the biggest disadvantage of studying nursing, Slovenian students listed crowded schedules, while Croatian students mentioned faculty organization. Students from both countries agreed that the biggest advantage is the ease of finding a job after graduation. DISCUSSION: As there is a lack of workforce in the healthcare sector, particularly a lack of nurses, universities must adjust their demands and improve study conditions to gain students' attention. Therefore, it is important to notice that nursing students perceive more advantages of studying nursing than disadvantages. CONCLUSION: There are many different reasons to enter nursing studies. Students perceive many advantages in studying nursing, such as ease of employment, getting many hours of clinical practice and the possibility for promotion. On the other hand, there are some challenges in studying nursing, such as the schedule and organization of lectures, seminars and clinical placement. There is a need for further research in the field of nursing student's motivation, especially due to their decreasing motivation during the studies.","Cilar, Leona; Spevan, Marija; Cucek Trifkovic, Klavdija; Stiglic, Gregor",Nurse Educ Today,,139

However, there are various hurdles that impede people from purchasing EVs. For example, long charging time, short driving range, cost and insufficient charging infrastructures available, etc. This article reports the public perception of EV-adoption using statistical analyses and proposes some recommendations for improving EV-adoption in Qatar. User perspectives on EV-adoption barriers in Qatar were investigated based on survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaires were based on similar studies done in other regions of the world. The study attempted to look at different perspectives of the adoption of EV, when asked to a person who is aware of EVs or a person who may or may not be aware of EVs. Cumulative survey responses from the two groups were compared and analyzed using a two sample t-test statistical analysis. Detailed analyses showed that among various major hindrances raising of public awareness of such greener modes of transportation, the availability of charging options in more places and policy incentives towards EVs would play a major role in EV-adoption. The authors provide recommendations that along with government incentives could help make a gradual shift to a greater number of EVs convenient for people of Qatar. The proposed systematic approach for such a study and analysis may help in streamlining research on policies, infrastructures and technologies for efficient penetration of EVs in Qatar.","Khandakar, Amith; Rizqullah, Annaufal; Berbar, Anas Ashraf Abdou; Ahmed, Mohammad Rafi; Iqbal, Atif; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Design and method: The study included 542 patients aged 18 to 98 years old with verified COVID-19 pneumonia by CT of the chest and PCR diagnosis of COIVD-19. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed by past medical history. Results: The patients' age was 58 ± 15 years (n = 542), 53,9 (n=292) of them were women. There were 49,3% (n=267) patients with AH. The prevalence of AH was higher among women (63% (n=169) compare to 37% (n=98) of men) and older adults. The average age of patients with AH was 65,3±14,5 years old compared to 50,1±14,5 years old among patients without hypertension (p&lt;0,01). There was no statistical difference in NEWS scores between patients with and without arterial hypertension (p&gt;0,05). 16% of patients with AH were transferred to ICU, while only 10% without AH needed to be placed in ICU (p&lt;0,05). However, the mortality was higher in patients with arterial hypertension (8,6% compared to 0,7%, p&lt;0,05%). Conclusions: Arterial hypertension is relatively common among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and is associated with higher mortality.

363429,Nanophotonic biosensors for point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics and coronavirus surveillance,2021,"The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) and the accompanied coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued ceaselessly despite the implementations of popular measures, which include social distancing and outdoor face masking as recommended by the World Health Organization. Due to the unstable nature of the virus, leading to the emergence of new variants that are claimed to be more and rapidly transmissible, there is a need for further consideration of the alternative potential pathways of the virus transmissions to provide the needed and effective control measures. This review aims to address this important issue by examining the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 via indirect contacts such as fomites and aerosols, extending to water, food, and other environmental compartments. This is essentially required to shed more light regarding the speculation of the virus spread through these media as the available information regarding this is fragmented in the literature. The existing state of the information on the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water-food-environmental compartments is essential for cause-and-effect relationships of human interactions and environmental samples to safeguard the possible transmission and associated risks through these media. Furthermore, the integration of effective remedial measures previously used to tackle the viral outbreaks and pandemics, and the development of new sustainable measures targeting at monitoring and curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. This study concluded that alternative transmission pathways via human interactions with environmental samples should not be ignored due to the evolving of more infectious and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Adelodun, Bashir; Ajibade, Fidelis Odedishemi; Tiamiyu, AbdulGafar Olatunji; Nwogwu, Nathaniel Azubuike; Ibrahim, Rahmat Gbemisola; Kumar, Pankaj; Kumar, Vinod; Odey, Golden; Yadav, Krishna Kumar; Khan, Afzal Husain; Cabral-Pinto, Marina M S; Kareem, Kola Yusuff; Bakare, Hashim Olalekan; Ajibade, Temitope Fausat; Naveed, Quadri Noorulhasan; Islam, Saiful; Fadare, Oluniyi Olatunji; Choi, Kyung Sook",Environ Res,,139

This study investigated the anxiety of the Chinese public and its relationship with social support during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby providing empirical support for interventions on improving the public's mental health. On the basis of an online questionnaire survey conducted on 10-18 February 2020, this study shows that 19.8%, 68.5%, and 11.1% of the respondents suffered mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, and severe anxiety, respectively. Significant differences are reported in state anxiety between people with different household incomes. There are significant differences in trait anxiety and state anxiety between different social support groups. Social support and trait anxiety are negatively correlated. Social support and state anxiety are negatively correlated. Social support affects state anxiety both directly and indirectly (through the mediation of trait anxiety). Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing public support for society can effectively reduce public anxiety.","Ao, Yibin; Zhu, Hao; Meng, Fanrong; Wang, Yan; Ye, Gui; Yang, Linchuan; Dong, Na; Martek, Igor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,139

This induced the government to adopt severely restrictive measures to reduce the contagion risk, forcing most of the population to stop working and from leisure activities, and to remain at home for several weeks. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-related quarantine on smoking and dietary habits of a well-characterized northern Italian rural population. For this purpose, while lockdown restrictions were in place (February-April 2020), 359 subjects from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort underwent a phone interview about their lifestyle habit changes during COVID-19-related quarantine. Quarantine did not significantly modify smoking habit nor body mass index. Subjects significantly increased daily carbohydrates consumption, all fresh vegetables, healthy vegetable oils, milk and yogurt, alcoholic drinks, sugars and sweets, and coffee. The weekly consumption of low-fat meat, cured meat other than ham, cheeses, eggs, nuts and mixed seed oils significantly increased, while the weekly intake of fish, mussels, and legumes significantly decreased during lockdown. The Dietary Quality Index was reduced from 42.4 ± 4.1 to 37.8 ± 4.7 (p < 0.03). In accordance with our findings, COVID-19-related quarantine might worsen the quality of diet, also leading to an increased intake of almost all food categories.","Cicero, Arrigo F G; Fogacci, Federica; Giovannini, Marina; Mezzadri, Martina; Grandi, Elisa; Borghi, Claudio",Nutrients,,139

Both undergraduate and graduate medical education have seen disruptions ranging from fully virtual delivery of educational content and limited clinical care for medical students to increased clinical demands with redeployment for residents and fellows. Adherence to social distancing has led to the adoption and implementation of already available technologies in medical education, including video conferencing softwares and social media platforms. Efficient and effective use of these technologies requires an understanding not only of these platforms and their features but also of their inherent limitations. During a time of uncertainty and increased clinical demands, the approach to medical education must be thoughtful with attention to wellness of both the educator and learner. In this review, we discuss the influence of the pandemic on the existing medical education landscape, outline existing and proposed adaptations to social distancing, and describe challenges that lie ahead.","Hilburg, Rachel; Patel, Niralee; Ambruso, Sophia; Biewald, Mollie A.; Farouk, Samira S.",Adv.

374669,Oxaliplatin-induced hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,2021,"Over the past few decades, there have been concerns regarding the humanization of healthcare and the involvement of family members in patients’ hospital care. The attitudes of hospitals toward welcoming families in this respect have improved. In Arab culture, the main core of society is considered to be the family, not the individual. The objective behind involving family in patient care is to meet patients’ support needs. Consequently, this involvement affects nurses and their attitudes toward the importance of family involvement in patient care. Objectives: To describe nurses’ and nursing students’ perceptions of family involvement in the care of hospitalized adult patients in Saudi Arabia. Design: This study used a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design. The data were collected using a convenience sampling survey via social media. Results: A total of 270 participants (staff and students) took part in this study, including 232 (85.9%) females and 38 (14.1%) males. Moreover, a high percentage of participants (78.8%) acknowledged that family presence strongly affected the improvement of the patient’s condition. However, 69.3% of participants thought that involving family members during special care processes or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would be traumatizing for these individuals. Moreover, there was a significant diffidence between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and the number of years of employment (F = 3.60, p &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, there were insignificant differences between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and their gender, nationality, age, education level, and years of work experience in Saudi Arabia (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between nurses’ years of employment and their support of family involvement in patient care (ß = −0.20, SE = 0.08, t = −2.70, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Nurses with more experience showed no support for family involvement in patient care. We have to consider the clinical barriers that affect nurses’ support for family involvement in patient-centered care, such as hospital polices, guidelines, and the model used for family-centered care integration in the hospital system to facilitate the interaction between healthcare providers and family members.","Shibily, Faygah M.; Aljohani, Nada S.; Aljefri, Yara M.; Almutairi, Aisha S.; Almutairi, Wassaif Z.; Alhallafi, Mashael A.; Alsharif, Fatmah Almutairi Wedad Badr Hanan",Nursing Reports,,139

METHODS: We evaluated 397 patients who were follow-up and treated due to COVID-19 infections. The ages, genders, chronic diseases, ABO and Rh blood group antigens, admission rates to Intensive Care Units (ICU), and mortality rates of the patients were analyzed. FINDINGS: The mean age of the 397 patients with COVID-19 was 47±17 years. In the blood group analysis of the patients, A Rh-positive (A +) was the most frequently seen blood type (176 patients, 44.3%) followed by O Rh-positive (0 +) (109 patients, 27,5%); 38 patients were Rh negative (Rh -) (9,6%). 53 of the patients (13,4%) were followed in ICU and 29 patients died (7,3%). Neither mortality nor admission to ICU was seen for Rh - group. The comparison of Rh groups concerning the need for ICU admission revealed a significantly high rate of ICU admission in the Rh + group (p=0,011), while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh antigen (p=0,069). CONCLUSION: The most frequently seen blood type among COVID-19 patients was A +. The Rh + blood group was found in all cases who were admitted to ICU and had a death outcome. The Rh + blood group was found in a significantly high number of patients who were admitted to ICU, while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh blood group.","Yaylaci, Selçuk; Dheir, Hamad; Issever, Kubilay; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Senocak, Didar; Kocayigit, Havva; Guclu, Ertugrul; Suner, Kezban; Ekerbicer, Hasan; Koroglu, Mehmet",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,139

The molecular interaction study revealed that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where Azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp (-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of SARS-CoV-2. After the comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41, C145, and M165 of MPP played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372, A375, W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction surface of S proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors.

To understand the demographics of mask wearers and resistors, and the impact of mandates on mask-wearing behavior, we observed shoppers (n = 9935) entering retail stores during periods of June, July, and August 2020. Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a mask. At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age and was also 1.5x greater for females than males. Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas. Mask mandates enacted in late July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small percentage of resistors remained. Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily.

Mitigation measures to reduce workplace exposures have included work site policies to support flexible work site options, including telework, whereby employees work remotely without commuting to a central place of work.* Opportunities to telework have varied across industries among U.S. jobs where telework options are feasible (1). However, little is known about the impact of telework on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A case-control investigation was conducted to compare telework between eligible symptomatic persons who received positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (case-patients, 153) and symptomatic persons with negative test results (control-participants, 161). Eligible participants were identified in outpatient health care facilities during July 2020. Among employed participants who reported on their telework status during the 2 weeks preceding illness onset (248), the percentage who were able to telework on a full- or part-time basis was lower among case-patients (35%; 42 of 120) than among control-participants (53%; 68 of 128) (p<0.01). Case-patients were more likely than were control-participants to have reported going exclusively to an office or school setting (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-2.7) in the 2 weeks before illness onset. The association was also observed when further restricting to the 175 participants who reported working in a profession outside the critical infrastructure (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3-3.6). Providing the option to work from home or telework when possible, is an important consideration for reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In industries where telework options are not available, worker safety measures should continue to be scaled up to reduce possible worksite exposures.","Fisher, Kiva A; Olson, Samantha M; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Lindsell, Christopher J; Shapiro, Nathan I; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Erickson, Heidi L; Prekker, Matthew E; Steingrub, Jay S; Exline, Matthew C; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Rice, Todd W; Hager, David N; Ginde, Adit A; Talbot, H Keipp; Casey, Jonathan D; Grijalva, Carlos G; Flannery, Brendan; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,139

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular interactions between monoterpenoids and spike protein of 2019-nCoV together with the cellular proteases [transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsin B (CatB), and cathepsin L (CatL)]. As a result of the relative binding capacity index (RBCI) analysis, carvone was found to be the most effective molecule against all targets when binding energy and predicted (theoretical) IC50data were evaluated together. It was found to exhibit drug-likeness property according to the Lipinski’s rule-of-five. Carvone has also been determined to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively, not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), not to inhibit any of the cytochrome P molecules, and to have no toxic effects even on liver cells. In addition, the LD50dose of carvone in rats was 1.707 mol/kg. Due to its interaction profile with target proteins and excellent pharmacokinetic properties, it has been concluded that carvone can be considered as an alternative agent in drug development studies against 2019-nCoV.","İstifli, Erman Salih; Şihoğlu Tepe, Arzuhan; Sarikürkcü, Cengiz; Tepe, Bektaş",Turk.

This study used Generalizability Theory to test the dependability of psychotherapy competence assessments based on video observation of trainees. A 10-item rating form was developed from a collection of forms used by graduate programs (n = 102) in counseling and clinical psychology, and a review of the common factors research literature. This form was then used by 11 licensed psychologists to rate eight graduate trainees while viewing 129, approximately 5-min video clips from their psychotherapy sessions with clients (n = 22) at a graduate program's training clinic. Generalizability analyses were used to forecast how the number of raters and clients, and length of observation time impact the dependability of ratings in various rating designs. Raters were the primary source of error variance in ratings, with rater main effects (leniency bias) and dyadic effects (rater-target interactions) contributing 24% and 7% of variance, respectively. Variance due to segments (video clips) was also substantial, suggesting that therapist performance varies within the same counseling session. Generalizability coefficients (G) were highest for crossed rating designs and reached maximum levels (G > .50) after four raters watched each therapist working with three clients and observed 15 min per dyad. These findings suggest that expert raters show consensus in ratings even without rater training and only limited direct observation. Future research should investigate the validity of competence ratings as predictors of outcome.

391453,"Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine pig liver sectorization and segmentation through the representation of their correlation to portal and hepatic veins, and through the development of virtual reality (VR) animation. METHODS: Twenty models were obtained by injection of portal and hepatic veins from Landrace pig livers with a methyl methacrylate solution, and by corrosion of the hepatic parenchyma with chloride acid 35%. VR animation of one of these models was conducted through graphic software (3D Studio Max 3.0). RESULTS: Constant presence of eight segments and six venous drainage sectors was observed. Pig portal vein bifurcation was not noticed. Hepatic veins were named according to their embryological origin. Correlation between venous system and hepatic parenchyma was established by means of VR animation. CONCLUSION: These models facilitated both the study of pig hepatic sectors and segments, and the proposal of hepatic veins nomenclature. These models have also been used for the development of VR animated models which show the correlation between the hepatic parenchyma and the pig liver venous system as well as the observation of them from several points of view.","José Zanchet, Dinamar; Frasson de Souza Montero, Edna",Acta cir. bras.,,139

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems, and male patients suffer increased severity and mortality. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidities, both being risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 pathology. We hypothesize that elevated androgens in PCOS regulate SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins in multiple tissues increasing the risk for this population. Female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 90 days. Body composition was measured by EchoMRI. Fasting glucose was determined by an enzymatic method. mRNA and protein levels of ACE2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, Furin, Tmprss4, and Adam17 were quantified by RT-qPCR, Western-blot, or ELISA in tissues, serum, and urine. DHT treatment increased body weight, fat and lean mass, and fasting glucose. Ace2 mRNA was upregulated in the lung, cecum, heart, and kidney, while downregulated in the brain by DHT. ACE2 protein was upregulated by DHT in the small intestine, heart, and kidney. The SARS-CoV-2 priming proteases Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, and Furin mRNA were upregulated by DHT in the kidney. ACE2 sheddase Adam17 mRNA was upregulated by DHT in the kidney, which corresponded with increased urinary ACE2 in DHT treated mice. Our results highlight the potential for increased cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PCOS women with COVID-19.","Huffman, Alexandra M; Rezq, Samar; Basnet, Jelina; Yanes Cardozo, Licy L; Romero, Damian G",Int. j. mol. sci.

392711,Highlights in the advances of chronic rhinosinusitis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Few months after the COVID-19 pandemic burst, many aspects of the human life, including education, dramatically changed. Because of the lockdown measures taken to limit the virus spread in Italy, in-person teaching and learning have been interrupted in all health care disciplines and readapted in virtual formulae. METHODS: As academic ophthalmology departments, we had to maintain the educational needs of medical and orthoptic students, internships, surgical training of residents, as well as to cover the scientific update of health care personnel (HCPs), and the continuation of research and academic activities. To assure these needs we ideated an educational strategy and a team, which was then translated on a multichannel virtual platform created with Microsoft Teams. RESULTS: In this platform there were 21 channels organized in a public view mode, open to all Team members, or in private view mode to separate non-permanent HCPs, internships, residents, and students' tasks, from permanent HCPs tasks. Virtual channels were dedicated to provide theoretical lessons, clinical cases, surgical video, internal meetings and webinar, to offer news from scientific societies, requests of appointments from biomedical companies, links with ophthalmological websites, to move forward research projects, to participate at institutional academic duties, and to obtain feedbacks from users. Residents continued their training on surgery using a surgical simulator, after consulting an agenda uploaded into the dedicated virtual channel. CONCLUSION: These positive initial results should represent a boost to rapidly proceed with the development of even more versatile virtual learning solutions, given that the forecasts for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are not encouraging.","Gallenga, Carla Enrica; Agnifili, Luca; D039,; Aloisio, Rossella; Brescia, Lorenza; Toto, Lisa; Perri, Paolo",Eur J Ophthalmol,,139

This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10 weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3 weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January-21 February) and second (22 February-17 March) periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CI = 69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.17-2.50), high impact score (OR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.17-2.26) and high fear score (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.01-2.14). In conclusion, the psychological and behavioural responses were found to increase with the progression of the outbreak. High anxiety levels found in this study warrant provision of mental health intervention during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wong, Li Ping; Alias, Haridah",J. behav. med,,139

394878,Challenge to scientists: does your ten-year-old code still run?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the behavioral, cognitive, and electrophysiological impact of mild (only a few hours) and acute (one night) sleep loss via simultaneously recorded behavioural and physiological measures of vigilance. METHODS: Participants (N = 23) came into the lab for two testing days where their brain activity and vigilance were recorded and assessed. The night before the testing session, participants either slept from 12am to 9am (Normally Rested), or from 1am to 6am (Sleep Restriction). RESULTS: Vigilance was reduced and sleepiness was increased in the Sleep Restricted vs. Normally Rested condition, and this was exacerbated over the course of performing the vigilance task. As well, sleep restriction resulted in more intense alpha bursts. Lastly, EEG spectral power differed in Sleep Restricted vs. Normally Rested conditions as sleep onset progressed, particularly for frequencies reflecting arousal (e.g., delta, alpha, beta). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that only one night of mild sleep loss significantly increases sleepiness and, importantly, reduces vigilance. In addition, this sleep loss has a clear impact on the physiology of the brain in ways that reflect reduced arousal. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the neural correlates and cognitive processes associated with loss of sleep may lead to important advancements in identifying and preventing deleterious or potentially dangerous, sleep-related lapses in vigilance.","Gibbings, A; Ray, L B; Berberian, N; Nguyen, T; Shahidi Zandi, A; Owen, A M; Comeau, F J E; Fogel, S M",Clin Neurophysiol,,139

METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus and Web of Sciences databases were searched to retrieve potential studies from January 2020 to 3 January 2021. Summary data on frequency and mean of depression and anxiety were extracted. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to estimate overall prevalence, mean and standardized mean difference. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review, of them 21 studies included in meta-analysis. Overall depression and anxiety were 0.37 (0.27, 0.47); I2 = 99.05%, P value < 0.001 and 0.38 (0.31, 0.46); I2 = 99.08%, P value < 0.001, respectively. Compared to controls, cancer patients had higher anxiety level [standard mean difference (SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.08, 0.42)]. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic can reach considerable levels, although observed substantial heterogeneity should be considered when interpreting the results.","Ayubi, Erfan; Bashirian, Saeid; Khazaei, Salman",J Gastrointest Cancer,,139

398470,Clinical characteristics and evolution of pediatric patients with acute leukemia and SARS-COV2 virus infection in a third level hospital in Mexico,2021,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic and obese patients are at higher risk of severe disease and cardiac injury in corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in normal hearts. There is a disagreement regarding the effect of factors such as obesity and diabetes on ACE2 expression in the human heart and whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or anti-diabetic medications increases ACE2 expression and subsequently the susceptibility to infection. We designed this study to elucidate factors that control ACE2 expression in human serum, human heart biopsies, and mice. METHODS: Right atrial appendage biopsies were collected from 79 patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We investigated the alteration in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in heart tissue and serum. ACE2 expression was compared with clinical risk factors: diabetes, obesity and different anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic therapies. WT or db/db mice were infused with Angiotensin II (ATII), treated with different anti-diabetic drugs (Metformin, GLP1A and SGLT2i) were also tested. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was increased in diabetic hearts compared to non-diabetic hearts and was positively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. ACE2 was not differentially expressed in patients who were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to the operation. We found no correlation between plasma free ACE2 and cardiac tissue ACE2 expression. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), metalloprotease ADAM10 and ADAM17 that facilitate viral-ACE2 complex entry and degradation were increased in diabetic hearts. ACE2 expression in mice was increased with ATII infusion and attenuated following anti-diabetic drugs treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or obesity with RAS activation have higher ACE2 expressions therefore are at higher risk for severe infection. Since ACEi or ARBs show no effect on ACE2 expression in the heart further support their safety.","Herman-Edelstein, Michal; Guetta, Tali; Barnea, Amir; Waldman, Maayan; Ben-Dor, Naomi; Barak, Yaron; Kornowski, Ran; Arad, Michael; Hochhauser, Edith; Aravot, Dan",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,139

Several problems that span from physical systems to mathematical conjectures can be encoded into these clauses and be solved by checking their satisfiability (SAT). Recently, SAT solvers have become a sophisticated and powerful computational tool capable, among other things, of solving long-standing mathematical conjectures. In this work, we propose the use of logic AI for the design of optical quantum experiments. We show how to map into a SAT problem the experimental preparation of an arbitrary quantum state and propose a logic-based algorithm, called Klaus, to find an interpretable representation of the photonic setup that generates it. We compare the performance of Klaus with the state-of-the-art algorithm for this purpose based on continuous optimization. We also combine both logic and numeric strategies to find that the use of logic AI improves significantly the resolution of this problem, paving the path to develop more formal-based approaches in the context of quantum physics experiments.","Cervera-Lierta, Alba; Krenn, Mario; Aspuru-Guzik, Al'an",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13273v1.pdf,139

We aimed to describe the course of disease and early post-transplantation outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who failed to show lung recovery despite optimal medical management and were deemed to be at imminent risk of dying due to pulmonary complications. METHODS: We established a multi-institutional case series that included the first consecutive transplants for severe COVID-19-associated ARDS known to us in the USA, Italy, Austria, and India. De-identified data from participating centres-including information relating to patient demographics and pre-COVID-19 characteristics, pretransplantation disease course, perioperative challenges, pathology of explanted lungs, and post-transplantation outcomes-were collected by Northwestern University (Chicago, IL, USA) and analysed. FINDINGS: Between May 1 and Sept 30, 2020, 12 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS underwent bilateral lung transplantation at six high-volume transplant centres in the USA (eight recipients at three centres), Italy (two recipients at one centre), Austria (one recipient), and India (one recipient). The median age of recipients was 48 years (IQR 41-51); three of the 12 patients were female. Chest imaging before transplantation showed severe lung damage that did not improve despite prolonged mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The lung transplant procedure was technically challenging, with severe pleural adhesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and increased intraoperative transfusion requirements. Pathology of the explanted lungs showed extensive, ongoing acute lung injury with features of lung fibrosis. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the allografts. All patients with COVID-19 could be weaned off extracorporeal support and showed short-term survival similar to that of transplant recipients without COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The findings from our report show that lung transplantation is the only option for survival in some patients with severe, unresolving COVID-19-associated ARDS, and that the procedure can be done successfully, with good early post-transplantation outcomes, in carefully selected patients.

406043,The role of bio-detection dogs in the prevention and diagnosis of infectious diseases: A systematic review,2021,"Background Pandemics of infectious diseases have long been regarded as societal challenges This study aimed to summarize the theories of Persian medicine for controlling respiratory disease-related pandemics and to compare these theories with the findings of modern medicine Methods We searched the classic medical reference books of the 9th to 19th centuries for the terms ‘polluted air’ and ‘pandemic’, and we searched 4 databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus) with the keywords ‘COVID-19’, ‘pandemic’, ‘history’, and ‘prevention programs’ The results were collected and subjected to content analysis Results From the point of view of traditional Iranian physicians, disease prevention is primarily possible by avoiding pathogenic factors As a secondary solution, reducing one's susceptibility to the disease is crucial;this can be achieved through cleansing the body and strengthening the mood, reducing food intake, decreasing the internal humidity, disinfecting the house with herbal fumigation, and making use of pleasant aromas Some of these recommendations are reaffirmed by modern research Conclusion Persian medicine techniques may be preventive during respiratory, influenza-like disease pandemics However, rigorous studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis","Iranzadasl, Maryam; Karimi, Yasin; Moadeli, Fatemeh; Pasalar, Mehdi",Integrative Medicine Research,,139
408127,Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of Bartholin's Gland: What Is the Best Approach?,2020,"PURPOSE: Vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) is frequently observed on [18F]FDG PET-CT following BNT162b2 administration. Recent data suggest a prominent B cell germinal-center (GC) response elicited by mRNA vaccines in draining lymph nodes. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the correlation between VAHL and humoral immunity as reflected by post-vaccination serologic testing and by comparing the incidence of VAHL between lymphoma patients treated recently with B cell depleting therapy and those that were not. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with hematologic malignancy that had post-vaccination [18F]FDG PET-CT were included (All-PET group), 86 received both vaccine doses before imaging (PET-2 group). Their VAHL status and grade on imaging were recorded. Among 102 lymphoma patients, 34 (33.3%) were treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy. A subgroup of 54 patients also underwent serologic testing 2-3 weeks after the booster dose, and their anti-spike titers were recorded and graded as well. RESULTS: The overall incidence of VAHL in patients with hematologic malignancy was 31.4%. The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted with all other lymphoma patients (8.8 versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers, and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90 and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (rs = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (rs = 0.642, Pv < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VAHL on [18F]FDG PET-CT of patients with hematologic malignancy may reflect GC B cell proliferation and an effective humoral response elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine.","Cohen, Dan; Hazut Krauthammer, Shir; Cohen, Yael C; Perry, Chava; Avivi, Irit; Herishanu, Yair; Even-Sapir, Einat",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,139
408534,Should we mind for late neurologic manifestations from novel coronavirus?,2020,"MOTIVATION: The combination of genomic and epidemiological data holds the potential to enable accurate pathogen transmission history inference. However, the inference of outbreak transmission histories remains challenging due to various factors such as within-host pathogen diversity and multi-strain infections. Current computational methods ignore within-host diversity and/or multi-strain infections, often failing to accurately infer the transmission history. Thus, there is a need for efficient computational methods for transmission tree inference that accommodate the complexities of real data. RESULTS: We formulate the direct transmission inference (DTI) problem for inferring transmission trees that support multi-strain infections given a timed phylogeny and additional epidemiological data. We establish hardness for the decision and counting version of the DTI problem. We introduce Transmission Tree Uniform Sampler (TiTUS), a method that uses SATISFIABILITY to almost uniformly sample from the space of transmission trees. We introduce criteria that prioritize parsimonious transmission trees that we subsequently summarize using a novel consensus tree approach. We demonstrate TiTUS's ability to accurately reconstruct transmission trees on simulated data as well as a documented HIV transmission chain.

412551,The transmissibility of novel Coronavirus in the early stages of the 2019-20 outbreak in Wuhan: Exploring initial point-source exposure sizes and durations using scenario analysis,2020,"Background and Objectives: In the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the management of immunosuppressive (IS) therapy in kidney transplant (KT) recipients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires attention. It is not yet understood whether IS therapy may protect from the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or a temporary adjustment/withdrawal of IS therapy to restore the immune system may be necessary. We performed a systematic literature review to investigate the current management of IS therapy in KT recipients with COVID-1. Materials and Methods: Out of 71 articles published from 1 February 2020 until 30 October 2020, 554 KT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Results: Modifications of IS therapy were based on the clinical conditions. For asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, a ""wait and see approach"" was mostly used; a suspension of antimetabolites drugs (347/461, 75.27%) or mTOR inhibitors (38/48, 79.2%) was adopted in the majority of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infections. For CNIs, the most frequent attitude was their maintenance (243/502, 48.4%) or dose-reduction (99/502, 19.72%) in patients asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms, while drug withdrawal was the preferred choice in severely symptomatic patients (160/450, 31.87%). A discontinuation of all IS drugs was used only in severely symptomatic COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Renal function remained stable in 422(76.17%) recipients, while 49(8.84%) patients experienced graft loss. Eight (1.44%) patients experienced a worsening of renal function. The overall mortality was 21.84%, and 53(9.56%) patients died with functioning grafts. Conclusion: A tailored approach to the patient has been the preferred strategy for the management of IS therapy in KT recipients, taking into account the clinical conditions of patients and the potential interactions between IS and antiviral drugs, in the attempt to balance the risks of COVID-19-related complications and those due to rejection or graft loss.","Angelico, Roberta; Blasi, Francesca; Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Toti, Luca; Tisone, Giuseppe; Cacciola, Roberto",Medicina (Kaunas),,139

Given existing health disparities and research on minority stress, COVID-19 may have uniquely impacted psychological well-being among sexual minorities. In an online survey of adults in the U.S. (N = 1,007) conducted in April 2020, we examined differences between sexual minority and heterosexual participants in psychological well-being, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19-related worry and experiences. Sexual minorities reported lower thriving and greater psychological distress, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19 worry and experiences than heterosexual participants. Social distancing and distress were positively correlated among sexual minorities and more frequent computer-mediated communication predicted greater thriving across groups. Path analyses showed sexual minorities' poorer psychological well-being was mediated by their greater COVID-19 worry and social distancing, in particular. These findings shed light on the distinct impact of COVID-19 on sexual minorities.","Baumel, Katie; Hamlett, Mara; Wheeler, Brittany; Hall, Deborah; Randall, Ashley K; Mickelson, Kristin",J Homosex,,139

418935,"Scribes, EHRs, and Workflow Efficiencies in Allergy Practices",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Stroke is a common cause of epilepsy that may be mediated via glutamate dysregulation. There is currently no evidence to support the use of antiseizure medications as primary prevention against poststroke epilepsy. Perampanel has a unique antiglutamatergic mechanism of action and may have antiepileptogenic properties. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perampanel as an antiepileptogenic treatment in patients at high risk of poststroke epilepsy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Up to 328 patients with cortical ischaemic stroke or lobar haemorrhage will be enrolled, and receive their first treatment within 7 days of stroke onset. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive perampanel (titrated to 6 mg daily over 4 weeks) or matching placebo, stratified by stroke subtype (ischaemic or haemorrhagic). Treatment will be continued for 12 weeks after titration. 7T MRI will be performed at baseline for quantification of cerebral glutamate by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging. Blood will be collected for measurement of plasma glutamate levels. Participants will be followed up for 52 weeks after randomisation.The primary study outcome will be the proportion of participants in each group free of late (more than 7 days after stroke onset) poststroke seizures by the end of the 12-month study period, analysed by Fisher's exact test. Secondary outcomes will include time to first seizure, time to treatment withdrawal and 3-month modified Rankin Scale score. Quality of life, cognitive function, mood and adverse events will be assessed by standardised questionnaires. Exploratory outcomes will include correlation between cerebral and plasma glutamate concentration and stroke and seizure outcomes.

419071,Minimal Change Disease Following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine a cut-off value of Chest CT severity score (CT-SS) in order to discriminate between the clinical types of COVID-19 pneumonia. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Radiology, Shifa International Hospital, from 1st March to June 30th, 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and three consecutive patients' RT PCR positive for COVID-19 were included. Two consultant radiologists, with experience of 7 to 10 years in body imaging, evaluated their HRCT studies in consensus and calculated the CT severity score. A scoring of all 20 individual regions in each lung were assigned by the radiologists attributing a score of 0, 1 or 2 to each region, if parenchymal opacification was none, less than 50%, or 50% or more, respectively. The CT severity score was a summation of scores of all 20 regions of both lungs combined with a range of 0 to 40 points. The scores were compared for clinically mild and severe disease. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted regarding the scoring of lung opacity in mild and severe groups in each lung segment, p <0.05. The most significantly involved segments were right lower lobe's medial and lateral basal segment, left upper lobe's superior lingular segment and left lower lobe's medial basal and lateral basal segments. To discriminate mild versus severe disease, CT-SS threshold value turned out to be 19.5 Conclusion: CTSS may be of value for a prompt and objective means of assessing the degree of severity and disease burden in lungs.

We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson's coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value < 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson's coefficients between -0.47 and -0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Mutti, Luciano; Pentimalli, Francesca; Baglio, Giovanni; Saladino, Rita Emilena; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Giordano, Antonio",,,139

Building on an existing trustworthiness checklist for digital health applications, we searched the literature and developed a framework to guide the assessment of smartphone and web-based applications that aim to contribute to controlling the current epidemic or mitigating its effects. It further integrates epidemiological subject knowledge and a legal analysis, outlining the mechanisms through which new applications can support the fight against COVID-19.

We found that under the reference infection scenario, the US gasoline demand grows slowly after a quick rebound in May, and is unlikely to fully recover prior to October 2020. Under the reference and pessimistic scenario, continual lockdown (no reopening) could worsen the motor gasoline demand temporarily, but it helps the demand recover to a normal level quicker. Under the optimistic infection scenario, gasoline demand will recover close to the non-pandemic level by October 2020.","Ou, Shiqi; He, Xin; Ji, Weiqi; Chen, Wei; Sui, Lang; Gan, Yu; Lu, Zifeng; Lin, Zhenhong; Deng, Sili; Przesmitzki, Steven; Bouchard, Jessey",Nat.

The dataset was representative of the population, with 18.4% of subjects reporting at least one NCD. Results showed that low household income and residence in government-subsidized housing were significant predictors for the subjects who experienced difficulty in managing during first 2 months of the pandemic (11% of the NCD patients). Of those on long-term NCD medication, 10% reported having less than one week's supply of medication. Targeted services for vulnerable groups during a pandemic should be explored to support NCD self-care.","Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Kim, Jean Hee; Lo, Eugene Siu Kai; Huang, Zhe; Hung, Heidi; Hung, Kevin Kei Ching; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Lee, Eric Kam Pui; Wong, Martin Chi Sang; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,139
429770,Abstract No. 526 Role of interventional radiology in a pandemic,2021,"COVID-19 is one of the major global health threats of the 21st century, causing unprecedented humanitarian crises worldwide. Despite concerted efforts to curb the spread of the disease, the pandemic continues to strain healthcare systems globally and a safe, highly effective, and globally acceptable and equitable vaccination program, together with pre-existing precautionary measures, is essential to effectively contain the outbreak. We commented on the need to level any uneven power dynamics in COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution must not allow for sovereignty which is tightly linked to historical imbalances in power and resources to result into discrimination between rich and poor countries. Poor countries must be supported in ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccine by levelling the power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and fuel inequity. We must ensure equity, fairness and transparency in COVID-19 distribution and gain public trust in COVID-19 vaccine through participatory community engagement. COVID-19 vaccine distribution and access must be equitable and not politicized.","Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Badmos, Abubakar; Khalid-Salako, Fahd; Gaya, Sa039; Khalid, id; Ilesanmi, Esther Bosede; Olaoye, Damilola Quazeem; Bamisaiye, Adeola; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Public Health Pract (Oxf),,139

433092,Changes in serum virus-specific IgM/IgG antibody in asymptomatic and discharged patients with reoccurring positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (RPNAT),2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has immensely affected economic and social order in not only China but the entire world, seriously threatening peoples' lives and property. In China's fight against COVID-19, the community is at the front line of joint prevention and control of the disease, yet it faces the problem of insufficient resilience. We explored the manifestations and formation mechanism of the problem of insufficient resilience in community public health crisis governance, based on the complex adaptive system theory, which emphasizes interaction among subjects and between subjects and the environment to improve the adaptability to the environment. Questionnaires and in-depth interviews were conducted in 28 counties (districts) of 14 cities of 7 provinces in China; 2345 questionnaires and 71 interview data were collected, and we conducted descriptive statistical analysis on questionnaire data. It is found that some communities faced insufficient resilience problems such as ""simply isolating households and communities"", ""blindly setting limits"", ""layer-by-layer law"", and ""rejecting and repelling all individuals from or even related to Hubei"". These problems are due to the fact that the community have a non-interactive relationship, which is a one-dimensional linear governance model to some extent. The legal content of the building of a ""comprehensive disaster-reduction demonstration community"" implemented by the Chinese government is compelled to stay at the level of system design to some extent, with its existence playing an ornamental role but lacking a substantial one. In this regard, this study suggests that a resilient governance model of community pluralistic cooperation be established based on the theoretical framework of complex adaptive system. This model is designed to increase the resilience of community public health crisis governance. The authoritative role of central and local policies is expected to be truly developed and played in dealing with the grassroots community public health crisis.","Wang, Chao; Dong, Xuan; Zhang, Yan; Luo, Yiwen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,139
434587,Exercise and well-being during COVID 19 - time to boost your immunity,2020,"Past research studies have acknowledged the role of resilience in policies and decisions to address disruptive events and proposed frameworks to measure it. The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","Karan, E.; Asgari, S.",Environment Systems and Decisions,,139
434748,Abstract No. 589 Assessing the role of interventional radiology during the initial phase of COVID-19: a large health system experience,2021,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important role in physiology and disease and represent productive drug targets. Orphan GPCRs, which have unknown endogenous ligands, are considered drug targets and consequently have attracted great interest in identifying their endogenous cognate ligands for deorphanization. However, additional studies have shown that GPCRs, including many orphan GPCRs, can constitutively activate G protein signaling in a ligand-independent manner. GPR39 is such an orphan GPCR with constitutive activity. Here, we performed a phylogenetic and selection analysis of GPR39 in vertebrates, and we found that GPR39 underwent positive selection in different branches of vertebrates. Using luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that human, frog and chicken GPR39 can constitutively activate Gq and G12 signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. Zebrafish GPR39 can constitutively activate Gs, Gq and G12 signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. We further found that the zebrafish-H2967.35 site is crucial for the activity of the Gs signaling pathway. In addition, our mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection sites of GPR39 from different species had important effects on the constitutive activity of the receptor. Our results revealed the adaptive evolution of GPR39 in diverse directions, which led to differences in constitutive activity.","Zhang, Lina; Song, Jingjing; Zang, Zhuqing; Tang, Huihao; Li, Wei; Lai, Shanshan; Deng, Cheng",Gen Comp Endocrinol,,139

Management of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its potential limited availability have created concerns about the increased risks for healthcare professionals at hospitals and nursing homes. Ozone is a powerful oxidant agent. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of ozone treatment on PPE contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, and to explore whether relative humidity could modify those effects. METHODS: PPE contaminated by heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were treated with different ozone concentrations, exposure times, and relative humidity conditions. SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There was no amplification of SARS-CoV-2 in PPE after the following ozone exposures: 30 s at 10,000 ppm (20 g/m3), 5 min at 4000 ppm, and 10 min at 2000 ppm. At lower ozone concentrations, 4-12 ppm (0.008-0.024 g/m3), the effects were highly dependent on the relative humidity conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress induced by ozone exposure eliminated heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in different PPE components under appropriate exposure times, ozone concentrations, and relative humidity conditions. These findings could have implications in decreasing the risk of contamination associated with personal protective equipment management and in increasing its availability. Further research in the original SARS-CoV-2 strain is guaranteed.","Clavo, Bernardino; Córdoba-Lanús, Elizabeth; Rodríguez-Esparragón, Francisco; Cazorla-Rivero, Sara E; García-Pérez, Omar; Piñero, José E; Villar, Jesús; Blanco, Angeles; Torres-Ascensión, Cristina; Martín-Barrasa, José L; González-Martin, Jesús M; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro; Lorenzo-Morales, Jacob",,,139

The switching mechanism naturally forces the existence of periodic orbits. In order to make unbiased comparisons between periodic orbits in this model and a traditional one where the contact rate switches based on more simplistic pointwise evaluations of active cases, we use a rigorous homotopy continuation method. We develop computer-assisted proofs that can validate the continuation and prove that the branch of periodic orbits has no folds and is isolated in the space of periodic solutions. This allows a direct, rigorous comparison between the geometric and quantitative properties of the cycles with a moving average threshold and a pointwise threshold.

A systematic review of the literature,2020,"Biomineralization of Cu has been shown to control contaminant dynamics and transport in soils. However, very little is known about the role that subsurface microorganisms may play in the biogeochemical cycling of Cu. In this study, we investigate the bioreduction of Cu(II) by the subsurface metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens Rapid removal of Cu from solution was observed in cell suspensions of G. sulfurreducens when supplied with Cu(II), while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses showed the formation of electron dense nanoparticles associated with the cell surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis and EDX spectrum image maps revealed the nanoparticles are rich in both Cu and S. This was confirmed by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses which identified the nanoparticles as Cu2S. Biomineralization of CuxS nanoparticles in soils has been reported to enhance the colloidal transport of a number of contaminants including Pb, Cd, and Hg. However, formation of these CuxS nanoparticles has only been observed under sulfate-reducing conditions and could not be repeated using isolates of implicated organisms. As G. sulfurreducens is unable to respire sulfate, and no reducible sulfur was supplied to the cells, these data suggest a novel mechanism for the biomineralization of Cu2S under anoxic conditions. The implications of these findings for the biogeochemical cycling of Cu and other metals as well as the green production of Cu catalysts are discussed.ImportanceDissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in soils and aquifers and are known to utilize a wide range of metals as terminal electron acceptors. These transformations play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metals in pristine and contaminated environments and can be harnessed for bioremediation and metal bioprocessing purposes. However, relatively little is known about their interactions with Cu. As a trace element that becomes toxic in excess, Cu can adversely affect soil biota and fertility. In addition, biomineralization of Cu nanoparticles has been reported to enhance mobilization of other toxic metals. Here, we demonstrate that when supplied with acetate under anoxic conditions, the model metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens, can transform soluble Cu(II) to Cu2S nanoparticles. This study provides new insights into Cu biomineralization by microorganisms and suggests that contaminant mobilization enhanced by Cu biomineralization could be facilitated by Geobacter species and related organisms.","Kimber, Richard L; Bagshaw, Heath; Smith, Kurt; Buchanan, Dawn M; Coker, Victoria S; Cavet, Jennifer S; Lloyd, Jonathan R",,,139

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits at a community-based hospital in the United States. Methods: Patients and providers were electronically surveyed at the end of 2020 regarding telemedicine visit experiences. These visits took place throughout the majority of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 85.7% (6) of providers reported spending the same or less time on telemedicine visits compared with in-person visits. All providers were either somewhat or very satisfied with the interpersonal connections made in telemedicine visits. All providers wished to see telemedicine visits continued in the future. A total of 355 patients responded. Over 90% of participants reported feeling comfortable speaking to their provider about personal issues through telemedicine. Around 73.2% of patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visit. Around 69.8% of patients report that they would like to use either primarily telemedicine visits or a combination of telemedicine and in-person visits when it is safe to return to in-person care. Conclusions: Patients and providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine use in a weight management center. They both wish to see these visit types offered in the future.

451821,Deep learning-based multi-view fusion model for screening 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia: A multicentre study,2020,"We describe the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mosquito-borne diseases in Queensland, Australia, during the first half of 2020. Implementation of restrictions coincided with an atypical late season outbreak of Ross River virus (RRV) characterized by a peak in notifications in April (1173) and May (955) which were greater than 3-fold the mean observed for the previous four years. We propose that limitations on human movement likely resulted in the majority of RRV infections being acquired at or near the place of residence, and that an increase in outdoor activities, such as gardening and bushwalking in the local household vicinity, increased risk of exposure to RRV-infected mosquitoes. In contrast, the precipitous decline in international passenger flights led to a reduction in the number of imported dengue and malaria cases of over 70% and 60%, respectively, compared with the previous five years. This substantial reduction in flights also reduced a risk pathway for importation of exotic mosquitoes, but the risk posed by importation via sea cargo was not affected. Overall, the emergence of COVID-19 has had a varied impact on mosquito-borne disease epidemiology in Queensland, but the need for mosquito surveillance and control, together with encouragement of personal protective measures, remains unchanged.","Jansen, Cassie C; Darbro, Jonathan M; Birrell, Frances A; Shivas, Martin A; van den Hurk, Andrew F",Viruses,,139

452710,Positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay results in patients recovered from COVID-19: Report of two cases,2021,"In this letter, the authors wonder about the need to apply some of the precautions that have been repeatedly suggested during the recent COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic not only to suspected or documented cases of infection but also to all the new cases entering the hospital. In this regard, orotracheal intubation has been universally recognized as a maneuver with a high risk of viral transmission. On the other hand, rapid sequence induction, which represents the gold standard for limiting the risk of transmission for health care professionals, implies side effects that can be potentially harmful for patients with impaired hemodynamics. In this regard, the authors report a particular type of rapid induction that they are performing in a systematic way during the recent pandemic in cardiac surgery patients. This is performed after the patient reaches a deep analgesic plan, thanks to the unique characteristics of the opioid remifentanil. This type of induction, already tested in vasculopathic patients who underwent carotid surgery, is characterized by great hemodynamic stability and is very advantageous, in the writer's experience, when rapid sequence induction has to be systematically applied to cardiovascular patients, especially if you only want to protect operators.","Bevilacqua, Sergio; Bottari, Vanessa; Galeotti, Ilaria",Semin Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,,139

The model is a classical SIR, but is non-autonomous; the rate of susceptible people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the available data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under the assumption that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the infected population has not been tested positive. In the last part, we extend the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and NY states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available data, and illustrates typical dynamics of the disease: exponential increase, apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in the transmission rate over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown policies reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ states shows a wave in NJ following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor.","Ambrosio, Benjamin; Aziz-Alaoui, M.

455824,Successful ECMO therapy in a child with COVID-19-associated ARDS and acute lymphoblastic leukemia,2021,"The aim of this paper was to investigate the therapeutic effect of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid recommended by Provincial Novel Coronary Virus Pneumonia Treatment Scheme on the treatment of BALB/c mice with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome and to explore its clinical application in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to provide laboratory data support for clinical Chinese medicine. According to the classification of syndromes of novel coronavirus pneumonia by the national competent department of traditional Chinese medicine, this study determined that human coronavirus 229 E(HCoV-229 E)-infected mouse model of cold and dampness syndrome can be used to study human coronavirus pneumonia combined with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome model. This model is suitable for simulating traditional Chinese medicine treatment of common disease syndromes in Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program(trial implementation of the sixth edition). Specific steps are as follows. BALB/c mice of cold and dampness syndrome is infected with HCoV-229 E virus, and were divided into normal control group, infection control group, cold-dampness control group, cold-dampness infection group(the model group), and Compound Qilan Oral Liquid high dose group(22 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)) and low dose group(11 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). On the day of infection, the Compound Qilan Oral Liquid was administered for three consecutive days. On the last dosing day, the lung tissue was dissected, and the lung index and inhibition rate were calculated. The nucleic acid of lung tissue was extracted and the HCoV-229 E virus load was detected by RT-PCR. Blood leukocytes were separated and the percentage of T and B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Lung tissue protein was extracted and the contents of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ were detected by ELISA. Serum was separated and the contents of gastrin(GAS) and motilin(MTL) were detected by ELISA. Histopathological analysis was performed with lung tissue. The high and low doses of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid significantly reduced the lung index(P<0.01) of mice with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome, and the inhibition rates were 59.01% and 47.72%, respectively. Compared with the model control group, the high and low doses of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid significantly reduced lung tissue viral load(P<0.01), increased cross blood CD4~+ T lymphocytes, CD8~+ T lymphocytes and total B lymphocyte percentage(P<0.01), reduced serum motilin content(P<0.01), reduced IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ levels in lungs(P<0.01) and reduced lung tissue inflammation. Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid has a better effect on the mouse model with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome, which may attribute to its function of in virus replication inhibition, gastrointestinal function improvement, immunity enhancement, and inflammatory factor reduction.","Bao, Yan-Yan; Shi, Yu-Jing; Guo, Shan-Shan; Geng, Zi-Han; Bao, Lei; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Rong-Hua; Gao, Ying-Jie; Fang, Tong-Hua; Meng, Jie; Cui, Xiao-Lan",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,139

456784,Medical waste management practice during the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus pandemic: Experience in a general hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on economies, food systems, and health care resources in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities; however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of -0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81, and -0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic. Enhanced surveillance will inform policymakers and leaders in the LAC about COVID-19 outbreaks.","Post, Lori; Ohiomoba, Ramael O; Maras, Ashley; Watts, Sean J; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Chaudhury, Azraa S; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,139

Our objective was to investigate the mental health of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Trauma Exposure Scale, abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Demographic Questionnaire were used to examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, trauma exposure, resilience and perceived social support among 898 patients who were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. The data were analyzed with t tests, one-way ANOVA and multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety was 13.2, 21.0 and 16.4%, respectively. Hospitalized patients who were more impacted by negative news reports, had greater exposure to traumatic experiences, and had lower levels of perceived social support reported higher PTSD, depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Effective professional mental health services should be designed to support the psychological wellbeing of hospitalized patients, especially those who have severe disease, are strongly affected by negative news and have high levels of exposure to trauma.","Chen, Yaru; Huang, Xin; Zhang, Chengyuan; An, Yuanyuan; Liang, Yiming; Yang, Yufang; Liu, Zhengkui",BMC Psychiatry,,139

Physicians attending intensive care and emergency medicine training courses between June 16th and July 2nd 2020 answered a questionnaire and were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via automated electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay. We recruited 516 physicans from all parts of Germany, 445/516 (86%) worked in high risk areas, and 379/516 (73%) had treated patients with COVID-19. The overall positive rate was 18/516 (3.5%), 16/18 (89%) had antibodies against SARS-COV-2, another 2 reported previous positive RT-PCR results although antibody testing was negative. Of those positive, 7/18 (39%) were unaware of their infection. A stay abroad was stated by 173/498 (35%), mostly in Europe. 87/516 (17%) reported a febrile respiratory infection after January 1st 2020 which was related to SARS-CoV-2 in 4/87 (4.6%).

N95 masks and eye protection devices were available for 87% and 73%, respectively. A total of 254/502 (51%) had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. The overall SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of german physicians from intensive care and emergency medicine was low compared to reports from other countries and settings. This finding may be explained by the fact that the German health care system was not overwhelmed by the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Brandenburger, Timo; Braun, Julian F W; Cleff, Corvin; Moussazadeh, Kian; Mrosewski, Ingo; Timm, Jörg; Wetzchewald, Dietmar",PLoS One,,139

458885,"Causal associations of smoking with the expression of ACE2, a putative receptor of COVID19: Results from a Mendelian randomization study",2020,"INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the decision-making process regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) into focus. The aim of this study is to compare rates of Do-Not-Attempt-CPR (DNACPR) documentation in older hospitalised patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: this was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. Data including co-morbidities and resuscitation status was collected on 300 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised from 1 March to 31 May 2020. DNACPR documentation rates in patients aged &#8805;65 years with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared to those without COVID-19 admitted during the same period and were also compared to the documentation rates pre-COVID-19 pandemic (1 March-31 May 2019). RESULTS: of 300 COVID-19-positive patients, 28% had a DNACPR order documented during their admission. Of 131 older (&#8805;65 years) patients with COVID-19, 60.3% had a DNACPR order compared to 25.4% of 130 older patients without COVID-19 (P < 0.0001). During a comparable time period pre-pandemic, 15.4% of 130 older patients had a DNACPR order in place (P < 0.0001). Almost fifty percent of DNACPR orders were recorded within 24 h of a positive swab result for SARS-CoV-2. Of older COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% were referred to palliative care services and 70.2% survived. CONCLUSION: the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more widespread and earlier decision-making regarding resuscitation status. Although case fatality rates were higher for older hospitalised patients with COVID-19, many older patients survived the illness. Advance care planning should be prioritised in all patients and should remain as part of good clinical practice despite the pandemic.","Connellan, David; Diffley, Kara; McCabe, John; Cotter, Aoife; McGinty, Tara; Sheehan, Gerard; Ryan, Karen; Cullen, Walter; Lambert, John S; Callaly, Elizabeth L; Kyne, Lorraine",Age Ageing,,139

463288,Practice Notes from the AAAI,2021,"As of June 16, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 2,104,346 cases and 116,140 deaths in the United States.* During pregnancy, women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that could increase their risk for more severe illness from respiratory infections (1,2). To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19-related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15-44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.","Ellington, Sascha; Strid, Penelope; Tong, Van T; Woodworth, Kate; Galang, Romeo R; Zambrano, Laura D; Nahabedian, John; Anderson, Kayla; Gilboa, Suzanne M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,139

This study aims to identify the clinical and demographic factors influencing the time taken for viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 to determine the optimal isolation period. METHODS: This two-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between March 1 and June 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were included. Data were extracted from medical records. The positive duration, which was defined as the period from the day of symptom onset to the negative conversion day, was assessed using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: We included 63 patients. The mean positive duration was 20 days. The positive duration was significantly shorter for patients younger than 30 years of age and those between 30 and 60 years of age than for patients older than 60 years of age. We observed a more scattered distribution of the positive duration in older patients than in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients who recovered from COVID-19 took less time to clear SARS-CoV-2 than older patients; thus, a classification of the isolation periods based on age could be considered. A uniform viral clearance period for older patients may be difficult to determine because of biases such as underlying medical conditions. Further surveillance measures are recommended to determine the viral clearance time and the optimal isolation period.","Hirai, Nobuyasu; Nishioka, Yuichi; Sekine, Takahiro; Nishihara, Yuji; Okuda, Nao; Nishimura, Tomoko; Fujikura, Hiroyuki; Imakita, Natsuko; Fukumori, Tatsuya; Ogawa, Taku; Hishiya, Naokuni; Suzuki, Yuki; Nakano, Ryuichi; Yano, Hisakazu; Sato, Masatoshi; Maeda, Koichi; Imamura, Tomoaki; Kasahara, Kei",J Infect Chemother,,139

The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.","To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chiu, Kelvin Hei-Yeung; Hung, Derek Ling-Lung; Li, Xin; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhang, Anna Jian-Xia; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,139
469900,Applications of Google Search Trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: a case study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan,2020,"We postulate that similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an altruistic defense mechanism to protect their niche against external threat. Herein, we report mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based altruistic defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection of lung. MHV-1 infection led to reprogramming of CD271+ MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype that exhibits altruistic behavior, as per our previous work in human embryonic stem cells. The reprogrammed MSCs exhibited transient expansion for 2 weeks, followed by apoptosis and expression of stemness genes. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibited direct antiviral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1-induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells by increasing their survival/proliferation and decreasing viral load. Thus, the reprogrammed MSCs can be identified as altruistic stem cells (ASCs), which exert a unique altruistic defense against MHV-1. In a mouse model of MSC-mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20-fold lower viral loads than the MTB-free control mice on the third week of viral infection, and exhibited six-fold increase of ASCs, thereby enhancing the altruistic defense. Notably, these ASCs exhibited intracellular replication of MTB, and their extracellular release. Animals showed tuberculosis reactivation, suggesting that dormant MTB may exploit ASCs for disease reactivation.","Pathak, Lekhika; Gayan, Sukanya; Pal, Bidisha; Talukdar, Joyeeta; Bhuyan, Seema; Sandhya, Sorra; Yeger, Herman; Baishya, Debabrat; Das, Bikul",Am. j. pathol,,139

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and acute cerebrovascular diseases is unclear. AIMS: We aimed to characterize the incidence, risk factors, clinical-radiological manifestations, and outcome of COVID-19-associated stroke. METHODS: Three medical databases were systematically reviewed for published articles on acute cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 (December 2019-September 2020). The review protocol was previously registered (PROSPERO ID = CRD42020185476). Data were extracted from articles reporting &#8805;5 stroke cases in COVID-19. We complied with the PRISMA guidelines and used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effect model. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Of 2277 initially identified articles, 61 (2.7%) were entered in the meta-analysis. Out of 108,571 patients with COVID-19, acute CVD occurred in 1.4% (95%CI: 1.0-1.9). The most common manifestation was acute ischemic stroke (87.4%); intracerebral hemorrhage was less common (11.6%). Patients with COVID-19 developing acute cerebrovascular diseases, compared to those who did not, were older (pooled median difference = 4.8 years; 95%CI: 1.7-22.4), more likely to have hypertension (OR = 7.35; 95%CI: 1.94-27.87), diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.56; 95%CI: 3.34-9.24), coronary artery disease (OR = 3.12; 95%CI: 1.61-6.02), and severe infection (OR = 5.10; 95%CI: 2.72-9.54). Compared to individuals who experienced a stroke without the infection, patients with COVID-19 and stroke were younger (pooled median difference = -6.0 years; 95%CI: -12.3 to -1.4), had higher NIHSS (pooled median difference = 5; 95%CI: 3-9), higher frequency of large vessel occlusion (OR = 2.73; 95%CI: 1.63-4.57), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR = 5.21; 95%CI: 3.43-7.90). CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebrovascular diseases are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, especially in those whom are severely infected and have pre-existing vascular risk factors. The pattern of large vessel occlusion and multi-territory infarcts suggests that cerebral thrombosis and/or thromboembolism could be possible causative pathways for the disease.","Nannoni, Stefania; de Groot, Rosa; Bell, Steven; Markus, Hugh S",Int J Stroke,,139

Among these actions, occupational health faces challenges, since a significant part of the population is economically active and have had to suspend work, and in the current context, return-to-work measures have been implemented. The care and protection of healthcare workers is crucial, given that they are the specific population that takes care for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and this increases their exposure to the virus and expands their possibility of suffering from COVID-19, which must be recognized as an occupational disease which must be attended from the prevention of exposure to the care of sequelae and even compensation for death derived from this disease.","Moreno-Torres, L.

We analyzed the COVID-19 data from the nationwide health insurance claims of South Korea. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and mortality records of patients with COVID-19 were extracted from the database. The odds ratios of mortality according to comorbidities in these patients with and without adjustment for age and sex were calculated. The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold > 3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94). Our study revealed multiple risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The high predictive power of the ACCI for mortality in our results can support the importance of old age and comorbidities in the severity of COVID-19.","Cho, Soo Ick; Yoon, Susie; Lee, Ho-Jin",Sci Rep,,139

Given the ill-suited structure of correctional facilities to facilitate health and safety guidelines, one solution is decarceration. Yet decarceration has faced political and public backlash. As no evidence currently exists on how the public views this emergency solution, the authors examined the correlates of support for decarceration by conducting a survey experiment in which respondents were randomly presented with information on the dangers of COVID-19 in prisons and jails. Respondents’ attitudes toward releasing various subgroups of the incarcerated population were then measured. The findings indicate that learning about the health risks of COVID-19 in correctional facilities had no discernable effect on support for decarceration for any subgroup. Racial resentment consistently predicted opposition to release for all groups, although its effect largely operated through empathetic identification with those who commit crimes. © The Author(s) 2021.","Ivanov, S.; Novisky, M.

First, representative alkaloids from RCY were docked with LSD1 for screening active skeleton compounds. Simultaneously, the crude extract of RCY was preliminarily separated via pH-zone refining CCC. Subsequently, guided by LC-MS/MS analysis of the fragmentation pathways, three potential active fractions were obtained, followed by further online-storage and recycling CCC separation. Finally, three high-purity target quaternary alkaloids compound 3 (dehydrocorydaline), 7 (coptisine), and 8 (columbamine) were successfully isolated as a new class of potential natural LSD1 inhibitors by only one CCC instrument with multiple modes. Compound 3, with the highest LSD1 inhibition ratio of 2.44 µM, was tested for its ability to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in U2OS cells. Therefore, the CCC separation guided by virtual screening is a promising method for the targeted isolation of enzyme inhibitors from medicinal herbs.","Lin, Yaolan; Luo, Jianguang; Li, Lingnan; Liu, Xiaoqin; Wang, Wenli; Zhu, Li; Han, Chao; Kong, Lingyi",J Chromatogr A,,139

For this, the clinical data from 84 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tianjin Haihe Hospital (Tianjin, China) between January and February 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the following groups: The common COVID-19 group (n=61) and severe COVID-19 group (n=23). In addition, 30 healthy subjects were included as a control group. The results demonstrated that the percentage of neutrophils (NEU%) was significantly increased, while the absolute number of white blood cells, LYM and the percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%) were significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, in the severe group, the absolute number of red blood cells in female patients, the NEU%, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were markedly elevated, while those of LYM and LYM% were significantly decreased (all P&lt;0.05). In addition, in the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis for the combination of LYM + CK, the area under the curve values were 0.96 and 1.00, with a sensitivity of 95.08 and 100%, specificity of 86.67 and 100% and cut-off values of 0.42 and 0.50 for the common and severe COVID-19 group, respectively.

Finally, a moderate correlation of lactate dehydrogenase with CRP and NLR (r=0.492 and 0.433, respectively;both P&lt;0.05) was obtained. Overall, the results of the present study indicated that the values of LYM and CK were associated with the progression of COVID-19, suggesting that the combination of both factors may be of clinical diagnostic value for COVID-19.","Du, Y.; Wang, X.; Qin, Z.; Zhang, L.",Experimental &amp; Therapeutic Medicine,,139

However, in the setting of infection control policies, visitor restrictions, social distancing, and a lack of personal protective equipment, many of these important conversations are occurring by virtual visits. Objective: From our experience with a multisite study exploring the effectiveness of virtual palliative care, we have identified key elements of webside manner that are helpful when conducting serious illness conversations by virtual visit. Results: The key elements and components of webside manner skills are proper set up, acquainting the participant, maintaining conversation rhythm, responding to emotion, and closing the visit. Other considerations that may require conversion to phone visits include persistent technical difficulties, lack of prerequisite technology to conduct virtual visits, patients who are too ill to participate, or who find virtual visits too technically challenging. Conclusions: Similar to bedside manner, possessing nuanced verbal and nonverbal webside manner skills is essential to conducting serious illness conversations during virtual visits.","Chua, Isaac S; Jackson, Vicki; Kamdar, Mihir",J Palliat Med,,139

Current high-throughput technologies for detecting PAIs, such as promoter capture Hi-C, are not scalable to large cohorts. Here, we present an analytical approach that uses summary-level data from cohort-based DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies to predict PAIs. Using mQTL data from human peripheral blood ([Formula: see text]), we predict 34,797 PAIs which show strong overlap with the chromatin contacts identified by previous experimental assays. The promoter-interacting DNAm sites are enriched in enhancers or near expression QTLs. Genes whose promoters are involved in PAIs are more actively expressed, and gene pairs with promoter-promoter interactions are enriched for co-expression. Integration of the predicted PAIs with GWAS data highlight interactions among 601 DNAm sites associated with 15 complex traits. This study demonstrates the use of mQTL data to predict PAIs and provides insights into the role of PAIs in complex trait variation.","Wu, Yang; Qi, Ting; Wang, Huanwei; Zhang, Futao; Zheng, Zhili; Phillips-Cremins, Jennifer E; Deary, Ian J; McRae, Allan F; Wray, Naomi R; Zeng, Jian; Yang, Jian",Nat Commun,,139
479521,Heightened Innate Immune Responses in the Respiratory Tract of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"As observed in other infections with a systemic inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and a prothrombotic state. Currently, there is growing evidence that pulmonary embolism and thrombosis contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients with COVID-19 is not known. Whereas pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is generally recommended for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, adequate dosing of anticoagulants remains a controversial issue. Therefore, we summarize current evidence from the available literature and, on behalf of the German Society of Angiology (DGA), we aim to provide advice to establish an improved and more uniform strategy for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.","Linnemann, Birgit; Bauersachs, Rupert; Grebe, Mathias; Klamroth, Robert; Müller, Oliver; Schellong, Sebastian; Lichtenberg, Michael",Vasa,,139

In the present study we developed an optimized protocol for SARS-COV- 2 RNA extraction from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs and to compare the sensitivity of RNA extraction methods. Here, RNA extraction was performed using three different procedures (TRIzol, Qiamp, VMT-TRIzol) from nine positive SARS-CoV-2 patients. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR assay using a detection kit for SARS-CoV-2 (Sun Yat-sen University). Comparison of Real-time RT-PCR results, there were no discernible differences in detection rates when comparing the three different extraction procedures. Based on these results, TRIzol as media transport and RNA extraction method for SARS-CoV-2 detection can be a helpful alternative for laboratories facing commercial kit shortages.","Adel, Amirouche; Djida, Ait-Ali; Hamid, Nouri; Lila, Boudrahme-Hannou; Souhil, Tliba; Abderrezak, Ghidouche; Idir, Bitam",New Microbes New Infect,,139

482283,Study on the effect of nursing-technology integrated in the imaging examination of Novel coronavirus pneumonia/ 重庆医学,2020,"Rapid responses in the early stage of a new epidemic are crucial in outbreak control. Public holidays for outbreak control could provide a critical time window for a rapid rollout of social distancing and other control measures at a large population scale. The objective of our study was to explore the impact of the timing and duration of outbreak-control holidays on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic spread during the early stage in China. We developed a compartment model to simulate the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 in China starting from January 2020. We projected and compared epidemic trajectories with and without an outbreak-control holiday that started during the Chinese Lunar New Year. We considered multiple scenarios of the outbreak-control holiday with different durations and starting times, and under different assumptions about viral transmission rates. We estimated the delays in days to reach certain thresholds of infections under different scenarios. Our results show that the outbreak-control holiday in China likely stalled the spread of COVID-19 for several days. The base case outbreak-control holiday (21 d for Hubei province and 10 days for all other provinces) delayed the time to reach 100â000 confirmed infections by 7.54 d. A longer outbreak-control holiday would have had stronger effects. A nationwide outbreak-control holiday of 21 d would have delayed the time to 100â000 confirmed infections by nearly 10 d. Furthermore, we find that outbreak-control holidays that start earlier in the course of a new epidemic are more effective in stalling epidemic spread than later holidays and that additional control measures during the holidays can boost the holiday effect. In conclusion, an outbreak-control holiday can likely effectively delay the transmission of epidemics that spread through social contacts. The temporary delay in the epidemic trajectory buys time, which scientists can use to discover transmission routes and identify effective public health interventions and which governments can use to build physical infrastructure, organize medical supplies, and deploy human resources for long-term epidemic mitigation and control efforts.","Chen, Simiao; Chen, Qiushi; Yang, Weizhong; Xue, Lan; Liu, Yuanli; Yang, Juntao; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till",,,139
482733,COVID-19 Therapeutic and Prevention,2020,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 may develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute kidney injury (AKI). We report the incidence, risk factors, associations, and outcomes of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 diagnosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between March 2020 and May 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors for the development of AKI and use of RRT. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality after ICU admission. RESULTS: 101 (50.2%) patients developed AKI (72% on the first day of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and thirty-four (17%) required RRT. Risk factors for AKI included higher baseline Cr (OR 2.50 [1.33-4.69], p = 0.005), diuretic use (OR 4.14 [1.27-13.49], p = 0.019), and IMV (OR 7.60 [1.37-42.05], p = 0.020). A higher C-reactive protein level was an additional risk factor for RRT (OR 2.12 [1.16-4.33], p = 0.023). Overall 60-day mortality was 14.4% {23.8% (n = 24) in the AKI group versus 5% (n = 5) in the non-AKI group (HR 2.79 [1.04-7.49], p = 0.040); and 35.3% (n = 12) in the RRT group versus 10.2% (n = 17) in the non-RRT group, respectively (HR 2.21 [1.01-4.85], p = 0.047)}. CONCLUSIONS: AKI was common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and occurred early in association with IMV. One in 6 AKI patients received RRT and 1 in 3 patients treated with RRT died in hospital. These findings provide important prognostic information for clinicians caring for these patients.","Doher, Marisa Petrucelli; Torres de Carvalho, Fabrício Rodrigues; Scherer, Patrícia Faria; Matsui, Thaís Nemoto; Ammirati, Adriano Luiz; Caldin da Silva, Bruno; Barbeiro, Bruna Gomes; Carneiro, Fabiana Dias; Corrêa, Thiago Domingos; Ferraz, Leonardo José Rolim; Dos Santos, Bento Fortunato Cardoso; Pereira, Virgílio Gonçalves; Batista, Marcelo Costa; Monte, Júlio Cesar Martins; Santos, Oscar Fernando Pavão; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Serpa Neto, Ary; Durão, Marcelino de Souza",Blood Purif,,139

In this retrospective study we investigated whether therapeutic anticoagulation prior to infection has a beneficial effect in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study included 1154 COVID-19 patients admitted to 6 hospitals in the Netherlands between March and May 2020. We applied 1:3 propensity score matching to evaluate the association between prior therapeutic anticoagulation use and clinical outcome, with in hospital mortality as primary endpoint. In total, 190 (16%) patients used therapeutic anticoagulation prior to admission. In the propensity score matched analyses, we observed no associations between prior use of therapeutic anticoagulation and overall mortality (risk ratio 1.02 [95% confidence interval; 0.80-1.30]) or length of hospital stay (7.0 [4-12] vs. 7.0 [4-12] days, P = .69), although we observed a lower risk of pulmonary embolism (0.19 [0.05-0.80]).

Here we highlight atypical presentations of this fulminant infectious disease COVID-19, based on a clinical case and a cohort of 19 patients admitted to a geriatric ward. The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients. Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population. As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Protocols for diagnosis, and contact isolation measures, should take these atypical presentations into account.","Olde Rikkert, M G M; Vingerhoets, R W; van Geldorp, N; de Jong, E; Maas, H A A M",Ned. tijdschr. geneeskd,,139

METHODS: The authors used electronic medical record data along with chi-squared or t tests to compare patients' demographic characteristics. Generalized estimating equations for estimating the odds of primary and secondary outcomes were used, controlling for demographic characteristics. RESULTS: During COVID-19, the odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit (N=26,715) were 6.68 times the odds of completing an in-person visit (N=11,094). The odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit during COVID-19 were 3.00 times the odds of completing an in-person visit during the pre-COVID-19 reference period (N=40,318). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, outpatient adult mental health clinic telepsychiatry appointments, largely by telephone, were strongly associated with a higher rate of visit completion compared with in-person visits during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulators should consider permanently enabling reimbursement for telephone-only telepsychiatry visits.","Avalone, Lynsey; Barron, Charles; King, Carla; Linn-Walton, Rebecca; Lau, Jen; McQuistion, Hunter L; Popiel, Maryann; Balasubramaniam, Meera; Freeman, Richard; Fattal, Omar",Psychiatr Serv,,139
486161,Drug repositioning is an alternative for the treatment of coronavirus COVID-19,2020,"A novel coronavirus termed as COVID-19 by WHO has been the causative agent of an unprecedented pandemic in the history of humanity. The global burden of mortality and morbidity associated with this pandemic continues to increase with each passing day as it is progressively leading to multiorgan dysfunction. In most cases, the cause of death has been attributed to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac failure, kidney injury, or coagulopathy. As more knowledge is being unfolded, an in-depth understanding of various systemic manifestations and complications of SARS-CoV2 is vital for optimum management of these patients. This novel virus is known to spread faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), demonstrating a case fatality ranging from 5 to 8% [1]. Hematological abnormalities such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-Dimer, elevated fibrinogen, elevated fibrinogen degradation products as well as cytokines such as IL-6 are emerging as important prognostic marker for worse outcome of COVID-19. Among various systemic manifestations, hematological complications such as venous thrombosis causing pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis causing myocardial infarction, strokes or limb ischemia are being noted to be directly linked to high mortality from COVID-19. An attempt to understand the pathophysiology of various hematological abnormalities including cytokine storm, hypercoagulable state and some rare presentations of this disease hence becomes imperative. Through this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date summary of current evidence-based literature of hematological manifestations, their consequences and management including role of anticoagulation and drugs targeting cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Kaur, Supreet; Bansal, Rashika; Kollimuttathuillam, Sudarsan; Gowda, Anusha Manje; Singh, Balraj; Mehta, Dhruv; Maroules, Michael",Blood Rev,,139

488393,Two Mineralocorticoid Receptor-Mediated Mechanisms of Pendrin Activation in Distal Nephrons,2020,"COVID-19 is a viral disease characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Since then, researchers from all over the world have been looking for ways to fight this disease. Many cases of complications arise from insufficient immune responses due to low immunity, with intense release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage the structure of organs such as the lung. Thus, the hypothesis arises that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with the use of a low-level laser (LLLT) may be an ally approach to patients with COVID-19 since it is effective for increasing immunity, helping tissue repair, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review was performed with the use of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: “low-level laser therapy OR photobiomodulation therapy AND COVID-19”. The inclusion criteria were complete articles published from January 2020 to January 2021 in English. The exclusion criteria were other languages, editorials, reviews, brief communications, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and articles that did not provide the full text. The bibliographic search found 18 articles in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database, 118 articles on the Web of Science, 23 articles on Scopus, and 853 articles on Google Scholar. Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis, of which four commentary articles discussed the pathogenesis and the effect of PBMT in COVID-19. Two in vitro and lab experiments showed the effect of PBMT on prevention of thrombosis and positive results in wound healing during viral infection, using the intravascular irradiation (ILIB) associated with Phthalomethyl D. Two case reports showed PBMT improved the respiratory indexes, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients. One case series reported the clinical improvement after PBMT on 14 acute COVID-19 patients, rehabilitation on 24 patients, and as a preventive treatment on 70 people. One clinical trial of 30 patients with severe COVID-19 who require invasive mechanical ventilation, showed PBMT-static magnetic field was not statistically different from placebo for the length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, but improved diaphragm muscle function and ventilation and decreased the inflammatory markers. This review suggests that PBMT may have a positive role in treatment of COVID-19. Still, the necessity for more clinical trials remains in this field and there is not sufficient research evidence regarding the effects of PBMT and COVID-19 disease, and there is a large gap.","de Matos, Brenda Thaynne Lima Buchaim Daniela Vieira Pomini Karina Torres Barbalho Sandra Maria Guiguer Elen Landgraf Reis Carlos Henrique Bertoni Bueno Cleuber Rodrigo de Souza Cunha Marcelo Rodrigues da Pereira Eliana de Souza Bastos Mazuqueli Buchaim Rogerio Leone",Life,,139

This study determined the proportion of Australian postgraduate psychology courses that provide training on trauma in coursework units. &lt;bold&gt;Method&lt;/bold&gt;: Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyse the trauma-related contents of online unit handbooks from Masters of Psychology courses that were offered in 2019. &lt;bold&gt;Results&lt;/bold&gt;: Forty-two unit handbooks from 25 courses delivered by 16 institutions explicitly mentioned trauma-related content, equating to 31.65% of courses included in the present study. Of those unit handbooks, 30 were unique (i.e., not duplicates across courses at the same institution). Content analysis of the unit handbooks revealed (a) trauma was most commonly discussed as a disorder (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, stressor-related disorders) and (b) postgraduate psychology students were often taught about trauma-related assessment, intervention and theory. &lt;bold&gt;Conclusions&lt;/bold&gt;: Trauma training appears limited within postgraduate psychology coursework in Australia. Further research is warranted into how well-prepared psychology graduates are to work with clients who have been exposed to trauma. Such preparedness is vital in the current Australian climate whereby many individuals are impacted by potentially traumatic loss or adversity, for example, due to bushfires and COVID-19. &lt;bold&gt;KEY POINTS&lt;/bold&gt; &lt;bold&gt;What is already known about this topic:&lt;/bold&gt; The effects of traumatisation are highly variable across individuals and thus psychologists must be well-informed about the different presentations of trauma.

Herein, we conduct a review to discuss the most frequent cutaneous adverse effects of vaccines and their management, with a particular focus on the expected adverse reactions for the coming severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, such as local reactions, as well as immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrosis, serum sickness-like reactions, and vasculitides. We also discuss the yet unanswered questions on vaccines for which we may soon be asked to provide an expert opinion.","Alpalhão, Miguel; Maia-Silva, João; Filipe, Paulo",Dermatitis,,139
496037,What are we doing in the dermatology outpatient department amidst the raging of the 2019 novel coronavirus?,2020,"It has long been known that epidemics can travel along communication lines, such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical SIR model with diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. The line and the domain interact by constant exchanges of populations. A classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system analogous to one we had previously introduced Berestycki et al. (J Math Biol 66:743-766, 2013) to describe the enhancement of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence of a minimal spreading speed, and we show that it may be quite large, even when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is close to 1. We also prove here further qualitative features of the final state, showing the influence of the line.","Berestycki, Henri; Roquejoffre, Jean-Michel; Rossi, Luca",Bull Math Biol,,139
496208,Infection: is it a question of control?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat, and host immunity remains the main mechanism of protection against the disease. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID-19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Hattori, Takamitsu; Koide, Akiko; Noval, Maria G; Panchenko, Tatyana; Romero, Larizbeth A; Teng, Kai Wen; Tada, Takuya; Landau, Nathaniel R; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Koide, Shohei",J Mol Biol,,139

499256,Model for safe elective liver resection during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic: lessons for enhanced recovery,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global neo-coronary pneumonia epidemic has increased the workload of healthcare institutions in various countries and directly affected the physical and psychological recovery of the vast majority of patients requiring hospitalization in China. We anticipate that post-total knee arthroplasty kinesiophobia may have an impact on patients' postoperative pain scores, knee function, and ability to care for themselves in daily life. The purpose of this study is to conduct a micro-video intervention via WeChat to verify the impact of this method on the rapid recovery of patients with kinesiophobia after total knee arthroplasty during neo-coronary pneumonia. METHODS: Using convenience sampling method, 78 patients with kinesiophobia after artificial total knee arthroplasty who met the exclusion criteria were selected and randomly grouped, with the control group receiving routine off-line instruction and the intervention group receiving micro-video intervention, and the changes in the relevant indexes of the two groups of patients at different time points on postoperative day 1, 3 and 7 were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the scores of kinesiophobia, pain, knee flexion mobility (ROM) and ability to take care of daily life between the two groups on the first postoperative day (Pâ>â.05). On postoperative day 3 and 7, there were statistical differences in Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia, pain, activities of daily living scale score and ROM between the two groups (Pâ<â.01), and the first time of getting out of bed between the two groups (Pâ<â.05), and by repeated-measures ANOVA, there were statistically significant time points, groups and interaction effects of the outcome indicators between the 2 groups (Pâ<â.01), indicating that the intervention group reconstructed the patients' postoperative kinesiophobiaand hyperactivity. The level of pain awareness facilitates the patient's acquisition of the correct functional exercises to make them change their misbehavior. CONCLUSIONS: WeChat micro-video can reduce the fear of movement score and pain score in patients with kinesiophobia after unilateral total knee arthroplasty, shorten the first time out of bed, and improve their joint mobility and daily living ability. ETHICS: This study has passed the ethical review of the hospital where it was conducted and has been filed, Ethics Approval Number: 20181203-01.","Lu, Guanzhen; Wu, Tingting; Tan, Qin; Wu, Zhe; Shi, Lingmei; Zhong, Yan",Medicine (Baltimore),,139

500453,COVID-19 infection in paediatric recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation: the UK experience,2021,"PURPOSE: Publications about increased number of peripheral facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the literature. However, these studies comprised of an estimate rather than a broad analysis of exact numbers. In this study, we planned to investigate whether the pandemic really resulted in an increase in facial paralysis cases admitted to the hospital by evaluating the cases who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic year and in the previous 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis between March 2016-February 2017 (Group 1), between March 2017-February 2018 (Group 2), between March 2018-February 2019 (Group 3), between March 2019-February 2020 (Group 4), and between March 2020-February 2021 (Group 5) were investigated and detailed data were noted. RESULTS: 156, 164, 149, 172 and 157 patients were admitted to the hospital due to peripheral facial paralysis in Group 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Of these patients, 155, 164, 145, 169, and 153 were Bell's palsy, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive in only 2 of the 153 patients who were diagnosed in the year of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the number of peripheral facial paralysis detected during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to previous years. Very few number of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results may have been found incidentally in Bell's palsy patients. Theses stating that SARS-CoV-2 causes peripheral facial paralysis should be supported by laboratory studies and postmortem research.","Mutlu, Ahmet; Kalcioglu, Mahmut Tayyar; Gunduz, Ayse Yasemin; Bakici, Burcu; Yilmaz, Utku; Cag, Yasemin",Am J Otolaryngol,,139

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method to implement virtual screening with convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The descriptors represent chemical molecules, and these descriptors are input into the CNN framework to train a model and predict active compounds. When compared to other machine learning methods, including random forest, naive Bayes, decision tree, and support vector machine, the proposed CNN model's evaluation of the test set showed an accuracy of 0.86, a sensitivity of 0.45, a specificity of 0.96, a precision of 0.73, a recall of 0.45, an F-measure of 0.55, and a ROC of 0.71. The CNN model screened 17 out of 918 phytochemical compounds; 60 out of 423 from the natural product NCI divset IV; 17,831 out of 112,267 from the ZINC natural product database; and 315 out of 1556 FDA-approved drugs as anti-SARS-CoV agents. Further, to prioritize drug-like compounds, Lipinski's rule of five was applied to screen anti-SARS-CoV compounds (excluding FDA-approved drugs), resulting in 10, 59, and 14,025 hit molecules. Out of 10 phytochemical compounds, 9 anti-SARS-CoV agents belonged to the flavonoid group. In conclusion, the proposed CNN model can prove useful for developing novel target-specific anti-SARS-CoV compounds.","Kumari, Madhulata; Subbarao, Naidu",Comput Biol Med,,139

Since the very high number of disposable masks being used globally on a daily basis to face the Covid19 pandemic is posing new environmental risks, mainly connected to improper disposal, any possible improvements in the management of this waste stream is very important. In this work their potential use as sound porous absorber is discussed. Surgical face masks are mainly made of polypropylene fibers which show good acoustical properties. Their porous structure was studied through the measurement of some non-acoustic properties: bulk density, fiber diameter, porosity, flow resistivity and tortuosity. Moreover, the sound absorption performance of samples, made of scrapped face masks, with different thicknesses was evaluated using an impedance tube according to ISO 10534-2. The results obtained from the sound absorption spectra and two single indexes, Noise Reduction Coefficient and Sound Absorption Average showed a high sound absorption value over a frequency range of interest. Finally, the sound absorption spectra obtained for surgical face masks were compared with those obtained for fibrous materials currently used in building sector, suggesting that this fibrous waste could act as a possible substitute to traditional ones.","Maderuelo-Sanz, Rubén; Acedo-Fuentes, Patricia; García-Cobos, Francisco José; Sánchez-Delgado, Francisco José; Mota-López, María Isabel; Meneses-Rodríguez, Juan Miguel",Sci Total Environ,,139

512944,Acute myeloid leukemia: 2021 update on risk-stratification and management,2020,"Rheological properties of triblock copolymers dissolved in a nematic liquid crystal (LC) solvent demonstrate that their microphase separated structure is heavily influenced by changes in LC order. Nematic gels were created by swelling a well-defined, high molecular weight ABA block copolymer with the small-molecule nematic LC solvent 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (5CB). The ""B"" midblock is a side-group liquid crystal polymer (SGLCP) designed to be soluble in 5CB and the ""A"" endblocks are polystyrene, which is LC-phobic and microphase separates to produce a physically cross-linked, thermoreversible, macroscopic polymer network. At sufficiently low polymer concentration a plateau modulus in the nematic phase, characteristic of a gel, abruptly transitions to terminal behavior when the gel is heated into its isotropic phase. In more concentrated gels, endblock aggregates persist into the isotopic phase. Dramatic changes in network structure are observed over small temperature windows (as little as 1 °C) due to tccche rapidly changing LC order near the isotropization point. The discontinuous change in solvent quality produces an abrupt change in viscoelastic properties for three polymers having different pendant mesogenic groups and matched block lengths.","Kempe, Michael D; Verduzco, Rafael; Scruggs, Neal R; Kornfield, Julia A",Soft Matter,,139
515119,A Simple HEPA Filtering Facepiece,2021,"One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.","Dattner, Itai; Goldberg, Yair; Katriel, Guy; Yaari, Rami; Gal, Nurit; Miron, Yoav; Ziv, Arnona; Sheffer, Rivka; Hamo, Yoram; Huppert, Amit",PLoS Comput Biol,,139
515666,[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic with reference to EBMT recommendation],2021,"In the event of a global infectious pandemic, drastic measures may be needed that limit or require adjustment of ambulatory allergy services. However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.","Shaker, Marcus S; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W Y; Rider, Nicholas; Dutmer, Cullen M; Vander Leek, Timothy K; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K; Lang, David; Lieberman, Jay; Fleischer, David; Golden, David B K; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,139

This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter. AREAS COVERED: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy.","Soleimanpour, Saman; Yaghoubi, Atieh",Expert Rev Vaccines,,139
517911,Italian association for the study of the liver position statement on SARS-CoV2 vaccination,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic urges searches for antiviral agents that can block infection or ameliorate its symptoms. Using dissimilar search strategies for new antivirals will improve our overall chances of finding effective treatments. Here, we have established an experimental platform for screening of small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, genetically engineered to enhance cellular uptake of small molecules in the environment. The system consists of a fusion of the E. coli toxin MazF and its antitoxin MazE, with insertion of a protease cleavage site in the linker peptide connecting the MazE and MazF moieties. Expression of the viral protease confers cleavage of the MazEF fusion, releasing the MazF toxin from its antitoxin, resulting in growth inhibition. In the presence of a small molecule inhibiting the protease, cleavage is blocked and the MazF toxin remains inhibited, promoting growth. The system thus allows positive selection for inhibitors. The engineered yeast strain is tagged with a fluorescent marker protein, allowing precise monitoring of its growth in the presence or absence of inhibitor. We detect an established main protease inhibitor down to 10 M by a robust growth increase. The system is suitable for robotized large-scale screens. It allows in vivo evaluation of drug candidates, and is rapidly adaptable for new variants of the protease with deviant site specificities. IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue several years before vaccination campaigns can put an end it globally. Thus, the need for discovery of new antiviral drug candidates will remain. We have engineered a system in yeast cells for detection of small molecule inhibitors of one attractive drug target of SARS-CoV-2, its main protease which is required for viral replication. To detect inhibitors in live cells brings the advantage that only compounds capable of entering the cell and remain stable there, will score in the system. Moreover, by its design in yeast, the system is rapidly adaptable for tuning of detection level, eventual modification of protease cleavage site in case of future mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or even for other proteases.","Alalam, Hanna; Sigurdardóttir, Sunniva; Bourgard, Catarina; Tiukova, Ievgeniia A.; King, Ross D; Grötli, Morten; Sunnerhagen, Per",,,139

519713,"Spices to Control COVID-19 Symptoms: Yes, but Not Only",2020,"Introduction Anatomy is a fundamental science essential to the practice and understanding of medicine. As the COVID-19 pandemic has put a halt to live teaching, specifically, Anatomy classes and Lab Practical examination at Baylor College Medicine (BCM), the opportunity was presented to compare test scores of students who matriculated into the Physician Assistant (PA), Doctor of Nursing Practice-Anesthesia (DNP), and Medical School (MS) programs in 2020 with those of the same programs from previous cohorts. Students who matriculated in August of 2019 and before were able to have live Anatomy lectures, live Lab Practical examinations, and live cadaver labs. Whereas those who matriculated in the year 2020 had to watch online lectures, have online Lab Practical examinations, but still have live cadaver labs with COVID-19 rules i.e., social distancing implemented. Materials & Methods Lab Practical examination scores from classes who matriculated in the years of 2016 through 2019 were compared with those who matriculated in 2020 for the PA, DNP, and MS programs. Independent Measures Two-tailed T-test and One-Way Anova Analyses were used to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences of exam scores compared within the PA, DNP, and MS programs. The DNP and PA programs must also take a cumulative multiple-choice (MC) exam at the end of each term. These scores were also compared using the same measures. Results Independent Measures T-test revealed statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) when comparing the MS 2017 Lab Practical scores with the 2020 MS cohort with the 2020 cohort scoring significantly lower. For the DNP program, statistical significance was found between Lab Practical test scores from every cohort when compared to the 2020 cohort with the 2020 cohort scoring significantly higher in each comparison. Only when comparing the DNP 2016 to the 2020 cohort (MC) exam results was a statistical significance found for the MC exam with the 2020 cohort scoring significantly higher. One-Way Anova Analyses revealed there were no statistically significant findings within any of the cohorts from any of the programs other than the DNP 2016/2020 cohort comparison and 2019/2020 cohort comparison which yielded statistically significant differences with the 2020 cohort scoring significantly higher in each comparison. Conclusions While the current situation of the COVID-19 Pandemic may not be permanent, it has had a profound impact on the delivery of education in the year of 2020. As the delivery of education has shifted, one should acknowledge that test results may be impacted as well. This analysis reveals that students test scores, while varying more so than previous cohorts, were not significantly impacted in every cohort comparison with the shift to online learning. Significance Online learning in Anatomy has not been attempted before at BCM and evaluating student performance was vital this year. Anatomy at BCM continues for 2 more terms, and while the exam scores do not show significant differences for one term, the long term-term influences from COVID-19 on learning Anatomy still remains to be investigated.","Mumbower, Daniel Zhang Ming Yarneau Glen",The FASEB Journal,,139

People with obesity are especially vulnerable to emotional eating and might be more prone to weight gain and negative outcomes during lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals scheduled for an appointment at the Obesity Unit of a Tertiary Hospital between March 16 and June 21 (n=1230). An online survey was distributed on May 11. Multivariable logistic regression models and general linear models were used to assess the relationship between perceived COVID-19 threat, BS status, and outcome variables. RESULTS: Of the 603 (72.0% females, 39% aged >55 years) respondents, 223 (36.9%) were BS naïve (non-BS), 134 (22.2%) underwent BS within the two previous years (BS<2y), and 245 (40.6%) more than 2 years before (BS>2y).

We previously identified a potent human monoclonal antibody, 47D11, capable of cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and protecting against the associated respiratory disease in an animal model. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of trimeric SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomains in complex with the 47D11 Fab. 47D11 binds specifically to the closed conformation of the receptor-binding domain, distal to the ACE2 binding site. The CDRL3 stabilizes the N343 glycan in an upright conformation, exposing a conserved and mutationally constrained hydrophobic pocket, into which the CDRH3 loop inserts two aromatic residues. 47D11 stabilizes a partially open conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting that it could be used effectively in combination with other antibodies that target the exposed receptor-binding motif. Altogether, these results reveal a cross-protective epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike and provide a structural roadmap for the development of 47D11 as a prophylactic or post-exposure therapy for COVID-19.","Fedry, Juliette; Hurdiss, Daniel L; Wang, Chunyan; Li, Wentao; Obal, Gonzalo; Drulyte, Ieva; Du, Wenjuan; Howes, Stuart C; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Förster, Friedrich; Bosch, Berend-Jan",Sci.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed methodology approach was used, with triangulation between a thematic analysis of eight semi-structured interviews from radiology trainees and trainers, and a contextual analysis of 60 free-text feedback comments and module ratings from trainees after completion of R-ITI modules. RESULTS: Three broad themes emerged: “learning the subject matter”, “learning the role,” and “e-learning preferences”. Superficial learning techniques were prevalent when “learning the subject matter” during early training, with e-learning resources providing a good pedagogical fit for this learning. Much of what was considered “learning the role” of the radiologist was learned at the workplace. This included topics with inherent subjectivity, which were difficult to convey with e-learning. Trainees' “e-learning preferences” favoured modules that incorporated many imaging cases with layer annotation, clinical relevance, and self-assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The ease of reproducing imaging studies using the R-ITI platform represents a huge potential for e-learning. Content tailored to the learning needs of the trainee, the appropriateness of the subject matter for an online platform, and the design of the e-learning modules are important considerations. Radiology training also involves important tacit learning and discussions around subjective topics, which are difficult to capture on this platform.","Upadhyay, N.; Wadkin, J.C.R.",Clin Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218924/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009926021003081; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2021.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009926021003081,139

Bangladesh and India are two densely populated South Asian developing countries with limited resources. Both countries face mass community transmission of the disease, with India facing severe infections and deaths. Predictably, a large population might sum up to a large amount of COVID-19-related BMW. There is also the question of capacity, whether the existing BMW policies and regulations of the regions can manage the BMW strategically driven by the pressure of the pandemic. Here, we have shown a framework leading to further environmental and community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic if the BMW generated at healthcare facilities and homes is not appropriately managed. The BMW, such as safety suits or personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, gloves, and shields, would likely damage the environment in the long run by creating microplastic pollution. Modification and modernization of the existing policies, plans, and guidelines on the proper management of the hospital and household infectious waste is suggested. Moreover, occupational health and safety assessments for waste management workers at the hospitals are recommended. Installing suitable capacity incinerators and related infrastructures are recommended for appropriate waste management. In the absence of incinerators, the existing industrial furnaces, cement kilns, and mobile incinerators can be used with a rapid impact assessment adhering to the appropriate implementations of the policies and guidelines.","Shammi, Mashura; Behal, Arvind; Tareq, Shafi M",Environ Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434001/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c05117,139

The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual′s risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were gathered. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results: The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 versus 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 95%, respectively. Conclusion: The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters.

594964,The Novel Coronavirus 2019 epidemic and kidneys,2020-03-07,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use or advanced development are based on the viral spike protein (S) as their immunogen. S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern B.1.248 and B.1.351. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.ImportanceVaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants, as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded. Despite occlusion of the receptor binding site, the spike induces potently neutralizing sera against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antibodies are raised against a different pattern of epitopes to those induced by other spike constructs, preferring conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Closed spikes, or mRNA vaccines based on their sequence, can be a valuable component of next generation vaccines.","Carnell, George W; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A; Wells, David A; Xiong, Xiaoli; Aguinam, Ernest T; McLaughlin, Stephen H; Mallery, Donna; Ebrahimi, Soraya; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; Asbach, Benedikt; Einhauser, Sebastian; Wagner, Ralf; James, Leo C; Doffinger, Rainer; Heeney, Jonathan L; Briggs, John A G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00203-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963055/,139

African Americans have a higher degree of COVID‐19 mortality. The incidence of salt‐sensitive hypertension is higher in older individuals and African Americans. Lower circulating levels of natriuretic peptides, key regulators of vascular tone and kidney function, have been associated with salt‐sensitive hypertension and obesity. Evidence has accumulated that ANP administered to pulmonary endothelial cells, isolated lungs, and patients suffering from ARDS reduces endothelial damage and preserves the endothelial barrier, thereby reducing pulmonary edema and inflammation. Epidemiologic and pharmacologic data suggest that deficiencies in the natriuretic peptide hormone system may contribute to the development of severe lung pathology in COVID‐19 patients, and treatments that augment natriuretic peptide signaling may have potential to limit progression to ARDS.","Currie, Mark G.; Zimmer, Daniel P.; Halushka, Perry V.",FASEB Bioadv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838215/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fba.2020-00042,139

We argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was facilitated by the engagement of local leaders to mobilize communities to adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Village heads (VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individual's knowledge about the pandemic and the adaption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals' behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health messages and policies. These lessons from the first pandemic wave remain relevant as in many low-income countries behavioral responses to Covid-19 will remain the primary prevention strategy for a foreseeable future.","Kohler, I.

597136,Imagining Our Lives Post-Pandemic,2020-08-10,"Background To prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19, Australia is pursuing a mass-vaccination approach in which a targeted group of the population comprising healthcare workers, aged-care residents and other individuals at increased risk of exposure will receive a highly effective priority vaccine. The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective vaccine. Methods We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of vaccine efficacy. Findings Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia’s vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and initial epidemic growth rate by 43% and 52%, respectively. The severity of epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown strategies. Interpretation The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale vaccination campaign in Australia, which would substantially reduce both the intensity of future outbreaks and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions required for their suppression.

In the mixed treatment assay, six AK extracts [AK-1 (EtOH extract), AK-3 (H2O layer), AK-5 (40% methanol fraction), and AK-9–11 (H2O extract, polysaccharide fraction, supernatant fraction)] exhibited inhibitory activities against G5P[7] rotavirus with the EC50 values ranging from 0.7±0.4 to 33.7±6.5μg/mL. Extracts AK-1, AK-3, and AK-5 inhibited rotavirus infection against G8P[7] rotavirus, the with EC50 values of 8.4±2.2μg/mL, 6.5±0.8μg/mL and 8.4±5.0μg/mL, respectively. By hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, six AK extracts completely inhibited viral adsorption onto human RBCs in both strains of rotaviruses at less than 11μg/mL. However, in the post treatment assay, there was no anti activity shown against both strains of rotaviruses. As a result, six AK extracts were attributed mainly to having a strong interaction with hemagglutinin protein on the outer surface of rotavirus, resulting to blockage of viral adsorption.","Kim, Ha-Hyun; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Ryu, Young Bae; Chang, Jong Sun; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Hosmillo, Myra D.T.; Rho, Mun-Chual; Park, Su-Jin; Lee, Woo Song",Research in Veterinary Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.11.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528810003929; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528810003929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21196021/,139

There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19. HIGHLIGHTS We mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome We discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronaviruses We predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning tool","Sun, Lei; Li, Pan; Ju, Xiaohui; Rao, Jian; Huang, Wenze; Zhang, Shaojun; Xiong, Tuanlin; Xu, Kui; Zhou, Xiaolin; Ren, Lili; Ding, Qiang; Wang, Jianwei; Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732,139

Here, we studied the time trend of inflammatory markers in a population of hemodialysis (HD) patients affected by COVID-19, undergoing two different dialysis approaches. In a prospective study, thirty-one maintenance HD patients with COVID-19 were randomized to expanded HD (HDx), performed using a medium cut-off membrane, or standard treatment using a protein-leaking dialyzer (PLD). Circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TLR4 (sTLR4), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), were collected at diagnosis, and one and two weeks after. Compared with 14 non-infected HD patients, COVID-19 patients showed lymphopenia and higher ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Moreover, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of IL-10 (15.2 (12.5) vs. 1.2 (1.4) pg/mL, p = 0.02). Twenty-nine patients were randomized to HDx (n = 15) or PLD (n = 14). After a single treatment, IL-8 showed a significant reduction in both groups, whereas IL-10 decreased only in HDx. All over the study, there were no significant modifications in circulating cytokine levels between the two groups, except for a parallel increase of IL-8 and IL-10 at one week control in the HDx group. No correlations were found between cytokine levels and clinical outcomes. In maintenance HD patients, COVID-19 is not related to a sustained inflammatory response. Therefore, modulation of inflammation seems not to be a suitable therapeutic target in this specific population.","Esposito, Pasquale; Cipriani, Leda; Verzola, Daniela; Grignano, Maria Antonietta; De Amici, Mara; Testa, Giorgia; Grosjean, Fabrizio; Russo, Elisa; Garibotto, Giacomo; Rampino, Teresa; Viazzi, Francesca",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808205/,139

The results disprove the ACE inhibition as the only single mechanism and also the direct interaction of potentiating peptides with the bradykinin receptors in transfected COS-7 cells as molecular mechanism of potentiation. Our results indicate a stimulation of inositol phosphates (IP(n)) formation independently from the B(2) receptor. Furthermore, the results with La(3+) support the role of extracellular Ca(2+) and its influx through corresponding channels. The missing effect of calyculin on the GPI disproves the role of phosphatases in the potentiating action. These experimental studies should not only contribute to a better understanding of the potentiating mechanisms but also incorporate a shift in the research towards the immune system, in particular towards the immunocompetent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotaxis of these cells can be potentiated most likely by exclusive inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. Thus the obtained results give evidence that the potentiation of the bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and on the applied potentiating factor.","Mueller, Sylvia; Gothe, Rita; Siems, Wolf-Dieter; Vietinghoff, Gabriele; Paegelow, Inge; Reissmann, Siegmund",Peptides,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978105001683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949642/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978105001683,139
600063,Digital health interventions in children with asthma,2020-12-06,"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses and infect a lot of species of mammals and birds. Five coronaviruses currently infect humans: HCoVs 229E and OC43, identified in the 1960s, SARS-CoV identified in March 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and the HCoVs NL63 and HKU1, identified in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features: the generation of multiple mutants during the replication resulting on a quasispecies structure of the viral population, the demonstrated ability of coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the flexibility of the genome due to a high frequency of homologue or heterologue recombinations, the ability to jump barrier species and to adapt to the new environment. Two epidemiologic pictures of HCoV infections have to be distinguished: as suggested by recent studies, HCoVs except SARS-CoV, are distributed worldwide and cocirculate during seasonal outbreaks. The distribution of the different HCoV species varies according to the geographic area and season. In contrast, the SARS-CoV is responsible of the first emerging infectious disease of this millennium, infecting more than 8000 people between November 2002 and July 2003. Its circulation has been stopped by drastic public health policy. Human coronaviruses may be also involved in enteric and neurologic diseases.

We evaluated this translation on the basis of psychometric testing in a German convenience sample. A cross-sectional online survey (n = 470) was carried out using a translated version of the health consciousness scale, oriented on the basis of international guidelines. As previous studies have not consistently confirmed the factorial structure of the health consciousness scale, we conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis to verify its factorial structure. Furthermore, we cross-validated the questionnaire with other scales in order to verify convergent and discriminant validity. The results indicated a two-factor solution for the Health Consciousness Scale-German (HCS-G). The criterion validity was confirmed on the basis of a significantly positive correlation between the HCS-G and health literacy. Furthermore, strict measurement invariance was able to be verified, indicating that the HCS-G is an applicable measurement, regardless of gender.

With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID‐19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three‐level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third‐party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID‐19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply‐chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an effective supply mechanism for FAPs in metropolitan areas during the COVID‐19 pandemic and describes the authors' experience of guaranteeing the quality and safety of FAPs for future pandemic cases. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","Yin, Shi; Bai, Lan; Zhang, Runqing",J Sci Food Agric,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969883/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.11308,139

A vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of HCMV during pregnancy is necessary to reduce the incidence of infant disease. The glycoprotein B (gB) + MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine platform is the most successful HCMV vaccine tested to-date, demonstrating approximately 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV acquisition in phase II trials. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection remains unknown. Plasma from 33 gB/MF59 vaccinees at peak immunogenicity was tested for gB epitope specificity as well as neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-HCMV effector functions, and compared to an HCMV-seropositive cohort. gB/MF59 vaccination elicited IgG responses with gB-binding magnitude and avidity comparable to natural infection. Additionally, IgG subclass distribution was similar with predominant IgG1 and IgG3 responses induced by gB vaccination and HCMV infection. However, vaccine-elicited antibodies exhibited limited neutralization of the autologous virus, negligible neutralization of multiple heterologous strains, and limited binding responses against gB structural motifs targeted by neutralizing antibodies including AD-1, AD-2, and Domain I. Interestingly, vaccinees had high-magnitude IgG responses against AD-3 linear epitopes, demonstrating immunodominance against this non-neutralizing, cytosolic region. Finally, vaccine-elicited IgG robustly bound trimeric, membrane-associated gB on the surface of transfected or HCMV-infected cells and mediated virion phagocytosis, though were poor mediators of NK cell activation. Altogether, these data suggest that non-neutralizing antibody functions, including virion phagocytosis, likely played a role in the observed 50% vaccine-mediated protection against HCMV acquisition. The CDC estimates that every hour, a child is born in the United States with permanent neurologic disability resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection – more than is caused by Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. A maternal vaccine to block transmission of HCMV to the developing fetus is a necessary intervention to prevent these adverse outcomes. The gB/MF59 vaccine is the most successful tested clinically to-date, achieving 50% reduction in HCMV acquisition. This manuscript establishes the function and epitope specificity of the humoral response stimulated by this vaccine that may explain the partial vaccine efficacy. Understanding the mechanism of gB/MF59-elicited protective immune responses will guide rational design and evaluation of the next generation of HCMV vaccines.","Nelson, Cody S.; Huffman, Tori; de la Rosa, Eduardo Cisneros; Xie, Guanhua; Vandergrift, Nathan; Pass, Robert F.; Pollara, Justin; Permar, Sallie R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/246884,139

GX-19 vaccinated nonhuman primate seroconverted rapidly and exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they did not develop fever and reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control.

The objective of this case presentation is to highlight an important complication and to explore potential predisposing risk factors and possible underlying pathophysiology of this phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema without positive pressure ventilation. Both patients had multiple comorbidities, received a combination of antibiotics, steroids and supportive oxygen therapy, and underwent routine laboratory workup. Both patients then developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and ultimately required intubation and mechanical ventilation, which proved to be challenging to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a serious complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, of which clinicians should be aware. Further studies are needed to determine risk factors and laboratory data predictive of development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Hazariwala, Vikisha; Hadid, Hind; Kirsch, Denise; Big, Cecilia",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-020-01308-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028398/,139

The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","Hoffmann, Markus; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Mol Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362314/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276520302641; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1097276520302641; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.022,139

However, the direct relationship between lifetime eating habits and functional capacity of the elderly is poorly understood. This study investigated the dietary changes across nutrition transition (NT) in the early 1960s, in a population located in the Sardinia island known for its longevity, dubbed as “Longevity Blue Zone” (LBZ), as well as the relationship between the dietary patterns and a panel of health indicators. A total of 150 oldest-old participants (89 women and 61 men, age range 90–101 years) living in the LBZ were recruited. Participants were interviewed using validated questionnaires to assess the consumption frequency of common food items, as well as the correlation with self-rated health, comorbidity, affective and cognitive level, physical mobility, disability and anthropometric parameters. Differences between subgroups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. Correlation analysis was performed by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient, separately in males and females. Compared to the pre-NT epoch, the consumption of meat, olive oil and fresh fruit slightly increased, while the consumption of lard, legumes and vegetables decreased. A significant association was found between increased olive oil intake across NT and self-rated health (ρ = 0.519), mobility (ρ = 0.502), improved vision (ρ = −0.227) and hearing (ρ = −0.314); increased chicken meat intake and performance in activities of daily living (basic activities of daily living: ρ = 0.351; instrumental activities of daily living: ρ = 0.333). Instead, vegetable consumption showed low correlation with health indicators. A mild increase in meat intake, mostly pastured poultry, is associated with better physical performance in the Sardinian LBZ elders, suggesting that a supply of protein may have been crucial to maintaining adequate functional capacity.","Pes, Giovanni Mario; Poulain, Michel; Errigo, Alessandra; Dore, Maria Pina",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925037/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13051495,139

There is a need to clarify the incidence of thromboembolic events (TEs), as well as major hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients in the context of an escalated-dose thromboprophylaxis strategy. Methods: We conducted a single center, retrospective study of 192 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital between March 26th and May 8th 2020. Our study aimed to investigate the rates of thromboembolic events (TEs), hemorrhage and mortality of in the context of an escalated-dose thromboprophylaxis strategy implemented early in our experience with hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: The incidence of radiographically-confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 7.3% (n=14), and the rate of combined TEs was 12% (n=23). The rate of major hemorrhage was 6.3% (n=12), including one fatal CNS bleed. The overall mortality rate was 27.6% (n=53). Conclusion: The rate of VTE and overall TE was much lower than was reported in early studies, and the majority of VTEs occurred in ambulatory patients. Our data suggest that an escalated-dose thromboprophylaxis strategy may help reduce the incidence of inpatient VTEs, and that ambulatory COVID-19 patients may benefit from primary thromboprophylaxis. However, the risk of bleeding was not negligible, and must therefore be assessed on an individual and continual basis when using a more aggressive thromboprophylaxis strategy.

Thus, clinical cases and studies are the major source of novel information about the course of infection and the related pathophysiology. In this context, a clinical case of an adult patient suffering from severe HBoV-pneumonia is described that was associated with loss of consciousness followed by acute rib fracture and subsequent neurological disorder. Following initial global respiratory dysfunction the clinical respiratory symptoms recovered but the neurological symptoms maintained after weaning and intensive care in the stroke unit. During the initial phase, an acute active HBoV infection was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reactions from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. The case further demonstrates that HBoV can cause severe pneumonia, induce secondary disease also in adults, and may be associated with neurological symptoms as previously assumed.","Krakau, Michael; Gerbershagen, Kathrin; Frost, Ulrich; Hinzke, Markus; Brockmann, Michael; Schildgen, Verena; Goßmann, Axel; Limmroth, Volker; Dormann, Arno; Schildgen, Oliver",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000001587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26496262/,139

The visual representation of a character’s resemblance to a real person and the emotional response to it, as well as the expectations raised, have been a topic of discussion for several decades and have been debated by scientists from different disciplines. But as with any new technology, the findings may need to be reevaluated and adapted to new modalities. In this context, we make two contributions which may have implications for how avatars should be represented in social virtual reality applications. First, we determine how default and customized characters of current social virtual reality platforms appear in terms of human likeness, eeriness, and likability, and whether there is a clear resemblance to a given person. It can be concluded that the investigated platforms vary strongly in their representation of avatars. Common to all is that a clear resemblance does not exist. Second, we show that the uncanny valley effect is also present in head-mounted displays, but—compared to 2D monitors—even more pronounced.","Hepperle, Daniel; Purps, Christian Felix; Deuchler, Jonas; Wölfel, Matthias",Vis Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-021-02151-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177022/,139

COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory symptoms as well as blood coagulation in the vessels (thrombosis), heart attack and stroke. Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID-19 patients and virus-induced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin-13, dynorphin-13, and products such as angiotensin (1-7), angiotensin (1-9), apelin-12, dynorphin-12 in the human body. Substrates accumulation ultimately induces inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, neuronal and tissue damage while diminished products lead to the loss of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic responses.

To study successfully, students not only needed to be prepared in terms of digital readiness (workspace, IT equipment, previous online learning experiences, and sharing information online), they also faced challenges that pertained to the self-regulated management of external resources (environment structuring, time management, and help-seeking). In the current study, we investigated students’ digital readiness for the sudden switch to online learning; differences between students’ intended and actual use of external resource management strategies; and the influence of students’ digital readiness on their actual use of resource management strategies. Students enrolled in a full-scale, German university (N = 662) answered two online questionnaires (before and in the middle of the term). Descriptive statistics indicated that students seemed to be ready to study online. However, repeated measures ANOVA showed that students were not able to manage their resources during the term as frequently as intended. Finally, separate regression analyses revealed that availability of workspace and IT equipment predicted the use of environment structuring strategies. Additionally, IT equipment and information sharing behavior predicted students’ help-seeking. Based on the current results, we discuss implications for the promotion of student self-regulated learning (SRL) in online emergency remote teaching based on both external resources and digital readiness.","Naujoks, Nick; Bedenlier, Svenja; Gläser-Zikuda, Michaela; Kammerl, Rudolf; Kopp, Bärbel; Ziegler, Albert; Händel, Marion",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.672741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149567/,139

We investigate here the role of a 3-3-1 hydrophobic repeat containing nonpolar amino acids at the a, d, and g positions in determining the structures of coiled coils using mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper dimerization domain. When three charged residues at the g positions in the parental sequence are replaced by nonpolar alanine or valine side chains, stable four-helix structures result. The X-ray crystal structures of the tetramers reveal antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coils in which the a, d, and g side chains interlock in a combination of knobs-into-knobs and knobs-into-holes packing. Interfacial interactions in a coiled coil can therefore be prescribed by hydrophobic-polar patterns beyond the canonical 3-4 heptad repeat. The results suggest that the conserved, charged residues at the g positions in the GCN4 leucine zipper can impart a negative design element to disfavor thermodynamically more stable, antiparallel tetramers.","Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Eliezer, David; Kallenbach, Neville R.; Lu, Min",Structure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212606000463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606000463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16472744/,139

In this work we briefly review structural biology and computational clues on representative single-subunit viral polymerases that are more or less connected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in particular, to elucidate how nucleotide substrates and potential drug analogs are selected in the viral genome synthesis. To do that, we first survey two well studied RdRps from Polio virus and hepatitis C virus in regard to structural motifs and key residues that have been identified for the nucleotide selectivity. Then we focus on related structural and biochemical characteristics discovered for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. To further compare, we summarize what we have learned computationally from phage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) on its stepwise nucleotide selectivity, and extend discussion to a structurally similar human mitochondria RNAP, which deserves special attention as it cannot be adversely affected by antiviral treatments. We also include viral phi29 DNA polymerase for comparison, which has both helicase and proofreading activities on top of nucleotide selectivity for replication fidelity control. The helicase and proofreading functions are achieved by protein components in addition to RdRp in the coronavirus replication-transcription machine, with the proofreading strategy important for the fidelity control in synthesizing a comparatively large viral genome.","Long, Chunhong; Romero, Moises Ernesto; La Rocco, Daniel; Yu, Jin",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021002361?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104356/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021002361,139
610530,SARS-COV2 and eosinophilic esophagitis: a first case,2021-07-02,"INTRODUCTION: Insufficient sleep is highly prevalent among school-age youth and adolescents, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether sleep during COVID-19 varies based on whether school is in session. We examined the sleep of school-age youth and adolescents during COVID-19 and described changes in rates of insufficient sleep from summer (Time 1) to school year (Time 2). We further examined whether insufficient sleep is associated with mental health service utilization. METHODS: Adults in Southwestern Pennsylvania with children under 18 years old in their household completed a repeated cross-sectional electronic survey. The survey was designed to assess usage of, and unmet need for, health and social service resources, among other health behaviors. As responses were anonymous with no longitudinal linking, we used descriptive statistics and Chi-Square tests to examine our aims at each time point. Insufficient sleep was operationalized as <9 hours (school-age youth) and <8 hours (adolescents) of sleep duration, per National Sleep Foundation standards. RESULTS: Data were analyzed from n=97 school-age youth and n=83 adolescents at Time 1, and n=77 school-age youth and n=82 adolescents at Time 2. Most school-age youth (76.3%) obtained sufficient sleep at Time 1, which was maintained at Time 2. However, while 75.6% of adolescents obtained sufficient sleep at Time 1, that number fell to 63.3% at Time 2. Youth with insufficient sleep were more likely to utilize mental health services than those obtaining sufficient sleep at a borderline level of statistical significance (p-value = 0.097), after controlling for age group. CONCLUSION: The rate of insufficient sleep among adolescents during COVID-19 is meaningfully higher than non-COVID, school-year rates recently reported among adolescents. Youth with insufficient sleep are more likely to utilize mental health services, though the direction of causality in that association is unknown. Future work should focus on strategies for increasing access to sleep promotion programs that support sleep health and mental health during a time of great stress.

This is often accompanied by infrastructure modifications, ward redesignations, as well as healthcare staff redeployments and changes to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. We review the potential for both negative and positive impacts these major changes can have on nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). RECENT FINDINGS: Healthcare facilities around the world have reported outbreaks of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast some centres have reported a decrease in baseline rates due to a number of possible factors.

In the capsid precursor, extensive deletions were prevalent in the passaged virus but uncommon in the clinical samples. A greater prevalence of point mutations was seen in the capsid precursor gene than in the putative helicase gene. In culture, the minority sequence in the capsid precursor at nucleotide position 5826 rapidly shifted after five passages to become the majority sequence.

Using reverse genetics technology, such negative-strand RNA viruses can now be rescued from cloned DNA. This technology allows the insertion of exogenous genes encoding foreign antigens into the MV genome in such a way that they can be expressed by the MV vaccine strain, without affecting virus structure, propagation and cell targeting. Recombinant viruses rescued from cloned cDNA induce immune responses against both measles virus and the cloned antigens. The tolerability of MV to gene(s) insertion makes it an attractive flexible vector system, especially if broad immune responses are required. The fact that measles replication strictly occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells without DNA intermediate has important biosafety implications and adds to the attractiveness of MV as a vector. In this article we report the characteristics of reporter gene expression (GFP, LacZ and CAT) and the biochemical, biophysical and immunological properties of recombinant MV expressing heterologous antigens of simian immunogeficiency virus (SIV).","Zuniga, Armando; Wang, ZiLi; Liniger, Matthias; Hangartner, Lars; Caballero, Michael; Pavlovic, Jovan; Wild, Peter; Viret, Jean Francois; Glueck, Reinhard; Billeter, Martin A.; Naim, Hussein Y.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X0700031X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3707277?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0700031X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17303293/,139
613376,How do we plan hematopoietic cell transplant and cellular therapy with the looming COVID‐19 threat?,2020-03-16,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an extraordinary threat to the global healthcare system. This infection disease, named COVID-19, is characterized by a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe viral pneumonia with fulminant cytokine storm, which leads to respiratory failure. To improve patient outcomes, both the inhibition of viral replication and of the unwarranted excessive inflammatory response are crucial. Since no specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for the treatment of patients and the only upcoming promising agents are monoclonal antibodies, inexpensive, safe, and widely available treatments are urgently needed. A potential anti-inflammatory molecule to be evaluated, which possesses antiviral activities in several experimental models, is the polyphenol resveratrol. This compound has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures and to downregulate several pathogenetic mechanisms involved in COVID-19 severity. The use of resveratrol in clinical practice is limited by the low bioavailability following oral administration, due to the pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics of the molecule. Therefore, topical administration through inhaled formulations could allow us to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of the compound in the airways, the entry route of SARS-CoV-2.","Rossi, Giovanni A.; Sacco, Oliviero; Capizzi, Antonino; Mastromarino, Paola",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093569/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.670955,139

The symptomatology of COVID-19 is heterogeneous with a severity continuum. Many symptoms are related to pathological changes in the vocal system, leading to the assumption that COVID-19 may also affect voice production. For the first time, the present study investigates voice acoustic correlates of a COVID-19 infection based on a comprehensive acoustic parameter set. We compare 88 acoustic features extracted from recordings of the vowels /i:/, /e:/, /u:/, /o:/, and /a:/ produced by 11 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 11 COVID-19 negative German-speaking participants. We employ the Mann-Whitney U test and calculate effect sizes to identify features with prominent group differences. The mean voiced segment length and the number of voiced segments per second yield the most important differences across all vowels indicating discontinuities in the pulmonic airstream during phonation in COVID-19 positive participants. Group differences in front vowels are additionally reflected in fundamental frequency variation and the harmonics-to-noise ratio, group differences in back vowels in statistics of the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and the spectral slope.

IgM, IgA and IgG levels against six SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the nucleocapsid antigen of the four HCoV (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) were quantified by Luminex, and antibody neutralization capacity was assessed by flow cytometry, in a cohort of health care workers followed up to 7 months (N = 578). Seroprevalence increases over time from 13.5% (month 0) and 15.6% (month 1) to 16.4% (month 6). Levels of antibodies, including those with neutralizing capacity, are stable over time, except IgG to nucleocapsid antigen and IgM levels that wane. After the peak response, anti-spike antibody levels increase from ~150 days post-symptom onset in all individuals (73% for IgG), in the absence of any evidence of re-exposure. IgG and IgA to HCoV are significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic seropositive individuals.

The objectives of this study were to explore the intervals before TB diagnosis and isolation at a regional hospital in Taiwan, and to provide useful knowledge to hospitals for the purpose of TB infection control. Methods From 2002 to 2005, we included a total of 343 patients with culture-positive pulmonary TB in a regional hospital in Southern Taiwan for this study. Their medical records were reviewed, and the time intervals between patient-hospital contact points and isolation were recorded. Results Of 343 culture-positive pulmonary TB patients, the majority were male, over 40 years old, and unemployed. The mean interval between the first admission and isolation was 20.5 days (median, 2.0 days). The mean intervals between the first admission from outpatient clinics, emergency department and hospitalization and suspected TB were < 1 day, 6.07 days and 25.53 days, respectively. The mean accumulated exposure time was 0.35 days, 0.61 days and 10.09 days in outpatient clinics, the emergency department and hospitalization, respectively; 75.5% of patients had their diagnosis confirmed at the chest department of the department of internal medicine. Conclusion Delayed diagnosis was most likely in the case of hospitalized patients and least likely in outpatient clinics.

Next, pathogenic potential of most frequently cultivated component of microbiome i.e. Escherichia coli was assessed to identify its known pathotypes which revealed the presence of virulent factors in many cultivated E. coli isolates. Applying in-depth bacterial community analysis using high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, a high inter-individual variation was observed among the studied guano samples. Interestingly, a higher diversity of bacterial communities was observed in decaying guano representative. The search against human pathogenic bacteria database at 97% identity, a small proportion of sequences were found associated to well-known human pathogens.

Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication. METHODS: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms “Covid-19 skin,” “Covid-19 rash,” “Covid-19 exanthem,” and “Covid-19 chilblains.” Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease. As a potential correlate to disease severity, prognosis, or infectibility, it is critical that all healthcare professionals be well versed in these increasingly common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.","Daneshgaran, Giulia; Dubin, Danielle P.; Gould, Daniel J.",Am J Clin Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40257-020-00558-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32865778/,139

To identify host miRNAs important to controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, we screened 15 miRNAs that were previously implicated in innate immunity or antiviral functions. Over-expression of the miR-26 family strongly inhibited PRRSV replication in vitro, as shown by virus titer assays, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR assays. MiR-26a inhibited the replication of both type 1 and type 2 PRRSV strains. Mutating the seed region of miR-26 restored viral titers. Luciferase reporters showed that miR-26a does not target the PRRSV genome directly but instead affects the expression of type I interferon and the IFN-stimulated genes MX1 and ISG15 during PRRSV infection. These results demonstrate the important role of miR-26a in modulating PRRSV infection and also support the possibility of using host miR-26a to achieve RNAi-mediated antiviral therapeutic strategies.","Li, Liwei; Wei, Zuzhang; Zhou, Yanjun; Gao, Fei; Jiang, Yifeng; Yu, Lingxue; Zheng, Hao; Tong, Wu; Yang, Shen; Zheng, Haihong; Shan, Tongling; Liu, Fei; Xia, Tianqi; Tong, Guangzhi",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003402; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25218480/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003402,139

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigate whether, the use of a respiratory symptom screening tool at the border would aid in predicting which travellers are more likely to be infected with specific respiratory viruses. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from travellers arriving at Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, during the winter 2008, via a symptom questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 342 (26.0%) of 1313 samples obtained from 2714 symptomatic travellers. The most frequently identified viruses were rhinoviruses (128), enteroviruses (77) and influenza B (48). The most frequently reported symptoms were stuffy or runny nose (60%), cough (47%), sore throat (27%) and sneezing (24%). Influenza B infections were associated with the highest number of symptoms (mean of 3.4) followed by rhinoviruses (mean of 2.2) and enteroviruses (mean of 1.9). The positive predictive value (PPV) of any symptom for any respiratory virus infection was low at 26%.

Recommendation of the International Geriatric Radiotherapy Group,2020-05-09,"New challenges to human, animal, and ecosystem health demand novel solutions: New diseases are emerging from new configurations of humans, their domestic animals and wildlife; new pressures on once robust and resilient ecosystems are compromising their integrity; synthetic compounds and engineered organisms, new to the natural world, are spreading unpredictably around the globe. Globalization provides opportunities for infectious organisms to gain access to new hosts, changing in distribution and virulence. What type of training should be developed to provide professionals with the right tools to meet these challenges? In this article, we offer recommendations for developing academic programs in conservation medicine. We discuss the need for, and the advantages to, using a conservation medicine approach to address real world situations and present illustrations of how this is applied today. We suggest a core set of skills that are needed in a conservation medicine practitioner, and recommend key considerations for designing new conservation medicine training programs. We review existing programs that offer conservation medicine content, and provide examples of where opportunities exist for those interested in pursuing a conservation medicine career.","Kaufman, Gretchen E.; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Paul-Murphy, Joanne; Modrall, Jennifer D.",Ecohealth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-008-0208-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19212790/,139
628629,Influence of anti‐COVID‐19 policies on 10 pediatric infectious diseases,2021-08-13,"We previously reported that the non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors (CypIs)—cyclosporin A analog CRV431 and sanglifehrin analog NV556—efficiently inhibit HCV replication in vitro. In this study, we asked whether they can also reduce HCV replication in vivo. We found that a single oral administration of CRV431 and NV556 to HCV-infected humanized-liver mice drastically reduced HCV blood levels. The antiviral effect was observed when CRV431 or NV556 were each individually administered with HCV, 3, 6 weeks or even 3 months post-infection when viral replication is robust. These results were confirmed in chimeric mice implanted with human hepatocytes isolated from three distinct donors. Remarkably, no viral rebound was observed 5 months after a single dose administration of 50 mg/kg of CRV431 or NV556 four weeks post-HCV infection, indicating the possibility of suppression of an established viral infection. Since we recently demonstrated that both CRV431 and NV556 also inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in nonviral-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse models, our present data suggest that the two entirely structurally different CypIs—CRV431 and NV556—derived from unrelated natural products, represent attractive partners to current direct-acting agent (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C and liver diseases.","Bobardt, Michael; Hansson, Magnus Joakim; Mayo, Patrick; Ure, Daren; Foster, Robert; Gallay, Philippe",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764799/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237236,139

The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications, and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden. This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status, and increase of opioid use with the associated risks. METHODS: The article is the study of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 task force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve, and joint disease. The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients. We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care. The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients. RESULTS: The article sets forth a strategy for the interventional pain centers to reemerge from the current pandemic and to set a course for future events.

The process of automated lung segmentation is challenging due to (a) CT radiation dosage and (b) ground-glass opacities caused by COVID-19. The lung segmentation methodologies proposed in 2020 were semi- or automated but not reliable, accurate, and user-friendly. The proposed study presents a COVID Lung Image Analysis System (COVLIAS 1.0, AtheroPoint™, Roseville, CA, USA) consisting of hybrid deep learning (HDL) models for lung segmentation. Methodology: The COVLIAS 1.0 consists of three methods based on solo deep learning (SDL) or hybrid deep learning (HDL). SegNet is proposed in the SDL category while VGG-SegNet and ResNet-SegNet are designed under the HDL paradigm. The three proposed AI approaches were benchmarked against the National Institute of Health (NIH)-based conventional segmentation model using fuzzy-connectedness. A cross-validation protocol with a 40:60 ratio between training and testing was designed, with 10% validation data. The ground truth (GT) was manually traced by a radiologist trained personnel. For performance evaluation, nine different criteria were selected to perform the evaluation of SDL or HDL lung segmentation regions and lungs long axis against GT. Results: Using the database of 5000 chest CT images (from 72 patients), COVLIAS 1.0 yielded AUC of ~0.96, ~0.97, ~0.98, and ~0.96 (p-value < 0.001), respectively within 5% range of GT area, for SegNet, VGG-SegNet, ResNet-SegNet, and NIH. The mean Figure of Merit using four models (left and right lung) was above 94%. On benchmarking against the National Institute of Health (NIH) segmentation method, the proposed model demonstrated a 58% and 44% improvement in ResNet-SegNet, 52% and 36% improvement in VGG-SegNet for lung area, and lung long axis, respectively. The PE statistics performance was in the following order: ResNet-SegNet > VGG-SegNet > NIH > SegNet. The HDL runs in <1 s on test data per image. Conclusions: The COVLIAS 1.0 system can be applied in real-time for radiology-based clinical settings.","Suri, Jasjit S.; Agarwal, Sushant; Pathak, Rajesh; Ketireddy, Vedmanvitha; Columbu, Marta; Saba, Luca; Gupta, Suneet K.; Faa, Gavino; Singh, Inder M.; Turk, Monika; Chadha, Paramjit S.; Johri, Amer M.; Khanna, Narendra N.; Viskovic, Klaudija; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Laird, John R.; Pareek, Gyan; Miner, Martin; Sobel, David W.; Balestrieri, Antonella; Sfikakis, Petros P.; Tsoulfas, George; Protogerou, Athanasios; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Kitas, George D.; Teji, Jagjit S.; Al-Maini, Mustafa; Dhanjil, Surinder K.; Nicolaides, Andrew; Sharma, Aditya; Rathore, Vijay; Fatemi, Mostafa; Alizad, Azra; Krishnan, Pudukode R.; Frence, Nagy; Ruzsa, Zoltan; Gupta, Archna; Naidu, Subbaram; Kalra, Mannudeep",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441340/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081405,139

Dysphagia is either part of the evolving clinical symptomatology of an underlying neurological autoimmunity or occurs as a sole manifestation, acutely or insidiously. This opinion article reviews the autoimmune neurological causes of dysphagia, highlights clinical clues and laboratory testing that facilitate early diagnosis, especially when dysphagia is the presenting symptom, and outlines the most effective immunotherapeutic approaches. Dysphagia is common in inflammatory myopathies, most prominently in inclusion body myositis, and is frequent in myasthenia gravis, occurring early in bulbar-onset disease or during the course of progressive, generalized disease. Acute-onset dysphagia is often seen in Guillain–Barre syndrome variants and slowly progressive dysphagia in paraneoplastic neuropathies highlighted by the presence of specific autoantibodies. The most common causes of CNS autoimmune dysphagia are demyelinating and inflammatory lesions in the brainstem, occurring in patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Less common, but often overlooked, is dysphagia in stiff-person syndrome especially in conjunction with cerebellar ataxia and high anti-GAD autoantibodies, and in gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes associated with autoantibodies against the ganglionic acetyl-choline receptor. In the setting of many neurological autoimmunities, acute-onset or progressive dysphagia is a potentially treatable condition, requiring increased awareness for prompt diagnosis and early immunotherapy initiation.","Stathopoulos, Panos; Dalakas, Marinos C.",Dysphagia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00455-021-10338-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226958/,139

The objective of this study was to provide an evidence-based review of the associated pathways and potential treatment of the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Dysregulated immune responses have been reported to occur in a smaller subset of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, leading to clinical deterioration 7 to 10 days after initial presentation. A hyperinflammatory state referred to as cytokine storm in its severest form has been marked by elevation of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and other cytokines and severe CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell lymphopenia and coagulopathy. Recognition of at-risk patients could permit early institution of aggressive intensive care and antiviral and immune treatment to reduce the complications related to this proinflammatory state. Several reports and ongoing clinical trials provide hope that available immunomodulatory therapies could have therapeutic potential in these severe cases.

Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, Echinococcus granulosus, and Rift Valley fever. The high fatality from MERS outbreaks during 2012–2016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of MERS-related publications. However, we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burnetii, and Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts. Camel populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts, and thus, the risk of zoonoses increases as well. In this review, we provide an overview of the major zoonotic diseases present in dromedary camels, their risk to humans, and recommendations to minimize spillover events.","Zhu, Sophie; Zimmerman, Dawn; Deem, Sharon L.",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140075/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-019-01413-7,139

The present study aimed to analyze the effect of psychosocial risks and emotional intelligence on nurses’ health, well-being, burnout level, and job satisfaction during the rise and main peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. It is a cross-sectional study conducted on a convenience sample of 125 Spanish nurses. Multiple hierarchical linear regression models were calculated considering emotional intelligence levels, psychosocial demand factors (interpersonal conflict, lack of organizational justice, role conflict, and workload), social support and emotional work on burnout, job satisfaction, and nurses’ health. Finally, the moderating effect of emotional intelligence levels, psychosocial factors, social support, and emotional work on burnout, job satisfaction, and nurses’ health was calculated. Overall, this research data points to a protective effect of emotional intelligence against the adverse effects of psychosocial risks such as burnout, psychosomatic complaints, and a favorable effect on job satisfaction.","Soto-Rubio, Ana; Giménez-Espert, María del Carmen; Prado-Gascó, Vicente",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143172/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217998,139

We constructed ingoing contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain that were linked by trading, to elucidate potential pathways for the transmission of infection and to evaluate their effect on the risk of a farm experiencing a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incident. Our findings are consistent with variation in bTB risk associated with region, herd size, disease risk area and history of previous bTB incidents on the root farm and nearby farms. However, we also identified effects of both direct and indirect trading patterns, such that connections to more farms in the England High-Risk Area up to three movements away from the root farm increased the odds of a bTB incident, while connections with more farms in the England Low-Risk Area up to eight movements away decreased the odds. Relative to other risk factors for bTB, trading behaviours are arguably more amenable to change, and consideration of risks associated with indirect trading, as well direct trading, might therefore offer an additional approach to bTB control in Great Britain.","Fielding, Helen R.; McKinley, Trevelyan J.; Delahay, Richard J.; Silk, Matthew J.; McDonald, Robbie A.",R Soc Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431877/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191806,139

However, it is possible that social relationships might have a protective effect. In the present study, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected older adults’ well-being and loneliness, and the role of structural and functional characteristics of social relationships. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We use data from 99 older adults in Switzerland who participated (a) in a three-week micro-longitudinal study on social relationships and well-being in 2019 and (b) in a weekly online survey during four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: Our findings show that the global pandemic had substantial adverse effects on older adults’ emotional well-being and loneliness. In addition, aspects of social relationships were related to loneliness both before and during the pandemic. Only one functional feature of social relationships (satisfaction with communication during the pandemic) buffered adverse effects of the major stressful event. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Although the social distancing measures during COVID-19 presented a major stressor for older adults’ well-being and loneliness, being able to maintain social communication to a satisfactory level during that time reduced this effect. Therefore, enabling older adults to stay in touch with their social circle based on their personal preferences might reduce the impact that any future lockdown might have on their well-being.","Macdonald, Birthe; Hülür, Gizem",Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258898/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa194,139

One of the most worrying features of COVID-19 is a phenomenon known as the “cytokine storm”, which is a rapid overreaction of the immune system. Additionally, coagulation abnormalities, thrombocytopenia and digestive symptoms, including anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea, are often observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Baker’s yeast β-glucan, a natural immunomodulatory component derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, primes the immune system to respond better to any microbial infection. Our previous studies have shown that oral administration of yeast β-glucans decreased the diarrhoea, modulated cytokine expression, and reduced the intestinal inflammation. Additionally, we showed that β-glucan fractions decreased coagulation in plasma and reduced the activation of platelets. During the period of home confinement facing individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, our immune defence could be weakened by different factors, including stress, anxiety and poor nutrition, while a healthy diet rich in vitamins C and D can reinforce the immune defence and reduce the risk of microbial infections. Additionally, β-glucan can be used to strengthen the immune defence in healthy individuals prior to any possible viral infections. This short review focuses on the role of baker’s yeast β-glucan, with a healthy diet rich in natural vitamins C and D, in addition to a healthy gut microbiota can provide synergistic immune system support, helping the body to naturally defend prior to respiratory virus infections, until stronger options such as vaccines are available.","Jawhara, Samir",Gut Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062058/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-020-00385-2,139

The longer high levels of viral multiplication occur – permitted by high levels of transmission –, the more the virus can adapt to the human host and find ways to success. The third wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic is starting in different parts of the world, emphasizing that transmission containment measures that are being imposed are not adequate. Part of the consideration in determining containment measures is the rationale that vaccination will soon stop transmission and allow a return to normality. However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine‐resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll‐out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic. In the absence of effective antivirals, it is not improbable that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection prophylaxis will involve an annual vaccination campaign against ‘dominant’ viral variants, similar to influenza prophylaxis. Living with COVID‐19 will be an issue of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants and evolution. It is therefore crucial to understand how SARS‐CoV‐2 evolves and what constrains its evolution, in order to anticipate the variants that will emerge. Thus far, the focus has been on the receptor‐binding spike protein, but the virus is complex, encoding 26 proteins which interact with a large number of host factors, so the possibilities for evolution are manifold and not predictable a priori. However, if we are to mount the best defence against COVID‐19, we must mount it against the variants, and to do this, we must have knowledge about the evolutionary possibilities of the virus. In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution. We now have the wherewithal – viral genome sequencing, protein structure determination/modelling, protein interaction analysis – to functionally characterize viral variants, but access to comprehensive genome data is extremely uneven. Yet, to develop an understanding of the impacts of such evolution on transmission and disease, we must link it to transmission (viral epidemiology) and disease data (patient clinical data), and the population granularities of these. In this editorial, we explore key facets of viral biology and the influence of relevant aspects of human polymorphisms, human behaviour, geography and climate and, based on this, derive a series of recommendations to monitor viral evolution and predict the types of variants that are likely to arise.","Luo, Ruibang; Delaunay‐Moisan, Agnès; Timmis, Kenneth; Danchin, Antoine",Environ Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769683/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15487,139

Accordingly, many changes occurred in the way of providing health care, including pregnancy and childbirth care. To our knowledge, no studies on experiences of maternity care Providers during the COVID-19 Pandemic have been published in Iran. We aimed to discover their experiences on pregnancy and childbirth care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was a qualitative research performed with a descriptive phenomenological approach. The used sampling method was purposive sampling by taking the maximum variation possible into account, which continued until data saturation. Accordingly, in-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted by including 12 participants, as 4 gynecologists, 6 midwives working in the hospitals and private offices, and 2 midwives working in the health centers. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven stage method with MAXQDA10 software. RESULTS: Data analysis led to the extraction of 3 themes, 9 categories, and 25 subcategories. The themes were as follows: “Fear of Disease”, “Burnout”, and “Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic”, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal health care providers experience emotional and psychological stress and work challenges during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, comprehensive support should be provided for the protection of their physical and mental health statuses. By working as a team, utilizing the capacity of telemedicine to care and follow up mothers, and providing maternity care at home, some emerged challenges to maternal care services can be overcome.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Bagheri, Maryam; Amjadi, Marjan Akhavan; Farahani, Maryam Farmahini; Haghollahi, Fedyeh",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602060/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04148-y,139

Kidney, blood pressure and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection",2021-03-03,"Background: Vaccinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are intended to induce an immune response to protect against infection/disease. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is thought to induce a (different) immune response, e.g., to induce tolerance to allergens. In this position paper we clarify how to use AIT in temporal relation to COVID-19 vaccination. Four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently approved in the EU, and their possible immunological interactions with AIT are described together with practical recommendations for use. Materials and methods: Based on the internationally published literature, this position paper provides specific recommendations for the use of AIT in temporal relation to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Results: AIT is used in 1) allergic rhinitis, 2) allergic bronchial asthma, 3) insect venom allergy, 4) food allergy (peanut). Conclusion: For the continuation of an ongoing AIT, we recommend an interval of 1 week before and after vaccination for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). For sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and oral immunotherapy (OIT), we recommend taking them up to the day before vaccination and a break of 2 – 7 days after vaccination. Initiation of a new SCIT, SLIT, or OIT should be delayed until 1 week after the day of the second vaccination. For SCIT, we generally recommend an interval of ~ 1 week to COVID-19 vaccination.","Klimek, Ludger; Pfaar, Oliver; Hamelmann, Eckard; Kleine-Tebbe, Jörg; Taube, Christian; Wagenmann, Martin; Werfel, Thomas; Brehler, Randolf; Novak, Natalija; Mülleneisen, Norbert; Becker, Sven; Worm, Margitta",Allergol Select,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533543/; https://doi.org/10.5414/alx02245e,139

To mitigate colony losses, beekeepers in Canada and around the world introduce queens into replacement colonies; however, Canada’s short queen rearing season has historically limited the production of early season queens. As a result, Canadian beekeepers rely on the importation of foreign bees, particularly queens from warmer climates. Importing a large proportion of (often mal-adapted) queens each year creates a dependency on foreign bee sources, putting beekeeping, and pollination sectors at risk in the event of border closures, transportation issues, and other restrictions as is currently happening due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Although traditional Canadian queen production is unable to fully meet early season demand, increasing domestic queen production to meet mid- and later season demand would reduce Canada’s dependency. As well, on-going studies exploring the potential for overwintering queens in Canada may offer a strategy to have early season domestic queens available. Increasing the local supply of queens could provide Canadian beekeepers, farmers, and consumers with a greater level of agricultural stability and food security. Our study is the first rigorous analysis of the economic feasibility of queen production. We present the costs of queen production for three Canadian operations over two years. Our results show that it can be profitable for a beekeeping operation in Canada to produce queen cells and mated queens and could be one viable strategy to increase the sustainability of the beekeeping industry.","Bixby, Miriam; Hoover, Shelley E; McCallum, Robyn; Ibrahim, Abdullah; Ovinge, Lynae; Olmstead, Sawyer; Pernal, Stephen F; Zayed, Amro; Foster, Leonard J; Guarna, M Marta",J Econ Entomol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32484511/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa102,139

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is thought to separate the CNS from any systemic inflammatory states to maintain homeostasis within this specialized, vulnerable organ. However, accumulating studies have challenged this concept by demonstrating systemic inflammatory effects on brain. Moreover, the coronavirus disease pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 2019 has rapidly evoked attention toward the BBB as the systemic-CNS immunological interface. In this review, we focus on microglia, the sole immune cells in the CNS, and briefly introduce our new findings regarding microglial BBB regulation in systemic inflammation.

However, it is difficult to prepare ordered and fine-grained brazed diamond grinding wheels. This study presents a new method for grain-arranged, brazed diamond grinding wheels with microtextures with similar performance to ordered and fine-grained brazed diamond grinding wheels. First, coarse diamond grains (18/20 mesh) were orderly brazed to fabricate the end grinding wheels. Next, a series of microtextures were ablated on the diamond grains using a pulsed laser, and two types of textured end grinding wheels—TG-G (ablated microgrooves only) and TG-GH (ablated microgrooves and microholes)—were prepared. Then, an experiment involving the grinding of alumina ceramics was performed, and the grinding characteristics and grinding mechanism were analyzed. The results indicated that compared with untextured diamond end grinding wheels (TG), the textured diamond grinding wheels (TG-G and TG-GH) significantly reduced the grinding force and the roughness of the machined surface. The local stress concentration at the microtextures promoted the formation of microcracks in the diamond grains of TG-G and TG-GH, and the self-sharpness of the grinding wheel was significantly improved. The brittle fracture mode of ceramic materials in grinding included intergranular fracture and transgranular fracture. Ironing pressure action was a key material-removal mechanism. It had an important influence on the cutting force and plasticity characteristics of the TG machined surface. For the surfaces processed by TG-G and TG-GH, the effect of ironing was weakened, while shearing played a more important role. The TG-GH grinding wheel ablated with microgrooves and microholes was superior to the TG-G grinding wheel ablated with only microgrooves, with regard to the grinding force, roughness, and self-sharpening.","Wu, Shixiong; Zhang, Fenglin; Ni, Yongqian; Chen, Feng; Yan, Zhiqiao",Ceram Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565606/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272884220312943; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272884220312943,139

The process consists of an autoregressive part that explains the effect of the previous parameters and a forcing variable that measures the dependence structure between marginal variables. We apply this model to the daily data of the exchange rates of five Asian countries with the strongest economies before and during the 2020 pandemic, namely CNY/USD, IDR/USD, INR/USD, JPY/USD, and KRW/USD. The ARIMA-GARCH model was used to model the exchange rates data and estimate the dynamic dependence using time-varying copulas with the extended parameters. The dynamic dependencies between Chinas and the four countries' exchange rates before and during the 2020 pandemic was evidenced. Moreover, India is the country whose exchange rate has been most strongly affected by the pandemic. Some of the highlights of the proposed approach are: • This paper provides two algorithms to investigate the dynamic dependencies among exchange rates data during a crisis and forecast the data using time-varying copulas with the extended parameters. • There are four extended time-varying copulas' parameters which can measure the dynamic dependencies between variables. • The computation procedure is easy to implement.","Ahdika, Atina; Rosadi, Dedi; Effendie, Adhitya Ronnie; Gunardi,",MethodsX,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.101322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436505/,139

Recent phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that this pathogenic fungus arrived in the PNW approximately 7 to 9 decades ago. In this paper, we theorize that the ancestors of the PNW C. gattii clones arrived in the area by shipborne transport, possibly in contaminated ballast, and established themselves in coastal waters early in the 20th century. In 1964, a tsunami flooded local coastal regions, transporting C. gattii to land. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in animals and humans 3 decades later suggests that adaptation to local environs took time, possibly requiring an increase in virulence and further dispersal. Tsunamis as a mechanism for the seeding of land with pathogenic waterborne microbes may have important implications for our understanding of how infectious diseases emerge in certain regions.

We aimed to define the prevalence and clinical characteristics of these two groups within a large multi-state healthcare system and develop a simpler means to assist clinicians in identifying VHR patients using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients in a 28-hospital US healthcare system in 2018. ICD-10 codes were used to define the ASCVD population. Per the AHA/ACC Guideline, VHR status was defined by ≥2 major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and ≥2 high-risk conditions. CART analysis was performed on training and validation datasets. A random forest model was used to verify results. RESULTS: Of 180,669 ASCVD patients identified, 58% were VHR. Among patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 99% and 96% were classified as VHR, respectively. Both CART and random forest models identified recent ACS, ischemic stroke, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, history of MI, and age as the most important predictors of VHR status. Using five rules identified by CART analysis, fewer than 50% of risk factors were required to assign VHR status. CONCLUSION: CART analysis helped to streamline the identification of VHR patients based on a limited number of rules and risk factors. This approach may help improve clinical decision making by simplifying ASCVD risk assessment at the point of care. Further validation is needed, however, in more diverse populations.","Sajja, Aparna; Li, Hsin-Fang; Spinelli, Kateri J.; Ali, Amir; Virani, Salim S.; Martin, Seth S.; Gluckman, Ty J.",Am J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611633/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2021.100187,139

DISCUSSION: Africa has contributed a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the global pool in growing open access repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) is coordinating initiatives across the continent to establish genomic hubs in selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation, efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity for high-throughput genomics at selected genomics hubs should not overshadow the deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small scale local genomic surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches at central genomic hubs.

However, the overall sensitivity of PADs still remains weak, posing a challenge for biosensing scientists exploiting them in clinical applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the current applicable potential of PADs, focusing on total signal-amplification strategies that have been applied widely in PADs involving colorimetry, luminescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, photoacoustic, photothermal, and photoelectrochemical methods as well as nucleic acid-mediated PAD modifications. The advances in signal-amplification strategies in terms of signal-enhancing principles, sensitivity, and time reactions are discussed in detail to provide an overview of these approaches to using PADs in biosensing applications. Furthermore, a comparison of these methods summarizes the potential for scientists to develop superior PADs.

However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is highly heterogeneous and exhibits localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, this characteristic burstiness in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with burstiness that over longer times converge to exactly zero VE, but that for interim times frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of a RNA based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and in reported cases.","Lisewski, Andreas Martin",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122100268X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122100268X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746095/,139
652973,Addressing the COVID-19 transmission in inner Brazil by a mathematical model,2021-05-24,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarize the current literature about telemedicine in pediatric headache and to provide practical guidance for its implementation. RECENT FINDINGS: There are few studies dedicated to telemedicine in pediatric headache, and existing studies are small. Patients and families report high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine, and most are willing to continue telemedicine visits in the future. Telemedicine demonstrated similar reductions in headache frequency, severity, and duration as patients treated in-person. Remotely delivered psychologic interventions have some utility in reducing headache severity acutely. Families feel telemedicine reduces geographic and financial barriers to care. SUMMARY: Telemedicine in pediatric headache is a growing field. While there is limited research available, it appears safe, efficacious, and feasible. Headache-related outcomes, including frequency, severity, and duration, were similar amongst telemedicine and in-person visits. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and detailed analysis of adverse outcomes.","Rosenthal, Scott; Yonker, Marcy",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-021-01112-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844073/,139

METHODS: The present study is a descriptive type of research. The study’s sample group consisted of 735 people and included healthcare workers (n = 426) and service sector employees (n = 309). In this study, sociodemographic characteristics, employment in the healthcare or service sector, having a relative with COVID-19, losing any relative due to COVID-19 and taking preventive measures were taken as independent variables. The dependent variable was the score from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). RESULTS: The FCV-19S median value was 14 for the service sector and 17 for the healthcare sector. While no difference was found between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the service sector, there was a significant correlation between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the healthcare sector. The FCV-19S median value of midwives was 21, and it was higher than those of other occupational groups were. The mean FCV-19S scores of those who thought they had COVID-19 symptoms due to stress or panic were higher among the healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: The healthcare workers need more support in fear management than those engaged in service sector employees, and it is recommended that raising the awareness of service sector employees in terms of compliance with preventive measures should be prioritized.","Kabasakal, Esma; Özpulat, Funda; Akca, Ayşegül; Özcebe, L.

654708,Widely available lysosome targeting agents should be considered as a potential therapy for COVID-19,2020-06-06,"Considerable attention has been recently given to possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via water media. This review addresses this issue and examines the fate of coronaviruses (CoVs) in water systems, with particular attention to the recently available information on the novel SARS-CoV-2. The methods for the determination of viable virus particle and quantification of CoVs and, in particular, of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are discussed with particular regard to the methods of concentration and to the emerging methods of detection. The analysis of the environmental stability of CoVs, with particular regard of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficacy of the disinfection methods are extensively reviewed as well. This information provides a broad view of the state-of-the-art for researchers involved in the investigation of CoVs in aquatic systems, and poses the basis for further analysis and discussion on the risk associated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water media. The examined data indicate that detection of the virus in wastewater and natural water bodies provides a potentially powerful tool for quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) and for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the evaluation of the level of circulation of the virus in a population. Assays of the viable virions in water media provide information on its integrity, capability of replication (in suitable host species) and on its potential infectivity. Challenges and critical issues relevant to the detection of coronaviruses in different water matrixes with both direct and surrogate methods as well as in the implementation of epidemiological tools are presented and critically discussed.","Buonerba, Antonio; Corpuz, Mary Vermi Aizza; Ballesteros, Florencio; Choo, Kwang-Ho; Hasan, Shadi W.; Korshin, Gregory V.; Belgiorno, Vincenzo; Barceló, Damià; Naddeo, Vincenzo",J Hazard Mater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735767/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389421005434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421005434?v=s5,139

This was aimed at producing the first minimal subunit-based, chemically-synthesised, immunogenic molecules (COLSARSPROT) covering several HLA alleles. They were predicted to cover 48.25% of the world’s population for 6 weeks (short-term) and 33.65% for 15 weeks (long-lasting) as they induced very high immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and ELISA titres against S, M and E parental native peptides, SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and host cell infection. The same immunological methods that led to identifying new peptides for inclusion in the COLSARSPROT mixture were used for antigenicity studies. Peptides were analysed with serum samples from patients suffering mild or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby increasing chemically-synthesised peptides’ potential coverage for the world populations up to 62.9%. These peptides’ 3D structural analysis (by (1)H-NMR acquired at 600 to 900 MHz) suggested structural-functional immunological association. This first multi-protein, multi-epitope, minimal subunit-based, chemically-synthesised, highly immunogenic peptide mixture highlights such chemical synthesis methodology’s potential for rapidly obtaining very pure, highly reproducible, stable, cheap, easily-modifiable peptides for inducing immune protection against COVID-19, covering a substantial percentage of the human population.","Patarroyo, Manuel E.; Patarroyo, Manuel A.; Alba, Martha P.; Pabon, Laura; Rugeles, María T.; Aguilar-Jimenez, Wbeimar; Florez, Lizdany; Bermudez, Adriana; Rout, Ashok K.; Griesinger, Christian; Suarez, Carlos F.; Aza-Conde, Jorge; Reyes, César; Avendaño, Catalina; Samacá, Jhoan; Camargo, Anny; Silva, Yolanda; Forero, Martha; Gonzalez, Edgardo",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.724060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539660/,139

It was first identified on 8(th)December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has since spread globally to become an emergency of international concern. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms ranging from mild clinical manifestations: such as fever, cough, and sore throat to moderate and severe form of the disease such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In some patients, SARS-CoV-2 can affect the heart and cause myocardial injury which is evidenced either by electrocardiographic (ECG) changes or by a rise in serum troponin level. Patients with myocardial involvement are generally at risk of developing severe illness and tend to have a poor outcome. We hereby present a case of a hypertensive male patient with undiagnosed, asymptomatic COVID-19, who underwent an emergency urologic procedure for ureteric calculi. He eventually sustained a postoperative myocardial injury resulting in his demise. This case highlights the importance of detailed preoperative assessment and anticipation of complications during this global pandemic.","Kassam, Nadeem; Aziz, Omar; Ismail, Ally Zain; Swai, Rodgers; Somji, Samina; Mvungi, Robert; Bapumia, Mustaafa; Zehri, Aliakber; Surani, Salim",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952814/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.36.170.23882,139

661654,Investigation of the Potential Mechanism Governing the Effect of the Shen Zhu San on COVID-19 by Network Pharmacology,2020-11-07,"BACKGROUND: In children, up to 30% of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) develop into bacterial complications associated with pneumonia, sinusitis or otitis media to trigger a tremendous need for antibiotics. This study investigated the efficacy of Echinacea for the prevention of viral RTIs, for the prevention of secondary bacterial complications and for reducing rates of antibiotic prescriptions in children. METHODS: Echinaforce® Junior tablets [400 mg freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea alcoholic extract] or vitamin C [50 mg] as control were given three times daily for prevention to children 4–12 years. Two × 2 months of prevention were separated by a 1-week treatment break. Parents assessed respiratory symptoms in children via e-diaries and collected nasopharyngeal secretions for screening of respiratory pathogens (Allplex® RT-PCR). RESULTS: Overall, 429 cold days occurred in N(ITT) = 103 children with Echinacea in comparison to 602 days in N(ITT) = 98 children with vitamin C (p < 0.001, Chi-square test). Echinacea prevented 32.5% of RTI episodes resulting in an odds ratio of OR = 0.52 [95% CI 0.30–0.91, p = 0.021]. Six children (5.8%) with Echinacea and 15 children (15.3%) with vitamin C required 6 and 24 courses of antibiotic treatment, respectively (reduction of 76.3%, p < 0.001). A total of 45 and 216 days of antibiotic therapy were reported in the two groups, respectively (reduction of 80.2% (p < 0.001). Eleven and 30 events of RTI complications (e.g., otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia) occurred with Echinacea and vitamin C, respectively (p = 0.0030). Echinacea significantly prevented influenza (3 vs. 20 detections, p = 0.012) and enveloped virus infections (29 vs. 47 detections, p = 0.0038). Finally, 76 adverse events occurred with Echinacea and 105 events with vitamin C (p = 0.016), only three events were reported possibly related with Echinacea. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of Echinacea for the prevention of RTIs and reduction of associated antibiotic usage in children.

The first published study reported a 1bp insertion rs11385942 on chromosome 3 (1) and subsequent studies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) such as rs35044562, rs67959919 (2) and rs13078854 (3), all highly correlated with each other. Zeberg and Paabo (4) subsequently traced them back to Neanderthal origin. They found that a 49.4 kb genomic region including the risk allele of rs35044562 is inherited from Neanderthals of Vindija in Croatia. Here we add a differently focused evaluation of this major genetic risk factor to these recent analyses. We show that (i) COVID-19-related genetic factors of three previously assessed Neanderthals deviate from those of modern humans and that (ii) they differ among world-wide human populations, which compromises risk prediction in non-Europeans. Currently, caution is thus advised in the genetic risk assessment of non-Europeans during this world-wide COVID-19 pandemic.","Wohlers, Inken; Calonga-SolÃ­s, VerÃ³nica; Jobst, Jan-Niklas; Busch, Hauke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.365551,139

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: People living in private households and communal establishments in England. PARTICIPANTS: 6 655 672 adults aged ≥70 years (mean 78.8 years, 55.2% women) who were alive on 15 March 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Having received the first dose of a vaccine against COVID-19 by 15 March 2021. We calculated vaccination rates and estimated unadjusted and adjusted ORs using logistic regression models. RESULTS: By 15 March 2021, 93.2% of people living in England aged 70 years and over had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While vaccination rates differed across all factors considered apart from sex, the greatest disparities were seen between ethnic and religious groups. The lowest rates were in people of black African and black Caribbean ethnic backgrounds, where only 67.2% and 73.8% had received a vaccine, with adjusted odds of not being vaccinated at 5.01 (95% CI 4.86 to 5.16) and 4.85 (4.75 to 4.96) times greater than the white British group. The proportion of individuals self-identifying as Muslim and Buddhist who had received a vaccine was 79.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Older age, greater area deprivation, less advantaged socioeconomic position (proxied by living in a rented home), being disabled and living either alone or in a multigenerational household were also associated with higher odds of not having received the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Research is now urgently needed to understand why disparities exist in these groups and how they can best be addressed through public health policy and community engagement.","Nafilyan, Vahe; Dolby, Ted; Razieh, Cameron; Gaughan, Charlotte Hannah; Morgan, Jasper; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Walker, Sarah; Khunti, Kamlesh; Glickman, Myer; Yates, Thomas",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301672/,139

Close contact plays an important role in infection spread, while fomite may also be a possible transmission route. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified long-range airborne transmission as one of the important transmission routes although lack solid evidence. Methods: We examined video data related to a restaurant associated COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou. We observed more than 40,000 surface touches and 13,000 episodes of close contacts in the restaurant during the entire lunch duration. These data allowed us to analyse infection risk via both the fomite and close contact routes. Results: There is no significant correlation between the infection risk via both fomite and close contact routes among those who were not family members of the index case. We can thus rule out virus transmission via fomite contact and interpersonal close contact routes in the Guangzhou restaurant outbreak. The absence of a fomite route agrees with the COVID-19 literature. Conclusions: These results provide indirect evidence for the long-range airborne route dominating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the restaurant. We note that the restaurant was poorly ventilated, allowing for increasing airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration.","Zhang, Nan; Chen, Xuguang; Jia, Wei; Jin, Tianyi; Xiao, Shenglan; Chen, Wenzhao; Hang, Jian; Ou, Cuiyun; Lei, Hao; Qian, Hua; Su, Boni; Li, Jiansen; Liu, Dongmei; Zhang, Weirong; Xue, Peng; Liu, Jiaping; Weschler, Louise B.; Xie, Jingchao; Li, Yuguo; Kang, Min",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062182/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445321002735; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.05.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445321002735?v=s5,139
663775,Models of Integration of Specialized Palliative Care with Oncology,2021-04-08,"The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease is increasing in the United States. Efficacious AUD pharmacotherapies, while available, are, for protean reasons, underutilized. Hepatology providers may be in a position to bridge the pharmacotherapeutic gap between availability and utilization of AUD pharmacotherapies. Our aim was to ascertain the current practice, knowledge and attitudes of hepatology physicians in the United States, and identify opportunities on how to increase AUD medication prescribing. METHODS: A web-based survey, developed by an expert panel, was administered to hepatology physicians working at all transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 131/658 (20%). There was significant support (two-thirds of respondents) for hepatology providers prescribing AUD medications; however, only 1 in 4 was comfortable prescribing these medications. The majority felt additional education is needed to prescribe AUD medications. The practice of hepatology providers prescribing AUD medications is common, with >50% of respondents having done so. Baclofen was the most popular medication prescribed. Hepatology providers perceived suboptimal ancillary addiction services. Although AUD prescribers had higher rates of AUD pharmacotherapy knowledge compared with nonprescribers, approximately 50% still had inadequate knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: AUD medication prescribing is a common practice among hepatology providers who appear eager to increase this practice through more education as they attempt to bridge the pharmacotherapeutic gap.

This systematic review summarises the early literature on clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital, and evaluates the quality of evidence produced during the initial stages of the pandemic. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched for studies published from January 1(st) 2020 to April 28(th) 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 of any age were included. Data on clinical characteristics were independently extracted by two review authors. Study design specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate included studies: the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and cross sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case series and the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS: The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries. The overall quality of included studies was low to moderate, and the majority of studies did not include a control group. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms early in the pandemic. Laboratory and imaging findings were diverse with lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities the most common findings respectively. Clinical data in children and vulnerable populations were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The early Covid-19 literature had moderate to high risk of bias and presented several methodological issues. Early clinical characterisation studies should aim to include different at-risk populations, including patients in non-hospital settings. Pandemic preparedness requires collection tools to ensure observational studies are methodologically robust and will help produce high-quality data early on in the pandemic to guide clinical practice and public health policy.

To effectively manage the outbreak of COVID-19, China established COVID-19 designated and non-designated hospitals. To date, few studies have examined the impacts of COVID-19 on psychological health of staff working at non-designated hospitals. This study is to explore factors affecting psychological health of non-designated hospital staff in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected through an online questionnaire between February and March 2020. The questionnaire consists of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-20), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), sociodemographic characteristics, employment history, health status, and contact history of COVID-19. The questionnaire was distributed through hospital WeChat groups and work colleague referrals. A total of 470 non-designated hospital staff members completed the questionnaire. Multiple Linear Regression analysis was used to interpret the associations among social support, coping styles, sociodemographic factors, job roles, and psychological status. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Results: The non-designated hospital staff differed significantly in anxiety and depression subscores of the GHQ-20 by their job roles, levels of social support, and history of mental disorders. Staff with medical job roles, good self-reported health status, no previous mental disorders, adequate social support, and positive coping styles scored lower in GHQ-20 total score, which indicated healthier psychological status. Conclusions: The results indicate that history of mental health disorders, non-medical job roles, and inadequate social support are associated with greater psychological distress. Personalized support should be provided to those who are vulnerable and in need of social and psychological support.","Yao, Dandan; Lyu, Jihui; Ma, Zongjuan; Champ, Mei; Xiong, Qian; Li, Mo; Li, Wenjie; Mu, Haiyan; Hu, Yueqing; Gao, Wenchao; Jia, Dongmei",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.591026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613337/,139

Background and goals: The aim of the study is to know the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and professional staff of a medium or long-stay hospital during the peak period of the pandemic in Spain, spring 2020. Equipment and methods: At the end of February 2020, we developed at the hospital a strategy to diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infection consisting of complementing the realization of PCR tests at real time with a quick technique of lateral flow immunochromatography to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the virus. We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020. Results: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309 (IC95%:1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (p=0,391), (OR=2,200 IC95 %: 0,500-9,689). Conclusions: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients’ prevalence rate higher than the outpatients’, and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare’s. Combining PCR tests (gold standard) with antibodies tests proved useful as a diagnostic strategy.","Moreno Borraz, LA; Giménez López, M; Vicente Gaspar, C; de la Nieta, F Amorós; Bonafonte Marteles, JL; González Pérez, E; Ortíz Domingo, C; García Forcada, AL; Serrano Herrero, MP; Fernández Doblado, S; Espinosa Val, MC; Fernández Adarve, M; Narvión Carriquiri, A; Arto Maza, F; Barea Gil, A; Aznar Vázquez, I; Sisas Rubio, R; González Tejedor, R; Florentín Ostáriz, E; López Santed, C; Molina Morales, A; Parrilla Binué, S; Sastre Heres, A; Pérez Sans, J; Carrera-Lasfuentes, P; García Mena, M; Moragrega Cardona, B; Luzón Alonso, M; Díaz Mora, F; Gil Acebes, JC; Rubio Morilla, Y; Lou Lou, R; Zabala Lahoz, RB; de Robles, A Coarasa Liron",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0211139X20301803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308845/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2020.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0211139X20301803?v=s5,139

Using the 254 counties of Texas as units of analysis, we utilized multiple linear regression to investigate the influence of 83 county-level predictor variables including race demographics, age, demographics, healthcare and financial status, and prevalence of and mortality rate from COVID-19 risk factors on the incidence rate and case fatality rate from COVID-19 in Texas on September 15, 2020. Here, we report that urban counties experience, on average, 41.1% higher incidence rates from COVID-19 than rural counties and 34.7% lower case fatality rates. Through comparisons between our models, we found that this difference was largely attributable to four major predictor variables: namely, the proportion of elderly residents, African American residents, and Hispanic residents, and the presence of large nursing homes. According to our models, counties with high incidence rates of COVID-19 are predicted to have high proportions of African American residents and Hispanic residents coupled with low proportions of elderly residents. Furthermore, we found that counties with the highest case fatality rates are predicted to have high proportions of elderly residents, obese residents, and Hispanic residents, coupled with low proportions of residents ages 20-39 and residents who report smoking cigarettes. In our study, major variables and their effects on COVID-19 risk are quantified, highlighting the most vulnerable populations and regions of Texas.","Luo, A.

Previous studies have demonstrated risk factors which predict severe infection and mortality however little is known about which risk factors are associated with failure of outpatient management and subsequent admission for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational chart review of patients who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test collected during an ED visit between March 1, 2020 and October 11, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on presence or absence of a subsequent 30-day hospitalization. Clinical and demographic information were collected including chief complaint, triage vital signs and comorbid medical conditions. RESULTS: 1038 patients were seen and discharged from a network ED with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. 94 patients (9.1%) were admitted to a hospital within 30 days of the index ED visit while 944 (90.9%) were not admitted to a network hospital within 30 days. Patients that were admitted were more likely to be older (aOR = 1.04 (95% CI 1.03–1.06)), hypoxic (aOR = 2.16 (95% CI 1.14–4.10)) and tachycardic (aOR = 2.13 (95% CI 1.34–3.38)) on initial ED presentation. Preexisting hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease and malignancy were all highly significant risk factors for 30-day hospital admission following initial ED discharge (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Emergency Department providers should consider age, chief complaint, vital signs and comorbid medical conditions when determining disposition for patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","McKay, Benjamin; Meyers, Matthew; Rivard, Leah; Stoltfus, Jill; Rammohan, Guhan; Stankewicz, Holly",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721007178; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.08.077; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721007178?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537576/,139

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence‐based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. METHOD: Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive‐behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT‐ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. RESULTS: A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT‐ED methods. DISCUSSION: Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence‐based practice. These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.","Waller, Glenn; Pugh, Matthew; Mulkens, Sandra; Moore, Elana; Mountford, Victoria A.; Carter, Jacqueline; Wicksteed, Amy; Maharaj, Aryel; Wade, Tracey D.; Wisniewski, Lucene; Farrell, Nicholas R.; Raykos, Bronwyn; Jorgensen, Susanne; Evans, Jane; Thomas, Jennifer J.; Osenk, Ivana; Paddock, Carolyn; Bohrer, Brittany; Anderson, Kristen; Turner, Hannah; Hildebrandt, Tom; Xanidis, Nikos; Smit, Vera",Int J Eat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383530/,139
668648,COVID-19 vaccine development: What lessons can we learn from TB?,2020-11-30,"Along the U.S. West Coast, sustainable management has rebuilt fish stocks, providing an opportunity to supply nutrient-rich food to adjacent coastal communities where food insecurity and diet-based diseases are common. However, the market has not successfully supplied locally sourced seafood to nutritionally vulnerable people. Rather, a few organizations make this connection on a limited scale. We used a “positive deviant” approach to learn how these organizations’ efforts developed, how they overcame challenges, and what conditions enabled their interventions. We found that organizations in these positive deviant cases provided fish from a wide variety of species and sources, and distributed them through different channels to a diversity of end consumers. A key factor facilitating success was the ability to negotiate a price point that was both profitable and reasonable for organizations supplying nutritionally vulnerable or low-income consumers. Further-more, securing access to grants overcame initial costs of establishing new supply channels. All cases highlighted the importance of individual champions who encouraged development and cultural connections between the initiative and the nearby community. Organizations overcame key challenges by establishing regulations governing these new channels and either using partnerships or vertically integrating to reduce costs associated with processing and transport. Oftentimes training and education were also critical to instruct workers on how to process unfamiliar fish and to increase consumer awareness of local fish and how to prepare them. These lessons illuminate pathways to improve the contribution of local seafood to the healthy food system.","Koehn, J.

669726,Automated Red Cell Exchange in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: Gender-related factors might affect vulnerability to Covid-19. The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization. RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6%) with a mean age of 67.0 ± 14.5 years (vs 67.8 ± 12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134–273] vs 238 mmHg [150–281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7% vs 13.0%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1% in women and 38.1% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.

Due to COVID-19’s spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19.

Despite their popularity, we know little about how makerspaces actually support entrepreneurship and innovation and even less about how they advance the goals of environmental sustainability and social inclusion, particularly in the Canadian context. In an effort to redress these gaps, this paper uses a unique database of makerspaces, complemented with findings from in-depth case studies, to examine the practices of makerspaces in southern Ontario (Canada). Our study finds that while makerspaces offer access to technologies and basic skills training, we find limited evidence that makerspaces generate the promised economic or social outcomes so often attributed to them. Moreover, we find very limited evidence that makerspaces actively seek to be socially inclusive in their membership and programming or encourage environmentally sustainable practices. In other words, the potential of makerspaces, in their current form, to contribute to more inclusive and sustainable forms of local economic and community development is not yet fully realized.","Vinodrai, Tara; Nader, Brenton; Zavarella, Christian",Local Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650320/; https://doi.org/10.1177/02690942211013532,139

The study about features of this infection could be very helpful in better knowledge about this infectious disease. The current systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed to estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic review using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar has been conducted. In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, the articles published in the period January 1, 2020, to April 2, 2020, written in English and reporting clinical symptoms of COVID-19 was reviewed. To assess, the presence of heterogeneity, the Cochran’s Q statistic, the I(2) index, and the tau-squared test were used. Because of significant heterogeneity between the studies the random-effects model with 95% CI was used to calculate the pooled estimation of each symptom prevalence. RESULTS: The most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients include: Fever 81.2% (95% CI: 77.9-84.4); Cough: 58.5% (95% CI: 54.2-62.8); Fatigue 38.5% (95% CI: 30.6-45.3); Dyspnea: 26.1% (95% CI: 20.4-31.8); and the Sputum: 25.8% (95% CI: 21.1-30.4). Based on the meta-regression results, the sample size used in different studies did not have a significant effect on the final estimate value (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the main symptoms of COVID-19 such as Fever, Cough, Fatigue, and Dyspnea can have a key role in early detection of this disease and prevent the transmission of the disease to other people.","ALIMOHAMADI, YOUSEF; SEPANDI, MOJTABA; TAGHDIR, MARYAM; HOSAMIRUDSARI, HADISEH",J Prev Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150219/; https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2020.61.3.1530,139

Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called ‘COVID-19’, as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.","Albahri, A.

However, their public health role is often overlooked. Objectives The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss the roles and the coping mechanisms of community pharmacists working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. Methods A cross-sectional study, using an electronic survey, was conducted to assess the community pharmacists' response during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Puerto Rico. Two open-ended questions explored community pharmacist's opinions about the pharmacist's role and coping mechanisms during the pandemic. The responses were analyzed following an inductive thematic analysis. Two major themes emerged from their responses: professional and personal experiences. Results Of the 302 participants who completed the survey, 77% of them answered one or both open-ended questions. The answers were diverse, and the respondents went beyond the specific topics asked. In professional experiences, important roles as educators and providing continuity of care and emotional support to their patients were highlighted. They also expressed concerns and frustrations on the profession's shortcomings, feeling overworked yet with a lack of recognition. In personal experiences, most of the respondents were concerned about the impact of having to juggle work and home life. They also reported mental health concerns, expressing feeling stressed, overworked, and worried about the constant risk of exposure and fear of exposing their loved ones. Conclusion Community pharmacists in Puerto Rico ensured the continuation of care, provided education, and managed anxious and stressed patients. Most relied on family members to cope with the extra burden that the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of recognition created resentfulness among participants. It is essential to listen to our community pharmacists' voices to support and respond to their needs and learn from their experiences as front-line health care workers.","Silva-Suarez, Georgina; Reyes, Yarelis Alvarado; Hernandez-Diaz, Ana; Ramirez, Keysha Rodriguez; Colón-Pratts, Frances M.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366289/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.07.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319121003149?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319121003149,139
675271,Ischemic stroke associated with novel coronavirus 2019: a report of three cases,2020-06-17,"BACKGROUND: As Scotland strives to become a country where children flourish in their early years, it is faced with the challenge of socio-economic health inequalities, which are at risk of widening amidst austerity policies. The aim of this study was to explore trends in infant mortality rates (IMR) and stillbirth rates by socio-economic position (SEP) in Scotland, between 2000 and 2018, inclusive. METHODS: Data for live births, infant deaths, and stillbirths between 2000 and 2018 were obtained from National Records of Scotland. Annual IMR and stillbirth rates were calculated and visualised for all of Scotland and when stratified by SEP. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the association between SEP and infant mortality and stillbirth events, and to assess for break points in trends over time. The slope (SII) and relative (RII) index of inequality compared absolute and relative socio-economic inequalities in IMR and stillbirth rates before and after 2010. RESULTS: IMR fell from 5.7 to 3.2 deaths per 1000 live births between 2000 and 2018, with no change in trend identified. Stillbirth rates were relatively static between 2000 and 2008 but experienced accelerated reduction from 2009 onwards. When stratified by SEP, inequalities in IMR and stillbirth rates persisted throughout the study and were greatest amongst the sub-group of post-neonates. Although comparison of the SII and RII in IMR and stillbirths before and after 2010 suggested that inequalities remained stable, descriptive trends in mortality rates displayed a 3-year rise in the most deprived quintiles from 2016 onwards. CONCLUSION: Whilst Scotland has experienced downward trends in IMR and stillbirth rates between 2000 and 2018, the persistence of socio-economic inequalities and suggestion that mortality rates amongst the most deprived groups may be worsening warrants further action to improve maternal health and strengthen support for families with young children.","Harpur, Alice; Minton, Jon; Ramsay, Julie; McCartney, Gerry; Fenton, Lynda; Campbell, Harry; Wood, Rachael",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044796/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10928-0,139
675458,Four moments for healthcare facility visitor hand hygiene,2020-08-16,"BACKGROUND: : Universal admission screening for SARS-CoV-2 in children and their caregivers (CG) is critical to prevent hospital outbreaks. We evaluated pooled SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (AG) to identify infectious individuals while waiting for PCR test results. METHODS: : This single-center study was performed from November 5, 2020 to March 1, 2021. Nasal mid-turbinate and oropharyngeal swabbing for AG and PCR testing was performed in children with two individual swabs that were simultaneously inserted. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from their CG. AG swabs were pooled in a single extraction buffer tube and PCR swabs in a single viral medium. Results from an adult population were used for comparison, as no pooled testing was performed. FINDINGS: : During the study period, 710 asymptomatic children and their CG were admitted. Pooled AG sensitivity and specificity was 75% and 99.4% respectively for detection of infectious individuals. Four false negatives were observed, though three out of four false negative child-CG pairs were not considered infectious at admission. Unpooled AG testing in an adult population showed a comparable sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 99.7%. AG performed significantly better in samples with lower Ct values in the corresponding PCR (32.3 vs 21, p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: : Pooled SARS-CoV-2 AGs are an effective method to identify potentially contagious individuals prior admission, without adding additional strain to the child.","Reichert, Friedrich; Enninger, Axel; Plecko, Thomas; Zoller, Wolfram G.; Paul, Gregor",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655321004843; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314758/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655321004843?v=s5,139

I develop a behavioral dynamic epidemic model for multifaceted policy analysis comprising endogenous virus transmission (from severe or mild/asymptomatic cases), social contacts, and case testing and reporting. Calibration of the system dynamics model to the ongoing outbreak (31 December 2019–15 May 2020) using multiple time series data (reported cases and deaths, performed tests, and social interaction proxies) from six countries (South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, and the United States) informs an explanatory analysis of outbreak responses and postpeak strategies. Specifically, I demonstrate, first, how timing and efforts of testing‐capacity expansion and social‐contact reduction interplay to affect outbreak dynamics and can explain a large share of cross‐country variation in outbreak pathways. Second, absent at‐scale availability of pharmaceutical solutions, postpeak social contacts must remain well below prepandemic values. Third, proactive (targeted) interventions, when complementing general deconfinement readiness, can considerably increase admissible postpeak social contacts. © 2020 System Dynamics Society","Struben, Jeroen",Syst Dyn Rev,https://doi.org/10.1002/sdr.1660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041496/,139

This study investigated disturbances to working life and mental health among Americans aged ≥55 during early months of the pandemic. METHODS: Using data from the nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study (N=6,264), we examined rates of job loss, furloughs, hour/income reductions, and work-from-home, along with unchanged work status, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. We next described sources of worry by job transition group and tested the adjusted associations of COVID-19-related job transitions with life satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Most job loss occurred among respondents under age 65 and those without college degrees. Job loss and reduced hours/income were more common among Hispanics compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and work-from-home transitions were most common among respondents with high educational attainment and jobs in government- and education-related occupations. Workers who lost their jobs had the lowest life satisfaction and the highest loneliness and depressive symptoms, followed by workers who were furloughed and workers with reduced hours/income. Work-from-home was associated with more anxiety than unchanged work. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related job transitions are detrimental to mental health, even when they might keep workers safe. These results enhance our understanding of the potentially long-term mental health effects of social and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for economic and mental health support for aging Americans.","Abrams, Leah R; Finlay, Jessica M; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837416/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab060,139

People are forced to conduct various activities at home using mobile devices (MDs) as a result of the outbreak. In this case, prolonged use of MDs is the major cause for work-related health problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used systematic cluster random sampling to sample a diverse group of Indians from India's various states. Subjects filled out a questionnaire with questions about their demographics, MDs usage and musculoskeletal symptoms (MSSs) faced. The relationship between MSSs and various factors was investigated using χ2 and binomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: An online survey yielded 720 responses. More than half of employees registered MSSs in their upper body regions. Age, gender and MD usage were correlated with MSSs in various body regions. According to the binomial logistic regression findings, gender was significantly linked to MSSs in each body region.

However, due to the packed major schedule and curriculum, many students are not required to take additional foreign language courses for their associate degree. Based on the lens of social cognitive career theory, the researcher sought to understand the motivations and reasons behind the learning behaviours. One research question was guided in this study, which was, what are the motivations and reasons for taking foreign language courses beyond their (i.e., nursing students) major curriculum and coursework plan? A qualitative research method was employed to collect interview data from 60 nursing students. The finding of this study indicated that the interest in career development and personal consideration were two of the most important factors for foreign language learning for these groups of nursing students. The results of this study provided recommendations for college leaders, government agencies, and policymakers to reform and polish foreign language courses and offer directions to contemporary students of the nursing curriculum. Students may also be benefitted as the study outlined the motivations and reasons for foreign language learning.

681461,Diagnosis and Management of Cognitive Concerns in the Oldest-Old,2021-03-26,"The multifold benefits of regular physical exercise have been largely demonstrated in human and animal models. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of physical activity, both in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system (CNS). Regular exercise improves cognition, brain plasticity, neurogenesis and reduces the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, making timeless the principle of “mens sana in corpore sano” (i.e., a healthy mind in a healthy body). Physical exercise promotes morphological and functional changes in the brain, acting not only in neurons but also in astrocytes, which represent the most numerous glial cells in the brain. The multiple effects of exercise on astrocytes comprise the increased number of new astrocytes, the maintenance of basal levels of catecholamine, the increase in glutamate uptake, the major release of trophic factors and better astrocytic coverage of cerebral blood vessels. The purpose of this review is to highlight the effects of exercise on brain function, emphasize the role of astrocytes in the healthy CNS, and provide an update for a better understanding of the effects of physical exercise in the modulation of astrocyte function.","Maugeri, Grazia; D’Agata, Velia; Magrì, Benedetta; Roggio, Federico; Castorina, Alessandro; Ravalli, Silvia; Di Rosa, Michelino; Musumeci, Giuseppe",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207393/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10061542,139

Using mobile phone data from 1.2 million devices in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19 crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity, mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively, while circadian rhythms tended to synchronize. In particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tended to restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is reduced by 1 h. We interpret and discuss these findings as signals for underlying social, biological and psychological gender differences when coping with crisis and taking risks.","Reisch, Tobias; Heiler, Georg; Hurt, Jan; Klimek, Peter; Hanbury, Allan; Thurner, Stefan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584107/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97394-1,139

Viral antigen was demonstrated and infectious JHM virus could be recovered from one animal which developed clinical signs at 3 months a.i. In one animal with clinical onset of 8 months a.i., completely remyelinated areas as well as recent demyelinating lesions were observed, suggesting a recurrence of the disease process. Remyelinated areas were also found in 40% of clinically silent animals. The morphology of the late onset of the demyelination was similar to that occurring in SDE. Remyelination consisted of both CNS and PNS-type.

On 30 January 2020, the WHO classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with four widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than one symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, n=641), while anxiety the least (7.1%, n=69). After adjustment for confounders, it is found that dental practitioners with pre-existing physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (OR, 1.972; 95%CI, 1.128∼3.448; p=0.017), and perceived stress (OR, 2.397 95%CI, 1.283∼4.478; p=0.006).

The VACO Index was initially developed and validated in a nationwide cohort of US veterans—we now assess its accuracy in an academic medical centre and a nationwide US Medicare cohort. METHODS: With measures and weights previously derived and validated in US national Veterans Health Administration (VA) inpatients and outpatients (n=13 323), we evaluated the accuracy of the VACO Index for estimating 30-day all-cause mortality using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots of predicted versus observed mortality in inpatients at a single US academic medical centre (n=1307) and in Medicare inpatients and outpatients aged 65+ (n=427 224). RESULTS: 30-day mortality varied by data source: VA 8.5%, academic medical centre 17.5%, Medicare 16.0%. The VACO Index demonstrated similar discrimination in VA (AUC=0.82) and academic medical centre inpatient population (AUC=0.80), and when restricted to patients aged 65+ in VA (AUC=0.69) and Medicare inpatient and outpatient data (AUC=0.67). The Index modestly overestimated risk in VA and Medicare data and underestimated risk in Yale New Haven Hospital data. CONCLUSIONS: The VACO Index estimates risk of short-term mortality across a wide variety of patients with COVID-19 using data available prior to or at the time of diagnosis. The VACO Index could help inform primary and booster vaccination prioritisation, and indicate who among outpatients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 should receive greater clinical attention or scarce treatments.","King, Jr., Joseph T; Yoon, James S; Bredl, Zachary M; Habboushe, Joseph P; Walker, Graham A; Rentsch, Christopher T; Tate, Janet P; Kashyap, Nitu M; Hintz, Richard C; Chopra, Aneesh P; Justice, Amy C",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583962/,139

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 669 positive Covid-19 patients within a cohort of 502,536 UK Biobank participants, recruited between 2006 and 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. We also assessed risk factors for inpatient and outpatient status for Covid-19 positive individuals. RESULTS: We found that black participants were at over three times increased risk of testing positive for Covid-19, relative to white participants, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28 to 4.31). Asian participants were also at higher risk of Covid-19 (ARR 2.03, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.95). Next, we analyzed the association of comorbidities with Covid-19. We found that participants were at increased risk of Covid-19 if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ARR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.31) or ischemic heart disease (ARR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.07). However, there was no evidence that either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARR 1.37, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.98) increased the risk of Covid-19. We confirmed that blood type A was associated with Covid-19 relative to blood type O individuals, and we also found that the HLA variant DQA1_509 was enriched in Covid-19 positive cases, even after Bonferroni correction (P = 1.0 × 10(−5)). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that black and Asian participants were at increased risk of Covid-19, even after adjusting for confounders. We also identified a novel genetic association with the HLA variant DQA1_509. Further investigations of genetic associations with Covid-19 may lead to important discoveries of genetic drivers of severe disease.","Kolin, David A.; Kulm, Scott; Elemento, Olivier",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20075507; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.05.20075507v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511589/,139
686956,Secondary Causes of Myositis,2020-10-06,"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and an effective vaccine is needed. During the outbreak, the urgency for developing candidate vaccines has brought distinct challenges to clinical development. An efficacy trial, which measures whether the vaccine reduces the incidence of disease, is ordinarily required to fully evaluate vaccine efficacy. However, emergency use may be possible if promising immunogenicity results are observed. A ring vaccination trial, which recruits subjects connected to a known case either socially or geographically, is a solution to evaluate vaccine efficacy and control the spread of the disease simultaneously although its conduct is challenging. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 becomes a recurrent epidemic, an ‘individual-level’ efficacy trial is preferred. Innovative statistical designs, including seamless design, platform trial, master protocol design, are helpful to accelerate clinical development. A seamless Phase I/II design has been applied in multiple COVID-19 vaccine studies to date. However, Phase II/III design should be done very carefully. The control of type I error, maintaining trial blinding and statistical methods leading to unbiased estimates should be pre-specified in the clinical protocol. A Data Safety Monitoring Board is especially important, given the need to assure an adequate level of safety when society want a safe and effective vaccine.","Jiang, Zhiwei; Wang, Xuanyi; Xia, Jielai",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1815489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991223/,139
687589,Abstract No. 526 Role of interventional radiology in a pandemic,2021-05-31,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic is associated with a heavy burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anticancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay. A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced a delay in lung cancer treatment during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Patients with a treatment delay received significantly more immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy than patients without a treatment delay (P = 0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular targeted agents experienced a treatment delay during the COVID‐19 pandemic period (P = 0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed at their request. We determined that 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested a treatment delay during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Oncologists should bear in mind that patients with cancer have more anxiety than expected under unprecedented circumstances such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Fujita, Kohei; Ito, Takanori; Saito, Zentaro; Kanai, Osamu; Nakatani, Koichi; Mio, Tadashi",Thorac Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790028/,139
688872,Viral Findings in Adult Hematological Patients with Neutropenia,2012-05-03,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During virus infection, several pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced, leading to the “cytokine storm.” Among these, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and IL-1β seem to have a central role in the progression and exacerbation of the disease, leading to the recruitment of immune cells to infection sites. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway involved in different aspects of lymphocytes functionality. The involvement of IL-6, TNF‐α, and IL-1β in autophagy modulation has recently been demonstrated. Moreover, preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect lymphocytes, playing a role in the modulation of autophagy. Several anti-rheumatic drugs, now proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, could modulate autophagy in lymphocytes, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vomero, Marta; Barbati, Cristiana; Colasanti, Tania; Celia, Alessandra Ida; Speziali, Mariangela; Ucci, Federica Maria; Ciancarella, Claudia; Conti, Fabrizio; Alessandri, Cristiano",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.569849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424586/,139
690785,Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses pre- and post- COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure: an observational case-control study,2020-12-11,"Human infection challenge studies (HCS) have been proposed as a means to accelerate SARS-CoV2 vaccine development and thereby help to mitigate a prolonged global public health crisis. A key criterion for the ethical acceptability of SARS-CoV2 HCS is that potential benefits outweigh risks. Although the assessment of risks and benefits is meant to be a standard part of research ethics review, systematic comparisons are particularly important in the context of SARS-CoV2 HCS in light of the significant potential benefits and harms at stake as well as the need to preserve public trust in research and vaccines. In this paper we explore several considerations that should inform systematic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 HCS. First, we detail key potential benefits of SARS-CoV-2 HCS including, but not limited to, those related to the acceleration of vaccine development. Second, we identify where modelling is needed to inform risk-benefit (and thus ethical) assessments. Modelling will be particularly useful in (i) comparing potential benefits and risks of HCS with those of vaccine field trials under different epidemiological conditions and (ii) estimating marginal risks to HCS participants in light of the background probabilities of infection in their local community. We highlight interactions between public health policy and research priorities, including situations in which research ethics assessments may need to strike a balance between competing considerations.","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Heriot, George S.; Selgelid, Michael J.",J Bioeth Inq,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10030-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840856/,139
