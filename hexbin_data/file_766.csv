33283,Labelling or packaging variation implementation time extended,2020-05-30,"In the Online-Dial-a-Ride Problem (OLDARP) a server travels to serve requests for rides. We consider a variant where each request specifies a source, destination, release time, and revenue that is earned for serving the request. The goal is to maximize the total revenue earned within a given time limit. We prove that no non-preemptive deterministic online algorithm for OLDARP can be guaranteed to earn more than half the revenue earned by [Formula: see text]. We then investigate the segmented best path ([Formula: see text]) algorithm of [8] for the general case of weighted graphs. The previously-established lower and upper bounds for the competitive ratio of [Formula: see text] are 4 and 6, respectively, under reasonable assumptions about the input instance. We eliminate the gap by proving that the competitive ratio is 5 (under the same assumptions). We also prove that when revenues are uniform, [Formula: see text] has competitive ratio 4. Finally, we provide a competitive analysis of [Formula: see text] on complete bipartite graphs.","Christman, Ananya; Chung, Christine; Jaczko, Nicholas; Li, Tianzhi; Westvold, Scott; Xu, Xinyue; Yuen, David",Combinatorial Algorithms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254915/,766
34307,Medsafe: potentially fatal adverse effects with Miracle Mineral Solution,2020-06-13,"Edible packaging is influenced by factors such as formulation, production technology, and solvent and additive properties. With the increase in the request for coating and film quality, appropriate form, and high product safety and storage period, various technologies such as high hydrostatic pressure, irradiation, ultrasound, high-pressure homogenization, cold plasma, and microwave have been reviewed. The present study states definitions and mechanisms of novel technologies. The experimental condition, packaging matrix, and the results pertaining to the effects of these technologies on various types of edible packaging is also discussed. The most of the matrix used for packaging was whey protein, soy protein isolate, chitosan, and gelatin. The technologies conditions such as power, frequency, time, temperature, dose, pressure, and voltage can have a significant influence on the application of them in film and coating. Therefore, finding the optimum point for the features of the technologies is important because improper use of them reduces the properties of the edible packaging.","Beikzadeh, Samira; Ghorbani, Marjan; Shahbazi, Nayyer; Izadi, Farzaneh; Pilevar, Zahra; Mortazavian, Amir Mohammad",Food Eng Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7280782/,766
35916,EMA issues recommendations on impurities in medicines,2020-07-04,"Technological innovation is transforming traditional clinical practice, enabling people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) to contribute health care outcome data remotely between clinic visits. In both relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), patients may experience variable disability accrual and symptoms throughout their disease course. The potential impact on the quality of life (QoL) in pwMS and their families and carers is profound. The introduction of treatment targets, such as NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) and NEPAD (no evidence of progression or active disease), that guide clinical decision-making, highlight the importance of utilizing sensitive instruments to measure and track disease activity and progression. However, the gold standard neurological disability tool—expanded disability severity scale (EDSS)—has universally recognized limitations. With strides made in our understanding of MS pathophysiology and DMT responsiveness, maintaining the status quo of measuring disability progression is no longer the recommended option. Outside the clinical trial setting, a comprehensive monitoring system has not been robustly established for pwMS. A 21st-century approach is required to integrate clinical, paraclinical, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from electronic health records, local databases, and patient registries. Patient and public involvement (PPI) is critical in the design and implementation of this workflow. To take full advantage of the potential of digital technology in the monitoring and care and QoL of pwMS will require iterative feedback between pwMS, health care professionals (HCPs), scientists, and digital experts.","Allen-Philbey, Kimberley; Middleton, Rod; Tuite-Dalton, Katie; Baker, Elaine; Stennett, Andrea; Albor, Christo; Schmierer, Klaus",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325931/,766
39057,In utero exposure to influenza vaccine not associated with ASD in children,2020-09-12,"BACKGROUND: Increasing cases of pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompetent patients with severe influenza have been reported. Howevere, the risk factors for occurence and death are largely unknown. METHODS: Data of hospitalised patients with influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) obtained from five teaching hospitals from 2031 to 2018, were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to determine the risk factors involved in the acquisition and 60-day mortality in IPA patients. RESULTS: Of the 693 FluA-p patients included in the study, 3.0% (21/693) were IPA patients with a 60-day mortality of 42.9% (9/21). Adjusted for confounders, a Cox proportional hazard model showed that IPA was associated with increased risk for 60-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.336, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.191–15.784, p = 0.026] in FluA-p patients. A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed that age (odd ratio (OR) 1.147, 95% CI 1.048–1.225, p = 0.003), systemic corticosteroids use before IPA diagnosis (OR 33.773, 95% CI 5.681–76.764, p < 0.001), leukocytes > 10 × 10(9)/L (OR 1.988, 95% CI 1.028–6.454, p = 0.029) and lymphocytes < 0.8 × 10(9)/L on admission (OR 34.813, 95% CI 1.676–73.006, p = 0.022), were related with the acquisition of IPA. Early neuraminidase inhibitor use (OR 0.290, 95% CI 0.002–0.584, p = 0.021) was associated with a decreased risk for a 60-day mortality in IPA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that IPA worsen the clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients. The risk factors for the acquisition and death were helpful for the clinicians in preventing and treating IPA.","Chen, Liang; Han, Xiudi; Li, Yanli; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xing, Xiqian",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479745/,766

43040,Other adverse reaction research,2020-12-05,"Background: Certain riboviruses can cause severe pulmonary complications leading to death in some infected patients. We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N1), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","Rogan, Peter K.; Mucaki, Eliseos J.; Shirley, Ben C.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676395/,766
44232,Other adverse reaction research,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild to severe disease and death. We aim to construct a simple and novel scoring model that will predict mortality events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We established a retrospective cohort of 2541 patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 19, 2020 to April 28, 2020 to Henry Ford Health System, MI. Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, and clinical data were collected. Our novel SAS score was constructed using 3 easily available parameters, namely Sex, Age, and Oxygen Saturation at presentation (Table 1 and 2). Primary endpoint was mortality. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was done and the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with area under ROC (AUROC) to determine the optimal cutoff for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 61 compared to 75 years for non-survivors (standard deviation 16 vs 13.8, p< 0.0001), and 1298 (51.1%) were men. Multivariate analysis of the SAS score adjusted for modified SOFA [Sequential organ failure assessment] score (mSOFA) showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval {CI} 2.04–2.72, p< 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.27–1.98) were the most significant predictors of mortality in the model. The SAS score had an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.77–0.81) (Figure 1). A cutoff score of 3 offered the most sensitivity for predicting mortality while maintaining a negative predictive value of 95% (Table 3). Comparison of AUROC shows that SAS score adjusted to mSOFA has better diagnostic information compared to either SAS score or mSOFA alone (Figure 2). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The easy to use SAS score at time of presentation identified hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for mortality. Application of the SAS score in the emergency department may help triage patients to inpatient versus outpatient care.

The arrival of COVID-19 has changed the provision and delivery of transportation services. This chapter specifically focuses on the anticipated post-pandemic changing nature of the service and service industries with particular reference to the Nigerian transport industry and its post-pandemic outlook. Nigeria, a developing country with existing underlying economic challenges, weak transportation infrastructures, and a growing population, faces a multitude of challenges adjusting to the ‘new normal’ post-pandemic. This chapter contributes to the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on developing countries; it presents the opportunities and inherent challenges for services providers, service design and service quality and improvement. The study recognises the impact of poor infrastructure on transportation and ardently on transport services provision and service system and process. Managerial implications for government, policymakers and transport services providers were also provided. Transportation service providers also need to redesign and co-create value in their services in recognition of an immediate transition of service processes, effectively communicate and engage with the customer through social media and other platforms and ensuring technology-enabled customer encounters.","Mogaji, Emmanuel; Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Nguyen, Nguyen Phong","The Future of Service Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Volume 1",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869958/,766

Unfortunately, contrary to the recommendations of WHO and health authorities, in Brazil the use of Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SarsCov‐2 has been approved. METHOD: We selected guidelines with recommendations for treatment of Covid 19, with an emphasis on the proposed treatments. Then we evaluate the main drug interactions and their potential risks. RESULT: The risk of using Hydroxychloroquine in patients with Alzheimer's Disease is high, both due to the aspect of the disease itself, but also due to the drug interactions found.

52572,Other adverse reaction research,2021-05-08,"Introduction: The high prevalence of vitamin D (vitD) deficiency in the general population is well recognized. Evidence suggests an immunomodulatory role for vitD in pro-inflammatory conditions, but doubt remains on its association with the severity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory infection (RI). Aim: To assess the impact of vitD status on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 RI in adults. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study that included adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 until 1/14/2020 was performed. Patients taking calcium, vitD supplementation or antiepileptics, with malabsorptive and/or calcium and phosphate metabolic disorders or stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease were excluded. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were obtained at the time of RI diagnosis. The participants were divided into 2 groups, depending on the vitD status (sufficiency and insufficiency [≥20 ng/mL]; deficiency [<20 ng/mL]), and in 3 groups of clinical severity of RI (adapted from the update [14/10/2020] of the standard 004/2020 of the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health): mild/moderate disease (g1); severe disease without bacterial coinfection (g2); severe disease with bacterial coinfection/critical disease (g3). Other factors associated with RI severity were analyzed. A multiple logistic regression model was developed to predict the severity of SARS-CoV-2 RI, considering vitD status as a categorical variable and other variables with statistical significance after univariate analysis. Results: This study encompassed 71 infected patients with a median age of 68 (p25;p75 = 58;77) years, 40 (56.3%) of which were women. 32 (45.1%) patients integrated g1, 14 (19.7%) g2 and 25 (35.2%) g3. 39 (54.9%) presented vitD deficiency and 32 (45.1%) vitD sufficiency or insufficiency. In the univariate analysis, vitD deficiency, age (>60 years old), male gender, Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonist and reduced levels of ionized serum calcium correlated with the severity of RI. In the multivariate regression model that included these variables, vitD deficiency remained independently correlated with critical/severe disease with bacterial coinfection (g3 vs. g1: OR=9.7; CI95%=[1.7; 56.4]; p=0.011; g3 vs. g2: OR=6.3; CI95%=[1.1–37.0]; p=0.044), with a tendency, albeit not statistically significant, for severe RI without bacterial coinfection (g2 vs g1: OR=1.6; CI95%=[0.3; 7.4]; p=0.581). Conclusions: An independent association of vitD deficiency with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 RI was found, supporting the anti-inflammatory effects of vitD. It is essential to identify and treat its deficiency in patients prone to adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 RI.","Silva, José Diogo; Rouxinol-Dias, Ana; Rocha, Gustavo Melo; Correia, Sara; Almeida, Lúcia; Alves, Helena; Oliveira, Maria João",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090369/,766
54338,Systemic corticosteroids may trigger phaeochromocytoma crisis,2021-06-12,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of concussion symptoms is a key element in management of sport-related concussions (SRC). The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased reports of anxiety and depression in the general population, though it is unknown if this increase has also affected reporting of concussion symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences in reporting of concussion symptoms in adolescents who sustained an SRC before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Subjects (n = 707) aged 12–18 with SRC were evaluated within 14 days of injury (M = 5.64 days, SD = 3.68) at a North Texas Concussion Registry (ConTex) clinic and completed the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 (SCAT-5) Symptom Evaluation. Subjects were grouped by those evaluated before (n = 625) or after (n = 82) March 23, 2020 and were similar in age, sex, and history of treatment for anxiety or depression. T-tests were used to compare the number of endorsed concussion symptoms and symptom severity between groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in number of concussion symptoms endorsed (M = 10.81, SD = 6.53 vs M = 11.35, SD = 6.25, p = 0.463) or symptom severity (M = 28.33, SD = 24.14, M = 26.79, SD = 20.91, p = 0.540) between before vs during COVID-19 SRC groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of young athletes, results suggest that despite effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on community mental health, we did not see evidence of a systematic influence on SRC symptom reporting during the pandemic.","SC, Bunt; C, Presley; T, Tarkenton; K, Wilmoth; N, Didehbani; M, Stokes; SM, Miller; K, Bell; H, Batjer; CM, Cullum",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194515/,766

Only certain microorganisms are able to synthetize B12, thus humans obtain cobalamin exclusively from their diet, specifically from animal-derived foods. Specific sub-group populations are at risk of vitamin B12 subclinical deficiency due to different factors including poor intake of animal source foods and age-dependent decrease in the capacity of intestinal B12 uptake. Consumption of animal products produces some negative health issues and negatively impacts sustainability while a plant-based diet increases the risk of B12 deficiency.

The effect of female labor force status on couples' marital satisfaction, as one of the main factors for evaluating marital quality, has been separately discussed, including extensive margins considering whether women are in the labor market and intensive margins on women working hours per week. This study analyzed data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) using a binary logit model and a stability test. Results showed that the work hours, rather than the occupational status, of women affect marital satisfaction. In addition, regardless of the gender role attitudes held by the couple, marital satisfaction increases when women are in the labor market. This study has retroactively reviewed the effects of women working outside the home on marital quality. The dual roles of Chinese women, as both employee and homemaker, have been socially accepted. However, the requirements of maintaining multiple roles often contradict and present conflicts among the roles, time, and pressure, in the long run, giving rise to marital dissatisfaction.","Yu, Xiao; Liu, Shu",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343394/,766

Recent years have seen swift growth and popularisation of the coworking model, making these spaces an integral part of local entrepreneurial ecosystems and transforming them into the localised pools of specialised talent. However, little research has been conducted to understand the role of human talent in coworking spaces, indicating a knowledge gap in human resource management and the role of contemporary coworking environments.

Design This quantitative, self-administered questionnaire study was conducted across three National Health Service hospitals. Data were collected from three other cohorts; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), colonic polyp surveillance and healthy individuals. Fisher's exact and Spearman's rank correlation tests were used for analysis. Propensity score matching adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results 687 participants were eligible for analysis (NDBO n=306, DBO n=49, GORD n=132, colonic polyps n=152 and healthy n=48). 53% of NDBO participants reported similarly high cancer worry, comparable to DBO (50%, p=0.933) and colonic polyp participants (51%, p=0.355). Less cancer worry was reported in GORD participants (43.4%, p=0.01 vs NDBO). NDBO participants reported anxiety in 15.8% and depression in 8.6% of cases, which was similar to the other disease cohorts. Moderate or severe heartburn or acid regurgitation was found in 11% and 10%, respectively, in the NDBO cohort, comparable to DBO participants (heartburn 2% p=0.172, acid regurgitation 4% p=0.31) but lower (better) than GORD participants (heartburn 31% p=<0.001, acid regurgitation 25% p=0.001).

However, such models are based on meagre data and limited biological understanding. We evaluate the accuracy of various models from recent pandemics (SARS, MERS and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) as a guide to whether we can trust the early model predictions for COVID-19. We show that early models can have good predictive power for a disease's first wave, but they are less predictive of the possibility of a second wave or its strength. The models with the highest accuracy tended to include stochasticity, and models developed for a particular geographic region are often applicable in other regions. It follows that mathematical models developed early in a pandemic can be useful for long-term predictions, at least during the first wave, and they should include stochastic variations, to represent unknown characteristics inherent in the earliest stages of all pandemics.","Costris-Vas, Christian; Schwartz, Elissa J; Smith, Robert",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378907/,766

248488,Antineoplastics,2021,"The current rise of protectionism has become the main uncertainty associated with global energy, economy, and the environment. Furthermore, the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth is crucial for implementing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). These INDCs would be discounted if decreasing carbon emissions would require sacrificing economic growth. This study explored the effect of protectionism (by measuring trade openness based on available data) on the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth. For this, the heterogenous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions were investigated using in data of 182 countries from 1990 to 2015. The results show that trade openness decreased carbon emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, while having no significant impact on carbon emissions of lower-middle-income countries; even worse, for low-income countries, trade openness increased carbon emissions. The heterogeneous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions indicate that trade openness positively impacts the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission in rich countries, but negatively impacts poor countries. In addition, increasing individual incomes and population distort the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. Renewable energy and high oil prices contributed to the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. These effects are similar in all countries. Targeted policy implications are presented that enable the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions for countries with different income levels.","Wang, Qiang; Zhang, Fuyu",J Clean Prod,,766

369324,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a COVID-19 recovered patient: unravelling an infective sequalae of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,2021,"In the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is infecting a naïve population. The innate immunity of the infected patient is unable to mount an effective defense, resulting in a severe illness with substantial morbidity and mortality. As most treatment modalities including antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents are mostly ineffective, an immunological approach is needed. The mechanism of innate immunity to this viral illness is not fully understood. Passive immunity becomes an important avenue for the management of these patients. In this article, the immune responses of COVID-19 patients are reviewed. As SARS-CoV-2 has many characteristics in common with two other viruses, SARS-CoV that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the experiences learned from the use of passive immunity in treatment can be applied to COVID-19. The immune response includes the appearance of immunoglobulin M followed by immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies. Convalescent plasma obtained from patients recovered from the illness with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was successful in treating many COVID-19 patients. The factors that determine responses as compared with those seen in SARS and MERS are also reviewed. As there are no approved vaccines against all three viruses, it remains a challenge in the ongoing development for an effective vaccine for COVID-19.","Lindholm, Paul F; Ramsey, Glenn; Kwaan, Hau C",Semin Thromb Hemost,,766
465886,Respiratory physiotherapy in patients with COVID-19 infection in acute setting: a Position Paper of the Italian Association of Respiratory Physiotherapists (ARIR),2020,"Although the cancellation of elective procedures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has been a vital precaution, it has resulted in the suspension of aesthetic procedures and surgeries worldwide. Consequently, this postponement and other factors might have a negative impact on patients planning to undergo aesthetic procedures. Understanding the changes in patient motivation and perception in comparison to the prepandemic period is imperative for proper adjustment of plastic surgery clinics.A prospective questionnaire study was conducted on patients with cancelled aesthetic surgeries or procedures to determine the effects that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had on patient motivation regarding cosmetic surgery and procedures and to establish a relationship between patient characteristics and the overall effect of pandemia on the perception of cosmetic surgery.Although most patients felt angry or frustrated due to the cancellation of their surgeries or procedures, the majority accepted that it was a necessary precaution. Patients with a history of previous minimally invasive procedures had a significantly higher ratio of acceptance for cancellations, whereas single patients were more likely to want to have their treatments done if the decision were left up to them. A subset of patients considered undergoing additional cosmetic procedures in the setting of self-isolation, and all patients stated that they would reschedule once the pandemia was under control.Patients with established motivation for plastic surgery and minimally invasive procedures ultimately plan to resume their normal treatments alongside others after the pandemia subsides. Plastic surgeons must actively communicate with their patient population during this time to properly educate, embrace, and direct them under scientific guidelines.","Sezgin, Billur; Tatar, Sedat; Kara, Basak Selin; Ozmen, Selahattin; Yavuzer, Reha",Facial Plast Surg,,766
482211,"Bronchoscopy in COVID-19 patients: When, how and why. Experience in clinical practice",2021,"The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 as the current global concern threatens lives of many people around the world. COVID-19 is highly contagious so that it has infected more than 1,848,439 people until April 14, 2020 and killed more than 117,217 people. The main aim of this study is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the spatio-temporal outbreak of COVID-19. The main innovation of this research is investigating the impacts of various strategies of school and educational center closures, heeding social distancing, and office closures on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Urmia city, Iran. In this research, the outbreak of COVID-19 disease was simulated with the help of ABM so that all agents considered in the ABM along with their attributes and behaviors as well as the environment of the ABM were described. Besides, the transmission of COVID-19 between human agents was simulated based on the SEIRD model, and finally, all control strategies applied in Urmia city along with corresponding actions of each control strategy were implemented in the ABM. The results of the ABM indicated that school and educational center closures in Urmia city, reduced the number of infected people by 4.96% each week on average and 49.61% in total from February 21 until May 10. Heeding social distancing by 30% and 70% of people of Urmia city from March 27, led to decrease the number of infected people by 5.24% and 10.07% each week, on average and 31.46% and 60.44% in total, respectively, and if 30% and 70% of civil servants of Urmia city did not go to work, the number of infected people would be decreased by 3.30% and 5.25% each week, on average and 32.98% and 52.48% in total from February 21 until May 10, respectively. As a result of this research, heeding social distancing by the majority of people is recommended for Urmia city in the current situation. The main advantages of disease modeling are to investigate how the disease is likely to evolve amongst the population of society and also assess the impacts of control strategies on controlling the outbreak of disease.","Mahdizadeh Gharakhanlou, Navid; Hooshangi, Navid",Inform.

The median Rt for Ghana and six out of sixteen regions dropped from greater than 1 in March 2020 to less than 1 in September but increased above 1 in January 2021. The relaxation of movement restrictions and religious gatherings were not associated with increased Rt in the regions with lower case burdens. However, Rt increased in most regions after schools were reopened in January 2021. In a regression analysis, we estimated that the per-capita cumulative case count increased with population size. Findings indicated the public health interventions reduced the Rt at the national level while at the regional levels, the Rt fluctuated, and the extent of fluctuation varied across regions.","Ofori, Sylvia K.; Schwind, Jessica S.; Sullivan, Kelly L.; Cowling, Benjamin J; Chowell, Gerardo; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",,,766

As of February 6, 2021, over 105 million persons have been infected in 223 countries and there have been 2,290,488 deaths. As a result, emergency medical services and hospital systems have undergone unprecedented healthcare delivery reconfigurations. Here, we review the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) epidemiology and systems of care. RECENT FINDINGS: Areas severely affected by the pandemic have reported increased incidence of OHCA, lower rates of successful resuscitation, and increased mortality. COVID-19 has significantly impacted patient outcomes through increased disease severity, decreased access to care, and the reshaping of emergency medical response and hospital-based healthcare systems and policies. The pandemic has negatively influenced attitudes toward resuscitation and challenged providers with novel ethical dilemmas provoked by the scarcity of healthcare resources. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had direct, indirect, psychosocial, and ethical impacts on the cardiac arrest chain of survival.","Kovach, Christopher P; Perman, Sarah M",Curr Opin Crit Care,,766
633840,To study heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 IgG response titre in patients recovered from COVID-19,2021,"The antiviral potential of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting rabies virus (RV) polymerase (L) and nucleoprotein (N) genes delivered through lentiviral vector was investigated. For in vitro evaluation, siRNAs expressing BHK-21 cell lines (BHK-L and BHK-N) were developed using transduction with Lenti-L and Lenti-N lentiviruses encoding siRNAs against RV-L and N genes, respectively. When these cell lines were challenged in vitro with RV Pasteur virus-11 (PV-11) strain, there was reduction in number of RV-specific foci and target gene transcripts indicating inhibitory effect on RV multiplication. For in vivo evaluation, mice were treated intracerebrally with lentiviruses and challenged with 20 LD(50) of RV challenge virus standard-11 (CVS-11) strain by intramuscular route in masseter muscle. Five out of eight mice treated with Lenti-N survived indicating 62.5 % protection. The control and Lenti-L-treated mice died within 7–10 days indicating lethal nature of challenge virus and no protection. These results demonstrated that siRNA targeting RV-N could not only inhibit RV multiplication, but also conferred protection in mice against lethal RV challenge. These findings have implication on therapeutic use of siRNA targeting RV-N against RV infection.","Singh, Niraj K.; Meshram, Chetan D.; Sonwane, Arvind A.; Dahiya, Shyam S.; Pawar, Sachin S.; Chaturvedi, V.
