220,220,220,Smallpox and Season: Reanalysis of Historical Data,13.789167,11.966482,2009-01-04,"Seasonal variation in smallpox transmission is one of the most pressing ecological questions and is relevant to bioterrorism preparedness. The present study reanalyzed 7 historical datasets which recorded monthly cases or deaths. In addition to time series analyses of reported data, an estimation and spectral analysis of the effective reproduction number at calendar time t, R(t), were made. Meteorological variables were extracted from a report in India from 1890–1921 and compared with smallpox mortality as well as R(t). Annual cycles of smallpox transmission were clearly shown not only in monthly reports but also in the estimates of R(t). Even short-term epidemic data clearly exhibited an annual peak every January. Both mortality and R(t) revealed significant negative association (P < .01) and correlation (P < .01), respectively, with humidity. These findings suggest that smallpox transmission greatly varies with season and is most likely enhanced by dry weather.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Kashiwagi, Tomoko",Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis,113,3
363,363,363,Mitigation Approaches to Combat the Flu Pandemic,13.822396,12.186383,2009,"Management of flu pandemic is a perpetual challenge for the medical fraternity since time immemorial. Animal to human transmission has been observed thrice in the last century within an average range of 11-39 years of antigenic recycling. The recent outbreak of influenza A (H1N1, also termed as swine flu), first reported in Mexico on April 26, 2009, occurred in the forty first year since last reported flu pandemic (July 1968). Within less than 50 days, it has assumed pandemic proportions (phase VI) affecting over 76 countries with 163 deaths/35,928 cases (as on 15(th) June 2009). It indicated the re-emergence of genetically reassorted virus having strains endemic to humans, swine and avian (H5N1). The World Health Organisation (WHO) member states have already pulled up their socks and geared up to combat such criticalities. Earlier outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) in different countries led WHO to develop pandemic preparedness strategies with national/regional plans on pandemic preparedness. Numerous factors related to climatic conditions, socio-economic strata, governance and sharing of information/logistics at all levels have been considered critical indicators in monitoring the dynamics of escalation towards a pandemic situation. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Government of India, with the active cooperation of UN agencies and other stakeholders/experts has formulated a concept paper on role of nonhealth service providers during pandemics in April 2008 and released national guidelines - management of biological disasters in July 2008. These guidelines enumerate that the success of medical management endeavors like pharmaceutical (anti-viral Oseltamivir and Zanamivir therapies), nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination development etc., largely depends on level of resistance offered by mutagenic viral strain and rationale use of pharmaco therapeutic interventions. This article describes the mitigation approach to combat flu pandemic with its effective implementation at national, state and local levels.","Chawla, Raman; Sharma, Rakesh Kumar; Madaan, Deepali; Dubey, Neha; Arora, Rajesh; Goel, Rajeev; Singh, Shefali; Kaushik, Vinod; Singh, Pankaj Kumar; Chabbra, Vivek; Bhardwaj, Janak Raj",J Glob Infect Dis,113,3

We assessed the feasibility of a strategy that allows the flexibility of postmanufacture mixture of vaccine and adjuvant at the point of care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial among healthy adults aged 18–49 years who received 2 doses of inactivated influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 clade 2.2.3) virus vaccine containing either 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) with or without AS03 adjuvant, administered 21 days apart. Subjects were observed for local (injection site) and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. Sera were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody levels against the homologous strain and 4 heterologous avian strains. RESULTS: Vaccine containing ASO3 adjuvant was associated with significantly more local reactions compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, but these were short-lived and resolved spontaneously. Although the immune response to nonadjuvanted vaccine was poor, 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing as little as 3.75 µg of HA elicited robust immune responses resulting in seroprotective titers (≥1:40) to the homologous strain in ≥86% of subjects by HAI and in 95% of subjects by MN. Cross-clade antibody responses were also observed with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, but not nonadjuvanted vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: AS03 adjuvant formulated with inactivated vaccine at the administration site significantly enhanced the immune responses to H5N1 vaccine and has the potential to markedly improve vaccine responses and accelerate delivery during an influenza pandemic.

1973,1973,1973,Estimates of the Demand for Mechanical Ventilation in the United States During an Influenza Pandemic,14.166335,12.033084,2015-05-01,"An outbreak in China in April 2013 of human illnesses due to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus provided reason for US public health officials to revisit existing national pandemic response plans. We built a spreadsheet model to examine the potential demand for invasive mechanical ventilation (excluding “rescue therapy” ventilation). We considered scenarios of either 20% or 30% gross influenza clinical attack rate (CAR), with a “low severity” scenario with case fatality rates (CFR) of 0.05%–0.1%, or a “high severity” scenario (CFR: 0.25%–0.5%). We used rates-of-influenza-related illness to calculate the numbers of potential clinical cases, hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and need for mechanical ventilation. We assumed 10 days ventilator use per ventilated patient, 13% of total ventilator demand will occur at peak, and a 33.7% weighted average mortality risk while on a ventilator. At peak, for a 20% CAR, low severity scenario, an additional 7000 to 11 000 ventilators will be needed, averting a pandemic total of 35 000 to 55 000 deaths. A 30% CAR, high severity scenario, will need approximately 35 000 to 60 500 additional ventilators, averting a pandemic total 178 000 to 308 000 deaths. Estimates of deaths averted may not be realized because successful ventilation also depends on sufficient numbers of suitably trained staff, needed supplies (eg, drugs, reliable oxygen sources, suction apparatus, circuits, and monitoring equipment) and timely ability to match access to ventilators with critically ill cases. There is a clear challenge to plan and prepare to meet demands for mechanical ventilators for a future severe pandemic.","Meltzer, Martin I.; Patel, Anita; Ajao, Adebola; Nystrom, Scott V.; Koonin, Lisa M.",Clin Infect Dis,113,3
2688,2688,2688,Impact of Outpatient Neuraminidase Inhibitor Treatment in Patients Infected With Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 at High Risk of Hospitalization: An Individual Participant Data Metaanalysis,13.726482,12.12767,2017-05-15,"BACKGROUND. While evidence exists to support the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) in reducing mortality when given to hospitalized patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, the impact of outpatient treatment on hospitalization has not been clearly established. We investigated the impact of outpatient NAI treatment on subsequent hospitalization in patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. METHODS. We assembled general community and outpatient data from 9 clinical centers in different countries collected between January 2009 and December 2010. We standardized data from each study center to create a pooled dataset and then used mixed-effects logistic regression modeling to determine the effect of NAI treatment on hospitalization. We adjusted for NAI treatment propensity and preadmission antibiotic use, including “study center” as a random intercept to account for differences in baseline hospitalization rate between centers. RESULTS. We included 3376 patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, of whom 3085 (91.4%) had laboratory-confirmed infection. Eight hundred seventy-three patients (25.8%) received outpatient or community-based NAI treatment, 928 of 2395 (38.8%) with available data had dyspnea or respiratory distress, and hospitalizations occurred in 1705 (50.5%). After adjustment for preadmission antibiotics and NAI treatment propensity, preadmission NAI treatment was associated with decreased odds of hospital admission compared to no NAI treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.30). CONCLUSIONS. In a population with confirmed or suspected A(H1N1)pdm09 and at high risk of hospitalization, outpatient or community-based NAI treatment significantly reduced the likelihood of requiring hospital admission. These data suggest that community patients with severe influenza should receive NAI treatment.","Venkatesan, Sudhir; Myles, Puja R.; Leonardi-Bee, Jo; Muthuri, Stella G.; Al Masri, Malak; Andrews, Nick; Bantar, Carlos; Dubnov-Raz, Gal; Gérardin, Patrick; Koay, Evelyn S.

3306,3306,3306,The Convergence of High-Consequence Livestock and Human Pathogen Research and Development: A Paradox of Zoonotic Disease,13.890071,12.094806,2018-05-30,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans account for 75 percent of new and emerging infectious diseases. Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them. These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development. To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed. In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden. The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats. To raise awareness of these challenges, which include biosafety and biosecurity issues, we held a workshop at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Biothreats conference to further discuss the topic with invited experts and audience participants. The workshop covered the subjects of research funding and metrics, economic sustainment of drug and vaccine development pipelines, workforce turnover, and the challenges of maintaining operational readiness of high containment laboratories.","Michelotti, Julia M.; Yeh, Kenneth B.; Beckham, Tammy R.; Colby, Michelle M.; Dasgupta, Debanjana; Zuelke, Kurt A.; Olinger, Gene G.",Trop Med Infect Dis,113,3

Hand disinfection is frequently recommended for prevention of rhinovirus (RV) infection and RV-associated common colds. The effectiveness of this intervention has not been established in a natural setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hand disinfection on RV infection and RV-associated common cold illness in a natural setting. Methods. A controlled clinical trial was done in young adult volunteers during 9 weeks of the fall 2009 RV season. Volunteers were randomized to either an antiviral hand treatment containing 2% citric acid and 2% malic acid in 62% ethanol (n = 116) or to a no-treatment control group (n = 96). The hand treatment was applied every 3 hours while the subjects were awake. All volunteers kept a daily diary of symptoms and had a nasal lavage for polymerase chain reaction once each week and 2 additional lavages around the time of each common cold illness. The primary endpoint was the number of RV-associated illnesses. The incidence of RV infection and of common cold illnesses were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Results. The hand treatment did not significantly reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses. The total number of common cold illnesses was significantly reduced in the intent-to-treat analysis, but this effect was not seen in the per protocol analysis. Conclusions. In this study, hand disinfection did not reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses. Clinical Trials Registration.

Despite the country’s improved dengue surveillance, it still suffers from various setbacks and needs to be complemented with alternative approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Internet-based surveillance such as Google Dengue Trends (GDT) in supplementing current epidemiological methods for predicting future dengue outbreaks and patterns. With this, our study has two objectives: (1) assess the temporal relationship of weekly GDT and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila from 2009–2014; and (2) examine the health-seeking behavior based on dengue-related search queries of the population. The study collated the population statistics and reported dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila from respective government agencies to calculate the dengue incidence (DI) on a weekly basis for the entire region and annually per city. Data processing of GDT and dengue incidence was performed by conducting an ‘adjustment’ and scaling procedures, respectively, and further analyzed for correlation and cross-correlation analyses using Pearson’s correlation. The relative search volume of the term ‘dengue’ and top dengue-related search queries in Metropolitan Manila were obtained and organized from the Google Trends platform. Afterwards, a thematic analysis was employed, and word clouds were generated to examine the health behavior of the population. Results showed that weekly temporal GDT pattern are closely similar to the weekly DI pattern in Metropolitan Manila. Further analysis showed that GDT has a moderate and positive association with DI when adjusted or scaled, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a delayed effect where GDT leads DI by 1–2 weeks. Thematic analysis of dengue-related search queries indicated 5 categories namely; (a) dengue, (b) sign and symptoms of dengue, (c) treatment and prevention, (d) mosquito, and (e) other diseases. The majority of the search queries were classified in ‘signs and symptoms’ which indicate the health-seeking behavior of the population towards the disease. Therefore, GDT can be utilized to complement traditional disease surveillance methods combined with other factors that could potentially identify dengue hotspots and help in public health decisions.","Ho, Howell T.; Carvajal, Thaddeus M.; Bautista, John Robert; Capistrano, Jayson Dale R.; Viacrusis, Katherine M.; Hernandez, Lara Fides T.; Watanabe, Kozo",Trop Med Infect Dis,113,3
3713,3713,3713,Lethal Influenza in Two Related Adults with Inherited GATA2 Deficiency,13.950321,12.128409,2018-06-07,"The pathogenesis of life-threatening influenza A virus (IAV) disease remains elusive, as infection is benign in most individuals. We studied two relatives who died from influenza. We Sanger sequenced GATA2 and evaluated the mutation by gene transfer, measured serum cytokine levels, and analyzed circulating T- and B-cells. Both patients (father and son, P1 and P2) died in 2011 of H1N1pdm IAV infection at the ages of 54 and 31 years, respectively. They had not suffered from severe or moderately severe infections in the last 17 (P1) and 15 years (P2). A daughter of P1 had died at 20 years from infectious complications. Low B-cell, NK- cell, and monocyte numbers and myelodysplastic syndrome led to sequence GATA2. Patients were heterozygous for a novel, hypomorphic, R396L mutation leading to haplo-insufficiency. B- and T-cell rearrangement in peripheral blood from P1 during the influenza episode showed expansion of one major clone. No T-cell receptor excision circles were detected in P1 and P3 since they were 35 and 18 years, respectively. Both patients presented an exuberant, interferon (IFN)-γ-mediated hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. No data about patients with viremia was available. Two previously reported adult GATA2-deficient patients died from severe H1N1 IAV infection; GATA2 deficiency may predispose to life-threatening influenza in adulthood. However, a role of other genetic variants involved in immune responses cannot be ruled out. Patients with GATA2 deficiency can reach young adulthood without severe infections, including influenza, despite long-lasting complete B-cell and natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, as well as profoundly diminished T-cell thymic output.

Mandatory meningococcal vaccination for all pilgrims against serogroups A and C and, subsequently, A, C, W, and Y controlled the epidemics. Overseas pilgrims show excellent adherence to the policy; however, vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims is suboptimal. This survey aimed to evaluate meningococcal vaccine uptake among Hajj pilgrims and to identify key factors affecting this. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among pilgrims in Greater Makkah during the Hajj in 2017–2018. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, cost of vaccination, and reasons behind non-receipt of the vaccine were collected. Results: A total of 509 respondents aged 13 to 82 (median 33.8) years participated in the survey: 86% male, 85% domestic pilgrims. Only 389/476 (81.7%) confirmed their meningococcal vaccination status; 64 individuals (13.4%), all domestic pilgrims, did not receive the vaccine, and 23 (4.8%) were unsure. Among overseas pilgrims, 93.5% certainly received the vaccine (6.5% were unsure) compared to 80.9% of domestic pilgrims (p < 0.01). Being employed and having a tertiary qualification were significant predictors of vaccination adherence (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3–3.8, p < 0.01; and OR = 1.7, CI = 1–2.5, p < 0.05, respectively). Those who obtained pre-Hajj health advice were more than three times as likely to be vaccinated than those who did not (OR = 3.3, CI = 1.9–5.9, p < 0.001). Lack of awareness (63.2%, 36/57) and lack of time (15.8%, 9/57) were the most common reasons reported for non-receipt of vaccine. Conclusion: Many domestic pilgrims missed the compulsory meningococcal vaccine; in this regard, lack of awareness is a key barrier. Being an overseas pilgrim (or living at a distance from Makkah), receipt of pre-Hajj health advice, and employment were predictors of greater compliance with the vaccination policy. Opportunities remain to reduce the policy–practice gap among domestic pilgrims.","Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Alghabban, Fatimah; Falemban, Wajd; Albishri, Abdullah; Rani Banik, Gouri; Alhawassi, Tariq; Abuelizz, Hatem; Bakarman, Marwan A.; Khatami, Ameneh; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor",Trop Med Infect Dis,113,3

Using a unique ZIKV virion-based sorting strategy, we isolated and characterized multiple antibodies, including one termed MZ4, which targets a novel site of vulnerability centered on the Envelope (E) domain I/III linker region and protects mice from viremia and viral dissemination following ZIKV or DENV-2 challenge. These data demonstrate that Zika vaccination in a DENV-experienced individual can boost pre-existing flavivirus immunity and elicit protective responses against both ZIKV and DENV. ZPIV vaccination in Puerto Rican individuals with prior flavivirus experience yielded similar cross-neutralizing potency after a single vaccination, highlighting the potential benefit of ZIKV vaccination in flavivirus-endemic areas.","Dussupt, Vincent; Sankhala, Rajeshwer S.; Gromowski, Gregory D.; Donofrio, Gina; De La Barrera, Rafael A.; Larocca, Rafael A.; Zaky, Weam; Mendez-Rivera, Letzibeth; Choe, Misook; Davidson, Edgar; McCracken, Michael K.; Brien, James D.; Abbink, Peter; Bai, Hongjun; Bryan, Aubrey L.; Bias, Candace Hope; Berry, Irina Maljkovic; Botero, Nubia; Cook, Tanya; Doria-Rose, Nicole A.; Escuer, Ariadna Grinyo i; Frimpong, Justice Akuoku; Geretz, Aviva; Hernandez, Mayda; Hollidge, Bradley S.; Jian, Ningbo; Kabra, Kareem; Leggat, David J.; Liu, Jinyan; Pinto, Amelia K.; Rutvisuttinunt, Wiriya; Setliff, Ian; Tran, Ursula; Townsley, Samantha; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Rolland, Morgane; McDermott, Adrian B.; Georgiev, Ivelin S.; Thomas, Rasmi; Robb, Merlin L.; Eckels, Kenneth H.; Barranco, Elizabeth; Koren, Michael; Smith, Darci R.; Jarman, Richard G.; George, Sarah L.; Stephenson, Kathryn E.; Barouch, Dan H.; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Michael, Nelson L.; Joyce, M.

6630,6630,6630,Infectious and Immunologic Phenotype of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome,14.209969,12.055349,2015-02-27,"Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain why cytomegalovirus pneumonitis (CMV-P) is frequent and severe in bone marrow transplant patients while remaining rare and mild in HIV infected patients. One hypothesis suggests that CMV-P is an immunopathological condition that is common in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) under the effects of an abnormally regenerating immune system that reacts against CMV infected lung tissue. Such a hypothesis implicates CD4 T lymphocytes as one of the critical cell populations involved in immunopathology and also suggests that this process would be aborted by CD4 T cell deficiency in HIV infection. However, studies correlating the onset of CMV-P with lymphocyte reconstitution following BMT have revealed that CD4 cells are present at very low frequencies in the blood during the early period after transplantation when most cases of CMV-P occur. Furthermore, studies directly investigating bronchoalveolar lavage cell types during episodes of CMV-P in BMT patients have also failed to demonstrate significant CD4 involvement and, instead, have emphasized a predominance of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 cells. These findings serve as the basis for questioning the validity of a CD4-driven immunopathological model of CMV-P in BMT. On the other hand, a variety of experimental and clinical observations support the protective role of CMV-specific CD3(+) CD8 T lymphocytes against CMV in both immunocompetent individuals and BMT patients. In a murine BMT model, adoptive transfer of syngeneic BM cells was associated with massive increases in lung CD8 cells which resulted in the resolution rather than the exacerbation of existing CMV-P. In the light of these findings a more plausible hypothesis for CMV-P in BMT is that during the early period after transplantation adequate protective CD8 responses are absent and an uncontrolled CMV proliferation is allowed to develop. Once a critical viral load is reached a cytokine ‘storm’ may be triggered in the lung tissue that aggravates direct CMV-associated cytopathic effects. Likely candidates for this process would include the release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from alveolar macrophages stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released from NK cells that are reconstituted early after BMT.

Host inflammatory response contributes to the clearance of influenza virus; meanwhile, the induced “cytokine storm” also leads to pathological lesions. However, what inflammation-related response of the host for H7N9 influenza A virus infection to survival from injures of exuberant cytokine release is still obscure. In this research, expression pattern and histological distribution of inflammation-related genes, RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α, Slit2 and Robo4 in the lung of BALB/c mice infected with two H7N9 IAV strains with only a PB2 residue 627 difference were investigated, as well as the histopathological injury of the lung. Results showed that significantly higher expression level of NLRP3, RIP3, IL-1β and TNF-α in H7N9-infected groups compared with the control would play a key role in driving lung pathological lesion. While the expression level of Slit2 and Robo4 in H7N9 rV(K627E) group had significantly increased trend than V(K627) which might be the main factor to inhibit the interstitial pneumonia and infiltration. Also, H7N9 induced the histopathological changes in the lung of infected mice, and RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α, Slit2 and Robo4 showed cell-specific distribution in the lung. The results will provide basic data for further research on the mechanism of inflammatory response and understanding of the role of site 627 in PB2 in H7N9 IAVs infection.

Since it is crucial to develop rapid, accurate, cost-effective, and in-situ methods for early detection viruses, a variety of sensors have been reported so far. This review provides an overview of the recent developments in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for detecting viruses and use of these sensors on environmental, clinical and food monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors for determining viruses are divided into four main groups including nucleic acid-based, antibody-based, aptamer-based and antigen-based electrochemical biosensors. Finally, the drawbacks and advantages of each type of sensors are identified and discussed.","Ozer, Tugba; Geiss, Brian J.; Henry, Charles S.",J Electrochem Soc,113,3

CLA enters the human diet mainly via milk fat and fatty beef; it acts as an effective anticarcinogen and exhibits other important physiological effects. The objective of the current study was to investigate the capability of a LA-conjugating bacterial community isolated from a human volunteer and associated with germ-free rats to supply the host with CLA. Gnotobiotic rats were fed a diet enriched with esterified LA in the form of sunflower-seed oil. The control group was fed the same diet and remained germ-free. Bacterial cell counts, in vitro LA-conjugation activities, and CLA concentration in feces and in the contents of various intestinal segments were determined. After 10 wk, various tissues were analyzed for CLA concentrations. LA-conjugation activity was found only in feces, cecum and colon content samples from associated rats, but CLA accumulation in various body tissues did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ratio of CLA to LA in feces and in cecal and colonic contents did not differ between groups, indicating that the microorganisms in the cecum and the colon do not synthesize substantial amounts of CLA in vivo and therefore, do not contribute to the CLA supplementation of the host.","Kamlage, Beate; Hartmann, Ludger; Gruhl, Bärbel; Blaut, Michael",J Nutr,113,3

Even prior to protein synthesis itself, the accessibility of the various open reading frames contained in the viral genome is precisely controlled. Eukaryotic viruses resort to a vast array of strategies to divert the translation machinery in their favor, in particular, at initiation of translation. These strategies are not only designed to circumvent strategies common to cell protein synthesis in eukaryotes, but as revealed more recently, they also aim at modifying or damaging cell factors, the virus having the capacity to multiply in the absence of these factors. In addition to unraveling mechanisms that may constitute new targets in view of controlling virus diseases, viruses constitute incomparably useful tools to gain in-depth knowledge on a multitude of cell pathways.","Komarova, Anastassia V.; Haenni, Anne-Lise; Ramírez, Bertha Cecilia",Adv Virus Res,113,1

In this study, we examined the effect of placental extract on the memory impairment and neuromorphological change in OVX/stress-subjected mice. Female Slc:ICR strain mice were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle-treated OVX, porcine placental extract (120 and 2160 mg/kg)-treated OVX, and sham-operated control groups. Two weeks after surgical operation, OVX mice underwent restraint stress for 21 days (6 h/day), and all animals were then subjected to a contextual fear conditioning test followed by morphological examination by Nissl staining. Placental extract was orally administered once daily until the behavioral analysis was carried out. Chronic treatment with both doses of placental extract improved the OVX/stress-induced fear memory impairment and Nissl-positive cell loss of the hippocampal CA3 region, although it did not affect the loss of bone mineral density and increase in body weight after OVX. These results have important implications for the neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing effects of placental extract in postmenopausal women.","Takuma, Kazuhiro; Mizoguchi, Hiroyuki; Funatsu, Yoko; Kitahara, Yuko; Ibi, Daisuke; Kamei, Hiroyuki; Matsuda, Toshio; Koike, Koji; Inoue, Masaki; Nagai, Taku; Yamada, Kiyofumi",J Pharmacol Sci,113,1

We found that abdominal irradiation of γ-rays could induce ACF in the rat colon. The irradiation was performed once a week at a dose rate of 2 or 3 Gy per irradiation. Irradiation-induced ACF were observed in the colon at 10 weeks after the first irradiation at dose of 2 Gy for six times or 3 Gy for four times. Dietary SBF had no effect on the number of ACF, aberrant crypts (AC) or AC/focus induced by abdominal γ-irradiation. However, an ingestion of SBF resulted in an increase in the number of these parameters in apoptosis-suppressed rats by cycloheximide (CHX). An injection of CHX suppressed irradiation-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells for at least 6 h after the irradiation. In CHX-injected rats, an ingestion of SBF significantly increased the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus compared with fiber-free fed rats at 9 weeks after the first irradiation. On the other hand, in saline-injected rats, no significant difference was found between SBF and fiber-free diets in the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus through the experimental period. These results suggest that dietary SBF may be involved in the elimination of abnormal cells from an irradiated colon through the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. In this study, we have shown a new method for inducing ACF by using γ-rays which were not influenced by luminal contents such as bacterial enzyme, at least in the initiation stage.","Ishizuka, Satoshi; Ito, Satoshi; Onuma, Masashi; Kasai, Takanori; Aoyama, Yoritaka; Hara, Hiroshi",Carcinogenesis,113,3

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in protein folding and ER stress has been implicated in bone mineralization. The role of ER stress in VSMC-mediated calcification is less clear. APPROACH AND RESULTS: mRNA expression of the ER stress markers PERK (PKR (protein kinase RNA)-like ER kinase), ATF (activating transcription factor) 4, ATF6, and Grp78 (glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa) was detectable in human vessels with levels of PERK decreased in calcified plaques compared to healthy vessels. Protein deposition of Grp78/Grp94 was increased in the matrix of calcified arteries. Induction of ER stress accelerated human primary VSMC-mediated calcification, elevated expression of some osteogenic markers (Runx2 [RUNX family transcription factor 2], OSX [Osterix], ALP [alkaline phosphatse], BSP [bone sialoprotein], and OPG [osteoprotegerin]), and decreased expression of SMC markers. ER stress potentiated extracellular vesicle (EV) release via SMPD3 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3). EVs from ER stress-treated VSMCs showed increased Grp78 levels and calcification. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Grp78/Grp94 in EVs. siRNA (short interfering RNA) knock-down of Grp78 decreased calcification. Warfarin-induced Grp78 and ATF4 expression in rat aortas and VSMCs and increased calcification in an ER stress-dependent manner via increased EV release. CONCLUSIONS: ER stress induces vascular calcification by increasing release of Grp78-loaded EVs. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of action of warfarin, involving increased EV release via the PERK-ATF4 pathway, contributing to calcification. This study is the first to show that warfarin induces ER stress and to link ER stress to cargo loading of EVs.","Furmanik, Malgorzata; van Gorp, Rick; Whitehead, Meredith; Ahmad, Sadia; Bordoloi, Jayanta; Kapustin, Alexander; Schurgers, Leon J.; Shanahan, Catherine M.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,113,9

In this study, we examined levels, trends, and inequalities in the utilization of institutional delivery services in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used nationally representative cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted during 1990–2018. Bayesian linear regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 74 countries, the utilization of institutional delivery services ranged from 23.7% in Chad to 100% in Ukraine and Armenia (with >90% in 19 countries and <50% in 13 countries) during the latest DHS rounds. Trend analysis in 63 countries with at least 2 surveys showed that the utilization of institutional delivery services increased in 60 countries during 1990–2018, with the highest increase being in Cambodia (18.3%). During this period, the utilization of institutional delivery services increased in 90.3% of countries among the richest, 95.2% of countries in urban, and 84.1% of countries among secondary+ educated women. The utilization of institutional delivery services was higher among wealthiest, urban, and secondary+ educated women compared to their counterparts. Greater utilization of private facilities for delivery was observed in women from the highest income group and urban communities, whereas highest utilization of public facilities was observed for women from the lowest income group and rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of institutional delivery services varied substantially between and within countries over time. Significant disparities in service utilization identified in this study highlight the need for tailored support for women from disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.","Hasan, Md.

Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.","Benavides, Julio A.; Valderrama, William; Streicker, Daniel G.",Proc Biol Sci,113,1

Our previous studies demonstrated that the culture media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs (conditional media) contained various soluble chondrogenic factors and were effective for directing chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the conditional media can induce ASCs towards chondrogenic differentiation, especially for three-dimensional (3D) cartilage formation in a preshaped scaffold. In this study, it demonstrated that the conditional media derived from chondrocyte-scaffold constructs could promote ASCs to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells, with similar expression of type II collagen to those induced by chondrogenic growth factors. Moreover, the expression level of chondrocyte-specific genes, such as SOX9, type II collagen, and COMP, was even higher in conditional medium group (CM) than that in optimized chondrogenic growth factor group (GF), indicating that the conditional media can serve as an effective inducer for chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs. Most importantly, the conditional media could also induce ASC-scaffold constructs to form 3D cartilage-like tissue with typical lacunae structures and positive expression of cartilage specific matrices, even higher contents of GAG and type II collagen were achieved in CM group compared to GF group. The current study establishes a simple, but stable, efficient, and economical method for directing 3D cartilage formation of ASCs, a strategy that may be more closely applicable for repairing cartilage defects.","Sun, Hengyun; Liu, Yu; Jiang, Ting; Liu, Xia; He, Aijuan; Li, Jie; Zhang, Wenjie; Liu, Wei; Cao, Yilin; Zhou, Guangdong",Tissue Eng Regen Med,113,3

The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed, and could be linked to different economic contexts. Arguably, the responses to these outbreaks have been “political” and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations. Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings. Based on a review of the published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databases—PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science, the overall objective of this paper discuss scholars’ narratives on the “politics” of Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika virus in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting. Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature. The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature. While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts, the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited. Regardless of income setting, there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic. The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic—specifically poor communities—need to be represented in the literature. This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics.","Kapiriri, Lydia; Ross, Alison",Glob Soc Welf,113,3

However, numerous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that inadvertant release of highly reactive oxygen metabolites by the PMN into the surrounding milieu results in autoinjury and is associated with diffuse capillary leak syndromes (septic shock, ARDS). NADPH oxidoreductase, the superoxide anion generating enzyme, is a PMN membrane bound flavoprotein normally dormant but inducible by a variety of agents. We studied the specific activity of this enzyme in critically ill children to determine if detection of its activation might provide an early clue of impending in inflammatory amplification injury. Venous blood specimens from 12 healthy young adult controls reflected an induced enzyme activity of 8.23 ± 2.1 nmoles superoxide/min./10(6) PMNs ± S.D. Similarly the induced activity in a group of 6 pediatric intensive care patients without evidence of capillary leak syndrome was 7.3 ± 2.2 . In constrast the mean induced activity from a group of 6 critically ill children with evidence of capillary leak syndrome was 3.0 ± 1.1 (p<.001). No activity was demonstrated in non-induced PMNs from any group. No differences in induced enzyme activity were appreciated between venous and arterial blood samples. Such findings may demonstrate the phenomena of desensitization of previously in vivo activated neutrophils to additional stimulation, and may represent a host defense which minimizes autoinjury.","Zimmerman, Jerry J; Pollack, Murray M; Shelhamer, James H",Pediatr Res,113,3

The optimal extraction method should fulfill the following conditions: speed, short working time, cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity and specificity, good reproducibility, and safety. The methods can be divided into solution or column based according to differences of their principles. The automated extraction instruments have many advantages, and these have proven to be very useful. Moreover, in recent years, fully automated instruments combining NA extraction and amplification have been commercially available. However, the method itself does not provide assurance, and the DNA recovery can be different among various kits or instruments that use the similar principles.

Patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at risk. Most of the cases of HSV pneumonia are caused by HSV-1; however, cases caused by HSV-2 have also been reported. Mucocutaneous disease often precedes the development of pneumonia, with nonspecific symptoms that include fever, cough, and dyspnea. Worsening oxygenation and failure to wean off mechanical ventilation despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage is also a common presentation. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion and is based on isolation of the virus from respiratory secretions and demonstration of cytopathic effects on histopathology. Acyclovir is the most widely used drug for treatment and prophylaxis. With increasing evidence of resistance to acyclovir and its analogs, newer agents such as foscarnet and cidofovir are being recommended as treatment options. Prophylaxis in patients with seropositive HSV undergoing chemotherapy or in the immediate post-HSCT period has been shown to reduce HSV disease rates and mortality rates. This chapter will focus on incidence and transmission, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HSV pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies and HSCT, as well as outcome and prognosis.","Shah, Jharna N.; Chemaly, Roy F.",Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies,113,3

27299,27299,27299,ProMED Update,14.003026,12.059319,2004-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Fit testing is used to determine whether a N95 mask will provide respiratory protection for the wearer by preventing inhalation of airborne transmitted microorganisms. National guidelines recommend that healthcare workers (HCW) who use N95 masks require fit testing. Quantitative fit testing requires the purchasing and use of fit testing solutions and associated equipment. In high volume, these solutions are expensive and may not be readily available, as was seen in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine how a homemade solution compared against a commercially available product and a placebo. METHODS: Afit test was performed on the same person, on three separate occasions, using three different solutions – commercial (45% sodium saccharin), homemade (to be disclosed) and placebo (water). The solution was double blinded and solutions were chosen and administered in a random order. RESULTS: Atotal of 48 people participated in this study.At the threshold testing stage, 8.3% did not taste any solution, 16.7% of people could taste the placebo, 89.6% could taste the commercial solution and 91.7% could taste the homemade solution. All persons who could taste the commercial solution could taste homemade solution. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study suggest that fit testing solutions could be made locally with a similar effect to that of commercial products, that quantitative fit testing is unreliable and that serious consideration should be given to the role of quantitative fit testing in future guidelines and standards. We recommend that this study be conducted on a larger scale to support our findings.","Mitchell, Brett G.; Wells, Anne; McGregor, Alistair; McKenzie, Duncan",Healthc Infect,113,3

Die höhere Nachweisrate von Antikörpern gegen C. pneumoniae deutet auf eine hohe Rate asymptomatischer oder unspezifischer Infektionen durch C. pneumoniae hin. Der Mensch ist weltweit das einzige Erregerreservoir. Kranke, seltener auch asymptomatische Ausscheider (Wochen bis 1 Jahr) sind die Ansteckungsquelle. Die Übertragung erfolgt als „Tröpfcheninfektion“ mit respiratorischen Sekreten. Eine epidemische Krankheitshäufung ist beschrieben.

In this paper we present a modeling study whose contribution is twofold: first, based on a dataset relative to the ED of an Italian hospital, we derive different kinds of Markovian models capable to reproduce, at different extents, the statistical character of dataset arrivals; second, we validate the derived arrivals model by interfacing it with a Petri net model of the services an ED patient undergoes. The empirical assessment of a few key performance indicators allowed us to validate some of the derived arrival process model, thus confirming that they can be used for predicting the performance of an ED.","Ballarini, Paolo; Duma, Davide; Horváth, Andras; Aringhieri, Roberto",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,113,1

This is particularly important for distributed systems with shared resources, e.g., one case can block another case competing for the same machine, leading to inter-case dependencies in performance. However, due to a variety of reasons, real-life systems often record only a subset of all events taking place. For example, to reduce costs, the number of sensors is minimized or parts of the system are not connected. To understand and analyze the behavior of processes with shared resources, we aim to reconstruct bounds for timestamps of events that must have happened but were not recorded. We present a novel approach that decomposes system runs into token trajectories of cases and resources that may need to synchronize in the presence of many-to-many relationships. Such relationships occur, for example, in warehouses where packages for N incoming orders are not handled in a single delivery but in M different deliveries. We use linear programming over token trajectories to derive the timestamps of unobserved events in an efficient manner. This helps to complete the event logs and facilitates analysis. We focus on material handling systems like baggage handling systems in airports to illustrate our approach. However, the approach can be applied to other settings where recording is incomplete. The ideas have been implemented in ProM and were evaluated using both synthetic and real-life event logs.","Denisov, Vadim; Fahland, Dirk; van der Aalst, Wil M.

The aim of this study was to develop a better understanding of the types of discussions taking place. Tweets were retrieved from the peak of the Zika outbreak (as identified by Google Trends). Tweets were then filtered and entered in NVivo to be analysed using thematic analysis. It was found that tweets on Zika revolved around seven key themes: pregnancy, travel and the Olympics, mosquitoes and conspiracy, health organisations, health information, travel and tracking, and general discussions around Zika. Our results are likely to be of interest to public health organisations disseminating information related to future outbreaks of Zika and we develop a set of preliminary recommendations for health authorities.","Ahmed, Wasim; Bath, Peter A.; Sbaffi, Laura; Demartini, Gianluca",Social Computing and Social Media,113,1

There are algorithms to decide whether an LTL formula or Büchi automaton (BA) specifies a stutter-invariant property, and to convert such a BA to a form that is appropriate for on-the-fly POR-based model checking. The interruptible properties play the same role in action-based model checking that stutter-invariant properties play in the state-based case. These are the properties that are invariant under the insertion or deletion of “invisible” actions. We present algorithms to decide whether an LTL formula or BA specifies an interruptible property, and show how a BA can be transformed to an interrupt normal form that can be used in an on-the-fly POR algorithm. We have implemented these algorithms in a new model checker named McRERS, and demonstrate their effectiveness using the RERS 2019 benchmark suite.","Siegel, Stephen F.; Yan, Yihao",Computer Aided Verification,113,1

In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing technology to investigate changes in the transcriptome profiles after infection with EV-A71 and CV-A16 in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Using systematic bioinformatics analysis, we then searched for useful clues regarding the pathogenesis of HFMD. As a result, a total of 111 common differentially expressed genes were present in both EV-A71- and CV-A16-infected cells. A trend analysis of these 111 genes showed that 91 of them displayed the same trend in EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection, including 49 upregulated genes and 42 downregulated genes. These 91 genes were further used to conduct GO, pathway, and coexpression network analysis. It was discovered that enriched GO terms (such as histone acetylation and positive regulation of phosphorylation) and pathways (such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis and DNA replication) might be closely associated with the pathogenic mechanism of these two viruses, and key genes (such as TBCK and GPC) might be involved in the progression of HFMD. Finally, we randomly selected 10 differentially expressed genes for qRT-PCR to validate the transcriptome sequencing data. The experimental qRT-PCR results were roughly in agreement with the results of transcriptome sequencing. Collectively, our results provide clues to the mechanism of pathogenesis of HFMD induced by EV-A71 and CV-A16.

Broad and Prevalent SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T Cell Response in Recovered COVID-19 Individuals Demonstrates Kinetics of Early Differentiation,14.173456,11.999764,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Those who survive critical illness only to become chronically critically ill (CCI) experience a high symptom burden, repeat episodes of illness exacerbation, communication barriers, and poor health outcomes. Yet, it is unclear how CCI individuals and their family understand their health and the importance of prognostic information following hospitalization. The research purpose was to examine expectations about health and disease prognosis of CCI residents in long-term care from the perspectives of the CCI themselves and their family members, as well as to describe healthcare provider (HCP) interpretations of, and reactions to, these health-related expectations. METHODS: In this qualitative interpretive descriptive study, conducted in British Columbia, Canada, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted (6 CCI residents, 11 family members, and 21 HCPs) and inductively analyzed using thematic and constant comparative techniques. RESULTS: There was divergence in CCI resident, family and HCP expectations about health and the importance of disease prognosis, which contributed to conflict. CCI residents and family viewed conflict with HCPs in relation to their day-to-day care needs, while HCPs viewed this as arising from the unrealistically high expectations of residents and family. The CCI residents and family focussed on the importance of maintaining hope, and the HCPs highlighted the complexity of end-of-life decisions in conjunction with the high expectations and hopes of family. CONCLUSIONS: The emotional and ongoing process of formulating health-related expectations points to the need for future research to inform the development and/or adapting of existing communication, psychosocial and health services interventions to ease the burden experienced by those who are CCI.

The occurrence of such variants is mainly related to mutations in hemagglutinin (HA). Previously we discovered mutations in H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin, which contributes to virus immune evasion. The purpose of this work was to study the role of these mutations in changing other, non-antigenic properties of the virus and the possibility of their maintenance in the viral population. Mutations were introduced into the HA gene of a recombinant H5N1 influenza A virus (VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG) using site-specific mutagenesis. The “variant” viruses were investigated and compared with respect to replication kinetics in chicken embryos, thermostability, reproductive activity at different temperatures (33, 37 and 40°C), and virulence for mice. Amino acid substitutions I155T, K156Q, K156E+V138A, N186K led to a decrease in thermal stability, replication activity of the mutant viruses in chicken embryos, and virulence for mice, although these effects differed between the variants. The K156Q and N186K mutations reduced viral reproduction at elevated temperature (40°C). The analysis of the frequency of these mutations in natural isolates of H5N1 influenza viruses indicated that the K156E/Q and N186K mutations have little chance to gain a foothold during evolution, in contrast to the I155T mutation, which is the most responsible for antigenic drift. The A138V and N186K mutations seem to be adaptive in mammalian viruses.","Timofeeva, T. A.; Sadykova, G. K.; Lomakina, N. F.; Gambaryan, A. S.; Rudneva, I. A.; Timofeeva, E. B.; Shilov, A.

It is common in the intensive care unit and is associated with poorer outcomes. Good quality sleep is important in the prevention and management of delirium. Melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the pineal gland which helps in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. It is possible that melatonin supplementation in intensive care improves sleep and prevents delirium. METHODS AND DESIGN: The ‘Prophylactic Melatonin for Delirium in Intensive Care’ study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether melatonin given prophylactically decreases delirium in critically ill patients. A total of 850 ICU patients have been randomised (1:1) to receive either melatonin or a placebo. Participants were monitored twice daily for symptoms of delirium. RESULTS: This paper and the attached additional files describe the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the trial. The SAP has been developed and submitted for publication before the database has been locked and before the treatment allocation has been unblinded. The SAP contains details of analyses to be undertaken, which will be reported in the primary and secondary publications. DISCUSSION: The SAP details the analyses that will be done to avoid bias coming from knowledge of the results in advance. This trial will determine whether prophylactic melatonin administered to intensive care unit patients helps decrease the rate and the severity of delirium.

Comparative Assessment of Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Antibody and Neutralization Assays from Blood Samples in COVID-19 Infected Patients,14.094972,12.145238,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In Italy the pandemic of COVID-19 infection has placed an enormous burden on health authorities: contact precautions are required to avoid viral transmission and people should be subjected to standard infection control procedures. This is crucial in a country experiencing a high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Europe and where multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GN) are endemic.The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of MDR-GN in surveillance rectal swabs (SRS) and in clinical samples (CS) in the period March 1,2020-April, 24 2020 with respect to the previous 2-month period and to the previous year. METHODS: The first SRS and the first CS with a MDR-GN isolate detected from 01/01/2019 to 24/04/2020 were included. Analysis was made by comparing three different study periods in 2019 and 2020 (Jan-Dec 2019, Jan-Feb 2020, and Mar-Apr 2020), for medical department, surgical department and intensive care department. RESULTS: Overall, 612 MDR-GN organisms were identified (399 SRS and 213 CS): carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii (CPAB) were the most frequently detected (Figure 1). We observed an increased relative frequency of patients with MDR-GN detected in CS respect to those found in SRS (32.7% vs 44.5% vs 70.6%, p=0.0005): 5/12 CS detected in the last period were isolated from the respiratory tract (Figure 2). Nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had MDR-GN. All but two patients had a previous negative SRS performed 4 days before (median value) and the median interval between COVID-19 positivity and MDR-GN positivity was 7 days.The six patients with CPAB isolation were all hospitalized in the same ward, with partially overlapping hospital stays during the study period. In 5 of them, CPAB was detected in the respiratory tract (Figure 3). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The first detection of MDR-GN in CS and the nosocomial MDR-GN acquisition despite cohorting due to COVID-19 infection underline the need to reinforce infection control measures in a high prevalence country during COVID-19 pandemia. A correct antimicrobial policy urged because, according to published data, most patients with COVID-19 infection received antimicrobial therapy: furthermore MDR-GN infection could play a role in the negative outcome of these patients.

The UNC OPAT program staff, previously accustomed to in-person collaboration in the hospital, became geographically distant amid North Carolina’s partial shutdown starting in March 2020. Team members relied on teleworking and many OPAT clinic visits shifted to phone and video telehealth. We assessed how COVID-19 impacted our care of OPAT patients including follow-up visits and readmissions. METHODS: UNC’s OPAT database contains clinical and demographic information on all patients on OPAT for at least 14 days who received specialized monitoring program led by an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacist, after evaluation by an ID physician. For all OPAT courses that ended between 3/1/20 and 5/20/20 (last available data cut), we assessed the length of OPAT treatment course, readmissions, adverse events, follow-up ID clinic visits, and the method of follow up visit utilized. We compared these measurements to historical baseline data from 3/1/19 to 5/20/19. RESULTS: During the 2020 period, 73 patients completed OPAT, with median OPAT enrollment lasting 36 days, which was similar to 2019 data (70 patients; median OPAT enrollment of 35 days). During the 2019 period, 93% of patients attended a follow up visit with an infectious diseases clinician, all of which took place in person. During the 2020 (COVID-19) period, 85% of patients attended an ID follow up visit; contrary to 2019, 42% of these visits took place in person, 45% were by phone and 13% were via a telemedicine video service. Readmission rates were similar across the two time periods (16% during COVID-19 vs 14% during 2019 comparison time period, P=0.72). CONCLUSION: UNC OPAT continued through the emergence of COVID-19 as an essential service for a high patient volume by adapting its care delivery and follow-up visit protocols to include virtual care options. Readmission rates for OPAT patients during COVID-19 were comparable to historical baseline data.

Moreover, validated serologic assays are critical to understanding immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time and identifying correlates of protection. METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol to detect antibodies (IgG) that bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was validated and ROC curve analysis performed by testing a large panel of pre-pandemic sera (n=162) and convalescent sera from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=60). We then applied this test in two cohorts: 1) Healthcare personnel (HCP) that were enrolled in a longitudinal surveillance cohort just after peak local transmission and 2) Mildly ill patients being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR from NP swabs in an ambulatory testing clinic. Demographics of mildly symptomatic patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR [Image: see text] RESULTS: ROC curve analysis yielded an AUC of 0.9953, with a sensitivity and specificity at 91.67% and 99.38% at the optimal OD normalization threshold of 0.20. In 240 HCP surveilled at enrollment, 5.83% had positive IgG results. Of 19 symptomatic patients who presented to the ambulatory clinic, 5/19 had a positive PCR. In convalescence (13–74 days post symptom onset), 3 of those 5 were positive for IgG. Validation of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA [Image: see text] ROC Curve Analysis [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA. This simple assay is an efficient way to track seroconversion and duration of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 for different populations, particularly since RBD-binding antibodies have been shown to correlate with neutralization activity and may be useful to determine protective immunity following natural infection or vaccination. Ongoing work will assess variation in magnitude, character and duration of antibody responses in key populations and seek to maximize deployability of large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serology.

Risk Factors Associated with Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Experience in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Mexico City,13.947672,12.03103,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 was admitted on March 15(th) 2020 to our community based hospital in the Bronx, NY. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of these first COVID-19 patients. Patient Characteristics and Outcome [Image: see text] METHODS: IRB approved retrospective chart review study of all COVID-19 patients admitted during March 2020 focusing on patient characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical manifestations and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients were admitted during March 2020: 57% African American 23.1% Hispanic and 16.9% White. 44.9% female, average age 60 years, and 90% had at least one comorbidity. Outcome was available on all patients except for one who was transferred to another institution for ECMO. Overall mortality was 33%. Clinical presentation: 69.4% presented with cough or shortness of breath, 15.8% with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, and 14.6% with myalgia, dizziness or altered mental status. 6.2% presented only with fever. However 59.8% of patients presented with fever and respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. MORTALITY: The table compares patients who died vs discharged (either home or to a short term facility). Those that were 65 years or older, hypertensive or presented to the ER with an oxygen saturation of 94% or lower, were more likely to die. Ventilated patients: 31.6% of patients were intubated with a mortality rate of 77%. 22% of these patients were intubated in the first 24 hours. Compared to non-intubated patients, there was no difference in BMI, diabetes, hypertension, COPD/Asthma, use of statins, aspirin or calcium channel blockers. Intubated patients older than 64 years had significantly higher mortality rates (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: This cohort of COVID-19 patients is unique as almost all received Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. Only 9% received steroids and even fewer received an interleukin-6 inhibitor, convalescent plasma or Remdesivir. African Americans and Hispanics accounted for 80% of patients. Greater than 90% received Medicaid. Overall mortality was 33%. The most common presentation was respiratory followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. The overall mortality was 33% but increased to 77% in intubated patients. Age, hypertension, and ER oxygen saturation correlated with mortality.

Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED): Updates from Year 2 of multi-site trial,14.1129055,12.2863455,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, risking infection through hospital contacts. Data regarding predisposing factors in the healthcare field is limited. In this study, we characterized presenting symptoms, occupation and hospitalizations for HCW who tested COVID-19 positive. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of HCW who presented for screening to a designated COVID-19 clinic at the largest hospital in Washington, DC between 3/13/20 - 5/28/20. Variables extracted included profession, exposure, presenting symptoms, past medical history and outcomes. Univariate analysis was performed using Fischer’s exact tests, with significance defined as p < 0.05. IRB approval was obtained. RESULTS: There were a total of 881 HCW who presented for COVID-19 testing: 316 (35.8%) tested positive; 216 (68.4%) were female, mean age was 39. Cough was the most common presenting symptom (92.7%), followed by subjective fever (63.3%), myalgia (57.9%), and chills (46.8%)(Fig 1). RNs [110 (34.8%)] and physicians [39 (12.3%)] accounted for nearly 50% of cases. Hospitalizations occurred in 22(6.9%); 2(0.6%) died from COVID-19. See Fig 2 for symptoms associated with hospitalizations. African Americans (OR 4.52, CI95 1.54–12.50), and those with hypertension (3.14, 1.32–7.23) and obesity (2.98, 1.25–6.89) were more likely to be hospitalized. Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: HCW remain at risk for COVID-19 infection with respiratory and constitutional symptoms as the most common presentation. RNs were among the most affected. This study supports other reports that African Americans and those with pre-existing comorbidities have greater morbidity with COVID-19 – we have documented that these inequities are also prevalent amongst HCW. This should be considered when testing for and implementing practices to avoid risk of COVID-19 among HCW.

Comparison of Singleplex qPCR and the Luminex MAGPIX Platform for the Detection of Viral Pathogens,14.026196,12.239754,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been accompanied by the emergence of distinct viral clades, although their clinical significance has yet to be fully elucidated. While whole genome sequencing efforts have identified viral diversity over time, less is known about the clinical significance of this diversity. This study assessed the nasopharyngeal viral loads within patients over time to determine if these changes affect clinical parameters. METHODS: Samples were collected from patients presenting to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Cycle threshold (Ct) values less than 35 were considered positive, and whole genome sequencing was performed by reverse transcription, multiplex PCR, and Nanopore sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on sequenced isolates and compared with publicly available global sequences. Sequence characteristics and viral loads were correlated with each clade. RESULTS: 177 samples were analyzed from March 14, 2020, through May 1, 2020. Most of the sequences (92.6%) clustered in three main clades [Figure 1]. Clade IDs were ordered by relative abundance as Clades 1 (n=122, 68.9%), 2 (n=34, 19.2%), and 3 (n=8, 4.5%). Over this time, Clade 1 viruses have been increasing in incidence across the USA and globally while Clade 2 viruses were uniquely predominant in Illinois with limited global distribution. Ct values were compared across clades [Figure 2]. Significantly lower average Ct values (higher viral loads) were observed in Clade 1 relative to both Clade 2 (p=0.0002) and Clade 3 (p=0.0011). These findings were independent of time from symptom onset to specimen collection. Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Isolates with Number of Clades and Clade Distribution [Image: see text] Associations Between Viral Clade and Ct Value [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 genotype may impact viral load in the upper airways. It remains to be determined whether this difference in clades may impact transmission potential and overall viral spread. Further longitudinal studies with more specimens and associated clinical data are needed. DISCLOSURES: Michael G.

An increased number of PED cases caused by variant PEDV have been reported in many countries since 2010. S protein is the main immunogenic protein containing some B-cell epitopes that can induce neutralizing antibodies of PEDV. In this study, the construction, expression and purification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE) without domain III (PEΔIII) as a vector was performed for the delivery of PEDV S-A or S-B. PE(ΔIII) PEDV S-A and PE(ΔIII) PEDV S-B recombinant proteins were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. The immunogenicity of PEDV S-A and PEDV S-B subunit vaccines were evaluated in mice. The results showed that PEDV-S-B vaccine could not only induce specific humoral and Th1 type-dominant cellular immune responses, but also stimulate PEDV-specific mucosal immune responses in mice. PEDV-S-B subunit vaccine is a novel candidate mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection.","Sun, Leqiang; Tang, Yajie; Yan, Keji; Chen, Huanchun; Zhang, Huawei",Animal Diseases,113,1

Case Series and Review of the Literature.,14.009029,12.095042,2020-11-05,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to spread and evolve across the planet. The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century. Hence, what we learn effectively from the current COVID-19 pandemic shall have broad, enduring, and intergenerational relevance for the future of planetary heath and society.","Kuguyo, Oppah; Kengne, Andre Pascal; Dandara, Collet",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,113,2

The purpose of this study was to correlate the clinicopathological findings and viral antigen distribution with the genotypic characteristics of CCoV in 11 puppies from nine premises in five states that were submitted for diagnostic investigation at Cornell University between 2008 and 2013. CCoV antigen was found in epithelial cells of small intestinal villi in all puppies and the colon in 2 of the 10 puppies where colon specimens were available. No evidence of systemic CCoV infection was found. Comparative sequence analyses of viral RNA extracted from intestinal tissues revealed CCoV-II genotype in 9 out of 11 puppies. Of the nine CCoV-IIs, five were subtyped as group IIa and one as IIb, while three CCoVs could not be subtyped. One of the CCoV-IIa variants was isolated in cell culture. Infection with CCoV alone was found in five puppies, of which two also had small intestinal intussusception. Concurrent infections with either parvovirus (n = 1), attaching-effacing Escherichia coli (n = 4), or protozoan parasites (n = 3) were found in the other six puppies. CCoV is an important differential diagnosis in outbreaks of severe enterocolitis among puppies between 4 days and 21 weeks of age that are housed at high population density. These findings will assist with the rapid laboratory diagnosis of enteritis in puppies and highlight the need for continued surveillance for CCoV variants and intestinal viral diseases of global significance.","Licitra, Beth N; Whittaker, Gary R; Dubovi, Edward J; Duhamel, Gerald E",Journal of clinical microbiology,113,1

The width (WSI) and the area of submucosal invasion (ASI) have been suggested as additional parameters to assess the risk of LNM. A review of the literature was undertaken on the correlation between WSI and ASI parameters and the incidence of LNM. METHODS A Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Library search was performed to retrieve all studies reporting correlation between WSI/ASI and risk of LNM in T1 colorectal cancer. RESULTS Eight studies including 1727 patients were identified. All considered the degree of WSI and its influence on LNM: seven assessed different width cut-off of submucosal invasion, and one study the mean width of submucosal invasion in patients having or not involved lymph nodes. The WSI was significantly a prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05) in four studies. Both 2 and 3 mm seem to be the most discriminatory cut-off values of submucosal width invasion in defining the risk difference of LNM above and below the cut-off (2 mm, OR = infinite; 3 mm, OR = 6.9). Patients having a cut-off ≤ 5 mm of WSI showed a low risk (5.6%) of LNM rendering radical surgery unnecessary. Four studies assessed the risk of LNM according to the involved submucosal area (width × depth). In two of these, the ASI was a significant prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The WSI and ASI seem to be reliable prognostic factors for LNM in T1 colorectal cancer. There is no agreement on ideal cut-off value.","Cracco, Nicola; Todaro, Valentina; Pedrazzi, Giuseppe; Del Rio, Paolo; Haboubi, Najib; Zinicola, Roberto",International journal of colorectal disease,113,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were assigned to group 1 if they died (n=9) and to group 2 if they made a full recovery (n=6). Two reviewers scored chest radiographs and CT examinations for segmental involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. RESULTS Eight patients had ground-glass opacity (53%), five had ground-glass and consolidation in combination (33%), five had pleural effusion (33%), and four patients had interlobular thickening (27%). Of 281 CT findings, 151 (54%) were peripheral, 68 (24%) were central, and 62 (22%) had a mixed location. The number of involved lung segments was higher in group 1. The lower lobe was more commonly involved (mean, 12.2 segments) than in the upper and middle lobes combined (mean, 6.3 segments). The mean number of lung segments involved was 12.3 segments in group 1 and 3.4 segments in group 2. The CT lung score (mean±SD, 15.78±7.9 vs 7.3±5.7, p=0.003), chest radiographic score (20.8±1.7 vs 5.6±5.4; p=0.001), and mechanical ventilation duration (13.11±8.3 vs 0.5±1.2 days; p=0.002) were higher in group 1. All nine group 1 patients and three of six group 2 patients had pleural effusion (p=0.52). CONCLUSION CT of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus predominantly showed ground-glass opacities, with peripheral lower lobe preference. Pleural effusion and higher CT lung and chest radiographic scores correlate with poor prognosis and short-term mortality.","Das, Karuna M; Lee, Edward Y; Enani, Mushira A; AlJawder, Suhaila E; Singh, Rajvir; Bashir, Salman; Al-Nakshbandi, Nizar; AlDossari, Khalid; Larsson, Sven G",AJR.

Although isolated cases have been reported in the literature, no series has yet been published on the use of this approach to treat colorectal cancer. We describe the surgical technique and perioperative outcomes of this approach in 15 patients diagnosed for colorectal cancer. METHODS We have used several devices to gain transumbilical access to the abdominal cavity, usually working with 3 cannulae to insert the instruments. We used a 5 mm endograsper, and articulated rotating (roticulating) endoscissors and endodissector to assist dissection. Vascular control and section of the rectum were performed using roticulating endostaplers. We combined the use of curved and straight instruments as required for each step during surgery. The dissection technique performed was the same as the one we normally use in conventional laparoscopy. Specimens were extracted through the umbilical incision. RESULTS The most commonly performed procedure was sigmoidectomy (n=7), followed by high anterior resection of the rectum (n=5). The mean surgical time was 185±44.9 minutes. The mean hospital stay was 6.2±4.7 days. Three cases (20%) were converted to conventional laparoscopy. Surgery was curative in all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Single-access transumbilical laparoscopic surgery is feasible and safe for treating colorectal carcinoma when performed by surgeons with ample experience in laparoscopic colorectal resection. Further studies are needed to determine the advantages and drawbacks of this procedure.","Arteaga González, Iván; Martín Malagón, Antonio; Garcia, Sara Gonzalez; Fernández, Eudaldo M Lopez-Tomassetti; Pallares, Angel Carrillo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",113,31

A Self-report Questionnaire, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Resilience Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale were used for data collection. OUTCOMES & RESULTS Participants presented higher levels of anxiety, meaning in life (presence), general self-efficacy and resilience (than average scale). Parents had higher values than university students in state anxiety, state-trait anxiety (total), meaning in life (presence) and resilience. Individuals with higher levels of resilience and meaning in life had lower anxiety levels. A significant correlation was observed for the regression coefficients according to pathway analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Families having members with SEND, although experiencing difficult situations and anxiety due to the unprecedented conditions of the pandemic, activate mechanisms, such as self-efficacy, meaning in life and resilience, to maintain their balance and mental health.","Tsibidaki, Assimina",Research in developmental disabilities,113,33

In this report, we examined the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery through a single incision using a flexible endoscope in a clinical setting. Specifically, we performed cholecystectomy using single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic (SIMPLE) surgery. METHODS Thirteen patients with cholecystolithiasis or gallbladder polyp underwent SIMPLE cholecystectomy using a newly developed short-type flexible endoscope with a working length of 60 cm. Twenty-seven patients underwent standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a 5-mm rigid laparoscope. We retrospectively compared the surgical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the short-type flexible endoscope was successfully carried out. No gallbladder perforation occurred, but perforation occurred in four cases in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Although no other surgical outcomes differed between the two groups, the flexible endoscope had several advantages over the standard laparoscope. The scope provided a flexible view of the operating field. The gallbladder dissection using the cutting device via the scope was easier and safer than that in standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The water-jet, suctioning, and self-cleaning lens functions of the scope served the surgery well. CONCLUSIONS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using a short-type flexible endoscope has surgical outcomes equivalent to those of standard single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but this endoscope with multiple functions may make the surgical procedures less stressful and safer.","Yamaguchi, Takashi; Abe, Nobutsugu; Matsunobu, Shuuichiro; Mizuno, Hideaki; Yanagida, Osamu; Takeuchi, Hirohisa; Masaki, Tadahiko; Mori, Toshiyuki; Sugiyama, Masanori",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,113,1

One group significantly affected both educationally and psychosocially is college students, as they experienced an abrupt cancellation of in-person courses, were forced to leave their dormitories, and witnessed a loss of social activities. Method: This study utilizes survey data from college students in the throes of COVID-19-based home schooling collected for a Belgium-based international study including more than 134,000 participants from 28 countries around the world. Two hundred fifty-seven college students from a U.S. university participated in this study. Results: Results indicate that college students are affected by COVID-19 on several levels, including fear of themselves or others in their social network contracting the virus, apprehension about the changes in coursework delivery and unclear instructional parameters, overall loneliness, compromised motivation, and sleep disturbances, as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Analyses reveal a positive relationship between academic frustrations and mental health symptoms, the latter also negatively related to trust in the government regarding the preventive measures being implemented. Worries about becoming infected were positively related to mental health symptoms and negatively related to trust in the government. Results and implications are discussed.

METHODS A retrospective chart review identified men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) from July 2004 through July 2016 at our institution. Cases underwent surgical interventions for UI following RP. Controls had RP during the study period but did not have an intervention for UI following RP. We used the UI scale of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) 26 to: (1) quantify post-RP UI before and after UI intervention overall and for specific surgical procedures; (2) evaluate the significance of improvement in post-RP UI before and after UI intervention and (3) identify controls with levels of post-RP UI that were comparable to the cases. RESULTS Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight RPs were performed; 48 patients underwent further surgical intervention (39 slings, 9 artificial urinary sphincter, AUS). For 20 cases with complete EPIC UI data (15 slings, 5 AUS), the median (IQR) pre-UI intervention score was 27.00 (IQR 22.75-42.75). Improvement was significant overall (p < 0.001) and for slings (p = 0.001). 71/2085 controls had post-prostatectomy UI scores ≤ 27.0, suggesting that they may have benefited from a post-RP surgical intervention for UI. CONCLUSION Data support the effectiveness of surgery to treat post-RP UI. A sizeable population of unidentified men may benefit from a surgical intervention to treat urinary incontinence after RP.","Alam, Syed; Kershen, Richard; Staff, Ilene; McLaughlin, Tara; Tortora, Joseph; Wagner, Joseph",World journal of urology,113,11

Dimethyl Fumarate is a disease-modifying medication used to treat RRMS patients that can induce lymphopenia. We aimed to immunophenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in RRMS patients cross-sectionally and examine the characteristics and modifications of lymphopenia over time. METHODS Characterization of PBMC was done by multiparametric flow cytometry. Patients had been on treatment for up to 4 years and were grouped into lymphopenic (DMF-L) and non-lymphopenic (DMF-N) patients. RESULTS Lymphopenia affected the cell population changes over time, with other patient characteristics (gender, age, and previous treatment status) also having significant effects. In both lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic patients, PBMC percentages were reduced over time. While overall T and B cells frequencies were not affected, males, older patients and untreated patients had significant changes in B cell subpopulations over time. CD4+ to CD8+T cell ratio increased significantly in lymphopenic patients over time. CD4-CD8-T cell population was similarly reduced in both lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic patients, over time. While the monocyte and NK overall populations were not changed, non-classical monocyte subpopulation decreased over time in lymphopenic patients. We also found CD56-CD16+ and CD56-CD16- NK cells frequencies changed over time in lymphopenic patients. Immune populations showed correlations with clinical outcomes measured by EDSS and relapse rate. Analysis of the overall immunophenotype showed that, while groups divided by other patient characteristics showed differences, the lymphopenia status overrode these differences, resulting in similar immunophenotype within DMF-L. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide evidence that under the same therapy, lymphopenia affects how the immunophenotype changes over time and can override the differences associated with other patient characteristics and possibly mask other significant changes in the immune profile of patients.","Lee, Chieh-Hsin; Jiang, Bei; Nakhaei-Nejad, Maryam; Barilla, David; Blevins, Gregg; Giuliani, Fabrizio",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,113,1

An early identification of PC needs is fundamental in the care approach: it provides effective patient-centred care and could improve outcomes such as patient quality of life, reduction of the overall length of hospitalisation, survival rate prolongation, the satisfaction of both the patients and caregivers and cost-effectiveness. METHODS We reviewed literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the most important ethical challenges related to the implementation of AI-based data processing services in PC and advance care planning. RESULTS AI-based mortality predictions can signal the need for patients to obtain access to personalised communication or palliative care consultation, but they should not be used as a unique parameter to activate early PC and initiate an ACP. A number of factors must be included in the ethical decision-making process related to initiation of ACP conversations, among which are autonomy and quality of life, the risk of worsening healthcare status, the commitment by caregivers, the patients' psychosocial and spiritual distress and their wishes to initiate EOL discussions CONCLUSIONS: Despite the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-based services into routine healthcare practice could have a positive effect of promoting early activation of ACP by means of a timely identification of PC needs, from an ethical point of view, the provision of these automated techniques raises a number of critical issues that deserve further exploration.","De Panfilis, Ludovica; Peruselli, Carlo; Tanzi, Silvia; Botrugno, Carlo",BMJ supportive & palliative care,113,26

METHODS A convenience sample of 22 EMT/Paramedics were recruited from an emergency department at one of the designated Ebola centers. Each provider participated in one of three on-site focus groups. Participants answered questions about how they gained their knowledge, felt about caring for EVD patients, made decisions about caring for EVD patients, and suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis. RESULTS Analysis revealed five prominent themes: reactions to scare, education/training, danger, decision making, and suggestions for future responses. Overall, first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD. They were more comfortable caring for EVD patients if they received adequate education and transparency from the administration. This resulted in a decreased perceived danger of the disease and decreased hesitancy when caring for EVD patients. However, those that expressed the most hesitancy also expressed the most emotional distress. Suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness included continuing education, tiered training models, peer training models, collaboration between emergency medical services (EMS) systems, better communication between departments, and the development of an infectious disease response team. CONCLUSIONS Although first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD, this did not come without hesitation and emotional distress. Some of these concerns may be mitigated by first providing a clear definition of ""duty to care,"" followed by interventions such as the development of clear and consistent ID preparedness training and interventions that address the emotional distress experienced by these providers.","Alexander, Andreia B; Masters, M Meredith; Warren, Karma",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,113,31

Causes for this disparity are unknown. The authors of this report examined the receipt of cancer treatment among AI/AN patients compared with white patients. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 338,204 patients who were diagnosed at age ≥65 years with breast, colon, lung, or prostate cancer between 1996 and 2005 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Nationally accepted guidelines for surgical and adjuvant therapy and surveillance were selected as metrics of optimal, guideline-concordant care. Treatment analyses compared AI/ANs with matched whites. RESULTS Across cancer types, AI/ANs were less likely to receive optimal cancer treatment and were less likely to undergo surgery (P ≤ .025 for all cancers). Adjuvant therapy rates were significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P < .001) and colon cancer (P = .001). Rates of post-treatment surveillance also were lower among AI/ANs and were statistically significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P = .002) and prostate cancer (P < .001). Nonreceipt of optimal cancer treatment was associated with significantly worse survival across cancer types. Disease-specific survival for those who did not undergo surgery was significantly lower for patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62), colon cancer (HR, 0.74), prostate cancer (HR, 0.52), and lung cancer (HR, 0.36). Survival rates also were significantly lower for those patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (HR, 0.56), colon cancer (HR, 0.59), or prostate cancer (HR, 0.81; all 95% confidence intervals were <1.0). CONCLUSIONS Fewer AI/AN patients than white patients received guideline-concordant cancer treatment across the 4 most common cancers. Efforts to explain these differences are critical to improving cancer care and survival for AI/AN patients.","Javid, Sara H; Varghese, Thomas K; Morris, Arden M; Porter, Michael P; He, Hao; Buchwald, Dedra; Flum, David R",Cancer,113,31

Frustrated by not being able to directly care for patients, medical students across the country formed diverse volunteer initiatives to help frontline clinicians. In this article, the authors describe the essential role of medical students at Weill Cornell Medicine in quickly designing and building a large registry of COVID-19 patients who presented at 3 New York City hospitals. The Cornell COVID-19 registry, which contains granular clinical information on more than 4,000 patients, informed hospital operations and guided clinical management during the first wave of the pandemic. One month after its creation, the registry led to the first published description of the clinical characteristics of a U.S.-based cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Using their experience as a model, the authors propose that students who cannot participate in their clinical clerkships because of the pandemic can augment their traditional medical education by contributing to COVID-19 research. In the case described in this article, students reviewed management of COVID-19 patients, followed inpatients throughout their hospitalization (much like students would on clinical rotations), and refined their interpersonal skills through discussions with patients and patients' families during follow-up calls. The authors conclude that medical students who are displaced from their hospital rotations can further their education and provide an invaluable contribution to the fight against COVID-19 by serving as essential frontline researchers.","Alshak, Mark N; Li, Han A; Wehmeyer, Graham T",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,113,19

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health, particularly in young adults (YA) who may already struggle to find structure and support. Methods: Surveys were distributed electronically to YA with T1D (ages 17-30) associated with the College Diabetes Network, a nonprofit organization serving YA with diabetes, in Spring and Fall 2020. Participants in each cohort were asked to rate their worry about contracting COVID-19 (scale of 1-5, 5=""very worried""), and report current diagnoses of depression or anxiety by a healthcare professional (yes/no). T-tests and chi-square tests examined the differences in reported COVID-19 worry, anxiety, and depression from Spring to Fall, as well as the association between worry and diagnosed depression/anxiety at both time points. Results: Participants were demographically similar at both time points ((M±SD) Spring: n=468, age 22.1±2.7 years, 82% female, 84% white;Fall: n=375, 22.4±3.2 years, 79% female, 82% white;p&gt;.10). Overall, participants endorsed significantly more COVID-19 worry in Fall than in Spring (3.57±1.1 vs. 3.29±1.4;p&lt;.001).

Conclusions: YA with T1D endorse more worry about contracting COVID-19 as the pandemic progresses, with an upward trend in anxiety diagnoses. Worry was exacerbated in those with a pre-existing mental health condition. These results underscore the need for greater support for YA with T1D, to reduce COVID-19 related worry and protect mental health outcomes.","Commissariat, Persis V.; St Pierre, Danielle Sabino Anna Lee Sara Saylor Jennifer",Diabetes,113,33

The hybridoma was first produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2/O-Ag14 mutant myeloma cells. The mAb is produced and purified using multistep ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography protocols. T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Because T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes minimal cytokine release, both treatment of rejection and induction of immunosuppression were accomplished with significantly fewer and milder untoward effects (cytokine release syndrome) than its comparator OKT3. Since T10B9 is directed against the αβ heterodimer of the CD3 epitope, it spares the gamma delta (γδ) region. These gamma delta (γδ) T cells have a unique role in the immune response controlling many serious human diseases and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. T10B9 has a relatively short duration of action, depleting T cells for only 10 to 14 days, unlike the protracted depletion seen with thymoglobulin and Campath-1H.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The synovial WBC count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (%PMN), and the serum CRP and ESR levels obtained > six weeks after primary THA were compared between 50 infected and 88 non-infected THAs, and in patients with symptoms for more than or less than two weeks. Diagnostic thresholds for the synovial WBC count were calculated using area under the curve calculation. RESULTS The synovial WBC count was significantly higher in patients with symptoms for ≤ two weeks compared with those with symptoms for > two weeks (p = 0.03). The optimal threshold for diagnosing PJI for the synovial WBC count was 5750 cells/µL (sensitivity 94; specificity 100; PPV 100%; NPV 89%; AUC 99%) and 1556 cells/µL (sensitivity 91; specificity 94; PPV 87% and NPV 97%; AUC 95%), respectively. The thresholds for the cut-offs based on duration of symptoms improved the diagnostic performance of this test.

Although their lateral thermal spread has been shown to be smaller than that of other electrosurgical devices, ultrasonically activated surgical devices (USADs) have been suggested as one of the causes. We therefore hypothesized that cavitation generated by USADs could cause injuries to pancreatic tissue. Our retrospective study showed that the amylase activity in the drainage fluid of patients in whom surgery was performed using a USAD with a curved blade was significantly higher than that in patients in whom surgery was performed using a USAD with a straight blade. We therefore focused on the effects of straight and curved USAD blades. METHODS The distribution of microbubbles generated in degassed water, which produce mechanical and biological tissue destructive forces, was measured and compared between the two types of USAD. RESULTS More microbubbles were found to be generated from the side aspect of the curved blade, and the mechanical and biological destructive forces were found to be significantly higher than those generated by the side aspect of the straight blade. CONCLUSIONS These findings strongly suggest that cavitation generated by USADs could injure pancreatic tissues in the clinical cases. Surgeons should be aware of these properties of devices to achieve safe and secure surgeries.","Gao, Tao; Lau, Bik Ee; Yamaguchi, Tadashi; Hanari, Naoyuki; Gunji, Hisashi; Kano, Masayuki; Matsubara, Hisahiro; Hayashi, Hideki",Surgery today,113,33

For the diagnosis of SARS virus infection, an epidemiological investigation is necessary to know whether the patient has been exposed to a risk in a country where the SARS virus is circulating or whether the patient had worked in a laboratory handling SARS virus. The detection of SARS virus is possible in various clinical samples (including urine) by viral culture or RT-PCR. The handling of those samples and RNA extraction must be performed in a BSL3 laboratory. The SARS virus RT-PCR is poorly sensitive, therefore the test should be performed on samples collected consecutively for several days. In front of a suspicion of A/H5N1, similar procedures are recommended. An epidemiologic investigation is necessary to specify whether the patient stayed in a country where A/H5N1 virus was circulating. Clinical samples needed for a specific diagnosis are: nasopharyngeal, throat-swab or fecal samples, cerebrospinal fluid and blood. The presence of A/H5N1 virus is confirmed by viral isolation or RNA detection by RT-PCR. RNA extraction must be performed in a BSL3 laboratory.

However, in some ambiguous cases other, more detailed assay might be desired. The genetic material of influenza virus is highly unstable and constantly mutates. It is known that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) results in resistance to commercially available anti-viral drugs. The genetic drift of the virus could also result in weakening of immune response to infection. Finally, in a substantial number of patients co-infection with various virus strains or types has been confirmed.

Subjects All patients with a diagnosis of SARS between 11 March and 29 March 2003 who had no pre-existing haematological disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine factors associated with adverse outcome. RESULTS 64 male and 93 female patients were included in this study. The most common findings included lymphopenia in 153 (98%) of the 157 patients, neutrophilia in 129 (82%), thrombocytopenia in 87 patients (55%), followed by thrombocytosis in 77 (49%), and isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in 96 patients (63%). The haemoglobin count dropped by more than 20 g/l from baseline in 95 (61%) patients. Four patients (2.5%) developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Lymphopenia was shown in haemato-lymphoid organs at postmortem examination. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and a high concentration of lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed in 31 patients. The counts of CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells fell early in the course of illness. Low counts of CD4 and CD8 cells at presentation were associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal haematological variables were common among patients with SARS.

In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification.

RESULTS Some intergeographical characteristics in demographics, and risk factors were found accompanying early atherosclerosis marker differences. In Asia where the subjects were at lower risk, the mean CCAIMT was 4% lower than in Africa/Middle East and Latin America. On multiple linear regression analysis CCAIMT and carotid plaque were independently associated with increased Framingham cardiovascular score (FCS) without heterogeneity across geographic regions.

The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. METHODS: Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. RESULTS: Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M; Drawve, Grant; Harris, Casey",J Anxiety Disord,113,19

Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.6% in patients with an early decision not to consider intensive care admission (67.1% in persons who developed respiratory failure vs 16.7% in patients without respiratory failure (p < 0.001)). Of 104 patients without early decision not to consider intensive care admission but who developed respiratory failure, 59 were eventually not transferred to intensive care unit with in-hospital mortality of 25.4%; 45 were transferred to the intensive care unit with mortality of 64.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians applied all levels of treatment in oldest-old hospitalized with COVID-19. Early decisions not to consider intensive care admission were taken in two thirds of the cohort of whom more than 50% survived to hospital discharge by means of conservative treatment.","Piers, Ruth; Van Braeckel, Eva; Benoit, Dominique; Van Den Noortgate, Nele",Palliat Med,113,20

Considering the universal risk of infection, the outpatient services in Pakistan need to be redesigned. Starting with risk assessment of the facility and provision of a dedicated telephone connection, structure and workflow need to be redesigned in order to minimise risk of exposure to healthcare professionals, staff and patients. Patients with COVID-19 patients should be identified before they arrive in the facility and should be served expeditiously, in an environment which prevents cross-transmission of infection.

So far, 60 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1.4 million people have died because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 - Gln690) at 10 ng/ml (0.13 nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was transient with a peak at 10 min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 - Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung vascular cells by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.","Suzuki, Yuichiro J; Nikolaienko, Sofia I; Dibrova, Vyacheslav A; Dibrova, Yulia V; Vasylyk, Volodymyr M; Novikov, Mykhailo Y; Shults, Nataliia V; Gychka, Sergiy G",Vascul Pharmacol,113,3

The existence of RAS is well established in metabolic organs, including pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - angiotensin II pathway contributes to the impairment of insulin secretion, glucose transport, fat distribution, and adipokines production. However, the activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - angiotensin (1-7) pathway, a novel branch of the RAS, plays an opposite role in the ACE pathway, which could reverse these consequences by improving local microcirculation, inflammation, stress state, structure remolding, and insulin signaling pathway. In addition, new studies indicate the protective RAS arm possesses extraordinary ability to enhance brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and induces browning of white adipose tissue, and consequently, it leads to increased energy expenditure in the form of heat instead of ATP synthesis. Interestingly, ACE2 is the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is threating public health worldwide. The main complications of SARS-CoV-2 infected death patients include many energy metabolism-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes. The specific mechanism leading to this phenomenon is largely unknown. Here, we summarize the latest pharmacological and genetic tools on regulating ACE/ACE2 balance and highlight the beneficial effects of the ACE2 pathway axis hyperactivity on glycolipid metabolism, as well as the thermogenic modulation.","Cao, Xi; Song, Li-Ni; Yang, Jin-Kui",Clin Sci (Lond),113,16

Early identification of high-risk parameters is required in order to provide the best therapeutic approach. Coronary, thoracic aorta and aortic valve calcium can be measured from a non-gated chest computer tomography (CT) and are validated predictors of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, their prognostic role in acute systemic inflammatory diseases, such as COVID-19, has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the association of coronary artery calcium and total thoracic calcium on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 1093 consecutive patients from 16 Italian hospitals with a positive swab for COVID-19 and an admission chest CT for pneumonia severity assessment were included. At CT, coronary, aortic valve and thoracic aorta calcium were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated separately and combined together (total thoracic calcium) by a central Core-lab blinded to patients' outcomes.

Compared with their condition before catching the infection, the men showed, in different degrees, a decline in all aspects of sexual function as assessed by the international index of erectile function. They started to develop premature ejaculation or exacerbate an already existing condition according to the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool scoring. Beck's depression inventory revealed deterioration of the men's moods up to severe depression. The sex-related hormones (testosterone-total and free, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and estradiol) of these men were within normal levels.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic.","Barnes, Stuart J",Soc Sci Med,113,4

Comment,13.888761,12.077675,2021,"BACKGROUND: Initial reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in children suggested that very young age and comorbidities may increase risk of severe evolution, but these findings remained to be confirmed. We aimed to analyze the clinical spectrum of hospitalized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and predictors of severe disease evolution. METHODS: We conducted a French national prospective surveillance of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included all children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 60 hospitals during February 15 to June 1, 2020. The main outcome was the proportion of children with severe disease, defined by hemodynamic or ventilatory (invasive or not) support requirement. RESULTS: We included 397 hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified several clinical patterns, ranging from paucisymptomatic children, admitted for surveillance, to lower respiratory tract infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children <90 days old accounted for 37% of cases (145 of 397), but only 4 (3%) had severe disease. Excluding children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (n = 29) and hospitalized for a diagnosis not related to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 62), 23 of 306 (11%) children had severe disease, including 6 deaths. Factors independently associated with severity were age &#8805;10 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-10.3), hypoxemia (OR = 8.9 [2.6-29.7]), C-reactive protein level &#8805;80 mg/L (OR = 6.6 [1.4-27.5]). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with preliminary reports, young age was not an independent factor associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and children <90 days old were at the lowest risk of severe disease evolution. This may help physicians to better identify risk of severe disease progression in children.","Ouldali, Naïm; Yang, David Dawei; Madhi, Fouad; Levy, Michael; Gaschignard, Jean; Craiu, Irina; Guiddir, Tamazoust; Schweitzer, Cyril; Wiedemann, Arnaud; Lorrot, Mathie; Romain, Anne-Sophie; Garraffo, Aurélie; Haas, Hervé; Rouget, Sébastien; de Pontual, Loïc; Aupiais, Camille; Martinot, Alain; Toubiana, Julie; Dupic, Laurent; Minodier, Philippe; Passard, Manon; Belot, Alexandre; Levy, Corinne; Béchet, Stephane; Jung, Camille; Sarakbi, Mayssa; Ducrocq, Sarah; Danekova, Nevena; Jhaouat, Imen; Vignaud, Olivier; Garrec, Nathalie; Caron, Elisabeth; Cohen, Robert; Gajdos, Vincent; Angoulvant, François",Pediatrics,113,10

While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups. However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing. Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19-related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented. Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval. There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients. Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS, myocarditis or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard. We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of ECMO for COVID-19.","Badulak, Jenelle; Antonini, M Velia; Stead, Christine M; Shekerdemian, Lara; Raman, Lakshmi; Paden, Matthew L; Agerstrand, Cara; Bartlett, Robert H; Barrett, Nicholas; Combes, Alain; Lorusso, Roberto; Mueller, Thomas; Ogino, Mark T; Peek, Giles; Pellegrino, Vincent; Rabie, Ahmed A; Salazar, Leonardo; Schmidt, Matthieu; Shekar, Kiran; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel",ASAIO. j,113,16

During March-May 2020 in Fulton County, Georgia, >50% of COVID-19-associated deaths occurred among LTCF residents, although these persons represented <1% of the population (3,4). Mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been an effective strategy for identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in LTCFs (5). This analysis sought to evaluate the timing at which mass testing took place in relation to the known presence of a COVID-19 infection and the resulting number of infections that occurred. In 15 LTCFs that performed facility-wide testing in response to an identified case, high prevalences of additional cases in residents and staff members were found at initial testing (28.0% and 7.4%, respectively), suggesting spread of infection had already occurred by the time the first case was identified. Prevalence was also high during follow-up, with a total of 42.4% of residents and 11.8% of staff members infected overall in the response facilities. In comparison, 13 LTCFs conducted testing as a preventive strategy before a case was identified. Although the majority of these LTCFs identified at least one COVID-19 case, the prevalence was significantly lower at initial testing in both residents and staff members (0.5% and 1.0%, respectively) and overall after follow-up (1.5% and 1.7%, respectively).

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of ß-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles. Altogether, these results highlight how E and M proteins may influence the properties of S proteins and promote the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","Boson, Bertrand; Legros, Vincent; Zhou, Bingjie; Siret, Eglantine; Mathieu, Cyrille; Cosset, François-Loïc; Lavillette, Dimitri; Denolly, Solène",J. biol. chem,113,20

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of early anti-inflammatory treatment (AIT) with intravenous anakinra with or without glucocorticoids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia from February 26 to April 29, 2020, to assess the efficacy of early AIT with intravenous anakinra (100 mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with tapering) alone or in combination with a glucocorticoid (intravenous methylprednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg daily, with tapering). The standard of care (SOC) treatment was hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin with or without antivirals and anticoagulants. Late rescue AIT with anakinra or tocilizumab was also evaluated. Treatment effect on overall survival was assessed by a propensity score-adjusted Cox model. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were analyzed; 63 patients received early AIT (30 received anakinra alone and 33 received anakinra plus a glucocorticoid) at admission, and 65 patients did not receive early AIT and were used as controls; of the latter 65 patients, 44 received the SOC treatment alone and 21 received the SOC treatment plus late rescue AIT. After adjustment for all the unbalanced baseline covariates, early AIT reduced the hazard of mortality by 74% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.26; P < .001). The effect was similar in patients receiving anakinra alone (adjusted HR = 0.28; P = .04) and anakinra plus a glucocorticoid (adjusted HR = 0.33; P = .07). Late rescue treatment did not show a significant advantage over SOC treatment alone (adjusted HR = 0.82; P = .70). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests, on a larger series of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the potential efficacy and safety of the early use of high doses of intravenous anakinra with or without glucocorticoids.","Pontali, Emanuele; Volpi, Stefano; Signori, Alessio; Antonucci, Giancarlo; Castellaneta, Marco; Buzzi, Davide; Montale, Amedeo; Bustaffa, Marta; Angelelli, Alessia; Caorsi, Roberta; Giambruno, Elisa; Bobbio, Nicoletta; Feasi, Marcello; Gueli, Ilaria; Tricerri, Francesca; Calautti, Francesca; Castagnola, Elio; Moscatelli, Andrea; Rollandi, Gian Andrea; Ravelli, Angelo; Cassola, Giovanni; Sormani, Maria Pia; Gattorno, Marco",J Allergy Clin Immunol,113,18

In this study, we employed two bivalve molluscan species from the genus Ruditapes as sentinel organisms to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 signals in the marine coastal environment. Estuarine sediments from the natural clam banks were also analyzed. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR, targeting IP4, E and N1 genomic regions. Positive samples were also subjected to a PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay in order to discriminate between intact and altered capsids, obtaining indirect information about the viability of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces were detected in 9/12 clam samples by RT-qPCR, from which 4 were positive for two different target regions. Viral quantification ranged from <LoQ to 4.48 Log genomic copies/g of digestive tissue. Regarding the sediment samples, 3/12 were positive by RT-qPCR, but only IP4 region was successfully amplificated. Quantification values for sediment samples ranged from <LoQ to 3.60 Log genomic copies/g of sediment. RNA signals disappeared in the PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay, indicating non-infectious potential. In addition, the recently discovered human-specific gut associated bacteriophage crAssphage was also quantified as a biomarker for the presence of human-derived wastewater contamination on the study area. CrAssphage was detected in 100% of both types of samples with quantification values ranging from <LoQ to 5.94 Log gc/g digestive tissue and from <LoQ to 4.71 Log gc/g sediment. Statistical analysis also showed that quantification levels for the crAssphage in clams are significantly higher than in sediments. These findings represent the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the marine environment, demonstrating that it can reach these habitats and make contact with the marine life.","Polo, David; Lois, Marta; Fernández-Núñez, María Teresa; Romalde, Jesús L",Sci Total Environ,113,15

Using various estimation strategies and employing a large number of potential confounding factors, we find that the participation rate decreases with city proximity to COVID-19 clusters. Furthermore, the proximity has conditioned impacts according to the proportion of elderly -who are the most threatened- within the city.

Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5% and 87.1-95.7%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.","Hira, Muta Tah; Razzaque, M A; Angione, Claudio; Scrivens, James; Sawan, Saladin; Sarkar, Mosharraf",Sci Rep,113,24

METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either ""COVID-19 suspected"" (positive and negative tested group) or ""COVID-19 not suspected"" (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19.

Hazard ratios were estimated using sex-specific Cox models, stratified by cohort, with age as the time scale. Models included baseline categorical obesity measures, age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. A total of 9105 all-cause deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10 years. Hazard ratios for all-cause death presented J- or U-shaped associations with most obesity measures. With waist and hip circumference included in the same model, for all hip sizes, having a smaller waist was strongly associated with lower risk of death, except for men with the smallest hips. In addition, among those with smaller waists, hip size was strongly negatively associated with risk of death, with &#8776;20% more people identified as being at increased risk compared with waist circumference alone. Conclusions A more complex relationship between hip circumference, waist circumference, and risk of death is revealed when both measures are considered simultaneously. This is particularly true for individuals with smaller waists, where having larger hips was protective. Considering both waist and hip circumference in the clinical setting could help to best identify those at increased risk of death.","Cameron, Adrian J; Romaniuk, Helena; Orellana, Liliana; Dallongeville, Jean; Dobson, Annette J; Drygas, Wojciech; Ferrario, Marco; Ferrieres, Jean; Giampaoli, Simona; Gianfagna, Francesco; Iacoviello, Licia; Jousilahti, Pekka; Kee, Frank; Moitry, Marie; Niiranen, Teemu J; Pajak, Andrzej; Palmieri, Luigi; Palosaari, Tarja; Satu, Männistö; Tamosiunas, Abdonas; Thorand, Barbara; Toft, Ulla; Vanuzzo, Diego; Veikko, Salomaa; Veronesi, Giovanni; Wilsgaard, Tom; Kuulasmaa, Kari; Söderberg, Stefan",J Am Heart Assoc,113,29

METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continuing rounds of seroprevalence studies will help to improve understanding of secular trends and the extent of infection during the course of the pandemic.","Nisar, Muhammad Imran; Ansari, Nadia; Khalid, Farah; Amin, Mashal; Shahbaz, Hamna; Hotwani, Aneeta; Rehman, Najeeb; Pugh, Sierra; Mehmood, Usma; Rizvi, Arjumand; Memon, Arslan; Ahmed, Zahoor; Ahmed, Ashfaque; Iqbal, Junaid; Saleem, Ali Faisal; Aamir, Uzma Bashir; Larremore, Daniel B; Fosdick, Bailey; Jehan, Fyezah",Int J Infect Dis,113,16

Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor ß, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.","Duan, Yang-Yang; Chai, Yong; Zhang, Nai-Li; Zhao, Dong-Mei; Yang, Cheng",J. mol. neurosci,113,5

Defining the positions of the double bonds in the alkyl chain requires conversion of the FAMEs into their respective dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives. Following EI, this derivative allows charge retention on the heterocycle, and concomitant charge remote fragmentation of the alkyl chain to yield key double bond position identifying ions.

The study aimed to find out whether the pandemic has been a factor that has helped to legitimize online teaching and learning as a universal mode of delivery across different fields of studies, or if the Zoom fatigue has shown its limitations. In addition, the research investigated what transformations university experts predict and their vision for the future of higher education. The study found that many lessons learnt during the period of forced adoption of distance education will be used by universities to enhance and expand online learning provisions. This shift will be driven by the investments the universities have made in distance education and the increased familiarity of the students, staff and institutions with e-learning.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory pedagogic research design was implemented in 2020 to examine the COVID-19 Dyadic Online Mentoring Intervention, a four-month individualized approach to mentorship. A survey was completed by mentees in an educational leadership cohort that revealed the benefits and drawbacks of technology for learning within online doctoral mentoring contexts. Additional sources of data were published literature, mentor's notes, email exchanges, and scholarly enrichment products. Findings: Data analysis yielded three themes: (1) mentoring strategies were utilized; (2) the pandemic unsettled reality and (3) personal professional development opportunities were evident. Although life challenges were exacerbated by the pandemic, the online doctoral mentoring intervention met dissertation-related needs and supported academic progress in a Doctorate in Education degree program. Practical implications: Technology-mediated mentoring during crises involves more than modality changes. Faculty mentors should not be solely responsible for mitigating program and dissertation disruption. Academic cultures must support the adoption of pedagogic innovations like high-quality online doctoral mentoring.

Total 133 mutations were detected in 15 samples, with G614D being present in all the samples, while 53 novel mutations as of Jan. 2021 were detected. On receptor-binding domain, 21 substitutions including ten novel mutations were identified. Other novel mutations were located on N-terminal domain (S1 subunit) and dispersed sites in S2 subunit, including two substitutions that remove potential N-glycosylation sites. P681R substitution adjacent to furin cleavage site was detected in one sample.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional survey. METHODS: Review of publicly available public health and academic hospitals guidelines along with review of communication among otolaryngology departments. RESULTS: Among 114 academic institutions affiliated with OHNS residencies, 20 (17.5%) institutions provided public access to some form of guidance on PPE and 73 (64%) provided information on screening or diagnostic testing. PPE guidelines were uniquely described based on several variables: location of care, COVID-19 status, involvement of aerosol generating or high-risk procedures, and physical distance from the patient. Six hospital guidelines were highlighted. Across these six institutions, there was agreement that N95 respirators were needed for high-risk patients undergoing high-risk procedures. Variations existed among institutions for scenarios with low-risk patients. Definitions of the low-risk patient and high-risk procedures were inconsistent among institutions. Three of the highlighted institutions had OHNS departments recommending higher level of airway protection than the institution. CONCLUSIONS: OHNS departments typically had more stringent PPE guidance than their institution. Discrepancies in communicating PPE use were frequent and provide inconsistent information on how healthcare workers should protect themselves in the COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of these inconsistencies serves as an opportunity to standardize communication and develop evidence-based guidelines.

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia for COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from 1 June 2020 to 12 June 2020. All studies reporting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19-positive patients were included. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia were frequently reported by COVID-19-positive patients. Symptoms were more common in females and in younger patients. There was no direct association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of symptoms. However, some evidence was found for a longer duration of these symptoms and increased severity of COVID-19 infection in young patients. CONCLUSION: OTD is commonly reported by COVID-19 patients. Due to limited literature on the association between OTD and COVID-19, it is currently not possible to conclude that these symptoms alone can be used to diagnose COVID-19. However, the presence of OTD can potentially be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 especially in young and female patients. Further research is required to establish the true diagnostic value of these symptoms and efficacy as screening tools for COVID-19 patients.","Zahra, Syeda Anum; Iddawela, Sashini; Pillai, Kiran; Choudhury, Rozina Yasmin; Harky, Amer",Brain Behav,113,20

Protruding from the viral surface is a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, which engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host cell entry. However, studies have reported viral susceptibility in intra- and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking ACE2, suggesting that the S protein may exploit additional receptors for infection. Studies have demonstrated interactions between S protein and innate immune system, including C-lectin type receptors (CLR), toll-like receptors (TLR) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and the non-immune receptor glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Recognition of carbohydrate moieties clustered on the surface of the S protein may drive receptor-dependent internalization, accentuate severe immunopathological inflammation, and allow for systemic spread of infection, independent of ACE2. Furthermore, targeting TLRs, CLRs, and other receptors (Ezrin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4) that do not directly engage SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but may contribute to augmented anti-viral immunity and viral clearance, may represent therapeutic targets against COVID-19.","Gadanec, Laura Kate; McSweeney, Kristen Renee; Qaradakhi, Tawar; Ali, Benazir; Zulli, Anthony; Apostolopoulos, Vasso",Int. j. mol. sci.

There is concern for increased substance use motivated by coping with stress, anxiety, depression, and boredom-all of which may be elevated during the pandemic. The current study examined intraindividual changes (from pre-COVID to during COVID) in young adults' alcohol and marijuana use, perceptions of peers' use (i.e., norms), and motives for use. METHODS: A community sample of young adults (N = 572; Mage= 25.14; 60.8% women) was recruited in Washington State. By using a repeated-measures design, data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020) and again during the initial acute phase of the pandemic (April/May of 2020). RESULTS: Young adults, on average, increased alcohol use frequency but decreased the amount consumed per drinking occasion. No changes in marijuana use were identified. Young adults (on average) perceived that peers had increased the frequency and total amount of alcohol use and perceived that peers were engaging in heavier marijuana use than prior to COVID-19. For alcohol use motives, there was a significant increase in depression coping motives and significant decreases in social, enhancement, and conformity motives. Boredom motives for marijuana use significantly increased, while celebration motives decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Using a prospective design with a sample initially recruited in Washington State, these data indicate that (a) young adults' patterns of alcohol use may have changed, (b) young adults tend to think that peers are engaging in heavier alcohol/marijuana use than before the pandemic, and (c) motives for using alcohol/marijuana may have changed during the pandemic.","Graupensperger, Scott; Fleming, Charles B; Jaffe, Anna E; Rhew, Isaac C; Patrick, Megan E; Lee, Christine M",J Adolesc Health,113,11

We present insights into the benefits and deficiencies of existing tools, as well as the respective roles of the human and automation in ML workflows. Finally, we discuss design implications for the future of Auto-ML tool development. We argue that instead of full automation being the ultimate goal of Auto-ML, designers of these tools should focus on supporting a partnership between the user and the Auto-ML tool. This means that a range of Auto-ML tools will need to be developed to support varying user goals such as simplicity, reproducibility, and reliability.","Xin, Doris; Wu, Eva Yiwei; Lee, Doris Jung-Lin; Salehi, Niloufar; Parameswaran, Aditya",,113,20

This chemokine is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, suggesting a role in lung defenses. However, little is known about the participation of CXCL17 against relevant respiratory pathogens in humans. Here, we evaluated the serum levels and lung tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in a cohort of patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from Mexico City. Peripheral blood samples obtained on admission and seven days after hospitalization were processed for determinations of serum CXCL17 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL17 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHQ) in lung autopsy specimens from patients that succumbed to the disease. Serum CXCL17 levels were also analyzed in two additional comparative cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients. Additionally, the expression of CXCL17 was tested in lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 68 had pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 24 had COVID-19, and 30 with PTB. CXCL17 was detected in post-mortem lung specimens from patients that died of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and COVID-19. Interestingly, serum levels of CXCL17 were increased only in patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB. CXCL17 not only differentiated pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from other respiratory infections but showed prognostic value for influenza-associated mortality and renal failure in machine-learning algorithms and regression analyses. Using cell culture assays, we also identified that human alveolar A549 cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages increase their CXCL17 production capacity after influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection. Our results for the first time demonstrate an induction of CXCL17 specifically during pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB in humans. These findings could be of great utility to differentiate influenza and COVID-19 and to predict poor prognosis specially at settings of high incidence of pandemic A(H1N1). Future studies on the role of CXCL17 not only in severe pandemic influenza, but also in seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and PTB are required to validate our results.","Choreño-Parra, Jose Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Salinas-Lara, Citlaltepetl; Sánchez-Garibay, Carlos; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; Hernández-Montiel, Erika Mariana; Fernández-López, Luis Alejandro; Cabrera-Cornejo, María Fernanda; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo Misael; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Domínguez, Andrea; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Cabello-Gutiérrez, Carlos; Bolaños-Morales, Francina Valezka; Mena-Hernández, Lourdes; Delgado-Zaldivar, Diego; Rebolledo-García, Daniel; Guadarrama-Ortiz, Parménides; Regino-Zamarripa, Nora E; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Rodiguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofia; Cervántes-Rosete, Diana; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen M; Khader, Shabaana A; Zlotnik, Albert; Zúñiga, Joaquín",Front Immunol,113,26

The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at &#8805;16 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and &#8805;32 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients. Altogether, the Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Renard, Nathalie; Daniel, Soizic; Cayet, Nadège; Pecquet, Matthieu; Raymond, Frédérique; Pons, Sylvie; Lupo, Julien; Tourneur, Carole; Pretis, Catherine; Gerez, Guillaume; Blasco, Patrick; Combe, Maxime; Canova, Imen; Lesénéchal, Mylène; Berthier, Franck",J. clin. microbiol,113,24

These diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. METHODS: Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed evidence profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. RESULTS: We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full-text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during the care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend towards greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low-quality observational simulation studies. CONCLUSION: Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR was identified. Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

We collected nasal swabs from anterior nares of 547 children, measured DNA methylation (DNAm), and tested differences at 15 ACE2 CpGs by sex, age, race/ethnicity and epigenetic age. ACE2 CpGs were differentially methylated by sex with 12 sites having lower DNAm (mean = 12.71%) and 3 sites greater DNAm (mean = 1.45%) among females relative to males. We observed differential DNAm at 5 CpGs for Hispanic females (mean absolute difference = 3.22%) and lower DNAm at 8 CpGs for Black males (mean absolute difference = 1.33%), relative to white participants. Longer DNAm telomere length was associated with greater ACE2 DNAm at 11 and 13 CpGs among males (mean absolute difference = 7.86%) and females (mean absolute difference = 8.21%), respectively.

Although primarily a respiratory illness, extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 include gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal and neurological diseases. Recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the endothelium during COVID-19 may exacerbate these deleterious events by inciting inflammatory and microvascular thrombotic processes. Although controversial, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may infect endothelial cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor using the viral Spike protein. In this review, we explore current insights into the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, endothelial dysfunction due to ACE2 downregulation, and deleterious pulmonary and extra-pulmonary immunothrombotic complications in severe COVID-19. We also discuss preclinical and clinical development of therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Finally, we present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human lung and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, in striving to understand the parameters that lead to severe disease in COVID-19 patients, it is important to consider how direct infection of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to this process.","Bernard, Isabelle; Limonta, Daniel; Mahal, Lara K; Hobman, Tom C",Viruses,113,16

However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel are still lacking. It is imperative to ensure the safety of health-care workers (HCWs) not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to ensure they do not transmit the virus, therefore evaluation of infection rates in these groups are indicated. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data regarding infected cases among HCWs of Fars, Iran with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were obtained from 10th March to 17th May 2020. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated a rate of 5.62% (273 out of 4854 cases) infection among HCW, with a mean age of 35 years and a dominance of female cases (146 cases: 53.5%). The majority of infected cases were among nurses (51.3%), while the most case infection rate (CIR) was among physicians (27 positive cases out of 842 performed test (3.2%)). Also, the highest rate of infection was in the emergency rooms (30.6%). Also, 35.5% of the patients were asymptomatic and the most frequent clinical features among symptomatic patients were myalgia (46%) and cough (45.5%). Although 5.5% were admitted to hospitals, there were no reports of ICU admission. Furthermore, 10.3% of the cases reported transmitting the infection to family and friends. Regarding safety precautions, 1.6% didn't wear masks and 18.7% didn't use gloves in work environments. CONCLUSION: HCWs are among the highest groups at risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, evaluating infection rates and associated features is necessary to improve and adjust protective measures of these vulnerable, yet highly essential group.","Sabetian, Golnar; Moghadami, Mohsen; Hashemizadeh Fard Haghighi, Leila; Shahriarirad, Reza; Fallahi, Mohammad Javad; Asmarian, Naeimehossadat; Moeini, Yalda Sadat",Virol J,113,16

An adaptive blended learning method was developed in response to the requirements necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. This model combined pedagogical needs with digital technology using online learning activities to implement student learning in a medical neuroscience course for year one medical students. This approach provided medical students with an individually customized learning opportunity in medical neuroscience. The students had the complete choice to engage the learning system synchronously or asynchronously and learn neuroscience materials at different locations and times in response to the demands required to deal with the pandemic. Students' performance in summative and formative examinations of the adaptive blended learning activities were compared with the previous performance obtained the previous year when the contents of the medical neuroscience course were implemented using the conventional ""face-to-face"" learning approach. While the cohort of our students in 2019 and 2020 changed, the contents, sessions, volume of material and assessment were constant. This enabled us to compare the results of the 2019 and 2020 classes. Overall, students' performance was not significantly different between the adaptive blended learning and the in-person approach. More students scored between 70-79% during the adaptive blended learning compared with in-class teaching, while more students scored between 80-89% during the in-person learning than during the adaptive blended learning. Finally, the percentage of students that scored >90% was not significantly different for both Years 2019 and 2020. The adaptive blended learning approach was effective in enhancing academic performance for high performing medical students.

METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients admitted to our brain damage unit. The study included all the significant clinical events from the first positive qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay (April 8th, 2020) for SARS-CoV-2 to the day all patients tested negative (June 8th, 2020). RESULTS: Of the 20 patients (14 men) (age 57.7 ± 14.9; 2-71 months after brain damage; all with a modified Rankin scale score > 4), 16 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and remained positive for a mean of 32.3 days (ranging from 26 to 61). One patient died from COVID-19, while 12 patients were asymptomatic and three suffered mild pneumonia without acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients received prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. Intravenous methylprednisolone was prescribed for three patients with bilateral pneumonia with excellent results. CONCLUSIONS: Most positive cases (93.7%) were not severe. The good outcome was most likely due to the use of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, the early use of methylprednisolone for pneumonia and the previously reported immunosuppression amid patients with brain damage.

Countries around the globe are facing challenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabetes suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient services need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes presenting with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term harm caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-related complications. Outpatient management need to be reorganised to maintain remote advice and support services, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, and using telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-management and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapidly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communicable vs non-communicable disease. Resulting challenges in clinical decision-making are compounded by a reduced clinical workforce. For many years, increasing diabetes mellitus incidence has been mirrored by rising preventable morbidity and mortality due to complications, yet innovation in service delivery has been slow. While the current focus is on limiting the terrible harm caused by the pandemic, it is possible that a positive lasting legacy of COVID-19 might include accelerated innovation in chronic disease management.","Wake, Deborah J; Gibb, Fraser W; Kar, Partha; Kennon, Brian; Klonoff, David C; Rayman, Gerry; Rutter, Martin K; Sainsbury, Chris; Semple, Robert K",Eur J Endocrinol,113,24

We developed a bioluminescence-based bioreporter to interrogate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein and its host entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The bioreporter assay is based on a nanoluciferase complementation reporter, composed of two subunits, large BiT and small BiT, fused to the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. Using this bioreporter, we uncovered critical host and viral determinants of the interaction, including a role for glycosylation of asparagine residues within the RBD in mediating successful viral entry. We also demonstrate the importance of N-linked glycosylation to the RBD's antigenicity and immunogenicity. Our study demonstrates the versatility of our bioreporter in mapping key residues mediating viral entry as well as screening inhibitors of the ACE2-RBD interaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by &#8805;0.3%) and bodyweight (by &#8805;3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one-quarter of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15).

This may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands seen in these patients. We aimed to quantify the extent of the hypermetabolic state and report the clinical effect of the use of hypothermia to decrease the metabolic demand in these patients. Methods: Mild hypothermia was applied on four critically ill patients with COVID-19 for 48 h. Metabolic rates, carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption were measured by indirect calorimetry. Results: The average resting energy expenditure (REE) was 299% of predicted. Mild hypothermia decreased the REE on average of 27.0% with resultant declines in CO2 production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) by 29.2% and 25.7%, respectively. This decrease in VCO2 and VO2 was clinically manifested as improvements in hypercapnia (average of 19.1% decrease in pCO2 levels) and oxygenation (average of 50.4% increase in pO2). Conclusion: Our case series demonstrates the extent of hypermetabolism in COVID-19 critical illness and suggests that mild hypothermia reduces the metabolic rate, improves hypercapnia and hypoxia in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Yu, Pey-Jen; Cassiere, Hugh; Bocchieri, Karl; DeRosa, Sarah; Yar, Shiraz; Hartman, Alan",Metabol Open,113,6

Although arrhythmia characterization and possible predictors were previously reported, there are conflicting data regarding the exact prevalence of arrhythmias. Clinically applicable algorithms to classify COVID patients' arrhythmic risk are still lacking, and are the aim of our study. METHODS: We describe a single center cohort of hospitalized patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 during the initial Israeli outbreak between 1/2/2020 -30/5/2020. The study's outcome was any documented arrhythmia during hospitalization, based on daily physical examination, routine ECG's, periodic 24-hour Holter, and continuous monitoring. Multivariate analysis was used to find predictors for new arrhythmias and create classification trees for discriminating patients with high and low arrhythmic risk. RESULTS: Out of 390 COVID-19 patients included, 28 (7.2%) had documented arrhythmias during hospitalization, including: 23 atrial tachyarrhythmias, combined atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia storm, and 3 bradyarrhythmias. Only 7/28 patients had previous arrhythmias. Our study showed significant correlation between disease severity and arrhythmia prevalence (p<0.001) with a low arrhythmic prevalence among mild disease patients (2%). Multivariate analysis revealed background heart failure (CHF) and disease severity are independently associated with overall arrhythmia while age, CHF, disease severity, and arrhythmic symptoms are associated with tachyarrhythmias. A novel decision tree using age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels was created to stratify patients into high and low risk for developing arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Dominant arrhythmia among COVID-19 patients is AF. Arrhythmia prevalence is associated with age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels. A novel simple Classification tree, based on these parameters, can discriminate between high and low arrhythmic risk patients.","Rav-Acha, Moshe; Orlev, Amir; Itzhaki, Itay; Zimmerman, Shmuel F; Fteiha, Bashar; Bohm, Davina; Kurd, Ramzi; Samuel, Tal Y; Asher, Elad; Helviz, Igal; Glikson, Michael; Michowitz, Yoav",Int J Clin Pract,113,1

METHOD: The files of 43 patients (ages 0-18) diagnosed with PE were retrospectively reviewed. The study included 25 patients from our pediatric neurology outpatient clinic, who were thought to have PE, and 18 patients, who were referred from the external centers to our hospital with a pre-diagnosis of PE. RESULTS: Of the 43 patients, 28 had PE, 8 had pseudopapilledema (PPE), and 7 had optic nerve pathologies (ONP). For patients who applied directly to our pediatric neurology unit, a margin of error of 8% was detected based on only a simple ophthalmologic examination and an evaluation of clinical findings. For the patients who were forwarded to our pediatric neurology unit from the external centers without examining any clinical findings and with no details, the margin of error was 72%. CONCLUSION: For patients with suspected PE, advanced ophthalmologic opinion is a necessary requirement before invasive radiological examinations are used. When the ophthalmologic evaluation is properly elaborated, the distinction can be made more clearly by using noninvasive methods. In order to determine the gold standard in terms of the methods used in the evaluation of patients who are not clinically diagnosed, new prospective studies with more patients should be planned.","Türay, Sevim; Kabakus, Nimet; Hanci, Fatma; Ulas, Fatih; Dilek, Mustafa; Cihan, Büsra",Childs nerv. syst,113,20

However, home isolation is likely to result in a significant decrease in participation in leisure time physical activities and an increase in sedentary behavior. Therefore, using an online cross-sectional survey we examined the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on physical activity (PA) behavior and fitness level in an Israeli cohort of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The survey PA questionnaire included 10 questions. Specifically, participants reported on whether, and to what extent, the pandemic conditions had altered their PA behavior. One hundred and twenty PwMS filled out the online survey, 78 were females with a mean age of 43.0 (S.D.=12.9) years. PA behavior during the pandemic demonstrated that 17.5% who were engaged in PA before the COVID-19 pandemic, ceased PA, 33.3% reduced their PA, 20.0% continued their PA as before, 18.3% increased their PA during the pandemic, and 10.8% did not perform any PA in the past and did not so during the pandemic. As for the patient's self-reported fitness level, 31.7% reported that their fitness level had decreased during the pandemic, 60.0% felt no change, and 8.3% reported an improvement. Our findings serve as a call of action for all professionals involved in MS management to address physical activity behavior in PwMS during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Kalron, Alon; Dolev, Mark; Greenberg-Abrahami, Michal; Menascu, Shay; Frid, Lior; Avrech-Shezifi, Sharon; Harari, Gil; Magalashvili, David; Achiron, Anat",Mult Scler Relat Disord,113,16

Studies, linking digit ratio and full facial shapes among Europeans, show that a low 2D:4D is associated with a set of male-specific facial features. Buryats - Mongolian people from Southern Siberia - demonstrate a different pattern of facial sexual dimorphism than Europeans (narrower and more vertically elongated faces in men as opposed to women). AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between facial shape and the 2D:4D in comparison to the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism in Buryats. SUBJECTS: Buryats: 88 men and 80 women aged 20 ± 2 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess relationship between facial shape and 2D:4D we used a geometric morphometric approach based on standardized full-face frontal photographs and direct measurements of the digit lengths among right-handed individuals. RESULTS: The results revealed that 2D:4D was associated with facial morphology in Buryat men, and to a lesser extent in women. Narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of Buryat men with low 2D:4D ratios, which corresponded to the male-like facial shapes in Buryats. CONCLUSIONS: In Europeans, such facial features were reported for men with a high 2D:4D, which corresponded more to female-like European facial shapes. Hence, our results show that sex-specific morphogenesis in humans is multidirectional, and that digit ratio is capable of predicting sex-specific facial traits even in populations with differing sexually-dimorphic morphology.","Rostovtseva, Victoria V; Mezentseva, Anna A; Windhager, Sonja; Butovskaya, Marina L",Early Hum Dev,113,1

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. METHODS: We collected data on individuals' social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate. RESULTS: From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28-34%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures. Our findings highlight that socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same region, and they contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high-income countries.","Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Galli, Margherita; Zardini, Agnese; Manenti, Fabio; Putoto, Giovanni; Marziano, Valentina; Gamshie, Worku Nigussa; Tsegaye, Ademe; Greblo, Alessandro; Melegaro, Alessia; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano; Poletti, Piero",BMC Med,113,12

OBJECTIVES: To describe the electrophysiologic findings and arrhythmias associated with pediatric COVID-19 and its treatment. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review was undertaken and included all patients with (1) symptoms of COVID-19 and (2) PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 who were placed on continuous telemetry for the duration of their hospitalization during March through May, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. Significant arrhythmias were found in 6 (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 5 and sustained atrial tachycardia in 1). All were self-resolving and half prompted prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients with significant arrhythmias were likely to have noncardiac comorbidities (4/6), but these were not more common than in patients without arrhythmias (20/30, P = 1). The use of HCQ was associated with statistically significant QTc prolongation (413 ± 19 ms vs 425 ± 16 ms, P =.005). QTc was not statistically different in patients with and without arrhythmias (425 ± 15 ms vs 425 ± 15 ms, P = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with PCR-positive active COVID-19 infection, significant arrhythmias are infrequent, but are more common than expected in a general pediatric population. Comorbidities are not more common in patients with arrhythmias than in patients without arrhythmias.

A Trans-Governmental Collaborative Effort to Independently Evaluate SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assays Using Well-Characterized Sample Panels,13.897569,12.2296715,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was reported from Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019, and the pandemic was spread to more than 212 countries in the globe. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications and to identify the association between the incidence of complications and age. METHODS: Comprehensive databases, PubMed, Hinari, and Google Scholar, were used to locate potential articles for this review. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and imported to the STATA/MP version 16.0 software for analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test, and small study effect was checked using Egger's statistical test at 5% significant level. Sensitivity analysis was checked. A random-effects model was conducted to estimate the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications. Univariate meta-regression was conducted to identify the association between the mean ages with each complication. RESULTS: From the total of 1237 studies, 12 studies were included with a total of 3064 COVID-19 patients. The most complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (30.93%, 95%CI 21.3-40.6%) followed by acute liver injury (22.8%, 95%CI 14-31.5%), shock (10.9%, 95%CI 7.4-14.4%), acute kidney injury (7%, 95%CI 3.8-10.4%), and acute cardiac injury (6.4%, 95%CI 2.8-15.6%). Univariate meta-regression revealed that as the mean age increased by 1 year, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, and shock increased by a factor of 2.9 (ß = 2.9, 95%CI 2.4-3.4, adjusted R2 = 88), 0.4 (ß = 0.4, 95%CI 0.04-0.72, adjusted R2 = 54), 1.6 (ß = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.1, adjusted R2 = 85), and 1.1 (ß = 1.1, 95%CI 0.8-1.5, adjusted R2 = 26) times respectively. CONCLUSION: Significant complications of COVID-19 viral infections were reported. Older populations were a high-risk group of developing adverse complications as compared to their counterparts. Health care professionals should give primary attention to those risk group individuals.","Tiruneh, Sofonyas Abebaw; Tesema, Zemenu Tadese; Azanaw, Melkalem Mamuye; Angaw, Dessie Abebaw",Syst Rev,113,29

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are at higher risk of preterm birth than uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 treatment in pregnancy. In addition, the long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health require greater consideration.","Sherer, Morgan L; Lei, Jun; Creisher, Patrick S; Jang, Minyoung; Reddy, Ramya; Voegtline, Kristin; Olson, Sarah; Littlefield, Kirsten; Park, Han-Sol; Ursin, Rebecca L; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Boyer, Theresa; Elsayed, Nada; Brown, Diane M; Walch, Samantha N; Antar, Annukka A R; Manabe, Yukari C; Jones-Beatty, Kimberly; Golden, William Christopher; Satin, Andrew J; Sheffield, Jeanne S; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Burd, Irina",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,113,20

As a result of this situation, the follow-up of such chronic diseases as dementia may be at risk. Similarly, neuropsychiatric complications related to lockdown measures may also be neglected; Argentina's lockdown has been the longest implemented in Latin America. This study aims to determine the frequency of the different types of medical consultations for neurocognitive disorders and the predictors for requiring consultation since the beginning of the lockdown. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study based on data collected through an online survey. RESULTS: Data were collected on 324 participants, with 165 (50.9%) having had at least one medical consultation. Consultations were held by telephone in 109 cases (33.6%), by e-mail in 62 (19.1%), by video conference in 30 (9.3%), and at the emergency department in 23 (7.1%). Predictors of requiring consultation were Clinical Dementia Rating scores &#8805;1 (P<.001) and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (P=.017). Higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were found in the group of respondents who did require medical consultation (P<.001), but no significant differences were found between groups for Zarit Burden Interview scores. CONCLUSION: We identified a high prevalence of behavioural disorders and caregiver burden during lockdown. Nevertheless, only 50% of respondents had sought medical consultation (by telephone or email in 52.7% of cases). Care of people with dementia must be emphasised, guaranteeing follow-up of these patients.","Sorbara, M; Graviotto, H G; Lage-Ruiz, G M; Turizo-Rodriguez, C M; Sotelo-López, L A; Serra, A; Gagliardi, C; Heinemann, G; Martinez, P; Ces-Magliano, F; Serrano, C M","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",113,33

Virus neutralisation tests (NTs) are the gold standard for the detection and quantification of NAbs, but they are complex and require BSL3 facilities. In contrast, surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (sELISA) offer the possibility of high-throughput testing under standard laboratory safety conditions. In this study, we investigated two commercial sELISA kits (GenScript, AdipoGen) designed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. METHODS: 276 plasma samples were screened using commercial IgG-ELISA and NAbs titres were determined by micro-neutralisation test (micro-NT). In addition, all samples were tested in both sELISA. Sensitivity and specificity for both sELISA were determined in comparison to the micro-NT results. RESULTS: 57 % of the samples were SARS-CoV-2 NAb positive in micro-NT, while 43 % tested negative. Comparison with micro-NT results showed a sensitivity of 98.2 % and a specificity of 69.5 % for the GenScript ELISA. The AdipoGen ELISA had a sensitivity of 83.5 % and a specificity of 97.8 %. False negative results were obtained mainly on samples with low NAbs titres. CONCLUSION: Both sELISA were able to qualitatively detect NAbs in plasma samples. Sensitivity and specificity differed between sELISA with GenScript superior in sensitivity and AdipoGen superior in specificity. Both sELISA were unable to quantify NAbs, thus neither of them can completely replace conventional NTs. However, in a two-step diagnostic algorithm, AdipoGen could potentially replace NT as a subsequent confirmatory test due to its high specificity but only in settings where no exact NAbs quantification is needed.","Müller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Wölfel, Roman",J Virol Methods,113,20

In total, 630 samples were used in this study. Individual positive samples with cycle threshold (CT ) values as high as 33 could be consistently detected when pooled with 4 negative samples (pool of 5), and individual positive samples with CT values up to 31 could be consistently detected when pooled with 9 negative samples (pool of 10). Pooling of up to 5 samples can be employed in laboratories for the diagnosis of COVID-19 for efficient utilization of resources, rapid screening of a greater number of people, and faster reporting of test results.","More, Sunil; Narayanan, Sai; Patil, Girish; Ghosh, Parna; Pushparaj, Samuel; Cooper, Emily; Ritchey, Jerry; Cheruvu, Vinay K; Kaul, Anil; Ramachandran, Akhilesh",J. clin. microbiol,113,26

This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable. The duration of herd immunity is another issue while information on the long-term immune response against SARS-CoV2 is yet scarce. Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population.

DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A prospective cohort of patients assessed for COVID-19 at a screening clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test from nasopharyngeal swab. A backwards stepwise logistic regression was used to derive a model of clinical variables predictive of a positive COVID-19 test. Internal validation of the final model was performed using bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients, with modelling performed for increasing prevalence. RESULTS: Of 4226 patients with suspected COVID-19 who were assessed, 2976 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing (n = 108 SARS-CoV-2 positive) and were used to determine factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test. The 7 features associated with a positive COVID-19 test on multivariable analysis were: COVID-19 patient exposure or international travel, Myalgia/malaise, Anosmia or ageusia, Temperature, Coryza/sore throat, Hypoxia-oxygen saturation < 97%, 65 years or older-summarized in the mnemonic COVID-MATCH65. Internal validation showed an AUC of 0.836. A cut-off of &#8805; 1.5 points was associated with a 92.6% sensitivity and 99.5% negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19.

Especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, high vaccination coverage should be attained. This review analyzed strategies to increase influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was conducted and 32 publications on influenza vaccination campaigns for healthcare workers were reviewed for key interventions and resulting vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Among key interventions analyzed, mandatory vaccination policies or multifaceted campaigns including a vaccinate-or-wear-a-mask policy as well as mandatory declination reached vaccination coverage in healthcare workers of over 90%. Although campaigns solely based on education and promotion or on-site-vaccination did not regularly exceed an absolute vaccination coverage of 40%, a substantial relative increase in vaccination coverage was reached by implementation of these strategies. CONCLUSION: Mandatory vaccination policies are effective measures to achieve high overall vaccination coverage. In clinics where policies are infeasible, multifaceted campaigns comprising on-site vaccination, vaccination stands and educational and promotional campaigns as well as incentives should be implemented. Lessons learned from influenza campaigns could be implemented in future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns.","Schumacher, Sofie; Salmanton-García, Jon; Cornely, Oliver A; Mellinghoff, Sibylle C",Infection,113,10

This concern is fueled by limited available studies on this subject. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that HFNC treatment is not associated with increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. METHODS: We used laser light scattering and a handheld particle counter to detect and quantify aerosols in healthy subjects and in adults with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19, during HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy. RESULTS: The use of HFNC was not associated with increased formation of aerosols as compared to conventional oxygen therapy in both healthy subjects (n = 3) and subjects with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19 (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS: In line with scarce previous clinical and experimental findings, our results indicate that HFNC itself does not result in overall increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. This suggests there is no increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission to health care workers during HFNC.","Bem, Reinout A; van Mourik, Niels; Klein-Blommert, Rozalinde; Spijkerman, Ingrid Jb; Kooij, Stefan; Bonn, Daniel; Vlaar, Alexander P",Respir. care,113,26

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of reduced mobility due to this pandemic in the occurrence of dengue in the state of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil. Method: It is an ecological study of time series, developed between January and August 2020. We use the number of confirmed dengue cases and residential mobility, on a daily basis, from secondary information sources. Mobility was represented by the daily percentage variation of residential population isolation, obtained from the Google database. We modeled the relationship between dengue occurrence and social distancing by negative binomial regression, adjusted for seasonality. We represent the social distancing dichotomously (isolation versus no isolation) and consider lag for isolation from the dates of occurrence of dengue. Results: The risk of dengue decreased around 9.1% (95% CI: 14.2 to 3.7) in the presence of isolation, considering a delay of 20 days between the degree of isolation and the dengue first symptoms. Conclusions: We have shown that mobility can play an important role in the epidemiology of dengue and should be considered in surveillance and control activities","Conceiccao, Gleice Margarete de Souza; Barbosa, Gerson Laurindo; Lorenz, Camila; Bocewicz, Ana Carolina Dias; Santana, Lidia Maria Reis; Marques, Cristiano Correa de Azevedo; Chiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco",,113,10

Such resource constraints arise in almost all health and safety risk contexts, which has led to a regulatory oversight process to ascertain whether the expected benefits of major regulations outweigh the costs. The economic approach to monetizing health and safety risks is well established and is based on the value of a statistical life (""VSL""). Government agencies use these values reflecting attitudes toward small changes in risk to monetize the largest benefit component of regulations-that dealing with mortality risks. This procedure consequently bases the benefit value on the individual's own rate of tradeoff between risk and money and in effect creates a quasi-market approach to public policy assessment. Whereas tort liability awards are personalized to reflect the particular circumstances of the case, government policies generally rely on average valuations of mortality risk across broad worker groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential role of resource constraints in the distribution of medical resources, particularly with respect to the provision of ventilators. The age-based allocation of treatment advocated by some medical ethicists violates age discrimination laws, is based on their own ethical judgments, and is divorced from consideration of private willingness-to-pay values or other possible economic efficiency criteria. A more constructive approach than the lifeboat and triage scenarios that are often discussed by medical ethicists is to consider ex ante how people would choose to provide for treatments when facing a prospective risk, making the task equivalent to that of valuing and saving statistical lives. Continued high valuations of risk reductions even by those who are old provides a rationale for more protective practices and more forward-thinking medical decisions than those advocated by some bioethicists.","Viscusi, W.

Hitherto, the genetics of tear duct development and obstruction has been scarcely explored, and related animal models are lacking. This study aims to study the potential role of the Wnt/PCP pathway mediated by Prickle 1 in tear duct development and diseases. Methods: A severe hypomorphic Prickle 1 mutant was generated. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare wild type, Prickle 1 hypomorphic, and null mutant tear ducts. In situ hybridization was conducted to identify the signaling components in the developing tear ducts. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was used to detect the human embryonic tear duct. Results: Here, we report that a severe Prickle 1 hypomorph mouse line exhibited epiphora. This phenotype was due to the blockage of the tear drainage by incompletely formed nasolacrimal duct (NLD) and lacrimal canaliculi (LC), which also causes precocious eyelid opening. We observed a dose-dependent requirement of Prickle 1 for tear duct outgrowth. An investigation of the expression of Wnt/PCP core genes demonstrated a subset of PCP signaling components expressed in the developing tear duct. Furthermore, Prickle 1 is not required for the expression of Fgfr2/Fgf10 and p63 genes, which are associated with the NLD and LC hypoplasia in humans. Last, we showed that Prickle 1 expression in the developing tear drainage system is conserved between mice and humans. Conclusions: The study suggests that malformed tear ducts caused by disruption of Prickle 1 underlies the epiphora and precocious eyelid opening.","Ru, Jiali; Guo, Dianlei; Fan, Jiaying; Zhang, Jiao; Ju, Rong; Ouyang, Hong; Wei, Lai; Liu, Yizhi; Liu, Chunqiao",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,113,28

However, the safety issue of intracameral injection of MXF for human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) is still debatable. In this study, we investigated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity (0.05-1 mg/ml) of MXF for immortalized HCECs (B4G12 cell) and the underlying mechanism. Reactive oxygen generation (ROS) and cell viability after MXF exposure was measured. Flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptotic HCECs after MXF exposure. Ultrastructure of damaged HCECs by MXF was imaged by transmission electron microscope. Western blot analysis and caspase 2, 3 and 8 analysis were used to reveal the underlying mechanism of MXF induced damage in HCECs. We found that MXF induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HCECs. MXF exposure increased ROS generation and induced autophagy in HCECs. Increased LDH release represented the cellular membrane damage by MXF. In addition, caspases activation, Bax/Bcl-xL-dependent apoptosis pathway and apoptosis inducing factor nuclear translocation were all involved in MXF induced HCECs' damage, especially after exposure to high dose of MXF (0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml). These findings suggest that MXF toxicity on HCECs should be thoroughly considered by ophthalmologists when intracameral injection of MXF is planned.","Park, Joo-Hee; Kim, Martha; Chuck, Roy S; Park, Choul Yong",Sci Rep,113,24

However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions. However, all approaches require public and policy deliberation about acceptable risks, and continuous careful management and evaluation.","Wilson, Nick; Baker, Michael G; Blakely, Tony; Eichner, Martin",Sci Rep,113,20

However, interventions targeting loneliness are less common than interventions for other mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and existing interventions focus primarily on building social skills and increasing opportunities for social interaction despite research suggesting these techniques are not the most effective. Furthermore, although there is an increasing need for scalable and convenient interventions, digital interventions for loneliness are even less common. OBJECTIVE: Using a qualitative approach, we explore how adults (18-64 years of age) who express wanting to be more connected to others experience loneliness and react to a digital mental health intervention targeting loneliness. METHODS: A total of 11 participants were recruited from a pilot randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a digital mental health intervention, Happify Health, on loneliness among adults aged 18-64 years who indicated wanting to feel more connected to others when signing up for the platform. Participants were invited to participate in a 3-day asynchronous focus group about their experiences with loneliness, with Happify Health, and with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 11 participants completed the focus group in May 2020. RESULTS: Participants’ responses were coded using thematic analysis, which led to identifying five themes, each with separate subthemes, that could be applied across the 3-day focus group: loneliness, relationships, social distancing, skill acquisition, and coping. Overall, we observed variability across participants in terms of the source of their loneliness, their perceptions of their social connections, and their motivation to reduce feelings of loneliness; however, participants commonly referred to negative self-perceptions as a cause or consequence of loneliness. Participants also varied in the extent to which they felt social distancing increased or decreased feelings of loneliness. In regard to the intervention, participants showed evidence of adopting skills they used to address their loneliness, particularly mindfulness and gratitude, and then using these skills to shift toward more active coping strategies following the intervention, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in participants’ experiences with loneliness described during this focus group emphasizes the subjective and complex nature of loneliness. This highlights the importance of developing loneliness interventions that use a variety of strategies, including both direct and indirect strategies for reducing loneliness. However, based on our data, a key component to loneliness interventions is incorporating strategies for addressing underlying negative self-perceptions that stem from, but also contribute to, loneliness. This data also provides preliminary evidence that digital platforms may be an effective tool for disseminating loneliness interventions while providing the added benefit of offering a productive distraction when feeling lonely.","Boucher, Eliane M; McNaughton, Emily C; Harake, Nicole; Stafford, Julia L; Parks, Acacia C",JMIR Ment Health,113,1

The birth of cyber diplomacy, occurred in the year 2007, which will always be remembered due to a wide-ranging cyber attack on Estonia. Indeed, Estonia is known for being one of the most wired countries in Europe. The attack consisted of crippled computer networks because of hackers which paralysed numerous amount of government and corporates sites. The escalation in these kinds of attacks highlighted the need for governments to formulate national cyber strategies. This sprang from the realisation that cyberspace, like the physical world, also has military and strategic dimensions and requires countries to work together to defeat cyber opponents. Attacks within cyberspace are subject to strategically-formulated threats, which go beyond the usual physical terrorist-type threats. Global progress, democracy and peace are at stake. This makes cyber diplomacy a major issue for countries’ foreign policies, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the domain. A number of aspects are relevant in this respect: policies, politics and sociology (dread), diplomacy, digital/cyber science, multilateralism and world history. This paper reports on a systematic literature review that was carried out to reveal the dimensions of current cyber diplomacy research. While a number of studies have introduced and defined “Cyber Diplomacy” and its associated diplomatic actions, none have sought to distinguish this field from the more traditional and well established diplomacy concept. This is a significant gap in the literature, which will be the topic of future research.","Attatfa, Amel; Renaud, Karen; Paoli, Stefano De",Procedia Computer Science,113,24

Non-human primates (NHP), in particular rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, serve as animal models for influenza and experimental FLUAV infection of common marmosets has recently also been reported. However, it is currently unknown whether the NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2 cleave and activate FLUAV hemagglutinin and contribute to viral spread in respiratory tissue. Here, we cloned and functionally analyzed the macaque and marmoset orthologues of human TMPRSS2. In addition, we analyzed the macaque orthologues of human TMPRSS4 and HAT, which also belong to the TTSP family. We found that all NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT cleave and activate HA upon directed expression and provide evidence that endogenous TMPRSS2 is expressed in the respiratory epithelium of rhesus macaques. Finally, we demonstrate that a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 suppresses FLUAV spread in precision-cut lung slices of human, macaque and marmoset origin. These results indicate that FLUAV depends on serine protease activity for spread in diverse NHP and in humans. Moreover, our findings suggest that macaques and marmosets may serve as models to study FLUAV activation by TMPRSS2 in human patients.","Zmora, Pawel; Molau-Blazejewska, Paulina; Bertram, Stephanie; Walendy-Gnirß, Kerstin; Nehlmeier, Inga; Hartleib, Anika; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Konzok, Sebastian; Dehmel, Susann; Sewald, Katherina; Brinkmann, Constantin; Curths, Christoph; Knauf, Sascha; Gruber, Jens; Mätz-Rensing, Kerstin; Dahlmann, Franziska; Braun, Armin; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,113,28

In this work, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 104 serum samples from 49 critical COVID-19 patients using a peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. Our data show that the binding epitopes of IgM and IgG antibodies differ across SARS-CoV-2 proteins and even within the same protein. Moreover, most IgM and IgG epitopes are located within nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are critical in inactivating the host’s innate immune response and enabling SARS-CoV-2 replication, transcription, and polyprotein processing. IgM antibodies are associated with a good prognosis and target nsp3 and nsp5 proteases, whereas IgG antibodies are associated with high mortality and target structural proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike, ORF3a). The epitopes targeted by antibodies in patients with a high mortality rate were further validated using an independent serum cohort (n = 56) and using global correlation mapping analysis with the clinical variables that are associated with COVID-19 severity.

Despite a lack of evidence over the efficacy in prevention against ulcers due to pressure, hourly repositioning in critical care as an intervention is used with more or less frequency to alleviate pressure on patients’ tissues. This brings up the objective of our study, which is to evaluate the efficacy in prevention of ulcers due to pressure acquired during hospitalization, specifically regarding two frequency levels of repositioning or manual posture switching in adults hospitalized in different intensive care units in different Colombian hospitals. METHODS: A nurse-applied cluster randomized controlled trial of parallel groups (two branches), in which 22 eligible ICUs (each consisting of 150 patients), will be randomized to a high-frequency level repositioning intervention or to a conventional care (control group). Patients will be followed until their exit from each cluster. The primary result of this study is originated by regarding pressure ulcers using clusters (number of first ulcers per patient, at the early stage of progression, first one acquired after admission for 1000 days). The secondary results include evaluating the risk index on the patients’ level (Hazard ratio, 95% IC) and a description of repositioning complications. Two interim analyses will be performed through the course of this study. A statistical difference between the groups < 0.05 in the main outcome, the progression of ulcers due to pressure (best or worst outcome in the experimental group), will determine whether the study should be put to a halt/determine the termination of the study. CONCLUSION: This study is innovative in its use of clusters to advance knowledge of the impact of repositioning as a prevention strategy against the appearance of ulcers caused by pressure in critical care patients. The resulting recommendations of this study can be used for future clinical practice guidelines in prevention and safety for patients at risk.

Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.","Citro, Rodolfo; Pontone, Gianluca; Bellino, Michele; Silverio, Angelo; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Baggiano, Andrea; Manka, Robert; Iesu, Severino; Vecchione, Carmine; Asch, Federico Miguel; Ghadri, Jelena Rima; Templin, Christian",Trends Cardiovasc Med,113,1

OBJECTIVES: This review summarises the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing. SOURCES: Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021. CONTENT: Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies. IMPLICATIONS: Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimise the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.","Ong, David S.Y.; Fragkou, Paraskevi C.; Schweitzer, Valentijn A.; Chemaly, Roy F.; Moschopoulos, Charalampos D.; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Clin Microbiol Infect,113,1

Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy. METHODS: In a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortium's AbC-19(TM) Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices. FINDINGS: We observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19(TM) device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95% uncertainty interval 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (“spectrum effects”), but the extent of this varied by device. INTERPRETATION: The estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives.

These techniques are relatively expensive, slow, and susceptible to false-negative results. A rapid noninvasive method to detect infection would be highly advantageous. Compelling evidence from canine biosensors and studies of adults with COVID-19 suggests that infection reproducibly alters human volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles. To determine whether pediatric infection is associated with VOC changes, we enrolled SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected children admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center. Breath samples were collected from children and analyzed through state-of-the-art GCxGC-ToFMS. Isolated features included 84 targeted VOCs. Candidate biomarkers that were correlated with infection status were subsequently validated in a second, independent cohort of children. We thus find that six volatile organic compounds are significantly and reproducibly increased in the breath of SARS-CoV-2 infected children. Three aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, and heptanal) drew special attention, as aldehydes are also elevated in the breath of adults with COVID-19. Together, these biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy for distinguishing pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the ongoing development of novel breath-based diagnostics.","Berna, Amalia Z.; Akaho, Elikplim H.; Harris, Rebecca M.; Congdon, Morgan; Korn, Emilie; Neher, Samuel; M’Farrej, Mirna; Burns, Julianne; Odom John, Audrey R.",ACS Infect Dis,113,1

Twelve calves were included in the study: Three animals were exposed to H. somnus only, and two to M. dispar only, whereas five were challenged to M. dispar followed by exposure to H. somnus 11–14 days later. Also, one calf was exposed to M. dispar followed by exposure to a sterile saline solution 11 days later, and one calf was only exposed to a sterile saline solution. Just one animal, only challenged with H. somnus, developed a focal necrotizing pneumonia, from which H. somnus was isolated. Thus, the ability of H. somnus and M. dispar to act as primary pathogens under these conditions were minimal and inconsistent. However, a transient rise in body temperature, a marked granulocytosis and increased levels of interleukin-8 in peripheral blood after inoculation with H. somnus indicated a clear systemic response, probably as a consequence of the natural non-specific local and systemic defence mechanisms acting in healthy calves.","Tegtmeier, C.; Angen, Ø.; Grell, S.N.; Riber, U.; Friis, N.F.",Vet Microbiol,113,1

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the top 3 EHR vendors and measures of hospital financial and quality performance. METHODS: This study evaluated 2667 hospitals with Cerner, Epic, or Meditech as their primary EHR and considered their performance with regard to net income, Hospital Value–Based Purchasing Total Performance Score (TPS), and the unweighted subdomains of efficiency and cost reduction; clinical care; patient- and caregiver-centered experience; and patient safety. We hypothesized that there would be a difference among the 3 vendors for each measure. RESULTS: None of the EHR systems were associated with a statistically significant financial relationship in our study. Epic was positively associated with TPS outcomes (R(2)=23.6%; β=.0159, SE 0.0079; P=.04) and higher patient perceptions of quality (R(2)=29.3%; β=.0292, SE 0.0099; P=.003) but was negatively associated with patient safety quality scores (R(2)=24.3%; β=−.0221, SE 0.0102; P=.03). Cerner and Epic were positively associated with improved efficiency (R(2)=31.9%; Cerner: β=.0330, SE 0.0135, P=.01; Epic: β=.0465, SE 0.0133, P<.001). Finally, all 3 vendors were associated with positive performance in the clinical care domain (Epic: β=.0388, SE 0.0122, P=.002; Cerner: β=.0283, SE 0.0124, P=.02; Meditech: β=.0273, SE 0.0123, P=.03) but with low explanatory power (R(2)=4.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence of a difference in clinical outcome performance among the top 3 EHR vendors and may serve as supportive evidence for health care leaders to target future capital investments to improve health care delivery.","Beauvais, Bradley; Kruse, Clemens Scott; Fulton, Lawrence; Shanmugam, Ramalingam; Ramamonjiarivelo, Zo; Brooks, Matthew",J Med Internet Res,113,20

Whilst nations are gradually reopening schools, and many politicians advise that schools remain safe and the risks of increases in the spread of COVID-19 are low, little evidence has been presented to confirm those statements. A review of the numbers of new confirmed COVID-19 cases by country suggests that the reopening of schools is likely to be a driver in the increase of the number of new cases. This is likely exacerbated by accompanying changes and easing of restrictions. However, with the exception of China, notable for its robust test, track, trace, and isolate processes, no other countries that had significant numbers of COVID-19 cases have successfully reopened schools without an increase in cases as a consequence. Whilst reopening of schools following an initial peak and decrease in COVID-19 infections is desirable for a range of reasons, doing so without adequate controls and protections may lead to an exacerbation of spread within the school environment, which could then lead to increased community spread of disease.","Beesley, Richard",,113,23

The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. RESULTS: The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Significant gaps exist in Kenya’s capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators.","Barasa, Edwine W.; Ouma, Paul O.; Okiro, Emelda A.",PLoS One,113,1

BACKGROUND: When faced with high‐pressure situations like the COVID‐19 pandemic, it is critical that nurse managers be equipped with the support they need to successfully surpass these hard times. METHODS: Descriptive correlational design was utilized. The study was conduct at different health care settings across Egypt. Convenience sampling technique was employed to recruit (214) nurse managers. Two instruments were used; questionnaire of challenges faced by nurse managers and survey of perceived organizational support. Mann–Whitney test, Kruskal–Wallis test, Spearman's correlation, and regression analysis were utilized. RESULTS: The highest percentage of managers reported being faced with high level of challenges. There was a highly statistically significant negative correlation between challenges currently faced by managers and their perception of organizational support. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic had placed additional challenges on nurse managers and these challenges are expected to persist in the future. Higher perception of organizational support minimizes managers' perception of being challenged in times of pandemics. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Better training focused on disaster management, ethical decision making, leading in times of uncertainty, and maintaining well‐being will help nurse managers lead better their teams.","Gab Allah, Amal Refaat",Nurs Forum,113,19

Physical distancing measures may be difficult to implement without introducing interventions that may violate human rights. Given that Indigenous women represent over 41% of federally incarcerated women, this is a cause for concern. Indigenous women are also more likely to have higher rates of numerous chronic conditions, including respiratory illnesses, substantially increasing vulnerability to COVID-19 complications. This can be exacerbated in prisons as access to healthcare may be limited. Outbreaks within the prison setting can not only overwhelm an already over-stretched healthcare system but also spread to the community and disproportionately impact marginalized communities and populations. In this commentary, we explore the public health and human rights implications of COVID-19 in prisons while calling particular attention to the unique needs and circumstances of incarcerated Indigenous women based on international best practice-based guidance to preventive and responsive measures to COVID-19.","Ryan, Chaneesa; Sabourin, Hollie; Ali, Abrar",Can J Public Health,113,26

This health crisis has resulted in a significant effort to stop the spread of this new coronavirus. However, while propagating itself in the human population, the virus accumulates mutations and generates new variants with increased fitness and the ability to escape the human immune response. Here we describe a color-based barcoded spike flow cytometric assay (BSFA) that is particularly useful to evaluate and directly compare the humoral immune response directed against either wild type (WT) or mutant spike (S) proteins or the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This assay employs the human B lymphoma cell line Ramos, transfected for stable expression of WT or mutant S proteins or a chimeric RBD-CD8 fusion protein. We find that the alpha and beta mutants are more stably expressed than the WT S protein on the Ramos B cell surface and/or bind with higher affinity to the viral entry receptor ACE2. However, we find a reduce expression of the chimeric RBD-CD8 carrying the point mutation N501Y and E484K characteristic for the alpha and beta variant, respectively. The comparison of the humoral immune response of 12 vaccinated probands with 12 COVID-19 patients shows that after the boost, the S-specific IgG class immune response in the vaccinated group is similar to that of the patient group. However, in comparison to WT the specific IgG serum antibodies bind less well to the alpha variant and only poorly to the beta variant S protein. This is in line with the notion that the beta variant is an immune escape variant of SARS-CoV-2. The IgA class immune response was more variable than the IgG response and higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the vaccinated group. In summary, we think that our BSFA represents a useful tool to evaluate the humoral immunity against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to analyze new vaccination protocols against these variants.","Vesper, Niklas; Ortiz, Yaneth; Bartels-Burgahn, Frauke; Yang, Jianying; de la Rosa, Kathrin; Tenbusch, Matthias; Schulz, Sebastian; Finzel, Stephanie; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Eibel, Hermann; Voll, Reinhard E.; Reth, Michael",Front Immunol,113,28

Although vaccine incentivisation has been cited as a motivating factor for vaccine passports, it is unclear whether vaccine passports are likely to increase inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale national survey in the UK of 17,611 adults between 9 and 27 April 2021. Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification is used to provide unbiased national-level estimates of the impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines and identify the differential impact of passports on uptake inclination across socio-demographic groups. FINDINGS: We find that a large minority of respondents report that vaccination passports for domestic use (46·5%) or international travel (42·0%) would make them no more or less inclined to accept a COVID-19 vaccine and a sizeable minority of respondents also state that they would ‘definitely’ accept a COVID-19 vaccine and that vaccine passports would make them more inclined to vaccinate (48·8% for domestic use and 42·9% for international travel). However, we find that the introduction of vaccine passports will likely lower inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once baseline vaccination intent has been adjusted for. This decrease is larger if passports were required for domestic use rather than for facilitating international travel. Being male (OR 0·87, 0·76 to 0·99) and having degree qualifications (OR 0·84, 0·72 to 0·94) is associated with a decreased inclination to vaccinate if passports were required for domestic use (while accounting for baseline vaccination intent), while Christians (OR 1·23, 1·08 to 1·41) have an increased inclination over atheists or agnostics. Change in inclination is strongly connected to stated vaccination intent and will therefore unlikely shift attitudes among Black or Black British respondents, younger age groups, and non-English speakers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings should be interpreted in light of sub-national trends in uptake rates across the UK, as our results suggest that passports may be viewed less positively among socio-demographic groups that cluster in large urban areas. We call for further evidence on the impact of vaccine certification and the potential fallout for routine immunization programmes in both the UK and in wider global settings, especially those with low overall trust in vaccinations.","de Figueiredo, Alexandre; Larson, Heidi J.; Reicher, Stephen D.",EClinicalMedicine,113,24

In this cross-section study we evaluated COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police forces of 10 major cities in Rio Grande do Sul, South of Brazil. METHODS: Sampling was randomly performed in clusters, in respect to the number of professionals at service per city and military unit. Research subjects were evaluated on July 23, 2020 (first wave peak in Brazil). Clinical information was obtained, and venous blood was taken for ELISA testing (IgA, and IgG antibodies). Sample size consisted of 1,592 military workers (33.6% of study population). They were mostly man (81.2%) and young (median 34 years-old). Most had been asymptomatic (75.3%) during pandemic, and 27.5% reported close contact with COVID-19 cases (after a median time of 21 days). Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure. Asymptomatic people were more prone to have negative antibody titters in the second run.","Pasqualotto, Alessandro C.; Pereira, Paula de Castro; Lana, Daiane F.

As the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is still poorly understood, a multidisciplinary research team of the Argentine Society of Intensive Care (SATI) conducted a multicenter study aimed to define nutritional features, and to evaluate the relationship between nutritional risk and relevant clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: a multicenter, prospective, observational study including twelve Argentinian ICUs was conducted between March and October 2020. Inclusion criteria were: adult patients older than 18 years who were admitted to the ICU with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included. Clinical data included comorbidities scores, and nutritional screening tools such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), the Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) 2002, and the modified NUTRIC score (mNUTRIC SCORE) were used. In addition, clinical outcomes including overall mortality, mechanical ventilation (MV) days, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) were recorded. RESULTS: a total of 285 ICU patients met our inclusion criteria. Mean age was 61.24 (SD = 14.6) years; APACHE-II, 14.2 (SD = 6.6); Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), 2.3 (SD = 2.3). Most patients were admitted from the emergency room to the ICU. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. Nutritional assessment showed that 36.9 % were SGA B+C, and 46 % were obese. Mean ICU LOS was 22.2 (SD = 19.5), and hospital LOS was 28.1 (SD = 21.9) days. Of all patients, 90.2 % underwent MV, and MV days were 20.6 (SD = 15.6). The univariate and multivariate analyses showed that risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]): SGA score of B or C: 2.13 [1.11-4.06], and NRS 2002 ≥ 3: 2.25 [1.01-5.01].

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied epidemiology workforce. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020 through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included demographic details of participants, along with their technical background, level of formal education, topics studied during epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi(2)) to test the difference between categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: In total, 282 people responded to the survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74% (n = 210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common.

An initial step in estimating the impact of these changes is to characterize the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. Methods We conducted an observational study, examining demographics, visit characteristics, and diagnoses for all ED patient visits to an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after a state emergency declaration and comparing them to a similar period in 2019. We estimated percent change based on the ratios of before and after periods with respect to 2019 and the decline per week using Poisson regression. Finally, we evaluated whether each factor modified the change in overall ED visits. Results After the state declaration, there was a 49.3% decline in ED visits overall, 35.2% (95%CI: -38.4 to -31.9) as compared to 2019. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain. Significant proportional increases were seen in ED visits for upper respiratory infections, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Conclusions There have been significant changes in patterns of care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in ED visits, especially for certain demographic groups and disease processes, should prompt efforts to understand these phenomena, encourage appropriate care-seeking, and monitor for the morbidity and mortality that may result from delayed or deferred care.","Westgard, Bjorn C.; Morgan, Matthew W.; Vazquez-Benitez, Gabriela; Erickson, Lauren O.; Zwank, Michael D.",Ann Emerg Med,113,18

Multiple triage systems for nonemergent surgical procedures have been published, but potentially curative cancer procedures are essential surgery rather than elective surgery. In the present and future scenario of our country, thoracic oncology teams may have the difficult decision of weighing the utility of surgical intervention against the risk for inadvertent COVID‐19 exposure for patients and medical staff. In consequence, traditional pathways of surgical care must be adjusted to reduce the risk of infection and the use of resources. It is recommended that all thoracic cancer patients should be offered treatment according to the accepted standard of care until shortage of services require a progressive reduction in surgical cases. Here, we present a consensus of recommendations discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts on thoracic oncology and based on the best available evidence, and hope it will provide a modifiable framework of guidance for local strategy planners in thoracic cancer care services in Mexico.

Per estensione, l’ECMO è diventata una tecnica respiratoria e cardiopolmonare utilizzata in caso di deficit respiratorio e/o cardiaco nell’attesa della restaurazione della funzione deficitaria o di un eventuale trapianto. Il supporto emodinamico può essere parziale o totale. Gli accessi vascolari possono essere periferici o centrali. Questo tipo di assistenza utilizza il concetto di circolazione extracorporea (CEC) sanguigna che in epoca moderna si è estesa con l’utilizzo di polmoni artificiali a membrana. Il circuito di base è semplice e comprende una pompa, un ossigenatore (che permette al sangue di caricarsi di O2 e di eliminare CO2) e delle vie d’accesso (una di drenaggio e una di reinfusione). La sua attuazione è facile, veloce e può essere avviata al letto del malato. Il miglioramento delle attrezzature, una migliore conoscenza delle tecniche e delle indicazioni, e le politiche di salute pubblica hanno reso popolare questa tecnica. Alcuni centri di chirurgia toracica la utilizzano di routine come assistenza alla realizzazione di un intervento terapeutico (soprattutto trapianto) assieme a team di rianimazione per il trattamento della sindrome da distress respiratorio acuto. Nel quadro della malattia polmonare dell’adulto, l’idea principale è quella di sviluppare il concetto di strategia minimalista con l’uso di una CEC adiuvante parziale – più che sostitutiva totale – che permetterebbe il recupero metabolico ad integrum del paziente. Nei prossimi anni, i progressi della tecnologia e dell’ingegneria così come le conoscenze approfondite permetteranno il miglioramento della prognosi dei pazienti colpiti da deficit respiratorio sotto assistenza meccanica.","Reeb, J.; Olland, A.; Renaud, S.; Kindo, M.; Santelmo, N.; Massard, G.; Falcoz, P.-E.",EMC - Tecniche Chirurgiche - Chirurgia Generale,113,24

Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue, and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of γδ T cells in lungs. Activation of ketogenesis in aged mice expands tissue protective γδ T cells, deactivates the NLRP3 inflammasome, and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice.

Colleges of pharmacy are faced with the challenge of training students in hospitals that are under considerable pressure at this time. The government of Saudi Arabia has moved all classes and training online to limit the spread of the virus. This study describes the experience of the Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE and APPE) students and preceptors engaged in the virtual IPPE training. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to describe and appraise the implemented virtual IPPE training from the experiences of IPPE and APPE students, and their preceptor. The IPPE students described their experiences in close-ended questionnaires, while APPE students in open-ended questionnaires, and the preceptor described the experiences in narrative. The study focused on highlighting the advantages, opportunities, challenges, and shortcomings of the virtual training. RESULTS: Two preceptors and seven APPE students participated in the preparation and administration of the virtual training. The IPPE students’ experiences, based on 87 respondents, were mostly positive. Although IPPE students enjoyed the time flexibility that allowed the learning of new skills and reflection on previous experiences, 15% experienced difficulty finding quiet places with a reliable internet connection or had difficulty working on team-based activities. Moreover, some were anxious about the lack of adequate patient-care experience. On the other hand, the APPE students found the experience enriching as they gained experience and understanding of academic workflow, gained skills, and overcame the challenges they faced during this virtual training experience. CONCLUSIONS: Future training programs should be organized to overcome the challenges and to maximize the benefits of training experiences. Schools of pharmacy may benefit from the training materials constructed, prepared, and administered by APPE students to improve IPPE students’ learning experiences and outcomes.

We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the risk of clinically relevant VTE in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: This meta-analysis included original articles in English published from January 1st, 2020 to June 15th, 2020 in Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of science, and Cochrane. Outcomes were major VTE, defined as any objectively diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Primary analysis estimated the risk of VTE, stratified by acutely and critically ill inpatients. Secondary analyses explored the separate risk of proximal DVT and of PE; the risk of major VTE stratified by screening and by type of anticoagulation. RESULTS: In 33 studies (n = 4009 inpatients) with heterogeneous thrombotic risk factors, VTE incidence was 9% (95%CI 5–13%, I(2) = 92.5) overall, and 21% (95%CI 14–28%, I(2) = 87.6%) for patients hospitalized in the ICU. Proximal lower limb DVT incidence was 3% (95%CI 1–5%, I(2) = 87.0%) and 8% (95%CI 3–14%, I(2) = 87.6%), respectively. PE incidence was 8% (95%CI 4–13%, I(2) = 92.1%) and 17% (95%CI 11–25%, I(2) = 89.3%), respectively. Screening and absence of anticoagulation were associated with a higher VTE incidence. When restricting to medically ill inpatients, the VTE incidence was 2% (95%CI 0–6%). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of major VTE among COVID-19 inpatients is high but varies greatly with severity of the disease. These findings reinforce the need for the use of thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients and for clinical trials testing different thromboprophylaxis regimens in subgroups of COVID-19 inpatients.

(2) Materials and methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed on PubMed, Medline and Scopus until 10 July. (3) Results: Chemicals, carcinogens and biologically active materials, such as bacteria and viruses, have been isolated in surgical smoke. However, the only evidence of viral transmission through surgical smoke to medical staff is post-laser ablation of HPV-positive genital warts. The reports of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery revealed the presence of the virus, when tested, in digestive wall and stools in 50% of cases but not in bile or peritoneal fluid. All surgeries did not result in contamination of the personnel, when protective measures were applied, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and filtration of the pneumoperitoneum. There are no comparative studies between classical and laparoscopic surgery. (4) Conclusions: Previously published data showed there is a possible infectious and toxic risk related to surgical smoke but not particularly proven for SARS-CoV-2. Implementing standardized filtration systems for smoke evacuation during laparoscopy, although increases costs, is necessary to increase the safety and it will probably remain a routine also in the future.","Serban, Dragos; Smarandache, Catalin Gabriel; Tudor, Corneliu; Duta, Lucian Nicolae; Dascalu, Ana Maria; Aliuș, Cătălin",Diagnostics (Basel),113,28

The gene sequence feature and gene expression patterns in various tissues and buds of the species were characterized. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 14 chlorogenic acid and luteolin biosynthesis-related genes were identified from the L. japonica transcriptome assembly. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the function of individual gene could be differentiation and induce active compound diversity. Their orthologous genes were also recognized in L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides genomic datasets, except for LHCHS1 and LMC4H2. The expression patterns of these genes are different in the tissues of L. japonica, L. hypoglauca and L. macranthoides. Results also showed that CGAs were controlled in the first step of biosynthesis, whereas both steps controlled luteolin in the bud of L. japonica.

The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs’ cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19. They are also critical for VILIs and applicable to future clinical studies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preexposure of cultured cells to either dexamethasone or transdehydroandrosterone significantly decreases cellular injuries associated with mechanical ventilation due to their ability to alter the cell mechanics. This is an alternative protective method against VILIs instead of common methods that rely on modification of mechanical ventilator modes.","Al-Ruweidi, Mahmoud Khatib A.

Studies distinguishing post-COVID conditions from late conditions caused by other etiologies are lacking. Using data from a large administrative all-payer database, we assessed the type, association, and timing of post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, October 20, 2020) data, during March–June 2020, 27,589 inpatients and 46,857 outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 (case-patients) were 1:1 matched with patients without COVID-19 through the 4-month follow-up period (control-patients) by using propensity score matching. In this matched-cohort study, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess for late conditions that were more common in case-patients compared with control-patients. Incidence proportion was calculated for conditions that were more common in case-patients than control-patients during 31–120 days following a COVID-19 encounter. RESULTS: During 31–120 days after an initial COVID-19 inpatient hospitalization, 7.0% of adults experienced at least one of five post-COVID conditions. Among adult outpatients with COVID-19, 7.7% experienced at least one of ten post-COVID conditions. During 31–60 days after an initial outpatient encounter, adults with COVID-19 were 2.8 times as likely to experience acute pulmonary embolism as outpatient control-patients and were also more likely to experience a range of conditions affecting multiple body systems (e.g. nonspecific chest pain, fatigue, headache, and respiratory, nervous, circulatory, and gastrointestinal system symptoms) than outpatient control-patients. Children with COVID-19 were not more likely to experience late conditions than children without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the evidence of late health conditions possibly related to COVID-19 in adults following COVID-19 diagnosis and can inform health care practice and resource planning for follow-up COVID-19 care.","Chevinsky, Jennifer R; Tao, Guoyu; Lavery, Amy M; Kukielka, Esther A; Click, Eleanor S; Malec, Donald; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Bruce, Beau B; Yusuf, Hussain; Goodman, Alyson B; Dixon, Meredith G; Nakao, Jolene H; Datta, S Deblina; Mac Kenzie, William R; Kadri, Sameer; Saydah, Sharon; Giovanni, Jennifer E; Gundlapalli, Adi V",Clin Infect Dis,113,27

Our aim was to determine the effect of time to starting AC from the date of surgery on survival of BC patients, based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: A total of 332,927 Stage I–III BC patients who received AC from 2010 to 2016 were analyzed. We included all ER, PR and HER2 statuses and excluded patients with stage 4 and stage 0 (DCIS) disease. The cohort was divided into five groups based on the time of initiating AC from the date of the most definitive surgery i.e., ≤ 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 91–120 days and > 120 days. They were further divided into five subgroups based on the receptor status. RESULTS: Hazard ratio (HR) estimates and Kaplan–Meier (KM) analysis shows that starting AC by 31–60 days shows the best survival outcome in all the subtypes, except in hormone positive/HER2 negative BC in which 31–60 days and 61–90 days have similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: After surgery for BC, it takes around 4–6 weeks to begin AC and delay in initiating the same leads to poor outcomes. Our results are particularly significant in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), similar to prior studies showing a benefit to starting AC as early as possible after surgery.","Ashok Kumar, Prashanth; Paulraj, Shweta; Wang, Dongliang; Huang, Danning; Sivapiragasam, Abirami",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,113,16

The aim of the current study was to explore the potential role of empathy and self-construal styles, as individual personality traits, on self-reported social distancing. Participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (a multi-dimensional measure of trait-levels of empathy), the Singelis Self-Construal Scale (a measure of self-construal styles), and were asked to rate their level of social distancing and how much they endorsed social distancing on a five-point Likert-scale. Across a large and diverse sample (with participants collected from Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, and United States; total n = 967), results showed that trait-levels of empathic concern (EC) and perspective taking (PT) positively correlates with social distancing. However, we did not find evidence to suggest that trait-levels of personal distress correlates with social distancing. We interpret these findings as suggesting that empathy, both its altruistic (EC) and cognitive (PT) dimensions, plays an important role in motivating people to socially distance and should be emphasized during times of crisis. Furthermore, we suggest that emphasizing a person’s self-distress during times of crisis may not be an effective approach in promotion social distancing policies (or other prosocial behaviors). We also found that both independence and interdependence self-construal styles positively correlates with social distancing. While we expected the latter result, we did not expect the former. This suggests that more work is needed to fully understand how self-construal styles, along with their cultural level analogs (i.e., Individualism-Collectivism), influences social distancing. Overall, these results provide us with novel multi-national data about the role of individual differences on social distancing tendencies specifically, and human behavior during a global health crisis more generally.","Galang, Carl Michael; Johnson, Devin; Obhi, Sukhvinder S.",Front Psychol,113,16

It seems that asymptomatic population may contribute importantly to the spread of the disease. Transmission from asymptomatic pregnant patients’ needs to be characterized in larger population cohorts and symptom assessment needs to be standardized. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 infection in an unselected obstetrical population and to describe their presentation and clinical evolution. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Medical records of pregnant women admitted at the Obstetrics & Gynecology department of Clínica Dávila for labor & delivery, between April 27(th) and June 7(th), 2020 were reviewed. All patients were screened with RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 at admission. After delivery, positive cases were inquired by the researchers for clinical symptoms presented before admission and clinical evolution. All neonates born from mothers with confirmed SARS CoV-2 were isolated and tested for SARS CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 586 patients were tested for SARS CoV-2 during the study period. Outcomes were obtained from 583 patients which were included in the study. Thirty-seven pregnant women had a positive test for SARS CoV-2 at admission. Cumulative prevalence of confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection was 6.35% (37/583) [CI 95%: 4.63–8.65]. From confirmed cases, 43.2% (16/37) were asymptomatic. From symptomatic patients 85.7% (18/21) had mild symptoms and evolved without complications and 14.3% (3/21) presented severe symptoms requiring admission to intensive care unit. Only 5.4% (2/37) of the neonates born to mothers with a positive test at admission had a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2. CONCLUSION: In our study nearly half of pregnant patients with SARS CoV-2 were asymptomatic at the time of delivery. Universal screening, in endemic areas, is necessary for adequate patient isolation, prompt neonatal testing and targeted follow-up.","Díaz-Corvillón, Pilar; Mönckeberg, Max; Barros, Antonia; Illanes, Sebastián E.; Soldati, Arturo; Nien, Jyh-Kae; Schepeler, Manuel; Caradeux, Javier",PLoS One,113,20

Considering the uncertainty about policies, health risks, financial difficulties, etc. the online media, especially the Twitter platform, is experiencing a high volume of activity related to this pandemic. Among the hot topics, the polarized debates about unconfirmed medicines for the treatment and prevention of the disease have attracted significant attention from online media users. In this work, we present a stance data set, COVID-CQ, of user-generated content on Twitter in the context of COVID-19. We investigated more than 14 thousand tweets and manually annotated the tweet initiators’ opinions regarding the use of “chloroquine” and “hydroxychloroquine” for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, COVID-CQ is the first data set of Twitter users’ stances in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the largest Twitter data set on users’ stances towards a claim, in any domain. We have made this data set available to the research community via the Mendeley Data repository.

The network based on progressive upsampling for COVID-CT super-resolution increases the reconstruction error. This paper proposes a progressive back-projection network (PBPN) for COVID-CT super-resolution to solve this problem. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a progressive back-projection network (PBPN) for COVID-CT super-resolution. PBPN is divided into two stages, and each stage consists of back-projection, deep feature extraction and upscaling. We design an up-projection and down-projection residual module to minimize the reconstruction error and construct a residual attention module to extract deep features. In each stage, firstly, PBPN performs back-projection to extract shallow features by two up-projection and down-projection residual modules; then, PBPN extracts deep features from the shallow features by two residual attention modules; finally, PBPN upsamples the deep features through sub-pixel convolution. RESULTS: The proposed method achieves the improvements of about 0.14∼0.47dB/0.0012∼0.0060 for × 2 scale factor, 0.02∼0.08dB/0.0024∼0.0059 for × 3 scale factor, and 0.08∼0.41dB/ 0.0040∼0.0147 for × 4 scale factor than state-of-the-art methods (Bicubic, SRCNN, FSRCNN, VDSR, LapSRN, DRCN and DSRN) in terms of PSNR/SSIM on benchmark datasets.

Despite the existence of interventions that address anxieties, lack of data on the size of the problem, especially in the Middle East where mental health stigmatized, means that outcomesmay not be maximized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study was cross-sectional survey of the University of Sharjah (UOS), the United Arab Emirates students undergoing clinical training in health sciences. The participants were selected from all the three UOS campuses: medical and science colleges; women’s colleges; and men’s colleges. A sample of 219 clinical training students were randomly sent an electronic link to participate on an online survey. The study received ethical approval from the UOS Research Ethics Committee number is REC-20-03-04-02-S. RESULTS: The mean score for state anxiety was 47.24±1.31 and the mean score for trait anxiety was 46.82±1.21. These scores indicated a high level of anxiety among students undertaking clinical training. Overall, 63% of the sample were classified as having high state anxiety, and 62% had high trait anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study shows clinical training students experience high levels of state and trait anxiety. It is necessary to address this issue to improve the conditions and circumstances for students entering clinical training.

HO-1 induction was recently shown to result in anti-HCV activity by inducing type I interferon and inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease activity. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of celastrol and characterize its mechanism of inhibition. METHODS: The anti-HCV activity of celastrol was evaluated using the HCV subgenomic replicon and HCVcc infection systems. The anti-HCV mechanism of celastrol targeting HO-1 expression was clarified using specific inhibitors against several signaling pathways. The transcriptional regulation of celastrol on target gene expression was determined using promoter-based reporter activity assay. The synergistic effect of celastrol and a numbers of clinically used anti-HCV drugs was determined via a drug combination assay. RESULTS: Celastrol inhibited HCV replication in both the HCV subgenomic and HCVcc infection systems with EC50 values of 0.37 ± 0.022 and 0.43 ± 0.019 μM, respectively. Celastrol-induced heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression promoted antiviral interferon responses and inhibition of NS3/4A protease activity, thereby blocking HCV replication. These antiviral effects were abrogated by treatment with the HO-1-specific inhibitor SnMP or silencing of HO-1 expression by transfection of shRNA, which indicates that HO-1 induction contributes to the anti-HCV activity of celastrol. JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were confirmed to be involved in the inductive effect of celastrol on HO-1 expression. Celastrol exhibited synergistic effects in combination with interferon-alpha, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, and the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir. CONCLUSION: Celastrol can serve as a potential supplement for blocking HCV replication. Targeting the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis presents a promising strategy against HCV infection.","Tseng, Chin-Kai; Hsu, Sung-Po; Lin, Chun-Kuang; Wu, Yu-Hsuan; Lee, Jin-Ching; Young, Kung-Chia",Antiviral Res,113,26

Participants completed a newly developed COVID‐19 Fear (Higher Education) scale to measure three domains of fear including fear of infection, fear of instability and fear of insecurity related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. They also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7‐item scale (GAD‐7) on the severity of anxiety symptoms. About 9.6% of the participants could be classified as exhibiting high anxiety level according to the GAD‐7. More students studying overseas (about 15%) were classified into the high GAD group when compared to students studying in both mainland China (6.6%) and Hong Kong (6.1%). MANOVA results showed that students studying in Hong Kong and overseas had more concerns related to preventive measures related to COVID‐19 than their mainland counterparts did. We concluded that international students studying away from their home country would have higher risk to develop anxiety problems during a collective trauma such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.

WeChat is a social media with the largest number of users in China. Its public account has become the most popular service among the public. METHODS: We examine the health communication of medical institutions on social media platforms. The WeChat public accounts of Zhejiang Provincial Chinese Traditional Medicine Hospital and Jiangxi Provincial Chinese Traditional Medicine Hospital were taken as cases to measure the communication effect from the following dimensions: update interval, content positioning and design, numbers of clicks and likes as well as topic types. RESULTS: The update interval of WeChat public account of Jiangxi Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine was regular, compared with that of the other hospital. The accounts of the two hospitals both set up special sections to facilitate patients to obtain medical services online. There is an extremely significant difference between the two hospitals’ mean numbers of clicks (p < 0. 001), compared with no significant difference between their mean numbers of likes. One-way analysis of variance suggests the type of topic on posts is significantly correlated with the number of clicks. Moreover, there is an extremely significant difference between public health knowledge and news propaganda. CONCLUSION: The development of hospitals’ WeChat public accounts can promote people’s health and equity in accessing medical information and service, and also boost “Internet plus health care” service. The topic type of hospital’s news publicity is paid a relatively lower attention by users. Therefore, hospitals’ WeChat public accounts need to adjust their strategy from propaganda-oriented to users-centered, with topic planning and posts designed to fulfill users’ needs.","Wang, Jie; Wu, Lanting",BMC Health Serv Res,113,29

We used the Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, health care delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. RESULTS: A total of 6510 HCWs, including 1794 nurses and 904 non-patient-facing administrators, participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were White, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic, and 3.1% were non-Hispanic Black. The crude prevalence of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% CI, 4.6%–5.2%).

Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Siaα2,3 Gal and Siaα2,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Siaα2,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF.","Chaves, Aida J; Busquets, Núria; Valle, Rosa; Rivas, Raquel; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Dolz, Roser; Ramis, Antonio; Darji, Ayub; Majó, Natàlia",Vet Res,113,32

Data from Twitter could be used to better understand the interest in and perceptions of a variety of diseases and medical conditions, including rheumatological diseases which have increased in prevalence over the past several decades. The aim of this study was to perform a content analysis of tweets referring to rheumatological diseases. Methods: The content of each tweet was rated as medical (including a reference to diagnosis, treatment, or other aspects of the disease) or non-medical (such as requesting help). The type of user and the suitability of the medical content (appropriate content or, on the contrary, fake content if it was medically inappropriate according to the current medical knowledge) were also evaluated. The number of retweets and likes generated were also investigated. Results: We analyzed a total of 1514 tweets: 1093 classified as medical and 421 as non-medical. The diseases with more tweets were the most prevalent. Within the medical tweets, the content of these varied according to the disease (some more focused on diagnosis and others on treatment). The fake content came from unidentified users and mostly referred to the treatment of diseases. Conclusions: According to our results, the analysis of content posted on Twitter in regard to rheumatological diseases may be useful for investigating the public’s prevailing areas of interest, concerns and opinions.

Researchers have suggested that COVID-19 death characteristics (e.g., intensive care admission, unexpected death) and circumstances (e.g., secondary stressors, social isolation) will precipitate a worldwide increase of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD). Yet, no study has investigated this. Since acute grief is a strong predictor of future pathological grief, we compared grief levels among people recently bereaved due to COVID-19, natural, and unnatural causes. METHODS: People bereaved through COVID-19 (n = 49), natural causes (n = 1182), and unnatural causes (n = 210), completed self-report measures of demographic and loss-related characteristics and PGD and PCBD symptoms. RESULTS: COVID-19 bereavement yielded higher symptom levels of PGD (d = 0.42) and PCBD (d = 0.35) than natural bereavement (but not unnatural bereavement). Effects held when limiting analyses to recent losses and those who participated during the pandemic. Expectedness of the death explained this effect. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include using a convenience sample and self-report measures. CONCLUSIONS: Higher grief levels occur among people bereaved due to COVID-19 compared to people bereaved due to natural loss.

As a first step to overcome technical limitations in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 along the water cycle, we assessed the analytical performance of a dead end hollow fiber ultrafiltration coupled to different options for secondary concentrations to concentrate viral particles from large volume of spiked tap water, seawater and surface water together with two quantitative RT-qPCR detection kits. Spiking the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, together with the mengovirus, we demonstrated that PEG-precipitation and SENS-kit better recovered PEDV (13.10 ± 0.66%) from tap water, while centrifugal filtration resulted the best option to recover mengovirus regardless of the detection kit used. No statistical significant differences were found when comparing high (10,000 ×g) and low (3500 ×g) centrifugation speeds for the secondary PEG- based concentration of spiked seawater, while considerable inhibition was observed for both viruses detected by NoInh-kit assay. Similarly, the co-concentration of PCR inhibitors and viral particles was observed in surface waters detected with either SENS-kit or NoInh-kit and RNA dilution was needed to achieve acceptable recoveries at the expenses of the overall sensitivity of the method. These methodologies represent suitable options to investigate SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in different water resources and allow to conduct on site sampling of large volume of water.","Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Pérez-Cataluña, Alba; Allende, Ana; Guix, Susana; Randazzo, Walter; Sánchez, Gloria",Sci Total Environ,113,12

The mask prices came down quickly, ensuring public health and suppressing the spread of the pandemic, and the sales of KF94 masks reverted to the free market system on July 12, 2020. This paper aims to evaluate the unintended consequence of public masks to mitigate any negative effects for future deployment. METHODS: The relationship between the offline and online prices of KF94 masks and the production quantity of medical masks was estimated using the data after July 12, 2020 (the “free market” period), and, given the regression results, counterfactual analyses were conducted to predict what the offline and online prices of KF94 masks would have been before July 12, 2020 (the “public masks” period) had the sales of medical masks reverted to the free market system a month earlier than July 12, 2020. RESULTS: The prolonged deployment of public masks distorted the ratio of offline and online prices of KF94 masks and kept the prices artificially high at its later stage. How much higher? The online price of privately sold KF94 masks would have been roughly thirty to forty percent lower and the offline price roughly three to four percent lower if public masks ended four weeks earlier. CONCLUSION: The government intervention achieved its intended consequence of controlling the surging prices of KF94 masks at the early days of Covid-19, but the prolonged use of public masks had the unintended consequence of distorting market outcomes. The lesson? The government intervention should be kept brief, and the free market system should return as soon as the crisis subsides.","Ahn, Dae-Yong",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,113,1

National and subnational authorities have introduced several measures to tackle the resulting crisis, including social distancing and restrictions on economic activities. However, as we will show in this contribution, such measures have sometimes resulted in uncertainty concerning the allocation of decision making powers along the central–local government continuum and regarding the exercise of administrative tasks by public authorities, thus producing conflict and variation within the policymaking and policy‐delivery processes in Italy. To show this, we review the relevant events that occurred during the pandemic in the country in light both of the literature on centralization and discretion and of the principles shaping the Italian legal system. Our analysis, based on a dialogue between political science and public law, allows us to read the Italian case as a mix of inadequate institutional coordination and insufficient and unclear central guidelines which ultimately produced uncertainty, which together had a direct impact on policymakers, policy‐deliverers, and citizens in general.","Malandrino, Anna; Demichelis, Elena",European policy analysis,113,1

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have determined the crystal structures of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59 and a C425S site-directed mutant. The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N- and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an “open” conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a “closed” conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As nsp4C is exposed in the reducing cytosol, the monomer of nsp4C should be physiological. This structure may serve as a basis for further functional studies of nsp4.","Xu, Xiaoling; Lou, Zhiyong; Ma, Yanlin; Chen, Xuehui; Yang, Zhangsheng; Tong, Xiaohang; Zhao, Qi; Xu, Yuanyuan; Deng, Hongyu; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe",PLoS One,113,17

We previously reported that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV‐229E) infection can alleviate the BST2 tethering of HIV‐1 virions by downregulating cell surface BST2, suggesting that coronaviruses are capable of encoding anti‐BST2 factors. Here we report our new finding that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein, similar to Vpu, is capable of antagonizing the BST2 tethering of SARS‐CoV, HCoV‐229E, and HIV‐1 virus‐like particles via BST2 downregulation. However, unlike Vpu (which downmodulates BST2 by means of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways), BST2 downregulation is apparently mediated by SARS‐CoV S through the lysosomal degradation pathway only. We found that SARS‐CoV S colocalized with both BST2 and reduced cell surface BST2, suggesting an association between SARS‐CoV S and BST2 that targets the lysosomal degradation pathway. According to one recent report, SARS‐CoV ORF7a antagonizes BST2 by interfering with BST2 glycosylation(1). Our data provide support for the proposal that SARS‐CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving supplementary anti‐BST2 factors in a manner that requires virus replication. Further experiments are required to determine whether the BST2‐mediated restriction of authentic SARS‐CoV virions is alleviated by the SARS‐CoV spike protein.","Wang, Shiu‐Mei; Huang, Kuo‐Jung; Wang, Chin‐Tien",J Med Virol,113,20

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial from 6/2017 to 6/2018 at a quaternary care children's hospital. Students were randomized to TDS or SPM during each 2-week block. All students completed a critical appraisal tool (CAT) of evidence related to a clinical question in a standardized appraisal form and self-reflected about the EBM process. The primary outcome was the numeric score of the CAT derived by using the validated Fresno tool. Secondary outcomes of knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and self-reported behaviors related to EBM were measured using validated surveys. Statistical analysis was performed using student's t-test for CAT scores and mixed-model procedure (PROC MIXED), with subject as random effect and time as repeated measure for the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 127 clerkship students were included. Overall, there was no significant difference in mean CAT scores for TDS (n=59) versus SPM (n=66) groups (90.3 vs. 92.0, p=0.65). There were no significant differences between SPM and TDS groups for knowledge (p=0.66), attitudes (p=0.97), confidence (p=0.55), and accessing evidence (p=0.27). Both groups showed significant gains in knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and accessing evidence from baseline to post course. Improvements in knowledge and confidence were sustained at 3-months. CONCLUSION: A SPM learning module is as effective as a TDS module for application of EBM concepts and knowledge to patient care.","Hadvani, Teena; Dutta, Ankhi; Choy, Eric; Kumar, Shelley; Molleda, Carolina; Parikh, Vipul; Lopez, Michelle A.; Lui, Karen; Ban, Kathryn; Wallace, Sowdhamini S.",Acad Pediatr,113,24

In this study, we examined the barriers and facilitators to engaging Community Health Workers (CHWs) for NCDs prevention and control in Bangladesh. METHODS: We used multipronged approaches, including a. Situation analyses using a literature review, key personnel and stakeholders’ consultative meetings, and exploratory studies. A grounded theory approach was used for qualitative data collection from health facilities across three districts in Bangladesh. We conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs (Health Inspector; Community Health Care Provider; Health Assistant and Health Supervisor) (n = 4); key informant interviews with central level health policymakers/ managers (n = 15) and focus group discussions with CHWs (4 FGDs; total n = 29). Participants in a stakeholder consultative meeting included members from the government (n = 4), non-government organisations (n = 2), private sector (n = 1) and universities (n = 2). Coding of the qualitative data and identification of themes from the transcripts were carried out and thematic approach was used for data analyses. RESULTS: The CHWs in Bangladesh deliver a wide range of public health programs. They also provide several NCDs specific services, including screening, provisional diagnosis, and health education and counselling for common NCDs, dispensing basic medications, and referral to relevant health facilities. These services are being delivered from the sub-district health facility, community clinics and urban health clinics. The participants identified key challenges and barriers, which include lack of NCD specific guidelines, inadequate training, excessive workload, inadequate systems-level support, and lack of logistics supplies and drugs. Yet, the facilitating factors to engaging CHWs included government commitment and program priority, development of NCD related policies and strategies, establishment of NCD corners, community support systems, social recognition of health care staff and their motivation. CONCLUSION: Engaging CHWs has been a key driver to NCDs services delivery in Bangladesh. However, there is a need for building capacity of CHWs, maximizing CHWs engagement to NCD services delivery, facilitating systems-level support and strengthening partnerships with non-state sectors would be effective in prevention and control efforts of NCDs in Bangladesh.

METHODS: Here, we employed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model to estimate the proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases in Italy from the reported number of deaths prior to the adoption of national control measures. RESULTS: We estimated 115 894 infectious individuals (95% confidence interval (CI) = 95 318-140 455) and a total of 144 116 cases (95% CI = 119 030-173 959) on 20 March, 2020. These estimates resulted in 67.3% (95% CI = 60.3%-73.0%) unreported infectious individuals and in 67.4% (95% CI = 60.5%-73.0%) total cases. As such, given the substantial volume of undocumented cases, the case fatality risk would drop from an apparent 8.6% to an estimated 2.6% (95% CI = 2.2%-2.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings partially explain the case fatality risk observed in Italy with a high proportion of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Genomic sequencing analysis has demonstrated the ability to uncover viral genetic diversity. However, an objective analysis is necessary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations. Herein, we detected all the mutations in 186 682 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We found that the GC content of the SARS-CoV-2 genome had evolved to be lower, which may be conducive to viral spread, and the frameshift mutation was rare in the global population. Next, we encoded the genomic mutations in binary form and used an unsupervised learning classifier, namely PhenoGraph, to classify this information. Consequently, PhenoGraph successfully identified 303 SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations, and we found that the PhenoGraph classification was consistent with, but more detailed and precise than the known GISAID clades (S, L, V, G, GH, GR, GV and O). By the change trend analysis, we found that the growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 diversity has slowed down significantly. We also analyzed the temporal, spatial and phylogenetic relationships among the subpopulations and revealed the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 to a certain extent.

All professions have been affected by stressful situations and anxiety in the proximity’s face of death generated by the pandemic. In this context, some professionals have emerged as essential, as social workers, acting in extreme situations in the face of increased demands and social uncertainty arising from the health crisis. The present study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety about death among social workers in Spain. For this purpose, an ad hoc questionnaire was designed, taking the Collett and Lester Fear of Death Scale as a reference (n = 304). The exploitation of the data was carried out from a quantitative perspective. First, a descriptive analysis was performed. Then, binary logistic regressions were carried out on the general scale. The dependent variable in all of them was the risk of suffering death anxiety to the set of its subscales. The main research results show high values of this anxiety in social workers concerning the general value of the scale—and the subscales—and the point of view of state and process. The highest values were Fear of Death of Others (81.6%) and Fear of the Process of Dying of Others (78.3%). Regarding the binary logistic regressions applied, predictor variables were identified in all of them, but the following stand out: Lack of personal protection equipment and Need psychological or psychiatric support.

METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged ≥40 were eligible if they had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) nine months before the pandemic and a lateral flow-based test for identification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the peak of the pandemic. Six months later, individuals completed a follow-up PSQI. The independent relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and deterioration in sleep quality was assessed by fitting logistic mixed models for longitudinal data. RESULTS: Of 639 participants (mean age at baseline: 59±12.8 years), 325 (51%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A total of 185 (29%) individuals at baseline and 311 (49%) at follow-up were poor sleepers (p<0.001). Mixed logistic regression models demonstrated a significant increase in poor sleepers at follow-up (OR: 2.85; 95% C.I.: 2.16 – 3.75), which was more marked among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive subjects (OR: 3.8; 95% C.I.: 2.48 – 5.81).

These lingering symptoms may persist for weeks to months after resolution of the acute illness. This study aimed to add insight into our understanding of certain post-acute conditions and clinical findings. The primary purpose was to determine the persistent post COVID impairments prevalence and characteristics by collecting post COVID illness data utilizing Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)). The resulting measures were used to assess surveyed patients physical, mental, and social health status. METHODS: A cross-sectional study and 6-months Mayo Clinic COVID recovered registry data were used to evaluate continuing symptoms severity among the 817 positive tested patients surveyed between March and September 2020. The resulting PROMIS(®) data set was used to analyze patients post 30 days health status. The e-mailed questionnaires focused on fatigue, sleep, ability to participate in social roles, physical function, and pain. RESULTS: The large sample size (n = 817) represented post hospitalized and other managed outpatients. Persistent post COVID impairments prevalence and characteristics were determined to be demographically young (44 years), white (87%), and female (61%). Dysfunction as measured by the PROMIS(®) scales in patients recovered from acute COVID-19 was reported as significant in the following domains: ability to participate in social roles (43.2%), pain (17.8%), and fatigue (16.2%). CONCLUSION: Patient response on the PROMIS(®) scales was similar to that seen in multiple other studies which used patient reported symptoms. As a result of this experience, we recommend utilizing standardized scales such as the PROMIS(®) to obtain comparable data across the patients’ clinical course and define the disease trajectory. This would further allow for effective comparison of data across studies to better define the disease process, risk factors, and assess the impact of future treatments.","Ganesh, Ravindra; Ghosh, Aditya K.; Nyman, Mark A.; Croghan, Ivana T.; Grach, Stephanie L.; Anstine, Christopher V.; Salonen, Bradley R.; Hurt, Ryan T.",J Prim Care Community Health,113,24

Finally, policies and recommendations for the manufacture, quality control, and use of inactivated autogenous vaccines are addressed to advance this important field in veterinary medicine.","Segura, Mariela; Aragon, Virginia; Brockmeier, Susan L.; Gebhart, Connie; de Greeff, Astrid; Kerdsin, Anusak; O’Dea, Mark A; Okura, Masatoshi; Saléry, Mariette; Schultsz, Constance; Valentin-Weigand, Peter; Weinert, Lucy A.; Wells, Jerry M.; Gottschalk, Marcelo",Pathogens,113,19
688442,688442,688442,A national consensus management pathway for Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS): The results of a national Delphi process,14.128612,12.354399,2020-07-23,"One of the most common cancers worldwide is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is associated with a significant death rate and has been linked to several risk factors. Notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of OSCC patients. In the present study, serum samples from OSCC patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. In this regard, 2-DE spots corresponding to various up- and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analyzed using the MASCOT database. We identified the following differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from OSCC patients: leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG), alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (ABG), clusterin (CLU), PRO2044, haptoglobin (HAP), complement C3c (C3), proapolipoprotein A1 (proapo-A1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (RBP4). Moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from Acinetobacter lwoffii, Burkholderia multivorans, Myxococcus xanthus, Laribacter hongkongensis, and Streptococcus salivarius. Subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from OSCC patients. In this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: CLU, HAP, C3, proapo-A1 and RBP4. Taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for OSCC.","Chen, Yeng; Azman, Siti Nuraishah; Kerishnan, Jesinda P.; Zain, Rosnah Binti; Chen, Yu Nieng; Wong, Yin-Ling; Gopinath, Subash C.

At the beginning of May 2020, 22 out of 70 Belgian soldiers deployed to a military education and training center in Maradi, Niger, developed mild COVID-19 compatible symptoms. Immediately upon their return to Belgium, and two weeks later, all seventy soldiers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-qPCR) and antibodies (two immunoassays). Nine soldiers had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test result. Five of them exhibited COVID-19 symptoms (mainly anosmia, ageusia, and fever), while four were asymptomatic. In four soldiers, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected and the genomes were sequenced. Conventional and genomic epidemiological data suggest that these genomes have an African most recent common ancestor and that the Belgian military service men were infected through contact with locals. The medical military command implemented testing of all Belgian soldiers for SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies, two to three days before their departure on a mission abroad or on the high seas, and for specific missions immediately upon their return in Belgium. Some military operational settings (e.g., training camps in austere environments and ships) were also equipped with mobile infectious disease (COVID-19) testing capacity.","Pirnay, Jean-Paul; Selhorst, Philippe; Cochez, Christel; Petrillo, Mauro; Claes, Vincent; Van der Beken, Yolien; Verbeken, Gilbert; Degueldre, Julie; T’Sas, France; Van den Eede, Guy; Weuts, Wouter; Smets, Cedric; Mertens, Jan; Geeraerts, Philippe; Ariën, Kevin K.; Neirinckx, Pierre; Soentjens, Patrick",Viruses,113,2

Methods: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high fat diet comprising of standard laboratory rat chow 84.3%, lard 5%, egg yolk powder 10%, cholesterol 0.2% and bile salt 0.5% for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the animals were kept in an overnight fast and injected with low dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.w). Results: Theaflavin (100 mg/kg b.w /day) was administered orally to diabetic rats for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, diabetic control rats showed significant increase in plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with concomitant decrease in plasma insulin, total hemoglobin and body weight. The activities of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes, glycogen content and glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase were also altered in diabetic rats. Discussion: Oral administration of theaflavin to diabetic rats significantly ameliorated all the biochemical alterations to near normal levels. The results of the present study suggest that theaflavin exhibits antidiabetic effect through its antioxidant activity.","Gothandam, Kirubananthan; Ganesan, Vijayan Siva; Ayyasamy, Thangaraj; Ramalingam, Sundaram",Redox Rep,113,26
