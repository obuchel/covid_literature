60392,Alteration in the psychologic status and family environment of pregnant women before and during the Covid-19 pandemic.,2021-01-05,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is becoming increasingly central in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Recent developments in DBS lead and implantable pulse generator design provide increased flexibility for programming, potentially improving the therapeutic benefit of stimulation. Directional DBS leads may increase the therapeutic window of stimulation by providing a means of avoiding current spread to structures that might give rise to stimulation-related side effects. Similarly, control of current to individual contacts on a DBS lead allows for shaping of the electric field produced between multiple active contacts. The following review aims to describe the recent developments in DBS system technology and the features of each commercially available DBS system. The advantages of each system are reviewed, and general considerations for choosing the most appropriate system are discussed.","Paff, Michelle; Loh, Aaron; Sarcia, Can; Lozano, Andres M; Fasano, Alfonso",Journal of movement disorders,https://doi.org/10.14802/jmd.20052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854482/,844
62026,The virus in the rivers: histories and antibiotic afterlives of the bacteriophage at the sangam in Allahabad.,2020-12-20,"BACKGROUND There is a high risk of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) because of chronic immunosuppression and severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION A case series of 10 KTRs with COVID-19 in Iran was developed. Participants consisted of two female and eight male patients, aged 46 to 68 years old. The data related to clinical laboratory tests, outcomes, diagnosis, and drug treatments were collected. The RT-PCR confirmed the COVID-19 infection in KTRs. The assessment of serum biochemical and blood hematological factors showed that there was a strong correlation between COVID-19 intensity and high serum Cr, BUN, and ALT levels, high CRP concentration, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts in male KTRs. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the main radiologic pattern visible on both chest radiographs of computed tomography scans. The COVID-19 and CMV coinfection in KTRs resulted in large-size kidneys with severe parenchymal echogenicity and hydronephrosis. The combined use of effective antibiotic and antiviral drugs was suitable to prevent COVID-19 progression in KTRs. CONCLUSIONS The coincidence of COVID-19 and CMV in KTRs may potentially increase the mortality risk of patients. The levels of Cr, BUN, ALT, and CRP as well as lymphocytes count in these patients should be continuously controlled.","Molaei, Hamideh; Khedmat, Leila; Nemati, Eghlim; Rostami, Zohreh; Hassan Saadat, Seyed",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881220/,844

66678,Foreword.,2006,"We reviewed exercise trials in men and women ≥ 45 years with hyperkyphosis at the baseline and performed meta-analyses for kyphosis and health-related outcomes. PURPOSE To determine the effects of exercise interventions on kyphosis angle, back extensor muscle strength or endurance, physical functioning, quality of life, pain, falls, and adverse events in adults 45 years or older with hyperkyphosis. METHODS Multiple databases were searched to May 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCT, and pre-post intervention studies that had at least one group with a mean kyphosis angle of at least 40° at the baseline were included. RESULTS Twenty-four studies were included. Exercise or physical therapy improved kyphosis outcomes (SMD - 0.31; 95% confidence intervals [CI] - 0.46, - 0.16; moderate certainty evidence), back extensor muscle strength (MD 10.51 N; 95% CI 6.65, 14.38; very low certainty evidence), and endurance (MD 9.76 s; 95% CI 6.40, 13.13; low certainty evidence). Meta-analyses showed improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SMD 0.21; 95% CI 0.06, 0.37; moderate certainty of evidence), general pain (MD - 0.26; 95% CI - 0.39, - 0.13; low certainty of evidence), and performance on the timed up and go (TUG) test (MD - 0.28 s; 95% CI - 0.48, - 0.08; very low certainty of evidence). The effects on the rate of falls (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.15; 95% CI 0.64, 2.05; low certainty evidence) or minor adverse events (IRR 1.29; 95% CI 0.95, 1.74; low certainty evidence) are uncertain. No serious adverse events were reported in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS Interventions targeting hyperkyphosis may improve kyphosis outcomes in adults with hyperkyphosis.","Ponzano, Matteo; Tibert, Nicholas; Bansal, Symron; Katzman, Wendy; Giangregorio, Lora",Archives of osteoporosis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11657-021-00998-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546447/,844
66802,Systematic review of areca (betel nut) use and adverse pregnancy outcomes.,2019,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has currently attracted increasing attention due to its potential function in regulating energy homeostasis, other than the actions on cellular growth, blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance. The existence of RAS is well established in metabolic organs, including pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - angiotensin II pathway contributes to the impairment of insulin secretion, glucose transport, fat distribution, and adipokines production. However, the activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - angiotensin (1-7) pathway, a novel branch of the RAS, plays an opposite role in the ACE pathway, which could reverse these consequences by improving local microcirculation, inflammation, stress state, structure remolding, and insulin signaling pathway. In addition, new studies indicate the protective RAS arm possesses extraordinary ability to enhance brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and induces browning of white adipose tissue, and consequently, it leads to increased energy expenditure in the form of heat instead of ATP synthesis. Interestingly, ACE2 is the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is threating public health worldwide. The main complications of SARS-CoV-2 infected death patients include many energy metabolism-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes. The specific mechanism leading to this phenomenon is largely unknown. Here, we summarize the latest pharmacological and genetic tools on regulating ACE/ACE2 balance and highlight the beneficial effects of the ACE2 pathway axis hyperactivity on glycolipid metabolism, as well as the thermogenic modulation.","Cao, Xi; Song, Li-Ni; Yang, Jin-Kui",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533405/,844
67934,Perceptions of obstetricians and pediatricians about the risk of COVID-19 for pregnant women and newborns.,2020-06-08,"REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY Diagnostic navicular bursoscopy has been described in limited cases. Review of greater numbers is needed to define its contribution to case management and prognostic values. OBJECTIVES To report: 1) clinical, diagnostic and endoscopic findings in a series of cases, 2) surgical techniques and case outcomes and 3) prognostic values. The authors hypothesise: 1) lameness localising to the navicular bursa is commonly associated with dorsal border deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, 2) endoscopy allows extent of injuries to be assessed and treated, 3) case outcome relates to severity of DDFT injury and 4) the technique is safe and associated with little morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS All horses that underwent endoscopy of a forelimb navicular bursa for investigation of lameness were identified. Case files were reviewed and those with injuries within the bursa selected for further analysis. RESULTS One-hundred-and-fourteen horses were identified. Ninety-two had injuries within the bursa and DDFT injuries were identified in 98% of bursae. Of those examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 56% had combination injuries involving the DDFT and navicular bone. Sixty-one percent of horses returned to work sound, 42% returned to previous performance. Horses with extensive tearing and combination injuries of the DDFT and navicular bone identified with MRI, had worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Lameness localising to the navicular bursa is commonly associated with injuries to the dorsal border of the DDFT. Endoscopy permits identification and characterisation of injuries within the navicular bursa and enables lesion management. Outcome following debridement is related to severity of injury but overall is reasonable. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE Horses with lameness localising to the navicular bursa may have tears of the DDFT. Bursoscopy is able to contribute diagnostic and prognostic information and debridement of lesions improves outcome compared to cases managed conservatively.","Smith, M R W; Wright, I M",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00443.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21848532/,844
69558,Anxieties and apprehensions among women waiting for fertility treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-06,"OBJECTIVE To examine the accuracy of the reporting of conflicts of interest (COI) among studies related to mesh use in ventral hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Accurate declaration of COI is integral to ensuring transparency of study results. Multiple studies have demonstrated undeclared COI are prevalent in surgical literature. METHODS Studies with at least one American author accepted between 2014-2018 in 12 major, peer-reviewed general surgery and plastic surgery journals were included. Declared COI were compared with payments listed in the ""Open Payments"" database (maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS]) during the year of acceptance and one year prior. Studies and authors were considered to have a COI if they received payments from any of 8 major mesh companies totaling > $100.00 from each company. Risk factors for undeclared COI were determined at the study and author levels. RESULTS 126 studies (553 authors) were included. 102 studies (81.0%) had one or more authors who received payments from industry and inaccurately declared their COI. 248 authors (44.8%) did not declare their COI accurately. On multivariate analysis, last authors were found to be at highest risk for undeclared payments (OR 3.59, 95%CI 2.02-6.20), while middle authors were at significantly higher risk for undeclared payments than first authors (OR 1.64, 95%CI 1.04-2.56). CONCLUSIONS The majority of studies investigating the use of mesh in ventral hernia repairs and abdominal wall reconstructions did not accurately declare COI. Last authors are at highest risk of undisclosed payments. Current policies on disclosing COI seem to be insufficient to ensure transparency of publications.","Sekigami, Yurie; Tian, Tina; Char, Sydney; Radparvar, Jacob; Aalberg, Jeffrey; Chen, Lilian; Chatterjee, Abhishek",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443908/,844

Despite the evidence that maximizing ovarian response can improve the chances of live born babies in poor responders, there are still voices suggesting that all poor responders are the same, irrespective of their age and their actual ovarian reserve. This has resulted in the suggestion of adopting a mild ovarian stimulation approach for all poor responders, based on the results of several trials which failed to identity differences when comparing mild and more intense stimulation in predicted poor responders. The current article analyzes in detail these studies and discusses the shortcomings in terms of type of population included, outcomes and settings performed, which may actually be responsible for the belief that only mild stimulation should be used. In the era of individualization in medicine, it must be realized that there are subgroups of predicted poor responders who will benefit from an individual rather than 'one fits all' mild stimulation approach and thus we should provide the same standard of treatment for all our poor responder patients.","Polyzos, N P; Popovic-Todorovic, B",Human reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830232/,844
73909,A multicenter study comparing surgical outcomes and ultrasonographic evaluation of scarring after laparoscopic myomectomy with conventional versus barbed sutures.,2016,"MRI-based vessel size imaging (VSI) allows for in-vivo assessment of cerebral microvasculature and perfusion. This exploratory analysis of vessel size (VS) and density (Q; both assessed via VSI) in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke involved sixty-two patients from the BAPTISe cohort ('Biomarkers And Perfusion--Training-Induced changes after Stroke') nested within a randomized controlled trial (intervention: 4-week training vs. relaxation). Relative VS, Q, cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and -flow (rCBF) were calculated for: ischemic lesion, perilesional tissue, and region corresponding to ischemic lesion on the contralateral side (mirrored lesion). Linear mixed-models detected significantly increased rVS and decreased rQ within the ischemic lesion compared to the mirrored lesion (coefficient[standard error]: 0.2[0.08] p = 0.03 and -1.0[0.3] p = 0.02, respectively); lesion rCBF and rCBV were also significantly reduced. Mixed-models did not identify time-to-MRI, nor training as modifying factors in terms of rVS or rQ up to two months post-stroke. Larger lesion VS was associated with larger lesion volumes (β 34, 95%CI 6.2-62; p = 0.02) and higher baseline NIHSS (β 3.0, 95%CI 0.49-5.3;p = 0.02), but was not predictive of six-month outcome. In summary, VSI can assess the cerebral microvasculature and tissue perfusion in the subacute phases of ischemic stroke, and may carry relevant prognostic value in terms of lesion volume and stroke severity.","Kufner, Anna; Khalil, Ahmed A; Galinovic, Ivana; Kellner, Elias; Mekle, Ralf; Rackoll, Torsten; Boehm-Sturm, Philipp; Fiebach, Jochen B; Flöel, Agnes; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Nave, Alexander H",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x211010071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866849/,844

One potentially beneficial component of the Joint Commission VAD Certification process is the requirement that individual VAD programs select 4 performance measures to improve and optimize patients' clinical outcomes. PROBLEM STATEMENT Review of patient data after our program's first certification visit in 2008 showed that, compared to national recommendations and published reports, our patients had suboptimal outcomes in 4 areas after device implantation: length of hospital stay, receipt of early (<48 hours) postsurgical physical therapy, driveline infection incidence, and adequacy of nutritional status (prealbumin ≥18 mg/dL). METHODS Plan-Do-Study-Act processes were implemented to shorten length of stay, increase patient receipt of early physical therapy, decrease driveline infection incidence, and improve nutritional status. With 2008 as our baseline, we deployed interventions for each outcome area across 2009 to 2017. Performance improvement activities included staff, patient, and family didactic, one-on-one, and hands-on education; procedural changes; and outcomes monitoring with feedback to staff on progress. Descriptive and inferential statistics were examined to document change in the outcomes. OUTCOMES Across the performance improvement period, length of stay decreased from 40 to 23 days; physical therapy consults increased from 87% to 100% of patients; 1-year driveline infection incidence went from 38% to 23.5%; and the percentage of patients with prealbumin within the normal range increased from 84% to 90%. IMPLICATIONS Performance improvement interventions may enhance ventricular assist device patient outcomes. Interventions' sustainability should be evaluated to ensure that gains are not lost over time.","Lockard, Kathleen L; Dunn, Elizabeth; Kunz, Nicole; Pearsol, Amanda; Schaub, Richard D; Severyn, Donald A; Lohmann, Douglas; McCall, Michael; Morelli, Brian; Teuteberg, Jeffrey J; Kormos, Robert L; Sciortino, Christopher M; Dew, Mary Amanda",Progress in transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526924820958129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985349/,844
80589,The impact of COVID-19 on services for people affected by sexual and gender-based violence.,2020-07-17,"PURPOSE Humanized antibody hPAM4 specifically binds a mucin glycoprotein expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. This phase I study evaluated a single dose of (90)Y-clivatuzumab tetraxetan ((90)Y-labeled hPAM4) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Twenty-one patients (4 stage III; 17 stage IV) received (111)In-hPAM4 for imaging and serum sampling before (90)Y-hPAM4. Study procedures evaluated adverse events, safety laboratories, computed tomography (CT) scans, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics, radiation dosimetry, and immunogenicity (HAHA). RESULTS (111)In-hPAM4 showed normal biodistribution with radiation dose estimates to red marrow and solid organs acceptable for radioimmunotherapy and with tumor targeting in 12 patients. One patient withdrew before (90)Y-hPAM4; otherwise, 20 patients received (90)Y doses of 15 (n = 7), 20 (n = 9), and 25 mCi/m(2) (n = 4). Treatment was well tolerated; the only significant drug-related toxicities were (NCI CTC v.3) grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia increasing with (90)Y dose. There were no bleeding events or serious infections, and most cytopenias recovered to grade 1 within 12 weeks. Three patients at 25 mCi/m(2) encountered dose-limiting toxicity with grade 4 cytopenias more than 7 days, establishing 20 mCi/m(2) as the maximal tolerated (90)Y dose. Two patients developed HAHA of uncertain clinical significance. Most patients progressed rapidly and with CA19-9 levels increasing within 1 month of therapy, but 7 remained progression-free by CT for 1.5 to 5.6 months, including 3 achieving transient partial responses (32%-52% tumor diameter shrinkage). CONCLUSION (90)Y-Clivatuzumab tetraxetan was well tolerated with manageable hematologic toxicity at the maximal tolerated (90)Y dose, and is a potential new therapeutic for advanced pancreatic cancer.","Gulec, Seza A; Cohen, Steven J; Pennington, Kenneth L; Zuckier, Lionel S; Hauke, Ralph J; Horne, Heather; Wegener, William A; Teoh, Nick; Gold, David V; Sharkey, Robert M; Goldenberg, David M",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-10-2579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21527562/,844

While the risk of migrant TB is linked to the TB incidence in their country of origin, the migration process can increase the TB risk. Objective We aimed to synthesis the evidence on key differences in the epidemiological profile of TB between migrants from high TB incidence birth countries and non-migrants resident in low to medium incidence TB countries. Methods We conducted a systematic review where the population was all active TB cases in countries with low to medium TB incidence (<40/100,000 population), the exposure was migration to a low or medium TB incidence country and the comparator was non-migrant TB cases in low or medium incidence countries. Overall proportions were compared between migrants and non-migrants, using Fisher's exact test. Meta-analysis of proportions was carried out for the primary outcome (active TB) while meta-analyses of odds ratios (ORs) were performed using a random effects model for secondary outcomes; sputum-smear positivity, any first line drug resistance, multi-drug resistance (MDR), clustered cases, HIV coinfections and successful treatment. Heterogeneity was evaluated and sources were investigated using subgroup and sensitivity analysis. Results Significant differences were found in the overall proportions of high TB incidence migrants and non-migrants for MDR cases, clustered cases, HIV coinfections and successful treatment, as well as a significant difference in the OR among MDR cases (3.91).

Evaluation of assessment methods, outcome measures, imaging modalities, and crucially, the optimal timing of surgical intervention was critically examined to develop a clinically applicable care pathway. A literature search was carried out using Scopus, PubMed and Web of Knowledge. The literature favors the use of HAR% ratio, Field of Binocular Single Vision (FOBSV) and Exophthalmometer as the core tests that should form part of the standardized assessment for blow-out fractures (BOFs). CT imaging remains gold standard, particularly to identify 'red-flags' warranting early intervention. There was some disagreement in relation to timing of intervention in adult fractures who continue to be symptomatic without initial extraocular muscle (EOM) entrapment and enophthalmos >3 mm, where early intervention within two weeks is not indicated. The limited literature available agreed that successful functional and radiological outcomes can be achieved with conservative or late surgical management following an extended observational period of four weeks, opposed to the conventional two weeks. An evidence-based care pathway has been created, confidently including the initial assessment methods, imaging modality, and the criteria for observation. A four-week observational period has been advocated due to evidence suggesting that there is no significant difference in outcomes from two-week observation, plus with careful functional evaluation, surgery may be avoided in some cases.","Wood, Jessica; Adeoye, Joanne",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1914686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970770/,844

However, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease need further exploration. Therefore, this retrospective analysis was conducted on multiple indicators of peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 to determine the role of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of COVID-19. Baseline information and clinical records of 40 patients were collected, including demographic data, disease status, medication, and laboratory routine. The correlation between the inspection indicators and disease classification, as well as prognostic factors, was analyzed. Decreased eosinophils were detected in 33/40 patients with COVID-19 on admission, while lymphocytes and eosinophils were inversely related to the severity of the disease, according to the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Thus, it could be deduced that eosinophils have better sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and play a major role similar to lymphocytes in assessing the prognosis of patients.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines to evaluate whether levels of these fatty acids during pregnancy influenced offspring weight development. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with DHA and/or EPA supplementation or cohort studies, which examined levels of DHA, EPA, or TFAs in maternal or neonatal blood samples and recorded offspring weight, were included. Overall, 27 RCTs and 14 observational studies were identified. The results showed that DHA and/or EPA supplementation doses >650 mg/day resulted in slightly higher birth weight (MD 87.5 g, 95% CI 52.3-122.6, n = 3,831) and combined BMI and BMI z score at 5-10 years (SMD 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.18, n = 3,220). These results were rated as moderate quality. Results from the observational studies were generally inconsistent. High TFA levels during pregnancy seemed to be associated with lower birth weight.

Educating parents regarding causative factors and treatment is useful. Exposure to tobacco smoke should be avoided; allergen avoidance may be considered when sensitisation has been established. Maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is recommended for multiple-trigger wheeze; benefits are often small. Montelukast is recommended for the treatment of episodic (viral) wheeze and can be started when symptoms of a viral cold develop. Given the large overlap in phenotypes, and the fact that patients can move from one phenotype to another, inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast may be considered on a trial basis in almost any preschool child with recurrent wheeze, but should be discontinued if there is no clear clinical benefit. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials with clear descriptions of patients are needed to improve the present recommendations on the treatment of these common syndromes.","Brand, P L P; Baraldi, E; Bisgaard, H; Boner, A L; Castro-Rodriguez, J A; Custovic, A; de Blic, J; de Jongste, J C; Eber, E; Everard, M L; Frey, U; Gappa, M; Garcia-Marcos, L; Grigg, J; Lenney, W; Le Souëf, P; McKenzie, S; Merkus, P J F M; Midulla, F; Paton, J Y; Piacentini, G; Pohunek, P; Rossi, G A; Seddon, P; Silverman, M; Sly, P D; Stick, S; Valiulis, A; van Aalderen, W M C; Wildhaber, J H; Wennergren, G; Wilson, N; Zivkovic, Z; Bush, A",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00002108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18827155/,844
96899,Prospective cohort study and meta-analysis of cyclic bleeding after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.,2013,"Adherence to immunosuppressant medication is critical to health and quality-of-life outcomes for children who have received a solid organ transplant. Research on the psychological and social predictors of medication adherence is essential to the advancement of pretransplant assessments and transplant psychosocial services. Despite the importance of identifying risk factors, the literature remains limited regarding psychosocial predictors of non-adherence. A systematic search was conducted to identify studies of the psychosocial predictors of post-transplant medication non-adherence in pediatric solid organ transplantation. From 1363 studies identified in searches of empirical literature, a final sample consisted of 54 publications representing 49 unique studies. Findings regarding psychosocial predictors were inconsistent with non-adherence associated largely with adolescence, racial/ethnic minority status, and presence of mental health issues. Familial predictors of non-adherence problems included single-parent households, lower socioeconomic status, lower family cohesion, presence of family conflict, and poor family communication. Several studies reported an association between non-adherence and social pressures (eg, peer social interaction, wanting to feel normal) among adolescent transplant recipients. While significant methodological and substantive gaps remain in this body of knowledge, this review synthesizes current evidence for assessment for transplant clinicians and researchers.","Killian, Michael O; Schuman, Donna L; Mayersohn, Gillian S; Triplett, Kelli N",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.13188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29637674/,844

99861,Reproductive health paradigms in times of COVID-19.,2020-05-17,"BACKGROUND Present mechanical devices are unable to achieve recanalisation in up to 20-40% of large vessel occlusion strokes. We compared efficacy and safety of the Trevo Retriever, a new stent-like device, with its US Food and Drug Administration-cleared predecessor, the Merci Retriever. METHODS In this open-label randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients at 26 sites in the USA and one in Spain. We included adults aged 18-85 years with angiographically confirmed large vessel occlusion strokes and US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 8-29 within 8 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to thrombectomy with Trevo or Merci devices. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤68 years vs 69-85 years) and NIHSS scores (≤18 vs 19-29) with alternating blocks of various sizes. The primary efficacy endpoint, assessed by an unmasked core laboratory, was thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores of 2 or greater reperfusion with the assigned device alone. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of procedure-related adverse events. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01270867. FINDINGS Between Feb 3, 2011, and Dec 1, 2011, we randomly assigned 88 patients to the Trevo Retriever group and 90 patients to Merci Retriever group. 76 (86%) patients in the Trevo group and 54 (60%) in the Merci group met the primary endpoint after the assigned device was used (odds ratio 4·22, 95% CI 1·92-9·69; p(superiority)<0·0001). Incidence of the primary safety endpoint did not differ between groups (13 [15%] patients in the Trevo group vs 21 [23%] in the Merci group; p=0·1826). INTERPRETATION Patients who have had large vessel occlusion strokes but are ineligible for (or refractory to) intravenous tissue plasminogen activator should be treated with the Trevo Retriever in preference to the Merci Retriever.

101315,Abdominal pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 37.8º C). The widespread morbidity caused by the common cold worldwide is related to its ubiquitousness rather than its severity. The development of vaccines for the common cold has been difficult because of antigenic variability of the common cold virus and the indistinguishable multiple other viruses and even bacteria acting as infective agents. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and previously updated in 2013. OBJECTIVES To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (September 2016), MEDLINE (1948 to September 2016), Embase (1974 to September 2016), CINAHL (1981 to September 2016), and LILACS (1982 to September 2016). We also searched three trials registers for ongoing studies and four websites for additional trials (February 2017). We included no language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccines compared with placebo to prevent the common cold in healthy people. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third review author. MAIN RESULTS We found no additional RCTs for inclusion in this update. This review includes one RCT dating from the 1960s with an overall high risk of bias. The RCT included 2307 healthy participants, all of whom were included in analyses. This trial compared the effect of an adenovirus vaccine against placebo. No statistically significant difference in common cold incidence was found: there were 13 (1.14%) events in 1139 participants in the vaccines group and 14 (1.19%) events in 1168 participants in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.02; P = 0.90). No adverse events related to the live vaccine were reported. The quality of the evidence was low due to limitations in methodological quality and a wide 95% confidence interval. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This Cochrane Review was based on one study with low-quality evidence. We found no conclusive results to support the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people compared with placebo. We identified a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Any future trials on medical treatments for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition. Outcome measures should include common cold incidence, vaccine safety, and mortality related to the vaccine.","Simancas-Racines, Daniel; Franco, Juan Va; Guerra, Claudia V; Felix, Maria L; Hidalgo, Ricardo; Martinez-Zapata, Maria José",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd002190.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28516442/,844

METHOD A cross-sectional mixed-method study design was used. Researchers (n=18) and patient-partners (n=9) were surveyed using the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET) in areas of: (1) communication/supports for participation; (2) sharing views/perspectives; (3) impacts/influence of engagement initiative; and (4) final thoughts/satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic-based approach were used to analyse the data. RESULTS For both study groups, high agreement, with responses largely ranging between 'agree' to 'strongly agree', was noted on all four sections of the PPEET. Qualitative reports reflected that patient engagement was important, meaningful, and had a significant impact on the quality of the project and on the professional development of researchers in their understanding and use of patient-oriented methodology. Patient-partners noted challenges related to having realistic deadlines in providing feedback and a lack of a broader range of representation among members.

OBJECTIVES To analyze the effectiveness of treatments recommended in the sepsis guidelines. METHODS In a prospective observational study, we studied all adult patients with severe sepsis from 77 intensive care units. We recorded compliance with four therapeutic goals (central venous pressure 8 mm Hg or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, central venous oxygen saturation 70% or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, blood glucose greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal but less than 150 mg/dl, and inspiratory plateau pressure less than 30 cm H(2)O for mechanically ventilated patients) and four treatments (early broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid challenge in the event of hypotension and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, low-dose steroids for septic shock, drotrecogin alfa [activated] for multiorgan failure). The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The effectiveness of each treatment was estimated using propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 2,796 patients, 41.6% died before hospital discharge. Treatments associated with lower hospital mortality were early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (treatment within 1 hour vs. no treatment within first 6 hours of diagnosis; odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90; P = 0.008) and drotrecogin alfa (activated) (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84; P = 0.004). Fluid challenge and low-dose steroids showed no benefits. CONCLUSIONS In severe sepsis, early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all patients and administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the most severe patients reduce mortality.","Ferrer, Ricard; Artigas, Antonio; Suarez, David; Palencia, Eduardo; Levy, Mitchell M; Arenzana, Angel; Pérez, Xose Luis; Sirvent, Josep-Maria",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200812-1912oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19696442/,844

110101,Safe abortion amid the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Italy.,2020-05-21,"A predator-prey model is used to investigate the interactions between phages and bacteria by considering the lytic and lysogenic life cycles of phages and the prophage induction. We provide answers to the following conflictual research questions: (1) what are conditions under which the presence of phages can purify a bacterial infected environment? (2) Can the presence of phages triggers virulent bacterial outbreaks? We derive the basic offspring number $\mathcal N_0$ that serves as a threshold and the bifurcation parameter to study the dynamics and bifurcation of the system. The model exhibits three equilibria: an unstable environment-free equilibrium, a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) phage-free equilibrium (PFE) whenever $\mathcal N_0<1$, and a locally asymptotically stable environment-persistent equilibrium (EPE) when $\mathcal N_0>1$. The Lyapunov-LaSalle techniques are used to prove the GAS of the PFE and estimate the EPE basin of attraction. Through the center manifold approximation, topological types of the PFE are precised. Existence of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations are established. Precisely, when $\mathcal N_0>1$, the EPE loses its stability and periodic solutions arise. Furthermore, increasing $\mathcal N_0$ can purify an environment where bacteriophages are introduced. Purposely, we prove that for large values of $\mathcal N_0$, the overall bacterial population asymptotically approaches zero, while the phage population sustains. Ecologically, our results show that for small values of $\mathcal N_0$, the existence of periodic solutions could explain the occurrence of repetitive bacteria-borne disease outbreaks, while large value of $\mathcal N_0$ clears bacteria from the environment. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results.","Ndongmo Teytsa, H M; Tsanou, B; Bowong, S; Lubuma, J M-S",Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA,https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqaa010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720676/,844

111850,Cost-effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices for the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage: A systematic review.,2020-09-25,"AIMS Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) is currently the most used measure in clinical practice to monitor cerebral ischaemia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Although end-tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ) is known as a factor that influences rSO2 , the relationship between PET CO2 and rSO2 has not been quantitatively evaluated in patients with severe arteriosclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PET CO2 on rSO2 in patients undergoing CEA under general anaesthesia. METHODS The intervention to change PET CO2 was conducted between skin incision and clamping of the carotid artery. The rSO2 values were observed by changing PET CO2 in the range of 25-45 mmHg. The PET CO2 -rSO2 relationship was characterized by population analysis using a turnover model. RESULTS In total, 1651 rSO2 data points from 30 patients were used to determine the pharmacodynamic characteristics. Hypertension (HTN) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were significant covariates on the slope factor in the stimulatory effect of PET CO2 on rSO2 and fractional turnover rate constant (kout ), respectively. The estimates of the parameters were kout (min-1 ): 3.59 for SBP <90 mmHg and 0.491 for SBP ≥90 mmHg, slope: 0.00321 for patients with HTN and 0.00664 for patients without HTN. CONCLUSION The presence of HTNattenuates the response of rSO2 after a change in PET CO2 . When cerebral blood flow is in a state of decline caused by a decrease in SBP to <90 mmHg, the response of rSO2 to PET CO2 is increased. It is advisable to maintain SBP >90 mmHg in patients with HTNduring CEA.","Ki, Seung-Hee; Rhim, Jin-Ho; Park, Jae-Hong; Han, Young-Jin; Cho, Yong-Pil; Kwon, Tae-Won; Choi, Byung-Moon; Noh, Gyu-Jeong",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.13441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940441/,844

METHODS Of the 152 institutions to which councilors of the Japanese Society of Endourology belong, 42 (28%) have carried out laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port surgery. A total of 32 of these institutions agreed to participate in this survey. Patients who had undergone surgery between January 2008 and March 2014 were included in the present study. RESULTS Overall, 1145 cases of laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port surgery were recorded during the study period. The most frequent procedures were adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy. Laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port surgery represented 12% (872/7311) of all laparoscopic procedures carried out at participating institutions. The number of patients who underwent pyeloplasty, donor nephrectomy and simple nephrectomy tended to increase, whereas those who underwent adrenalectomy, radical nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy peaked in 2012, and then tended to decrease in 2013. The rates of conversion, perioperative and postoperative complications, were 2.7%, 2.2% and 4.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The number of laparoendoscopic single-site and reduced port urological surgeries in Japan has increased for benign indications, such as pyeloplasty, donor nephrectomy and simple nephrectomy. In contrast, procedures such as adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy are trending down after reaching a peak in 2012.

Though it is well characterized in various plants, there is no systematic study of this cascade in tea. RESULT In this study, 5 genes of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MKK) and 16 genes of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) in Camellia sinensis were found through a genome-wide search taking Arabidopsis thaliana as the reference genome. Also, phylogenetic relationships along with structural analysis which includes gene structure, location as well as protein conserved motifs and domains, were systematically examined and further, predictions were validated by the results. The plant species taken for comparative study clearly displayed segmental duplication, which was a significant candidate for MAPK cascade expansion. Also, functional interaction was carried out in C. sinensis based on the orthologous genes in Arabidopsis. The expression profiles linked to various stress treatments revealed wide involvement of MAPK and MAPKK genes from Tea in response to various abiotic factors. In addition, the expression of these genes was analysed in various tissues. CONCLUSION This study provides the targets for further comprehensive identification, functional study, and also contributed for a better understanding of the MAPK cascade regulatory network in C. sinensis.","Chatterjee, Archita; Paul, Abhirup; Unnati, G Meher; Rajput, Ruchika; Biswas, Trisha; Kar, Tamalika; Basak, Srijita; Mishra, Neelam; Pandey, Ashutosh; Srivastava, Anurag Prakash",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07030-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894062/,844
114579,Contemporary Issues in Women's Health.,2021-04-01,"Fluid dairy milk consumption has decreased over the last 4 decades, and this drop has accelerated with the introduction of many competing beverage alternatives, such as plant-based milks and bottled water. Conversely, flavored milk sales remain strong, but many adults avoid flavored milk because of concerns about added sugar and calories and/or excessive sweetness. Here we used two discrete choice experiments to assess interest for a dark chocolate milk drink in adults, and explored whether there might be a consumer segment who prefers a more bitter, lower sugar chocolate milk. Adults were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States for two conjoint analysis studies. In a general population cohort (n = 735), type of sweetener was the most important attribute (24%), followed by milk fat (19%), grams of added sugar (16%), front of pack messaging (15%), package type (12%), carton size (8%), and protein content (6%). Attribute importance was relatively consistent in a second study with a younger, more physically active cohort (n = 1,017). Product choices in the active cohort were related to orthorexia and physically activity scores, indicating revealed preferences in a choice task are reflective of personal lifestyle and eating behavior. In both cohorts, three consistent consumer segments were identified and characterized: the calorie conscious, the average consumer, and the natural eaters. These data can help uncover lifestyle differences between adult consumers that impact their food product choices.","Brodock, Jennifer L; Hayes, John E; Masterson, Travis D; Hopfer, Helene",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771648/,844
114754,Delivery in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2: A fast review.,2020-04-09,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic has forced emergency services to implement new standards of practice around the world. The dynamic and unpredictable nature of many clinical situations has placed emergency service personnel in direct danger of contracting the disease. This work uses a validated survey developed for the study to assess the predictors of stress that paramedics, nurses and doctors experience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group included 955 medical staff, and the level of significance adopted for statistical analysis was p = 0.05. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the qualitative variables divided into groups. The selection of tests was carried out based on the distribution of variables, verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to determine the predictors that caused the feelings of stress, it was necessary to use the linear regression model. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress among emergency medical personnel has increased considerably due to new factors that did not previously exist. The predictors of stress in the professional environment include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of treatment for patients not suffering from COVID-19. Additional socio-demographic factors that increase stress among emergency medical personnel are being female and working in the nursing profession. Appropriate training, the supply of personal protective equipment and opinions on the preparedness of the system to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic did not affect the level of stress among health service personnel. CONCLUSIONS The factors that can be considered to act as predictors of occupational stress include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety and security while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of patients not suffering from COVID-19.","Ilczak, Tomasz; Rak, Małgorzata; Ćwiertnia, Michał; Mikulska, Monika; Waksmańska, Wioletta; Krakowiak, Anna; Bobiński, Rafał; Kawecki, Marek",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33300503/,844
115517,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on multiple gestation pregnancy.,2020-12-01,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory infection in young children and high-risk adults. However, a specific treatment for this viral infection is not currently available. In this study, we discovered that an exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC) can serve as a potential therapeutic target for RSV. In both lower and upper epithelial cells, treatment with EPAC inhibitor (ESI-09), but not protein kinase A inhibitor (H89), significantly inhibits RSV replication and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine induction. In addition, RSV-activated transcriptional factors belonging to the NF-κB and IRF families are also suppressed by ESI-09. Through isoform-specific gene knockdown, we found that EPAC2, but not EPAC1, plays a dominant role in controlling RSV replication and virus-induced host responses. Experiments using both EPAC2 knockout and EPAC2-specific inhibitor support such roles of EPAC2. Therefore, EPAC2 is a promising therapeutic target to regulate RSV replication and associated inflammation.IMPORTANCE RSV is a serious public health problem, as it is associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbations. Currently no effective treatment or vaccine is available, and many molecular mechanisms regarding RSV-induced lung disease are still significantly unknown. This project aims to elucidate an important and novel function of a protein, called EPAC2, in RSV replication and innate inflammatory responses. Our results should provide an important insight into the development of new pharmacologic strategies against RSV infection, thereby reducing RSV-associated morbidity and mortality.","Choi, Eun-Jin; Ren, Yuping; Chen, Yu; Liu, Shengxuan; Wu, Wenzhe; Ren, Junping; Wang, Pingyuan; Garofalo, Roberto P; Zhou, Jia; Bao, Xiaoyong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01200-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30185593/,844

This review aims to synthesise systematically the current evidence regarding nutritional risk screening with respect to the experiences and views of patients, their families and carers. METHODS A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and British Nursing Database (inception - July 2019); with screening terms related to malnutrition, screening tools and experience. Titles, abstracts and full-text papers were independently reviewed by two reviewers and then quality-appraised. Qualitative papers and quantitative surveys were included. A narrative review of surveys and a thematic framework synthesis of interviews were used to identify themes. RESULTS Nine studies, including five qualitative interview papers, were included. Qualitative and quantitative study results were combined using a matrix chart to allow comparison. Surveyed participants reported processes of nutritional screening as acceptable. Three key themes emerged from qualitative data: (i) experience of nutritional screening; (ii) misunderstanding of malnutrition: of causes, role of screening and poor self-perception of risk; and (iii) barriers to and opportunities for change. CONCLUSIONS Although the screening process is acceptable, patients' misunderstanding and poor knowledge regarding causes and consequences of malnutrition result in reduced risk perception and disbelief or disregard of nutritional screening results. Findings should inform policy and clinical practice, as well as highlight the known paucity of data regarding the effectiveness of screening on clinical outcomes.","Bullock, A F; Greenley, S L; Patterson, M J; McKenzie, G A G; Johnson, M J",Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316101/,844

We have recently reported that novel (99m)Tc-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitors bind with high affinity to PSMA-positive tumor cells in vitro and localize in PCa xenografts. This study reports the first, to our knowledge, human data in men with metastatic PCa and in healthy male subjects. METHODS Under an exploratory investigational new drug, using a cross-over design, we compared the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor uptake of (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 in 6 healthy men and 6 men with radiographic evidence of metastatic PCa. Whole-body images were obtained at 10 min and 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. SPECT was performed between 3 and 4 h after injection. RESULTS Both agents cleared the blood rapidly, with MIP-1404 demonstrating significantly lower urinary activity (7%) than MIP-1405 (26%). Both agents showed persistent uptake in the salivary, lacrimal, and parotid glands. Uptake in the liver and kidney was acceptable for imaging at 1-2 h. In men with PCa, both agents rapidly localized in bone and lymph node lesions as early as 1 h. SPECT demonstrated excellent lesion contrast. Good correlation was seen with bone scanning; however, more lesions were demonstrated with (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. The high-contrast images exhibited tumor-to-background ratios from 3:1 to 9:1 at 4 and 20 h. CONCLUSION Compared with the standard-of-care bone scanning, (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 identified most bone metastatic lesions and rapidly detected soft-tissue PCa lesions including subcentimeter lymph nodes. Because (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 has minimal activity in the bladder, further work is planned to correlate imaging findings with histopathology in patients with high-risk metastatic PCa.","Vallabhajosula, Shankar; Nikolopoulou, Anastasia; Babich, John W; Osborne, Joseph R; Tagawa, Scott T; Lipai, Irina; Solnes, Lilja; Maresca, Kevin P; Armor, Thomas; Joyal, John L; Crummet, Robert; Stubbs, James B; Goldsmith, Stanley J","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.114.140426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342385/,844
119864,Clinical features of pregnant women in Iran who died due to COVID-19.,2020-11-03,"Purpose As COVID-19 unprecedented situation significantly increased the time families spend indoors, the awareness of unhealthy living conditions negatively impacting immune system and early neurodevelopment of children is of crucial importance. Methods We retrospectively reviewed unrelated cases of the children with confirmed multiple indoor allergen sensitization due to prolonged exposure to unhealthy indoor environment with infestation and water damage, who, in addition to multiple health problems related to allergy and asthma, also developed neuroimmune complications and growth delay. Results Documented early in life atypical neurologic and behavioral changes were common in all cases. Clinical analysis did not establish other causative reason aside from prenatal and early life exposure to unhealthy living conditions. Alternaria Alternara and Penicillium/Aspergillus molds were found in all homes and sensitization was confirmed in all cases. Significant similarities in the symptoms recorded in all three families led us to a hypothesis that, likely, a significant level of the immune response to external immunogenic pathological stimulus such as mold spore protein, mycotoxin protein, dust mite protein, decay-related volatile particles (VOC) skewed a balance of the neuroimmune interactions, and further affected neuronal network establishment. As all children exhibited significant spectrum of the systemic inflammatory conditions early in life, coupled with inability to follow normal neurodevelopment, we hypothesize that an overwhelming activation of the aggressive immune mechanisms by the epigenetic factors led to glia activation, cytokine storm and break of tolerance. Conclusions We hypothesize that developing immune system exhibited aggressive responses due to environmental danger signals, subsequently TH-1 or TH-2 switch enables multiple clinical syndromes development with atypical presentation due to the described novel mechanism. An increased due to the COVID-19 lock-down may increase an amount of exposure of vulnerable people to indoor biological particles and volatile organic compounds present in unhealthy buildings. It is of crucial importance to identify and remediate indoor exposure factors that can decrease immune protection, especially against infectious pathogens such as novel coronavirus.","Kushnir-Sukhov, Nataliya M",Journal of clinical & experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.33140/jcei.05.04.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33179020/,844
121767,Vaginal calculus in a patient with a mid-urethral sling mesh exposure.,2020-07-13,"Identifying persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become an urgent public health challenge because of increasing HCV-related morbidity and mortality, low rates of awareness among infected persons, and the advent of curative therapies (1). Since 2012, CDC has recommended testing of all persons born during 1945-1965 (baby boomers) for identification of chronic HCV infection (1); urban emergency departments (EDs) are well positioned venues for detecting HCV infection among these persons. The United States has witnessed an unprecedented opioid overdose epidemic since 2013 that derives primarily from commonly injected illicit opioids (e.g., heroin and fentanyl) (2). This injection drug use behavior has led to an increase in HCV infections among persons who inject drugs and heightened concern about increases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV infection within communities disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis (3,4). However, targeted strategies for identifying HCV infection among persons who inject drugs is challenging (5,6). During 2015-2016, EDs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; Highland Hospital, Oakland, California; Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; and Boston University Medical Center, Massachusetts, adopted opt-out (i.e., patients can implicitly accept or explicitly decline testing), universal hepatitis C screening for all adult patients. ED staff members offered HCV antibody (anti-HCV) screening to patients who were unaware of their status.* During similar observation periods at each site, ED staff members tested 14,252 patients and identified an overall 9.2% prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV among the adult patient population. Among the 1945-1965 birth cohort, prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV (13.9%) was significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) (16.0%) than among non-Hispanic whites (whites) (12.2%) (p<0.001). Among persons born after 1965, overall prevalence of positive results for anti-HCV was 6.7% and was significantly higher among whites (15.3%) than among blacks (3.2%) (p<0.001). These findings highlight age-associated differences in racial/ethnic prevalences and the potential for ED venues and opt-out, universal testing strategies to improve HCV infection awareness and surveillance for hard-to-reach populations. This opt-out, universal testing approach is supported by new recommendations for hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of positive results for HCV infection is <0.1% (7).","Galbraith, James W; Anderson, Erik S; Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang; Franco, Ricardo A; Donnelly, John P; Rodgers, Joel B; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M; Thompson, William W; Nelson, Noele P; Rothman, Richard E; White, Douglas A E",MMWR.

Many of the surgical subgroup outcomes for apical prolapse are reported together, leading to a paucity of homogenous data. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study (NCT01598467, clinicaltrials.gov) assessing outcomes for homogeneous subgroups of robot-assisted apical prolapse surgery. SETTING Two European tertiary referral hospitals. POPULATION Consecutive patients undergoing robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) and supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy (RSHS). METHODS Anatomical cure (simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification, sPOPQ, stage 1), subjective cure (symptoms of bulge), and quality of life (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, PFIQ-7). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome: anatomical and subjective cure. SECONDARY OUTCOMES surgical safety and intraoperative variables. RESULTS A total of 305 patients were included (RASC n = 188; RSHS n = 117). Twelve months follow-up was available for 144 (RASC 76.6%) and 109 (RSHS 93.2%) women. Anatomical success of the apical compartment occurred for 91% (RASC) and in 99% (RSHS) of the women. In all compartments, the success percentages were 67 and 65%, respectively. Most recurrences were in the anterior compartment [15.7% RASC (symptomatic 12.1%); 22.9% RSHS (symptomatic 4.8%)]. Symptoms of bulge improved from 97.4 to 17.4% (P < 0.0005). PFIQ-7 scores improved from 76.7 ± 62.3 to 13.5 ± 31.1 (P < 0.0005). The duration of surgery increased significantly for RSHS [183.1 ± 38.2 versus 145.3 ± 29.8 (P < 0.0005)]. Intraoperative complications and conversion rates were low (RASC, 5.3 and 4.3%; RSHS, 0.0 and 0.0%).

Omission of steroids in patients with AI, particularly during physiological stress such as an intercurrent illness or surgery, can also lead to an adrenal crisis. The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) identified 78 incidents including two deaths and six incidents of severe harm to patients in a recent 4-year period. This guidance will go through causes of adrenal insufficiency, groups at risk of an adrenal crisis, emergency management and management for surgical procedures. A new NHS Steroid Emergency Card has been developed to be carried by patients at risk of adrenal crisis. We hope the new emergency card and this guidance will increase awareness of the need to start steroids promptly in patients at risk of an adrenal crisis, particularly those presenting in the emergency department or to acute medicine teams and those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures.","Simpson, Helen; Tomlinson, Jeremy; Wass, John; Dean, John; Arlt, Wiebke",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2019-0324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32675141/,844

The involved protective mechanisms include blood glucose-dependent and -independent mechanisms: SGLT2 inhibitors prevent both hyper- and hypoglycemia, with expectedly little net effect on HbA1C. Metabolic adaptations to induced urinary glucose loss include reduced fat mass and more ketone bodies as additional fuel. SGLT2 inhibitors lower glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration, thereby reducing the physical stress on the filtration barrier, albuminuria, and the oxygen demand for tubular reabsorption. This improves cortical oxygenation, which, together with lesser tubular gluco-toxicity, may preserve tubular function and glomerular filtration rate in the long term. SGLT2 inhibitors may mimic systemic hypoxia and stimulate erythropoiesis, which improves organ oxygen delivery. SGLT2 inhibitors are proximal tubule and osmotic diuretics that reduce volume retention and blood pressure and preserve heart function, potentially in part by overcoming the resistance to diuretics and atrial-natriuretic-peptide and inhibiting Na-H exchangers and sympathetic tone.

126601,Dangerous shortage of blood banks as an indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2: An obstetrics perspective.,2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND AND AIM In patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, it is crucial to maintain oxygen demand-consumption balance. Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is a useful indicator of oxygen demand and consumption balance which is an invasive method. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive, continuous monitoring technique that measures regional tissue oxygenation. NIRS that is placed over the internal jugular vein cutaneous area (NIRSijv) has the potential to show ScvO2 indirectly. In this study, we aimed to determine the correlation between ScvO2 with NIRSijv in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty children participated in the study. Four patients were excluded for the inability of internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization due to technical difficulties. After anesthesia induction, NIRS probes were placed on the IJV site with ultrasound guidance for the measurement of continuous transcutaneous oxygen saturation. The catheter insertion was also done through the IJV from the other side using ultrasound guidance. Cerebral oxygenation monitoring was done using NIRS with a single pediatric probe placed on the right forehead. Values of NIRSijv, cerebral NIRS (NIRSc) and ScvO2, were recorded at certain times until postoperative 24th hour. RESULTS Data were collected at 8 different time points. There was a significant correlation between ScvO2 and NIRSijv in all measurement time points (r = 0.91), (p = 0.001). The mean bias between ScvO2 and NIRSijv was 2.92% and the limits of agreement were 11 to -5.2%. There was a moderate correlation between ScvO2 and NIRSc (r = 0.45), (p = 0.001). The mean bias between ScvO2 and NIRSc was 2.7% and the limits of agreement were +26 to -20%. CONCLUSION In this study, we found a strong correlation between ScvO2 and NIRS measurements taken from the internal jugular vein site. Accordingly, continuous noninvasive monitoring with transcutaneous NIRSijv can be an alternative method as a trend monitor for the central venous oxygen saturation in pediatric cardiac patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery.","Altun, Dilek; Doğan, Abdullah; Arnaz, Ahmet; Yüksek, Adnan; Yalçinbaş, Yusuf Kenan; Türköz, Riza; Sarioğlu, Cafer Tayyar",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-1911-135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490634/,844

Residents of 2 low-income African American food desert neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were surveyed from March 23 to May 22, 2020, drawing on a longitudinal cohort (n = 605) previously followed from 2011 to 2018. We examined longitudinal trends in food insecurity from 2011 to 2020 and compared them with national trends. We also assessed use of food assistance in our sample in 2018 versus 2020.Results. From 2018 to 2020, food insecurity increased from 20.7% to 36.9% (t = 7.63; P < .001) after steady declines since 2011. As a result of COVID-19, the United States has experienced a 60% increase in food insecurity, whereas this sample showed a nearly 80% increase, widening a preexisting disparity.

130298,Contemporary Issues in Women's Health.,2020-07-12,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of assessing lung function and symptoms. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) and its longitudinal relationship with spirometry and symptoms are unresolved. We examined concordance between longitudinal spirometry, FOT and symptom control, and determined FOT limits of agreement in stable asthma. METHODS Over a 3-year period, adults with asthma attending a tertiary clinic completed the asthma control test (ACT), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), FOT and spirometry. Analysis included between-visit concordance for significant change using Cohen's kappa (κ) and stable asthma FOT limits of agreement. RESULTS Data (n = 186) from 855 visits (mean ± SD 4.6 ± 3.0 visits), 114 ± 95 days apart, were analysed. Between-visit concordance was moderate between reactance at 5 Hz (X5) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) (κ = 0.34, p = 0.001), and weak between ACT and FEV1 (κ = 0.18, p = 0.001). Change in FeNO did not correlate with lung function or ACT (κ < 0.05, p > 0.1). Stable asthma between visits (n = 75; 132 visits) had reduced lung function variability, but comparable concordance to the entire cohort. Limits of agreement for FEV1 (0.42 L), resistance at 5 Hz (2.06 cm H2 O s L-1 ) and X5 (2.75 cm H2 O s L-1 ) in stable asthma were at least twofold greater than published values in health. CONCLUSION In adults with asthma, there is moderate concordance between longitudinal change in FOT and spirometry. Both tests relate poorly to changes in asthma control, highlighting the need for multi-modal assessment in asthma rather than symptoms alone. The derivation of longitudinal FOT limits of agreement will assist in its clinical interpretation.","Cottee, Alice M; Seccombe, Leigh M; Thamrin, Cindy; Badal, Tanya; King, Gregory G; Peters, Matthew J; Farah, Claude S",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797141/,844

RESULTS The 27 diagnostic SCs listed the correct diagnosis first in 421 of 1170 SC vignette tests (36%; 95% CI, 31-42%), among the top three results in 606 tests (52%; 95% CI, 47-59%), and among the top ten results in 681 tests (58%; 95% CI, 53-65%). SCs using artificial intelligence algorithms listed the correct diagnosis first in 46% of tests (95% CI, 40-57%), compared with 32% (95% CI, 26-38%) for other SCs. The mean rate of first correct results for individual SCs ranged between 12% and 61%. The 19 triage SCs provided correct advice for 338 of 688 vignette tests (49%; 95% CI, 44-54%). Appropriate triage advice was more frequent for emergency care (63%; 95% CI, 52-71%) and urgent care vignette tests (56%; 95% CI, 52-75%) than for non-urgent care (30%; 95% CI, 11-39%) and self-care tests (40%; 95% CI, 26-49%). CONCLUSION The quality of diagnostic advice varied between SCs, and triage advice was generally risk-averse, often recommending more urgent care than appropriate.","Hill, Michella G; Sim, Moira; Mills, Brennen",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391611/,844
131116,Gynecological surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey.,2020-07-01,"We have previously shown that the combination of MIDGE-Th1 DNA vectors with the cationic lipid SAINT-18 increases the immune response to the encoded antigen in mice. Here, we report on experiments to further optimize and characterize this approach. We evaluated different formulations of MIDGE-Th1 vectors with SAINT-18 by assessing their influence on the transfection efficiency in cell culture and on the immune response in mice. We found that high amounts of SAINT-18 in formulations with a w/w ratio MIDGE Th1/SAINT-18 of 1:4.8 are beneficial for cell transfection in vitro. In contrast, the formulation of HBsAg-encoding MIDGE-Th1 DNA vectors with the lowest amount of SAINT-18 (w/w ratio MIDGE Th1/SAINT-18 of 1:0.5) resulted in the highest serum IgG1 and IgG2a levels after intradermal immunization of mice. Consequently, latter formulation was selected for a comparative biodistribution study in rats. Following intradermal administration of both naked and formulated MIDGE-Th1 DNA, the vectors localized primarily at the site of injection. Vector DNA levels decreased substantially over the two months duration of the study. When administered in combination with SAINT-18, the vectors were found in significantly higher amounts in draining lymph nodes in comparison to administration of naked MIDGE-Th1 DNA. We propose that the high immune responses induced by MIDGE-Th1/SAINT-18 lipoplexes are mediated by enhanced transfection of cells in vivo, resulting in stronger antigen expression and presentation. Importantly, the combination of MIDGE-Th1 vectors with SAINT-18 was well tolerated in mice and rats and is expected to be safe in human clinical applications.","Endmann, Anne; Oswald, Detlef; Riede, Oliver; Talman, Eduard G; Vos, Roelien E; Schroff, Matthias; Kleuss, Christiane; Ruiters, Marcel H J; Juhls, Christiane",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.03.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681271/,844

Methods: In April 2020, a total of 60 patients and 59 caregivers were administered by phone scales assessing patients' QoL (McGill QoL Questionnaire), general health status (EQ-5D-5L), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient's QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265). No significant correlations were found at T2. According to the COVID-QoL questionnaire, caregivers perceived lower family help compared to patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Restricted measures of lockdown period during COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant reduction of QoL in our cohort of ALS patients, while caregiver burden significantly increased. ALS motor impairment may have played a role in the unchanged life conditions of patients. Instead, the restriction of family help for primary caregivers could be responsible of their increased burden, reflecting the importance of a wide social support in the management of this clinical condition.","Giusiano, Silvia; Laura, Peotta; Iazzolino, Barbara; Mastro, Enza; Arcari, Martina; Palumbo, Francesca; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Bombaci, Alessandro; Grassano, Maurizio; Cabras, Sara; Di Pede, Francesca; DeMattei, Filippo; Matteoni, Enrico; Solero, Luca; Daviddi, Margherita; Salamone, Paolina; Fuda, Giuseppe; Manera, Umberto; Canosa, Antonio; Chiò, Adriano; Calvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Vasta, Rosario",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2021.1912772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860702/,844

Limited information exists regarding imaging of nonseptic axial osteitis of a PSB. OBJECTIVES To report the clinical, radiographic, ultrasonographic, computed tomographic and intra-arterial contrast-enhanced computed tomographic abnormalities in horses with axial nonseptic osteitis of a PSB. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective clinical study. METHODS Eighteen horses diagnosed with nonseptic osteitis of the axial border of a PSB between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Case details, clinical examination, radiographic, ultrasonographic, computed tomographic and intra-arterial/intra-articular contrast-enhanced computed tomographic features were recorded, when available. Radiographic, ultrasonographic and computed tomographic evaluations of the fetlock region had been performed on 18, 15 and 9 horses, respectively. The effect of the degree of lysis on the grade and duration of lameness was determined. RESULTS All horses had chronic unilateral lameness, 4 with forelimb and 14 with hindlimb signs. On radiographs, lysis was identified in both PSBs in 14 horses, one PSB in 3 horses and in one horse no lysis was identified. The degree of osteolysis was variable. Ultrasonography identified variably sized irregularities of the bone surface and alteration in echogenicity of the palmar/plantar ligament (PL). All horses undergoing computed tomographic examination (n = 9) had biaxial lysis. The lesions were significantly longer and deeper on computed tomographic images compared with radiographic images. Intra-arterial contrast-enhanced computed tomography may reveal moderate to marked contrast enhancement of the PL. There was no significant effect of the degree of lysis on the grade and duration of lameness. CONCLUSIONS Lesions of nonseptic axial osteitis of a PSB can be identified using a combination of radiography and ultrasonography. Computed tomography provides additional information regarding the extent of the pathology.","Vanderperren, K; Bergman, H J; Spoormakers, T J P; Pille, F; Duchateau, L; Puchalski, S M; Saunders, J H",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23855640/,844
135655,Stillbirths and the COVID-19 pandemic: Looking beyond SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2020-12-23,"PURPOSE To evaluate the impact of a feeding jejunostomy (FJ) on the preoperative management of patients with an oesogastric adenocarcinoma (OGA). METHODS From January 2007 to December 2014, patients with potentially resectable OGA were enrolled in a perioperative chemotherapy protocol. FJ was performed before starting perioperative treatments in patients presenting with dysphagia or with a nutritional risk index (NRI) <97.5. The patients who did not require a FJ served as a control group. RESULTS Among the 114 patients with OGA consecutively admitted in our surgical department, 88 (77.2%) were enrolled for neoadjuvant treatment. A FJ was placed in 50 patients (56.8%) before the neoadjuvant treatment (FJ group), whereas 38 patients (43.2%) started neoadjuvant treatments without FJ (control group). Ninety-six percent of patients (n = 48) in the FJ group successfully completed the neoadjuvant treatment but only 81.6% of patients without FJ (n = 31; p = 0.004). The FJ group was divided between responders: 37 patients with a weight response (74%), and nonresponders: 13 patients without weight response (26%). In the FJ group, the nutritional response during preoperative chemotherapy was a significant predictive factor for the achievement of second stage oesogastric resection (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS FJ with enteral nutritional support during the preoperative management of OGA is a safe and effective support for the completion of the preoperative chemotherapy. The weight response to the enteral support is a predictor factor for a completion of the preoperative chemotherapy and could identify a group of patients who would have a better chance of reaching radical surgery.","Manfredelli, Simone; Delhorme, Jean-Baptiste; Venkatasamy, Aïna; Gaiddon, Christian; Brigand, Cécile; Rohr, Serge; Romain, Benoît",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-017-5945-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28653159/,844

Research used to almost exclusively focus on a single aspect of a single molecule per experiment. Modern technologies have enabled thousands of molecules to be simultaneously analyzed and the way that these molecules influence each other to be discerned. The change has been so dramatic that it has given rise to a whole new descriptive suffix (i.e., omics) to describe these fields of study. While genomics was arguably the initial driver of this new trend, it quickly spread to other biological entities resulting in the creation of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. The development of these ""big four omics"" created a wave of other omic fields, such as epigenomics, glycomics, lipidomics, microbiomics, and even foodomics; all with the purpose of comprehensively studying all the molecular entities or processes within their respective domain. The large number of omic fields that were invented even led to the term ""panomics"" as a way to classify them all under one category. Ultimately, all of these omic fields are setting the foundation for developing systems biology; in which the focus will be on determining the complex interactions that occur within biological systems.

143387,Vaccination against COVID-19 in Africa.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Intra-abdominal abscess is a common complication of Crohn disease in children. Prior studies, primarily in adults, have shown that percutaneous abscess drainage is a safe and effective treatment for this condition; however, the data regarding this procedure and indications in pediatric patients is limited. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine the success rate of percutaneous abscess drainage for abscesses related to Crohn disease in pediatric patients with a focus on treatment endpoints that are relevant in the era of biological medical therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 25 cases of patients ages ≤20 years with Crohn disease who underwent percutaneous abscess drainage. Technical success was defined as catheter placement within the abscess with reduction in abscess size on post-treatment imaging. Clinical success was defined as (1) no surgery within 1 year of drainage or (2) surgical resection following drainage with no residual abscess at surgery or on preoperative imaging. Multiple clinical parameters were analyzed for association with treatment success or failure. RESULTS All cases were classified as technical successes. Nineteen cases were classified as clinical successes (76%), including 7 patients (28%) who required no surgery within 1 year of percutaneous drainage and 12 patients (48%) who had elective bowel resection within 1 year. There was a statistically significant association between resumption of immunosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks of drainage and both clinical success (P < 0.01) and avoidance of surgery after 1 year (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective treatment for Crohn disease-related abscesses in pediatric patients. Early resumption of immunosuppressive therapy is statistically associated with both clinical success and avoidance of bowel resection, suggesting a role for percutaneous drainage in facilitating prompt initiation of medical therapy and preventing surgical bowel resection.","Pugmire, Brian S; Gee, Michael S; Kaplan, Jess L; Hahn, Peter F; Doody, Daniel P; Winter, Harland S; Gervais, Debra A",Pediatric radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-015-3533-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26833482/,844

To understand AD, there have been many trials establishing AD animal models. Although various trials to establish AD animal models have been existed, even the mechanisms of AD in animal models are not enough clarified. OBJECTIVES This study assessed AD characteristics induced in Nishiki-nezumi Cinnamon/Nagoya (Nc/Nga) mice following trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) treatment for different periods and house dust mite (HDM) treatment to compare each model's immunological patterns, especially with cytokine antibody array tool. METHODS In this study, we exposed Nc/Nga mice to TNCB or HDM extract to induce AD. Nc/Nga mice were divided into 4 groups: control, TNCB 2 weeks-treated, TNCB 8 weeks-treated, and HDM-treated groups. After AD induction, all mice were evaluated by serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration and serum cytokine antibody assays, scoring of skin lesions, scoring of scratching frequency, and histological analysis. RESULTS The results showed significant differences between groups in serum IgE concentration, skin lesion scores, and scratching frequency. The analysis results for serum cytokine antibody arrays showed that in the TNCB 8 weeks- and HDM-treated groups, but not in the TNCB 2 weeks-treated group, expressions of genes related to the immune response were enriched. Among the histological results, the skin lesions in the HDM-treated group were most similar to those of AD. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed that immunological pattern of AD mice was markedly different between HDM and TNCB treated groups. In addition, the immunological pattern was quietly different dependent on TNCB treated duration.","Kim, Yoon Hwan; Kim, Tae Hyeong; Kang, Min Soo; Ahn, Jin Ok; Choi, Jung Hoon; Chung, Jin Young",Journal of veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735097/,844
144504,Respectful maternity care in the context of COVID-19: A human rights perspective.,2020-09-18,"Biliary atresia leads to cirrhosis in the vast majority of patients and constitutes the first cause of paediatric liver transplantation. Animal models allow us to understand the molecular basis and natural history of diseases. The aim of this study is to describe a surgically created animal model of biliary atresia with emphasis in long-term liver function. Forty-two 3-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: bile duct ligature (BDL) and control. The animals were sacrificed on the 2nd, 4th, and 6th postoperative weeks. Blood samples were collected for liver function analysis. The spleen to body weight ratio was determined. Histopathological examination of liver tissue was performed by hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius red staining. Collagen quantification was determined by using colorimetric digital image analysis and was expressed as a percentage of total liver tissue area. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyse gene expression levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (Tgfb1) and apeline (Apln) genes. Statistical analysis was performed where P<0.05 was considered significant. Animals from BDL group developed increasing cholestasis with clinical and laboratory features. Splenomegaly was detected at 4th and 6th week (P<0.05). Histological evaluation of the liver showed ductular reaction, portal fibrosis and bile plugs. Collagen area to total liver tissue area had a median of 2.5% in the control group and 6.5 %, 14.3 % and 37.7 % in BDL rats at 2nd, 4th and 6th weeks respectively (P<0.001). Tgfb1 mRNA expression level was significantly higher at 6th week (P<0.001) in BDL group when compared to control. Apln mRNA expression level was significantly higher at 4th and 6th week (P<0.001) and showed a positive linear correlation (r = 0.975, P<0.05) in BDL group when compared to control. Bile duct ligature in young rats is an animal model that recreates clinical, laboratory, histological and molecular findings of biliary atresia. Bile duct ligature constitutes a good animal model to investigate therapeutic approaches for modifying the progression of liver fibrosis in biliary atresia.","Garrido, Matias; Escobar, Camila; Zamora, Constanza; Rejas, Carolina; Varas, Juan; Párraga, Mario; San Martin, Sebastian; Montedónico, Sandra",European journal of histochemistry : EJH,https://doi.org/10.4081/ejh.2017.2803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29046057/,844

The results of hospital-based surveillance aiming at describing the aetiology and epidemiology of respiratory distress among children <5 years of age are presented. METHODS Children admitted to the Hôpital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco, and meeting the World Health Organization clinical criteria for severe pneumonia were recruited over a period of 14 months and were thoroughly investigated to ascertain a definitive diagnosis. RESULTS In total, 700 children were recruited for the study. Most frequent clinical diagnoses included wheezing-related conditions (bronchitis/asthma, 46%; bronchiolitis, 15%), while typical bacterial pneumonia was infrequent (only 19% of the cases). Invasive bacterial disease detected by classical microbiology or molecular methods was also uncommon, affecting only 3.5% of the patients, and with an overall low detection of pneumococcal or Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. Conversely, coverage of respiratory viral detection in the nasopharynx was almost universal among cases (92%), with the three most frequent viruses detected being rhinovirus (53%), respiratory syncytial virus (18%) and adenovirus (17%). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) among recruited patients with a known outcome was 4.1% (28/690). CONCLUSIONS In Morocco, the epidemiological profile of paediatric acute respiratory infections is markedly shifted towards wheezing-related diseases and thus resembles that of high-income countries. However, the high associated CFRs found in this study call for an improvement in preventive and clinical management strategies.","Jroundi, Imane; Mahraoui, Chafiq; Benmessaoud, Rachid; Moraleda, Cinta; Tligui, Houssain; Seffar, Myriam; Kettani, Selma Cherif; Benjelloun, Badr Sououd; Chaacho, Saad; Maaroufi, Abderrahman; Hayes, Edward B; Álvarez-Martínez, Míriam J; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Ruiz, Joaquim; Alonso, Pedro L; Bassat, Quique",Journal of tropical pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmu010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570343/,844

Problematically, cytotoxicity arising from overexpression of the transgene during vector production frequently leads to a reduction in vector yield. Herein, we evaluate the use of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing to limit overexpression of cytotoxic transgenes during packaging as a method of increasing vector yield. We examined if post-transcriptional regulation of transgenes during packaging via miRNA technology would lead to increased rAAV yields. Our results demonstrate that silencing of cytotoxic transgenes during production resulted in up to a 22-fold increase in vector yield. The inclusion of organ-specific miRNA sequences improved biosafety by limiting off-target expression following systemic rAAV administration. The small size (22-23 bp) of the target site allows for the inclusion of multiple copies into the vector with minimal impact on coding capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that inclusion of miRNA target sites into the 3'-untranslated region of the AAV cassette allow for silencing of cytotoxic transgenes during vector production leading to improved vector yield, in addition to increasing targeting specificity without reliance on cell-specific promoters.","Reid, C A; Boye, S L; Hauswirth, W W; Lipinski, D M",Gene therapy,https://doi.org/10.1038/gt.2017.50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28617420/,844

We aimed to investigate any possible effect of antihypertensive medications on inflammatory bowel disease course. METHODS One hundred and fifty inflammatory bowel disease patients with hypertension were compared using a 1:1 ratio with age- and gender-matched control patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The class of antihypertensive medication, traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease characteristics, and history (surgery, hospitalizations, and treatment) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Of 150 (44.7% Crohn's disease) patients with hypertension, 46.7% were on angiotensin receptor blockers, 30.6% on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 40% on β-blockers, and 40.7% on calcium channel blockers. Univariate analysis revealed significantly higher rates of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis among antihypertensive users. When analyzing by class of antihypertensive medication, angiotensin receptor blockers were significantly associated with milder course as indicated by less frequent immunomodulator (P = 0.039) and steroid use (P = 0.041). Rates of lifetime steroids were statistically significantly lower among angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (odds ratio = 1.191, 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.411). After adjustment with confounding factors, only angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with milder inflammatory bowel disease course (P = 0.037) and lower rates of immunomodulator use (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests a possible protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on overall inflammatory bowel disease course by targeting the renin-angiotensin system. Their effect on inflammatory bowel disease needs to be studied in larger cohorts.","Mantaka, Aikaterini; Tsoukali, Emmanouela; Fragkaki, Maria; Karmiris, Konstantinos; Viazis, Nikos; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J; Koutroubakis, Ioannis E",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000001912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925506/,844

METHODS These estimates were combined with routinely available population and mortality projections and observed trends in palliative care need to provide projections up to 2040. RESULTS Palliative care need in 2017 in Chorley & South Ribble and Greater Preston is estimated to be between 75% (1292) and 97% (1670), and 74.9% (1337) and 95.7% (1710) of all deaths, respectively. By 2040, the annual need is projected to increase compared with 2017 figures, by 24.2-55.9% (314-729 more deaths) in Chorley & South Ribble and by 13.4-41.4% (180-554 more deaths) in Greater Preston. The numbers of deaths from dementia are forecast to increase by three-fold in both localities. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates practical application of public health data to support the development of locally responsive palliative care services. Dissemination of findings from this needs assessment on rising palliative care need, including numbers of deaths in different disease groups, provides direction to plan appropriate, equitable and sustainable services. Rapidly growing dementia deaths deserve particular attention in the planning of care. Collaborative work between public health and palliative care in other settings is encouraged, and will likely increase in significance as the full impact of COVID-19 is felt.","Jeba, J; Taylor, C; O'Donnell, V",Public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116382/,844
153074,Potential risk of port-site adhesions in patients after laparoscopic myomectomy using radially expanding trocars.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage, but the current mechanism is unclear. Circular RNA (circRNA) plays a significant role in a series of biological processes related to osteoarthritis, but its mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the circTMBIM6/miR-27a/MMP13 axis in osteoarthritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression levels of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in cartilage of osteoarthritis patients and normal human cartilage were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Osteoarthritis cell model was induced by IL-1β and TNF-α, and the expression changes of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in the in vitro model were detected. In addition, the in vitro regulation of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a in osteoarthritis was verified by transfection of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a plasmids, and the regulation of miR-27a on MMP13 was also verified. The dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) method was used to analyze the secretion and formation of soluble glycosaminoglycan sulfate (sGAG), and the effects of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a chondrocytes were evaluated. RESULTS The expression levels of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis were higher than that of normal group, while the expression level of miR-195 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was lower. After IL-1β and TNF-α treatment, the expression of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in chondrocytes increased, while the expression of miR-27a decreased. CircTMBIM6 overexpression reduced miR-27a expression but increased MMP13 expression. The circTMBIM6 gene knockout showed the opposite effect. CONCLUSIONS CircTMBIM6 promotes osteoarthritis-induced chondrocyte extracellular matrix degradation via miR-27a/MMP13 axis.","Bai, Z-M; Kang, M-M; Zhou, X-F; Wang, D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767318/,844

OBJECTIVE To analyze retrospectively the efficacy and safety of flow diverters in the treatment of dissecting aneurysms of the vertebral artery. METHODS We identified six patients with six unruptured VA dissecting aneurysms either arising from the V4 or V3-V4 junction that were treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) at our institution between July 2012 and February 2015. Among other parameters, technical feasibility of the procedure, procedure-related complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS PED placement was achieved in all cases and immediate angiography follow-up demonstrated intra-aneurysmal contrast stasis with parent artery preservation. A temporary episode of dysarthria was noted in one patient. Major procedure-related complications were not observed. The 6-month follow-up (n=6) demonstrated complete/near-complete aneurysm obliteration in five patients and partial obliteration in one. At the 1-year follow-up (n=5) stable complete aneurysm occlusion was seen in two patients. Two cases showed progression from near complete occlusion and partial occlusion at 6 months to complete occlusion and near complete occlusion. One cases showed unchanged near complete occlusion. No aneurysmal bleeding, in-stent stenosis or thromboembolic complication was seen. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale scores remained unchanged from admission to discharge. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience with the use of PED for the treatment of intradural VA dissecting aneurysms shows promising short-term results, making this technique a feasible and safe treatment option in patients suitable for this approach. However, long-term and larger cohort studies are needed to validate these results.","Kühn, Anna Luisa; Kan, Peter; Massari, Francesco; Lozano, J Diego; Hou, Samuel Y; Howk, Mary; Gounis, Matthew J; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Puri, Ajit S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26546600/,844

The aim of this research was to explore the change in impact of COVID-19 public health measures on the mental wellbeing of people living with dementia (PLWD) and unpaid carers. METHOD Semi-structured, follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with PLWD and unpaid carers between June and July 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing social support services during the pandemic, and the impact of restrictions on their daily lives. RESULTS 20 interviews were conducted and thematically analyzed, which produced 3 primary themes concerning emotional responses and impact to mental health and wellbeing during the course of the pandemic: 1) Impact on mental health during lockdown, 2) Changes to mental health following easing of public health, and 3) The long-term effect of public health measures. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this research shed light on the longer-term psychological impacts of the UK Government's public health measures on PLWD and their carers. The loss of social support services was key in impacting this cohort mentally and emotionally, displaying a need for better psychological support, for both carers and PLWD.","Hanna, Kerry; Giebel, Clarissa; Tetlow, Hilary; Ward, Kym; Shenton, Justine; Cannon, Jacqueline; Komuravelli, Aravind; Gaughan, Anna; Eley, Ruth; Rogers, Carol; Rajagopal, Manoj; Limbert, Stan; Callaghan, Steve; Whittington, Rosie; Butchard, Sarah; Shaw, Lisa; Gabbay, Mark",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988721996816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626977/,844

Italy has been one of the first countries dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19 and severe measures have been adopted to limit viral transmission. The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity that physicians should be aware of. The initial experience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the exponential rise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. A restriction in the number of ICU beds available for both donors and transplant recipients may unfavorably influence the overall donation activity, and eventually lead to a reduced number of transplants. Preliminary Italian data show that a 25% reduction of procured organs has already occurred during the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 outbreak. This underlines the need to closely monitor what will be further happening in ICUs due to the COVID-19 spread in the attempt to preserve transplant activity, especially in Western countries where deceased donors represent the major organ resource.","Angelico, R; Trapani, S; Manzia, T M; Lombardini, L; Tisone, G; Cardillo, M",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243677/,844

PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients underwent LESS nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract TCC. In both cases, we used a homemade single-port device that consisted of a wound retractor and a surgical glove. Using the flexible laparoscopic instruments, nephrectomy was performed using procedures similar to those of conventional laparoscopic nephrectomy. Bladder cuff excision was performed laparoscopically using the same procedure with open technique. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully without conversion to conventional laparoscopic or open surgery and without additional extraumbilical trocars or incisions. LESS nephreoureterectomy with bladder cuff excision was performed in 385 and 285 minutes with estimated blood loss of 100 and 350 mL, respectively. Both patients were discharged on postoperative day 3 without perioperative complications.

The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the benefits of carbon nanoparticles in thyroid surgical procedures and examine their role in lymph node tracing, parathyroid preservation and recurrent laryngeal nerve protection. METHODS A systematic review of the literature in PubMed/Medline database was performed. Articles reporting randomized clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies that compared the use of carbon nanoparticles in one group of patients with a control-blank group were included. RESULTS The search strategy retrieved 22 studies of the literature. Fourteen studies calculated a greater number of lymph nodes detected/dissected in the central neck zone to the patients using CN solution and 1 article noted a higher rate of lymp h nodes resected in the lateral neck zone in the same group of patients. A significant increase in the number of metastatic lymph nodes retrieved in the CN group was found in 7 studies. Twenty -one studies suggested that the use of CNs for protection of the parathyroid glands was beneficial. Transient hypoparathyroidism and transient hypocalcemia were presented with a significant lower incidence in the CN group in 13 and in 8 studies respectively. CONCLUSION Carbon nanoparticles may improve both central and lateral neck dissection and enhance parathyroid gland. identification and preservation.","Spartalis, Eleftherios; Giannakodimos, Alexios; Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Chrysikos, Dimosthenis; Paschou, Stavroula A; Schizas, Dimitrios; Patelis, Nikolaos; Papasilekas, Themistoklis; Themistoklis, Konstantinos; Spartalis, Michael; Troupis, Theodore; Nikiteas, Nikolaos",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666200922154824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962609/,844

158970,Delayed diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome following staging surgery for ovarian cancer.,2013,"BACKGROUND Patterns of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and immunologic correlates vary globally, and contemporary trends are not well described. METHODS The REPRIEVE trial (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) enrolled persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were aged 40-75 years, receiving ART, and had low-to-moderate cardiovascular disease risk. ART use was summarized within Global Burden of Disease (GBD) super-regions, with adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses examining associations with immune parameters and key demographics. RESULTS A total of 7770 participants were enrolled, with a median age of 50 years (interquartile range, 45-55 years); 31% were female, 43% were black or African American, 15% were Asian, 56% had a body mass index >25 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and 49% were current or former smokers. The median CD4 T-cell count was 620/µL (interquartile range, 447-826/ µ L), and the median duration of prior ART use, 9.5 years (5.3-14.8) years. The most common ART regimens were nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) plus nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (43%), NRTI plus integrase strand transfer inhibitor (25%), and NRTI plus protease inhibitor (19%). Entry ART varied by GBD region, with shifts during the trial enrollment period. In adjusted analyses, entry CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio were associated with GBD region, sex, entry regimen, duration of ART, and nadir CD4 cell count; CD4 and CD8 cell counts were also associated with body mass index and smoking status. CONCLUSIONS There were substantial variations in ART use by geographic region and over time, likely reflecting the local availability of specific medications, changes in treatment guidelines and provider/patient preferences. The analyses of CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios may provide valuable insights regarding immune correlates and outcomes in people living with HIV.

159511,Violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic: An integrative review.,2020-09-03,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES Dental educators have played a critical role in addressing the opioid public health crisis. METHODS The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) conducted a semi-structured survey with all 66 accredited U.S. dental schools in 2019. The survey was organized into four modules to facilitate response and descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analyses were performed. RESULTS Seventy percent of the dental schools consented to participate. Each module varied in response rate: curricular (Module 1, 48%), clinical (Module 2, 47%), implemented curricular/clinical changes (Module 3, 56%), and willingness to participate in future studies (Module 4, 47%). The survey revealed that 87% of respondent dental schools have implemented curricular changes or curricular changes were in process in response to the opioid epidemic. Ninety-three percent of responding schools reported making clinical changes or that clinical changes were in process. Schools reported two factors that most frequently influence changes made: the adoption of state-specific regulations/mandates and the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) Standard 2-24e, which requires competency in prescription practices on substance use disorders. An analysis of the open-ended questions found four overarching themes to curricular changes, in order of frequency: didactic curriculum; integration of opioid epidemic subject matter experts in curricula; Screening, Brief, Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) training; and prescription guidelines. Similarly, four overarching themes were identified for clinical changes: protocol and policy development, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP), faculty and provider education, and prescription guidelines. CONCLUSIONS This research shows that dental educators are working to ensure that new dental professionals gain the necessary competencies in substance abuse, specifically related to opioids, to prevent and minimize prescription drug misuse.","Escontrías, Omar A; Istrate, Emilia; Stewart, Denice C L",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089898/,844

We aimed to assess the utility of BIS in the trauma intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in the trauma ICU at Hamad General Hospital in Qatar between 2011 and 2012. Patients were divided in two groups: Group I (without BIS monitoring) and Group II (with BIS monitoring). The depth of sedation was clinically evaluated with Ramsey Sedation Scale, changes in vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) level. Use of sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants were also recorded. Data were compared using Chi-square and Student t-tests. RESULTS A total of 110 mechanically ventilated trauma patients were enrolled with a mean age of 36 ± 14 years. The rate of head injury was greater in Group I when compared with Group II (94% vs. 81%, P = 0.04). In comparison to Group I, patients in Group II had lower GCS and higher mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) (6.3 ± 2.5 vs. 7.4 ± 2.7 and 25.5 ± 8.5 vs. 21.2 ± 4.7, respectively, P = 0.03). The used midazolam dose was less in Group II in comparison to Group I (5.2 ± 2.3 vs. 6.1 ± 2.1, P = 0.03). Also, fentanyl dose was less in Group II (152 ± 58 vs. 187 ± 59, P = 0.004). The rate of agitation, failure of extubation and tracheostomy in Group II were lower than those in Group I, P = 0.001. The length of stay for patients Group I was longer (14.6 ± 7.1 vs. 10.2 ± 5.9 days) in comparison to group II, P = 0.001. CONCLUSION Management of multiple trauma patients in the trauma ICU with BIS monitoring was found to be associated with better outcomes. BIS monitoring is a guide for adjusting the dosage of sedative agents. It can also minimize agitation, failure of extubation, and length of stay in ICU.","Mahmood, Saeed; Parchani, Ashok; El-Menyar, Ayman; Zarour, Ahmad; Al-Thani, Hassan; Latifi, Rifat",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.141890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25317356/,844

The primary aim of this study was to critically appraise available systematic reviews describing interventions for PPD. The secondary aim was to evaluate the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews and their conclusions. METHODS An electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2020 was conducted to identify systematic reviews that examined an intervention for PPD. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was utilized to independently score each included systematic review which was then critically appraised to better define the most effective therapeutic options for PPD. RESULTS Of the 842 studies identified, 83 met the a priori criteria for inclusion. Based on the systematic reviews with the highest methodological quality, we found that use of antidepressants and telemedicine were the most effective treatments for PPD. Symptoms of PPD were also improved by traditional herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Current evidence for physical exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in treating PPD remains equivocal. A significant, but weak relationship between AMSTAR score and journal impact factor was observed (p = 0.03, r = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.43) whilst no relationship was found between the number of total citations (p = 0.27, r = 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.09 to 0.34), or source of funding (p = 0.19).

Drawing on the theory of quantile estimation, we provide the first broadly applicable and statistically valid sample-based stopping rules for one-phase TAR. We further show theoretically and empirically that overshooting a recall target, which has been treated as innocuous or desirable in past evaluations of stopping rules, is a major source of excess cost in one-phase TAR workflows. Counterintuitively, incurring a larger sampling cost to reduce excess recall leads to lower total cost in almost all scenarios.","Lewis, David D.; Yang, Eugene; Frieder, Ophir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12746v1.pdf,844

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the use of a psychometrically sound assessment instrument and resource-driven planning procedure to help workers with disabilities resume or retain their employment. METHODS: Four employed people with neurological disabilities who took part in a larger job retention project funded by the United States Department of Labor completed structured interviews to determine their needs for employment accommodations during COVID-19. A trained interviewer administered theWork Experience Survey (WES) in teleconsultation sessions with each participant to identify: (a) barriers to worksite access, (b) difficulties performing essential job functions, (c) concerns regarding continued job mastery, and (d) extent of job satisfaction. RESULTS: Owing primarily to the sequelae of their disabling conditions and less so to social distancing requirements and telecommuting technology, participants reported a wide range of accessibility barriers and difficulties in performing essential functions of their jobs that they believed had the potential to significantly affect their ongoing productivity. Considering the stress and uncertainty that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic, it is surprising that the majority of participants reported high levels of job mastery and job satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The interviewer concluded the WES interview by recommending a job accommodation plan, which included suggestions from Job Accommodation Network (JAN) consultants.","Rumrill, P.; Rumrill, S.; Sheppard-Jones, K.; Rumrill, A.; Graham-Smith, M.; Curry, B.; Wiley, L.; Fisher, E.; Kabeya, A.; Adams, C.; Espinosa-Bard, C.; Jones, J.",Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.3233/jvr-211151,844

The sodium-dependent transport systems for the absorption of glucose and amino acids remain intact. In contrast, infections with rota- or coronavirus lead primarily to a disturbance of absorption processes in the intestine due to villous atrophy.

189487,[Pharmacovigilance update].,2011,"Binding of B-lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV) to host cells differing in susceptibility to viral infection was determined by a newly established, direct, nonradioactive virus binding assay, which allows quantitative description of the binding characteristics by receptor saturation and Scatchard analysis. LPV binding to the highly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell line BJA-B K88 is specific, saturable, and noncooperative. Binding occurs very fast, with an association rate constant (k1) of 6.7 x 10(7) M-1s-1, and is of high affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.9 x 10(-12) M; and the virus-receptor complex is stable, with a half life of 70 min. The binding affinities of receptors on four other highly, moderately, or weakly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell lines were similar, with up to twofold variation around a mean Kd value of 3 x 10(-12) M, suggesting the presence of the same LPV receptor on all of these cell lines. This view is further supported by the finding that in all cases a terminal sialic acid is necessary for LPV binding. Tunicamycin has been shown to drastically induce LPV susceptibility and LPV binding in weakly and moderately susceptible B-lymphoma cell lines (O.T. Keppler, M. Herrmann, M. Oppenländer, W. Meschede, and M. Pawlita, J. Virol. 68:6933-6939, 1994). The hypothesis that the constitutively expressed and tunicamycin-induced LPV receptors are identical is strengthened by our finding that both receptor types displayed the same high affinity. LPV susceptibility of different B-lymphoma cell lines was correlated with receptor number but not with receptor affinity. The numbers of receptors per cell on highly and moderately susceptible cell lines ranged from 2,000 to 400 and were directly proportional to LPV susceptibility. This indicates that the number of high-affinity receptors per cell is a key regulating factor for the LPV host range.","Herrmann, M; Oppenländer, M; Pawlita, M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7474091/,844

Out of these animals an additional six organs from a group of 30 cats were screened. In these cats membrana nicitians, parotid gland, thymus and apex of caecum had the highest incidence of virus antigen (90%). The lowest incidence of virus antigen was found in the spleen (60%). There was a clear demonstration of a higher incidence of antigen present in more than half of the total number of screened organs per cat (P less than 0.0005). No statistical difference was observed between sexes when comparing the incidence of virus antigen in different organs. Virus antigen was present in less organs in cats with no lesions suggestive of FIP disease compared to cats with such lesions (P less than 0.001). A similar distribution of the incidence of FCV antigen in the investigated organs was observed in these two groups.","Hök, K","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2168724/,844

191376,[Update in surgery].,2021-01-27,"Flow diverters (FDs) are increasingly used for complex intracranial aneurysms. As these self-expanding devices are deployed across an aneurysm neck, they can undergo deformations. The potential clinical consequences of FD deformations remain unclear. We describe an immediate thrombotic complication attributed to a stereotypical stenotic deformation of an FD extremity that can occur when landing zones are of insufficient length. This case is supplemented with in vitro studies showing the relationship between i) the length of the landing zones and ii) discrepancies between the diameter of the device and recipient vessel, and the severity of FD stenosis. In vitro, a shorter landing zone was associated with a progressive stenotic deformation of the terminal ends of all FDs studied. This deformation was more pronounced when the diameter of the device was oversized compared to the size of the recipient tube. In our clinical case, the presence of this deformation led to an immediate thrombotic complication, requiring deployment of a second stent to correct the observed stenosis. In addition, treatment failure ultimately led to a fatal rupture, a failure that can be explained by residual flows through a more porous transition zone, another characteristic FD deformation which occurs when they are oversized as compared to the parent vessel, but free to expand at the level of the aneurysm. Proper selection of device diameter and length of the landing zone is important, and may decrease the incidence of deformation-related complications.","Estrade, Laurent; Makoyeva, Alina; Darsaut, Tim E; Ghostine, Jimmy; Kouznetsov, Evgueni; Salazkin, Igor; Roy, Daniel; Weill, Alain; Raymond, Jean","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355146/,844

192203,[Bad bats?].,2007,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) consistently elevates the frequency of disease and mortality in young pigs. Many different secondary bacterial diseases occur in PRRS virus (PRRSV)-infected pigs. However, to date, establishing a reproducible experimental model of PRRSV infection in weaned pigs, with subsequent clinical disease following secondary bacterial challenge, has been difficult. PRRSV is frequently isolated during outbreaks from weak-born piglets affected by secondary bacterial diseases. This study was performed to investigate the potential role of intrauterine PRRSV infection on piglet susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. PRRSV-free pregnant sows were intranasally infected at 98 days of gestation with PRRSV strain SD 23983. All piglets born to the PRRSV-infected sows were viremic. Piglets were removed from the sows at birth and deprived of colostrum. Piglets from PRRSV-infected and noninfected sows were randomly assigned to Streptococcus suis challenge or control subgroups. At 5 days of age, piglets were challenged intranasally with strain MN 87555 of S. suis type II. Total and differential leukocyte counts were performed on blood samples collected at 3 days of age. The numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were significantly reduced in the PRRSV-infected piglets. Lesions were observed in bone marrow, brain, lung, heart, spleen, lymph node, tonsil, and thymus of PRRSV-infected piglets. Thymus/body weight ratios of in utero PRRSV-infected piglets were significantly reduced compared to those of non-PRRSV-infected piglets, and thymic lesions were characterized by severe cortical depletion of thymocytes. Lesions were not observed in piglets born to PRRSV-free sows. Overall, 20 out of 22 piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group died within 1 week after challenge with S. suis (10 of 11 in each of two trials). This contrasts with 1 of 18 piglets in the PRRSV-infection-only group and 5 of 23 piglets in the S. suis-challenge-only group (1 of 12 in trial 1 and 4 of 11 in trial 2). No piglets died in the uninfected control groups. Most of the piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group developed suppurative meningitis. S. suis type II was recovered from their brains and joints. These results indicate that in utero infection by PRRSV makes piglets more susceptible to infection and disease following challenge by S. suis type II. In utero infection by PRRSV may provide a useful model to study the interaction between PRRSV and bacterial coinfections in piglets.","Feng, W; Laster, S M; Tompkins, M; Brown, T; Xu, J S; Altier, C; Gomez, W; Benfield, D; McCaw, M B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11312360/,844

192914,[Pathophysiology of COVID-19 related happy hypoxemia].,2021-04-28,"Since December 2019, Covid-19 has become a challenge for doctors around the world, including pediatricians. In most infected children, the disease manifests itself in a mild or is char- acterized by a subclinical course. At the same time, in some cases, a severe clinical picture of the so-called late Covid disease may develop, in the form of a multisystem syndrome and other complications. In 2020-2021 at the Academic Pediatric Clinic named after G. Zhvania of Tbilisi State Medical University, we observed 60 children with post-Covid complications and late Covid syn- drome. More than half (32 children - 53.3%) were under 5 years of age, with a predominance of boys (33 children - 55%) who had a Covid-19 infection 1.5-2 months before contacting us with a positive antibody reaction. Most of them (51 children - 85%) were healthy before the disease. Vasculopathy, immune thrombocytopenia, thalassemia minor, primary diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, pneumonia-atelectasis, exacerbation of the underlying disease - arthralgia, arthritis and abnormal manifestations of sleep disturbance, general weakness and dizziness were noted. Separately, it is necessary to highlight the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in chirdren - MIS-C (8 children - 13%) proceeding with clinical signs of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous-lymphatic syndrome) with hectic temperature, polyserositis, hepatosplenomegaly, high rates of inflammation markers, a tendency to hypercoagulability. One patient had a coronary artery aneurysm. In 3 cases, the ANA and ANF titer was increased (up to 1:640) and also with nucleic, cytoplasmic and linear fibrils fluorescence, which indicates immune reactions in Covid infection, which can explain the positive effect of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of these patients. Only 22 (36%) patients were hospitalized, the rest were observed on an outpatient basis. Based on the aforementioned, it can be concluded that even with the asymptomatic course of Covidinfection in children, complications can be observed and the syndrome of the so-called late Covid, which dictates the need for a thorough examination of these patients and observation in dynamics.","Zhvania, M; Kvezereli-Kopadze, M; Kutubidze, T; Kapanadze, N; Gordeladze, M; Iakobashvili, A; Nakhutsrishvili, E",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103443/,844

The full-length spike protein (S) was newly synthesized as an endoglycosidase H (endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein (gp170) that is further modified into an endo H-resistant glycoprotein (gp180) in the Golgi apparatus. No substantial proteolytic cleavage of S was observed, suggesting that S is not processed into head (S1) and stalk (S2) domains as observed for certain other coronaviruses. While the expressed full-length S glycoprotein was exclusively cell associated, a truncation of S by excluding the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains resulted in the expression of an endoplasmic reticulum-localized glycoprotein (gp160) as well as a Golgi-specific form (gp170) which was ultimately secreted into the cell culture medium. Chemical cross-linking, thermal denaturation, and size fractionation analyses suggested that the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV forms a higher order structure of approximately 500 kDa, which is consistent with it being an S homotrimer. The latter was also observed in purified virions. The intracellular form of the C-terminally truncated S protein (but not the secreted form) also forms trimers, but with much less efficiency than full-length S. Deglycosylation of the full-length homotrimer with peptide N-glycosidase-F under native conditions abolished recognition of the protein by virus-neutralizing antisera raised against purified virions, suggesting the importance of the carbohydrate in the correct folding of the S protein. These data should aid in the design of recombinant vaccine antigens to prevent the spread of this emerging pathogen.","Song, Hyun Chul; Seo, Mi-Young; Stadler, Konrad; Yoo, Byoung J; Choo, Qui-Lim; Coates, Stephen R; Uematsu, Yasushi; Harada, Takashi; Greer, Catherine E; Polo, John M; Pileri, Piero; Eickmann, Markus; Rappuoli, Rino; Abrignani, Sergio; Houghton, Michael; Han, Jang H",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367599/,844

A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and the associated lung failure. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein potentiates transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells. The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-beta is Smad3-specific. N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-beta signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis. Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-beta signaling molecules.","Zhao, Xingang; Nicholls, John M; Chen, Ye-Guang",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18055455/,844

To give insights on patient management within Fangcang hospitals, we conducted a retrospective analysis to: 1) describe the characteristics of the patients admitted to Fangcang hospitals and 2) explore risk factors for longer length of stay (LOS). We enrolled 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms, who were hospitalized in the Wuti Fangcang Hospital. 58 patients completed the treatment and discharged before 1 March 2020. After describing patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure history, treatment received and time course of the disease, we conducted linear regression analysis to identify factors influencing LOS. We found that patients having fever before admission were hospitalized 3.5 days (95%CI 1.39 to 5.63, p = 0.002) longer than those without fever and that patients having bilateral pneumonia were hospitalized 3.4 days (95%CI 0.49 to 6.25, p = 0.023) longer than those with normal CT scan results. We also found weak evidence suggesting that patients with diabetes were hospitalized 3.2 days longer than those without diabetes (95%CI -0.2 to 6.56, p = 0.065). However, we observed no significant differences in LOS between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and between patients who received treatment and those without treatment. Longer duration of hospitalization among non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with having fever, bilateral pneumonia on CT scan and diabetes. However, being asymptomatic and using supportive medications at the early stage of infection do not have significant influences on LOS. Our study is a single-centered study with relatively small sample size. The findings provide evidence for predicting hospital bed demand in a novel response scenario and may help decision-makers in preparing for ramping up the health system capacity.","Wu, Shishi; Xue, Lanping; Legido-Quigley, Helena; Khan, Mishal; Wu, Hua; Peng, Xiaoxiang; Li, Xuewen; Li, Ping",PLoS One,,844

Subsequently, a virus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of the disease. Currently, the epidemic has spread all over the world. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. At the moment, the nuclide acid test is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of this infection. Methods: In the present paper, we report our experience with all patients who came to the Emergency Department from March 1 to April 1, 2020, with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patients: they all underwent a first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency department and, if negative, a second one after at least 24 hours. Results: Our study shows how the results obtained at time zero are usually identical to the ones obtained after 24 hours. We thus suggest, in patients with high suspicion of COVID19 and a negative result at the first swab, to repeat the test after at least 48 hours, during which patients with symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia disease should be kept in isolation to avoid the risk of contagion. Conclusions: these measures and in particular the early identifica-tion of cases with consequent isolation will allow the containment of the spread of the virus, representing one of the fundamental measures to guarantee and strengthen the control of the infection to reduce hospital admissions, the overload of national health service and health costs.","Piccioni, A; Franza, L; Rosa, F; Cicchinelli, S; Saviano, A; Valletta, F; de Cunzo, T; Zanza, C; Covino, M; Ojetti, V; Franceschi, F; Candelli, M",Clin Ter,,844

In this work, we proposed identifying quantitative/radiomic biomarkers for COVID-19 to support XR assessment of acute respiratory diseases. This retrospective study used different cohorts of 227 patients diagnosed with pneumonia; 49 of them had COVID-19. Automatically segmented images were characterized by 558 quantitative features, including gray-level histogram and matrices of co-occurrence, run-length, size zone, dependence, and neighboring gray-tone difference. Higher-order features were also calculated after applying square and wavelet transforms. Mann-Whitney U test assessed the diagnostic performance of the features, and the log-rank test assessed the prognostic value to predict Kaplan-Meier curves of overall and deterioration-free survival. Statistical analysis identified 51 independently validated radiomic features associated with COVID-19. Most of them were wavelet-transformed features; the highest performance was the small dependence matrix feature of ""low gray-level emphasis"" (area under the curve of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.85, [Formula: see text]).

We determined the reliability and reproducibility of multiple CA indices and the effect of intensive data-processing in a large population with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke. APPROACH: Consecutive, consenting patients in the population-based OXVASC (Oxford Vascular Study) Phenotyped cohort underwent up to 10-min supine continuous blood pressure monitoring (Finometer) with bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) transcranial ultrasound (DWL-Dopplerbox). Un-processed waveforms (Un-A) were median-filtered, systematically reviewed, artefacts corrected and their quality blindly graded (optimal (A) to worst (E)). CA metrics were derived in time-domain (autoregulatory index (ARI), Pearson's Mx, Sx, Dx) and in very-low (VLF) and low-frequency (LF) domains (WPS-SI: wavelet phase synchronisation, transfer function analysis), stratified by recording quality. Reliability and reproducibility (Cronbach's Alpha) were determined comparing MCA sides and the first vs. second 5-min of monitoring. MAIN RESULTS: In 453 patients, following manual data-cleaning, there was good reliability of indices when comparing MCA sides (Mx: 0.77; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.85; WPS-SI-LF 0.84), or repeated five minute epochs (Mx: 0.57; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.69; WPS-SI-LF 0.90), with persistently good reliability between sides even in lower quality Groups (Group D: Mx: 0.79; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.92; WPS-SI-LF: 0.91). Reliability was greatest for Pearson's Mx and wavelet synchronisation index, with reasonable reliability of transfer function analyses, but ARI was prone to occasional, potentially defective, extreme estimates (Left vs right MCA: 0.68).

We partnered with palliative care services from seven diverse practice settings in India to foster locally initiated improvement projects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation experiences of locally initiated palliative care improvement projects at seven diverse sites and understand the barriers and facilitators of using QI to improve palliative care in India. PARTICIPANTS: We use a quota sampling approach to capture the perspectives of 44 local stakeholders in each of the following three categories (organizational leaders, clinic leaders, and clinical team members) through a semi-structured interview guide informed by the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). We use standard qualitative methods to identify facilitators and barriers to using QI methods in seven diverse palliative care contexts. RESULTS: Across all sites, respondents emphasized the following factors important in the success of quality improvement initiative: leveraging clinic level data, QI methods training, provider buy-in, engaged mentors, committed leadership, team support, interdepartmental coordination, collaborations with other providers, local champions, and having a structure for accountability. Barriers to using QI methods to improve palliative care services included lack of designated staff, high patient volume, resources, patient population geographic constraints, general awareness and acceptance of palliative care, and culture. CONCLUSIONS: Empowering local leaders and medical personnel to champion, design, and iterate using QI methods represents a promising powerful tool to spread palliative care services in developing countries.","Giannitrapani, Karleen F; Satija, Aanchal; Ganesh, Archana; Gamboa, Raziel; Fereydooni, Soraya; Hennings, Taylor; Chandrashekaran, Shivani; Mickelsen, Jake; DeNatale, Michelle; Spruijt, Odette; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Lorenz, Karl A",J. gen. intern. med,,844

278519,Miller Fisher syndrome associated with COVID-19: an up-to-date systematic review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: According to recent studies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increased risk of mental health problems across many subpopulations including pregnant and postnatal women. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study comprising 1309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.01%-29.85%). Women who were worried about themselves or their babies being infected with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.562, 95% CI = 1.670-3.929), and those who had delayed regular medical checkups (OR = 2.434, 95% CI = 1.580-3.750) were at higher risk of depression. Compared with those living in central and western parts of China, women living in northern (OR = 0.513, 95% CI = 0.326-0.807) and southeastern parts of China (OR = 0.626, 95% CI = 0.463-0.846) were less likely to have depression. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased likelihood of mental health problems among pregnant and postnatal women. Over a quarter of the pregnant and postpartum women in China had depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative health impact of depression, preventive measures, regular mental health screening, and medical checkups are needed with the goal to reduce the risk of depression in this vulnerable population during a pandemic.","Bo, Hai-Xin; Yang, Yuan; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Meng; Li, Yilin; Zhang, Dong-Ying; Li, Ying; Li, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H; Wu, Xin-Juan; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Psychosom Med,,844
280722,[Psychiatry],2021,"BACKGROUND: There is ongoing controversy whether antidepressant use alters suicide risk in adults with depression and other treatment indications. METHODS: Systematic review of observational studies, searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES and SCOPUS for case-control and cohort studies. We included studies on depression and various indications unspecified (including off-label use) reporting risk of suicide and/or suicide attempt for adult patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other new-generation antidepressants relative to non-users. Effects were meta-analytically aggregated with random-effects models, reporting relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed via funnel-plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill method. Financial conflict of interest (fCOI) was defined present when lead authors' professorship was industry-sponsored, they received industry-payments, or when the study was industry-sponsored. RESULTS: We included 27 studies, 19 on depression and 8 on various indications unspecified (n=1.45 million subjects). SSRI were not definitely related to suicide risk (suicide and suicide attempt combined) in depression (RR=1.03, 0.70-1.51) and all indications (RR=1.19, 0.88-1.60). Any new-generation antidepressant was associated with higher suicide risk in depression (RR=1.29, 1.06-1.57) and all indications (RR=1.45, 1.23-1.70). Studies with fCOI reported significantly lower risk estimates than studies without fCOI. Funnel-plots were asymmetrical and imputation of missing studies with trim-and-fill method produced considerably higher risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to new-generation antidepressants is associated with higher suicide risk in adult routine-care patients with depression and other treatment indications. Publication bias and fCOI likely contribute to systematic underestimation of risk in the published literature.

Reports of hoarding and panic buying flooded the media. To identify the drivers of the increased sales of these products, we carried out an online survey with n = 495 people living in Germany. We followed a concurrent triangulation design. For the quantitative analysis, we extended the theory of planned behavior to identify possible reasons for stockpiling nonperishable food. The results suggest that ""attitude,"" ""subjective norm,"" and the ""fear of future unavailability"" were main drivers of stockpiling behavior in our sample. Additionally, we analyzed answers to open questions capturing participants' own explanations of why they did or did not stockpile nonperishable food. By contrasting the results, we found that our qualitative results validate some of our quantitative findings but also deliver new insights. For instance, a key stated reason for stockpiling nonperishable food was to reduce shopping frequency.","Lehberger, Mira; Kleih, Anne-Katrin; Sparke, Kai",Appetite,,844

In this work, we estimated the current SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in blood donors from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Saliva and blood samples were collected from 4103 blood donors from June 15 to September 30, 2020. Saliva samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in mini-pools of four samples. Individual samples were tested for positive or inconclusive pools, and positive donors had their plasma tested. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (0.66%) blood donors were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their saliva, but their plasma was negative, except for one, who presented a high viral load in saliva and nasopharyngeal samples and RNAemia in the plasma close to the limit of detection. Fourteen (56%) positive blood donors reported mild symptoms related to COVID-19 after donation, but the viral load levels were not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION: Despite the measures taken by Blood Centers to avoid blood donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers are able to donate. The risk of the virus transmission by transfusion seems to be negligible since plasma RNAemia was seen at a very low level in only one (3.7%) of the positive donors, but other studies must be performed to confirm this finding.

The data showing the role of frailty in patients infected with COVID-19 is needed. METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study conducted at all hospitals in Turkey. All COVID-19 hospitalized patients (&#8805; 65 years) were included. Patients who were alive and not discharged up to July 20, 2020, were excluded. The frailty was assessed by using the ""Hospital Frailty Risk Score"" (HFRS). Patients were classified into three risk groups of frailty based on previously validated cut points as low (<5 points), intermediate (5-15 points), and high (>15 points). Additionally, patients who had the HFRS of &#8805;5 were defined as frail. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rates by frailty group. RESULTS: Between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020, a total of 18,234 COVID-19 patients from all of 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Totally, 12,295 (67.4%) patients were defined as frail (HFRS of >5) of which 2,801 (15.4%) patients were categorized in the highest level of frailty (HFRS of >15). Observed in-hospital mortality rates were 697 (12.0%), 1,751 (18.2%) and 867 (31.0%) in low, intermediate and high hospital frailty risk, respectively (p<0.001). Compared with low HFRS (<5), the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 1.482 (1.334-1.646) for intermediate HFRS (5-15) and 2.084; 95% CI, 1.799-2.413 for high HFRS (>15). CONCLUSIONS: As a claims-based frailty model, the HFRS provides clinicians and health systems, a standardized tool for an effective detection and grading of frailty in patients in COVID-19. A frailty-based tailored management of the older population may provide a more accurate risk categorization for both therapeutic and preventive strategies.","Kundi, Harun; Çetin, Elif Hande Özcan; Canpolat, Ugur; Aras, Sevgi; Celik, Osman; Ata, Naim; Birinci, Suayip; Çay, Serkan; Özeke, Özcan; Tanboga, Ibrahim Halil; Topaloglu, Serkan",J. infect,,844

We aimed to demonstrate the real-life data on health outcomes in COVID-19-infected cancer patients. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the data of 43 COVID-19-infected cancer patients in our COVID-19 clinics between March 25, 2020, and May 9, 2020, retrospectively. Results: We determined that 1051 patients were followed up with COVID-19 infection and 43 (4%) of them were cancer patients. The mean age of the patients was 64.3 ± 12.3 years. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type among the patients (23.2%). Dyspnea (51.2%) was the most common symptom in the first admission. Typical ground-glass consolidation or patchy appearance with peribronchial thickening resembling bronchopneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was present in 29 (67.4%) patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 14 (32.5%) patients based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of nose-throat swab samples without any sign of lung involvement on HRCT. Total mortality of the COVID-19 infection was 46.5% (n = 20).

378693,[2020 Oncology Update],2021,"In this paper, we propose a wrapper for feature subset selection (FSS) based on parallel and distributed hybrid evolutionary algorithms viz., parallel binary differential evolution and threshold accepting (PB-DETA), parallel binary threshold accepting and differential evolution (PB-TADE) under the Apache Spark environment. Here, the FSS is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. PB-TADE comprises invoking two optimization algorithms i.e., TA and BDE in tandem in every iteration, while in PB-DETA, BDE is invoked first before TA takes over in tandem in every iteration. In addition to these hybrids, parallel binary differential evolution (P-BDE), is also developed to investigate the role played by TA and for baseline comparison. For all the three proposed approaches, logistic regression (LR) is used to compute the fitness function namely, the area under ROC curve (AUC) score. The effectiveness of the parallel and distributed wrappers is assessed over five large datasets of varying feature space dimension pertaining to the cyber security and biology domains. It is noteworthy that the PB-TADE turned out to be statistically significant compared to P-BDE and PB-DETA. The speed up is reported with respect to the sequential version of the three wrappers. Average AUC score obtained, most repeated feature subsets, feature subsets with least cardinality having best AUC score are also reported.

AIM: To estimate the costs related to COVID-19 exposure and infection among HCP in Greece. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the national database of SARS-CoV-2 infections and from the database of HCP exposed to COVID-19. A cost-of-illness analysis was performed to estimate total, direct and indirect, costs. RESULTS: We studied 254 HCP with COVID-19 and 3,332 HCP exposed to COVID-19 during the first epidemic wave. Of the 254 HCP with COVID-19, 49 (19.3%) were hospitalized (mean hospitalization: 11.6 days) and four were admitted to intensive care unit (mean duration: 10.8 days). Overall, 1,332 (40%) exposed HCP had a mean duration of absenteeism of 7.5 days while 252 (99.2%) HCP with COVID-19 had a mean duration of absenteeism of 25.8 days. The total costs for the management of the two groups were estimated at 1,735,830 Euros (772,890 Euros for the HCP with COVID-19 and 962,940 Euros for the exposed HCP). Absenteeism accounted for the large share of total costs (80.4% of all expenditures), followed by costs for RT-PCR and hospitalization costs (10.2% and 6.5% of all expenditures, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that COVID-19 is associated with increased rates and duration of absenteeism among HCP. Indirect costs and particularly absenteeism is the major driver of total costs among exposed to and infected with COVID-19 HCP. The estimated total costs are underestimated. Studies are needed to explore the impact of COVID-19 vaccination of HCP on absenteeism and COVID-19-associated costs.","Maltezou, Helena C; Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Pavli, Androula; Tsonou, Paraskeui; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Tseroni, Maria; Papadima, Kalliopi; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Sipsas, Nikolaos V; Souliotis, Kyriakos",J. hosp. infect,,844

We present two global non-overshoot pathways (+2.0◦ C and +1.5◦ C) with regional decarbonization targets for the four primary energy sectors—power, heating, transportation, and industry—in 5-year steps to 2050. We use normative scenarios to illustrate the effects of efficiency measures and renewable energy use, describe the roles of increased electrification of the final energy demand and synthetic fuels, and quantify the resulting electricity load increases for 72 sub-regions. Non-energy scenarios include a phase-out of net emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, reductions in non-carbon greenhouse gases, and land restoration to scale up atmospheric CO2 removal, estimated at −377 Gt CO2 to 2100. An estimate of the COVID-19 effects on the global energy demand is included and a sensitivity analysis describes the impacts if implementation is delayed by 5, 7, or 10 years, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of achieving the 1.5◦ C goal.

439856,Extroverts and quarantine a survey,2020,"Biological neural networks define the brain function and intelligence of humans and other mammals, and form ultra-large, spatial, structured graphs. Their neuronal organization is closely interconnected with the spatial organization of the brain's microvasculature, which supplies oxygen to the neurons and builds a complementary spatial graph. This vasculature (or the vessel structure) plays an important role in neuroscience; for example, the organization of (and changes to) vessel structure can represent early signs of various pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Recently, advances in tissue clearing have enabled whole brain imaging and segmentation of the entirety of the mouse brain's vasculature. Building on these advances in imaging, we are presenting an extendable dataset of whole-brain vessel graphs based on specific imaging protocols. Specifically, we extract vascular graphs using a refined graph extraction scheme leveraging the volume rendering engine Voreen and provide them in an accessible and adaptable form through the OGB and PyTorch Geometric dataloaders. Moreover, we benchmark numerous state-of-the-art graph learning algorithms on the biologically relevant tasks of vessel prediction and vessel classification using the introduced vessel graph dataset. Our work paves a path towards advancing graph learning research into the field of neuroscience. Complementarily, the presented dataset raises challenging graph learning research questions for the machine learning community, in terms of incorporating biological priors into learning algorithms, or in scaling these algorithms to handle sparse,spatial graphs with millions of nodes and edges.

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future.

These physiological adaptations in pregnant woman end up leading to a suppression in immune system favoring obstetric complications to the mother, fetus and placental tissue. An effective pharmacological therapy for these complications is still a challenge, since some drugs during pregnancy can have deleterious and teratogenic effects. An emerging alternative to pharmacological therapy during pregnancy is drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles (NP), recent area called nano-obstetrics. NP have the advantage of drug targeting and reduction of side effects. Then, maternal, placental or fetal uptake can be expected, depending on the characteristics of NP. Inorganic NP, crossing placental barrier effectively, but have several nanotoxicological effects. While organic NP appear to have a better targeting capacity and have few toxicological effects, but the studies are still scarce. Thus, in this review, were examined questions related to use and impact of physicochemical aspects of inorganic and organic NP during pregnancy.","Pereira, Kelle Velasques; Giacomeli, Renata; Gomes de Gomes, Marcelo; Haas, Sandra Elisa",Placenta,,844

The impact of secondary S. aureus bacteremia on mortality in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unknown. Methods: This was a retrospective observational case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed secondary S. aureus bacteremia across 2 New York City hospitals. The primary end point was to describe 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality rates of patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. Secondary end points included predictors of 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. Results: A total of 42 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with secondary S. aureus bacteremia were identified. Of these patients, 23 (54.8%) and 28 (66.7%) died at 14 days and 30 days, respectively, from their first positive blood culture. Multivariate analysis identified hospital-onset bacteremia (&#8805;4 days from date of admission) and age as significant predictors of 14-day hospital mortality and Pitt bacteremia score as a significant predictor of 30-day hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 11.9; 95% CI, 2.03-114.7; P = .01; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .02; and OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-2.18; P = .003, respectively).

However, the prevalence of mental health problems in frontline medical staff after fighting COVID-19 is still unknown. METHODS: Medical workers in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province were invited to participate a cross-sectional and convenience sampling online survey, which assessed the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: A total of 1,091 responses (33% male and 67% female) were valid for statistical analysis. The prevalence was anxiety 53%, insomnia 79%, depression 56%, and PTSD 11%. Healthcare workers in Wuhan were more likely to face risks of anxiety (56% vs. 52%, P = 0.03) and PTSD (15% vs. 9%, P = 0.03) than those in other cities of Hubei. In terms of educational attainment, those with doctoral and masters' (D/M) degrees may experience more anxiety (median of 7.0, [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0-8.5] vs. median 5.0 [IQR 5.0-8.0], P = 0.02) and PTSD (median 26.0 [IQR 19.5-33.0] vs. median 23.0 [IQR 19.0-31.0], P = 0.04) than those with lower educational degrees.

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the hospital with a new fracture during pandemic period (March 16 to May 22, 2020) were evaluated. Control group consisted of patients with new fractures admitted to the hospital in the same date range in 2018 and 2019. The patients were divided into two groups as &#8804;16 years old (group 1) and >16 years old (group 2). The evaluation was based on the age and gender of the patients and localization of the fractures. Hospitalized and surgically treated patients were evaluated as well. RESULTS: A total of 1794, 1747, and 670 fractures were observed in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Mean age of the patients in group 1 was found to have decreased in the pandemic period (p<0.001). The most common fracture sites in the pediatric population were the distal forearm and distal arm, whereas hand, distal forearm, and foot were most common fracture sites in adults, in both pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The proportional increase in femoral and tibial shaft fractures in group 1, and toe, tibial shaft, and metacarpal fractures in group 2 was found to be statistically significantly (p<0.05). In group 1; 6.8%, 7.7%, and 14.6% of the fractures were treated surgically in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (p<0.001). For group 2, these rates were 20.1%, 18.6%, and 18.1%, respectively (p=0.67). There were 48, 29, and 26 open fractures in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively (p=0.066). In pandemic period, duration of the hospital stay was significantly shorter for distal humerus and proximal femur fractures (p values= 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSION: We observed that the frequency of fractures decreased by approximately one-third during the pandemic period compared with that in the non-pandemic period. The mean age of the patients with a fracture in the pediatric group was found to have decreased also.

To combat this systemic marginalization, we propose using the term youth with socially complex needs. These youth, often minority ethnic/racial and/or sexual/gender minorities, experience repeated adversity and discrimination. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize the unique considerations of working with youth with socially complex needs-who have an increased vulnerability for social marginalization. SOURCES USED: Given the adversity experienced and challenges inherent in working with youth with socially complex needs, ethical principles, and relevant care delivery models were explored. CONCLUSIONS: Delivering mental health care and/or conducting research in collaboration with youth with socially complex needs requires thoughtful consideration of ethical principles and models of care. In conclusion, we propose a strengths-based, individualized approach to working with youth with socially complex needs that requires a dynamic, fluid, multisystemic approach to care and research.","Bounds, Dawn T; Winiarski, Dominka A; Otwell, Caitlin H; Tobin, Valerie; Glover, Angela C; Melendez, Adrian; Karnik, Niranjan S",,,844

608523,"Mortality in pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 in Brazil, 2020.",2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Individuals receiving means-tested benefits are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with a psychiatric illness compared to those who are employed, and the rate of those working in the first labor market is low. The intervention (Individual Placement and Support, IPS) aims at maintaining or regaining working ability and at facilitating reintegration into the (first) labor market following a “first place, then train”-approach. The objective of the study is to conduct the first RCT in Germany that addresses a broad group of long-term unemployed individuals with severe mental illnesses that receive means-tested benefits, and to test the effectiveness of the IPS intervention. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, about 120 eligible participants aged between 18 years and local retirement age will be randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) or to an active control group (CG) using a parallel arm design. The IG will receive IPS + high quality treatment as usual (TAU), the active CG will receive TAU + a booklet on integration measures. A block-randomization algorithm with a targeted assignment ratio of 1:1 for participants in IG and active CG will be used, stratified by sex and three age groups. Assessments will take place before the intervention at baseline (t0), and 6 (t1), 12 (t2), and 18 (t3) months later. Primary outcome will be the proportion of participants having worked at least 1 day in competitive employment since baseline, as assessed at t3. Secondary outcomes will be related to employment/ vocation and mental health. In addition, there will be a process evaluation. Treatment effects on outcomes will be tested using appropriate panel-data regression models, and acceptability, uptake and adherence will be evaluated using descriptive statistics and appropriate inference testing. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial are expected to generate a better understanding of the efficiency, feasibility, acceptance, and relevance of the IPS intervention in a German setting. They could be a first step towards the implementation of the method and towards improving the situation of long-term unemployed individuals with severe mental health problems.

637067,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on postpartum depression among mothers of extreme and early preterm infants.,2021-08-06,"Viruses remain a significant public health concern worldwide. Recently, humanity has faced deadly viral infections, including Zika, Ebola and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). The threat is associated with the ability of the viruses to mutate frequently and adapt to different hosts. Thus, there is the need for robust detection and classification of emerging virus strains to ensure that humanity is prepared in terms of vaccine and drug developments. A point or stand‐off biosensor that can detect and classify viruses from indoor and outdoor environments would be suited for viral surveillance. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a facile and versatile tool that has been explored for stand‐off detection in different environments including atmospheric, oceans and forest sensing. Notably, laser‐induced fluorescence‐light detection and ranging (LIF‐LiDAR) has been used to identify MS2 bacteriophage on artificially contaminated surgical equipment or released amidst other primary biological aerosol particles in laboratory‐like close chamber. It has also been shown to distinguish between different picornaviruses. Currently, the potentials of the LIF‐LiDAR technology for real‐time stand‐off surveillance of pathogenic viruses in indoor and outdoor environments have not been assessed. Considering the increasing applications of LIF‐LiDAR for potential microbial pathogens detection and classification, and the need for more robust tools for viral surveillance at safe distance, we critically evaluate the prospects and challenges of LIF‐LiDAR technology for real‐time stand‐off detection and classification of potentially pathogenic viruses in various environments.","Owoicho, Oloche; Olwal, Charles Ochieng’; Quaye, Osbourne",Microb Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242369/,844

Neither a vaccine nor specific therapeutic approaches are available, hindering the fight against this disease and making better understanding of its pathogenesis essential. Despite similarities between SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV, the former has unique characteristics which represent a great challenge to physicians. The mechanism of COVID‐19 infection and pathogenesis is still poorly understood. In the present review, we highlight possible pathways involved in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and potential therapeutic targets, focusing on the role of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.","Braga, Cássia L.; Silva‐Aguiar, Rodrigo P.; Battaglini, Denise; Peruchetti, Diogo B.; Robba, Chiara; Pelosi, Paolo; Rocco, Patricia R.

A serious threat of nosocomial spread exists and as such, there is a critical necessity for well-planned and rehearsed processes during the care of the COVID-19 positive and suspected patient to minimize transmission and risk to healthcare providers and other patients. Because of the aerosolization inherent in airway management, the pediatric otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist should be intimately familiar with strategies to mitigate the high-risk periods of viral contamination that are posed to the environment and healthcare personnel during tracheal intubation and extubation procedures. Since both the pediatric otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist are directly involved in emergency airway interventions, both specialties impact the safety of caring for COVID-19 patients and are a part of overall hospital pandemic preparedness. We describe our institutional approach to COVID-19 perioperative pandemic planning at a large quaternary pediatric hospital including operating room management and remote airway management. We outline our processes for the safe and effective care of these patients with emphasis on simulation and pathways necessary to protect healthcare workers and other personnel from exposure while still providing safe, effective, and rapid care.","Willer, Brittany L.; Thung, Arlyne K.; Corridore, Marco; D’Mello, Ajay J.; Schloss, Brian S.; Malhotra, Prashant S.; Walz, Patrick C.; Elmaraghy, Charles A.; Tobias, Joseph D.; Jatana, Kris R.; Raman, Vidya T.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563080/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620303177?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620303177,844

The second patient was a 30-year-old female who had a 4-week history of cough associated with shortness of breath and weight loss of 2 kg. The 2 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary TB and had positive MERS-CoV. Both patients were discharged to complete their therapy for TB at home. It is likely that both patients had pulmonary TB initially as they had prolonged symptoms and they subsequently developed MERS-CoV infection. It is important to carefully evaluate suspected MERS-CoV patients for the presence of other infectious diseases, such as TB, especially if cohorting is done for suspected MERS-CoV to avoid nosocomial transmission.","Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Altuwaijri, Talal A.; Memish, Ziad A.",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000477908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683463/,844
