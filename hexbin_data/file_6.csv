6,6,6,Debate: Transfusing to normal haemoglobin levels will not improve outcome,19.694227,10.931292,2001-03-08,"Recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. It is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. Although many questions remain, many laboratory and clinical studies, including a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. In addition, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of red blood cells (RBCs), save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.","Alvarez, Gonzalo; Hébert, Paul C; Szick, Sharyn",Crit Care,6,12
990,990,990,Relative cost and outcomes in the intensive care unit of acute lung injury (ALI) due to pandemic influenza compared with other etiologies: a single-center study,19.709126,10.959465,2012-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 influenza has been characterized by respiratory complications, including acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and associated with high mortality. We studied the severity, outcomes, and hospital charges of patients with ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza A infection compared with ALI and ARDS from other etiologies. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted that included patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic MICU with ALI/ARDS and confirmed influenza A infection, and all patients admitted with ALI/ARDS from any other etiology from September 2009 to March 2010. An itemized list of individual hospital charges was obtained for each patient from the hospital billing office and organized by billing code into a database. Continuous data that were normally distributed are presented as the mean ± SD and were analyzed by the Student’s t test. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in proportions between patient subgroups. Data that were not normally distributed were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were studied: 23 in the H1N1 group and 22 in the noninfluenza group. Mean ± SD age was similar (44 ± 13 and 51 ± 17 years, respectively, p = 0.15). H1N1 patients had lower APACHE III scores (66 ± 20 vs. 89 ± 32, p = 0.015) and had higher Pplat and PEEP on days 1, 3, and 14. Hospital and ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were comparable. SOFA scores over the first 2 weeks in the ICU indicate more severe organ failure in the noninfluenza group (p = 0.017). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the noninfluenza group (77 vs. 39%, p = 0.016). The noninfluenza group tended to have higher overall charges, including significantly higher cost of blood products in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza infection is associated with more severe respiratory compromise but has lower overall acuity and better survival rates than ALI/ARDS due to other causes. Higher absolute charges in the noninfluenza group are likely due to underlying comorbid medical conditions.","Wiesen, Jonathan; Komara, John J; Walker, Esteban; Wiedemann, Herbert P; Guzman, Jorge A",Ann Intensive Care,6,12
1498,1498,1498,Kinetics of circulating immunoglobulin M in sepsis: relationship with final outcome,19.82425,11.4529,2013-10-21,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) during the different stages of sepsis. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, blood sampling for IgM measurement was done within the first 24 hours from diagnosis in 332 critically ill patients; in 83 patients this was repeated upon progression to more severe stages. Among these 83 patients, 30 patients with severe sepsis progressed into shock and IgM was monitored daily for seven consecutive days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 55 patients and stimulated for IgM production. RESULTS: Serum IgM was decreased in septic shock compared to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and patients with severe sepsis. Paired comparisons at distinct time points of the sepsis course showed that IgM was decreased only when patients deteriorated from severe sepsis to septic shock. Serial measurements in these patients, beginning from the early start of vasopressors, showed that the distribution of IgM over time was significantly greater for survivors than for non-survivors. Production of IgM by PBMCs was significantly lower at all stages of sepsis compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Specific changes of circulating IgM occur when patients with severe sepsis progress into septic shock. The distribution of IgM is lower among non-survivors.","Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Apostolidou, Efterpi; Lada, Malvina; Perdios, Ioannis; Gatselis, Nikolaos K; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Georgitsi, Marianna; Bristianou, Magdalini; Kanni, Theodora; Sereti, Kalliopi; Kyprianou, Miltiades A; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Armaganidis, Apostolos",Crit Care,6,12

The impact of polymicrobial ICUAP is not extensively known. We therefore investigated the characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP. METHOD: Patients with ICUAP confirmed microbiologically were prospectively compared according to identification of 1 (monomicrobial) or more (polymicrobial) potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. Microbes usually considered as non-pathogenic were not considered for the etiologic diagnosis. We assessed clinical characteristics, microbiology, inflammatory biomarkers and outcome variables. RESULTS: Among 441 consecutive patients with ICUAP, 256 (58 %) had microbiologic confirmation, and 41 (16 %) of them polymicrobial pneumonia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and several Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in polymicrobial pneumonia. Multi-drug and extensive-drug resistance was similarly frequent in both groups. Compared with monomicrobial, patients with polymicrobial pneumonia had less frequently chronic heart disease (6, 15 % vs. 71, 33 %, p = 0.019), and more frequently pleural effusion (18, 50 %, vs. 54, 25 %, p = 0.008), without any other significant difference. Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment was similarly frequent in the monomicrobial (185, 86 %) and the polymicrobial group (39, 95 %), as were the initial response to the empiric treatment, length of stay and mortality. Systemic inflammatory response was similar comparing monomicrobial with polymicrobial ICUAP. CONCLUSION: The aetiology of ICUAP confirmed microbiologically was polymicrobial in 16 % cases. Pleural effusion and absence of chronic heart disease are associated with polymicrobial pneumonia. When empiric treatment is frequently appropriate, polymicrobial aetiology does not influence the outcome of ICUAP.","Ferrer, Miquel; Difrancesco, Leonardo Filippo; Liapikou, Adamantia; Rinaudo, Mariano; Carbonara, Marco; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Gabarrus, Albert; Torres, Antoni",Crit Care,6,12

While HEV does not cause clinical disease in pigs, its zoonotic potential has raised concerns in the food safety sector. PRRS has become endemic in the United Kingdom (UK) since its introduction in 1991, and continues to cause considerable economic losses to the swine industry. A better understanding of the current prevalence and diversity of PRRSV and HEV in the UK, and their potential association, is needed to assess risks and target control measures appropriately. This study used plasma, tonsil, and cecal content samples previously collected from pigs in 14 abattoirs in England and Northern Ireland to study the prevalence of several pathogens including PRRSV and HEV. The diversity of PRRSV strains detected in these samples was analyzed by sequencing open reading frame 5 (ORF5), revealing no substantial difference in PRRSV strains from these clinically unaffected pigs relative to those from clinical cases of disease in the UK. Despite the potential immuno-modulatory effect of PRRSV infection, previously demonstrated to affect Salmonella and HEV shedding profiles, no significant association was found between positive PRRSV status and positive HEV status.","Frossard, Jean-Pierre; Grierson, Sylvia; Cheney, Tanya; Steinbach, Falko; Choudhury, Bhudipa; Williamson, Susanna",Viruses,6,12
3108,3108,3108,Potentially modifiable respiratory variables contributing to outcome in ICU patients without ARDS: a secondary analysis of PRoVENT,20.11277,10.969119,2018-03-21,"BACKGROUND: The majority of critically ill patients do not suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To improve the treatment of these patients, we aimed to identify potentially modifiable factors associated with outcome of these patients. METHODS: The PRoVENT was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of consecutive patients under invasive mechanical ventilatory support. A predefined secondary analysis was to examine factors associated with mortality. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 935 Patients were included. In-hospital mortality was 21%. Compared to patients who died, patients who survived had a lower risk of ARDS according to the ‘Lung Injury Prediction Score’ and received lower maximum airway pressure (P(max)), driving pressure (ΔP), positive end-expiratory pressure, and FiO(2) levels. Tidal volume size was similar between the groups. Higher P(max) was a potentially modifiable ventilatory variable associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariable analyses. ΔP was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality, but reliable values for ΔP were available for 343 patients only. Non-modifiable factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age, presence of immunosuppression, higher non-pulmonary sequential organ failure assessment scores, lower pulse oximetry readings, higher heart rates, and functional dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Higher P(max) was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients under mechanical ventilatory support for reasons other than ARDS.

3595,3595,3595,Elevated plasma glypicans are associated with organ failure in patients with infection,19.946945,11.079826,2019-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Increased vascular permeability is a key feature in the pathophysiology of sepsis and the development of organ failure. Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response. We hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans (GPC) are elevated in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Plasma GPC 1–6 levels were measured by ELISA in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening. Plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection. Patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure. To determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure, patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment. The association of plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation, disease severity, and glycocalyx shedding was investigated. RESULTS: In the pilot study, only GPC 1, 3, and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients. In the larger cohort, GPC 1, 3, and 4 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure. GPC 1, 3, and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers C-reactive protein, lactate, procalcitonin, and heparin binding protein, and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1. They were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx-protective factors apolipoprotein M and sphingosine-1-phosphate. CONCLUSIONS: We show that GPC 1, 3, and 4 are elevated in plasma of patients with sepsis and correlate with markers of disease severity, systemic inflammation, and glycocalyx damage.

4368,4368,4368,Vasopressin and its analogues in shock states: a review,20.029697,10.975028,2020-01-22,"Activation of arginine–vasopressin is one of the hormonal responses to face vasodilation-related hypotension. Released from the post-pituitary gland, vasopressin induces vasoconstriction through the activation of V1a receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells. Due to its non-selective receptor affinity arginine–vasopressin also activates V2 (located on renal tubular cells of collecting ducts) and V1b (located in the anterior pituitary and in the pancreas) receptors, thereby potentially promoting undesired side effects such as anti-diuresis, procoagulant properties due to release of the von Willebrand’s factor and platelet activation. Finally, it also cross-activates oxytocin receptors. During septic shock, vasopressin plasma levels were reported to be lower than expected, and a hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effect is reported in such situation. Terlipressin and selepressin are synthetic vasopressin analogues with a higher affinity for the V1 receptor, and, hence, potentially less side effects. In this narrative review, we present the current knowledge of the rationale, benefits and risks of vasopressin use in the setting of septic shock and vasoplegic shock following cardiac surgery. Clearly, vasopressin administration allows reducing norepinephrine requirements, but so far, no improvement of survival was reported and side effects are frequent, particularly ischaemic events. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for vasopressin and its agonists in the setting of septic shock, and the remaining unresolved questions.","Demiselle, Julien; Fage, Nicolas; Radermacher, Peter; Asfar, Pierre",Ann Intensive Care,6,12
4451,4451,4451,Natural versus artificial light exposure on delirium incidence in ARDS patients,19.990252,10.954273,2020-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Human infection studies (HIS) are valuable in vaccine development. Deliberate infection, however, creates challenging questions, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIS are new and ethical challenges may be heightened. Consultation with stakeholders is needed to support contextually appropriate and acceptable study design. We examined stakeholder perceptions about the acceptability and ethics of HIS in Malawi, to inform decisions about planned pneumococcal challenge research and wider understanding of HIS ethics in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted 6 deliberative focus groups and 15 follow-up interviews with research staff, medical students, and community representatives from rural and urban Blantyre. We also conducted 5 key informant interviews with clinicians, ethics committee members, and district health government officials. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived HIS research to have potential population health benefits, but they also had concerns, particularly related to the safety of volunteers and negative community reactions. Acceptability depended on a range of conditions related to procedures for voluntary and informed consent, inclusion criteria, medical care or support, compensation, regulation, and robust community engagement. These conditions largely mirror those in existing guidelines for HIS and biomedical research in LMICs. Stakeholder perceptions pointed to potential tensions, for example, balancing equity, safety, and relevance in inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest HIS research could be acceptable in Malawi, provided certain conditions are in place. Ongoing assessment of participant experiences and stakeholder perceptions will be required to strengthen HIS research during development and roll-out.","Kapumba, Blessings M.; Jambo, Kondwani; Rylance, Jamie; Gmeiner, Markus; Sambakunsi, Rodrick; Parker, Michael; Gordon, Stephen B.; Gooding, Kate",BMC Med Ethics,6,12

LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. Thus, ITCH constitutes a novel interactor of LASV and MOPV Z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.","Baillet, Nicolas; Krieger, Sophie; Carnec, Xavier; Mateo, Mathieu; Journeaux, Alexandra; Merabet, Othmann; Caro, Valérie; Tangy, Frédéric; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Baize, Sylvain",Viruses,6,12

Outcome: Mechanical ventilation (MV) at postnatal day 7. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine (14.8%) were on MV at postnatal day 7. The median peak FB was 0% (IQR: −2.9, 2) and occurred on postnatal day 2 (IQR: 1,5).

Recent advances have greatly increased the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in flow cytometry. In particular, an increase in available fluorochromes with distinct excitation and emission spectra combined with novel multicolor flow cytometers with several lasers have enhanced the generation of multidimensional expression data for leukocytes and other cell types. However, these advances have mainly benefited the analysis of human or mouse cell samples given the lack of reagents for most animal species. The flow cytometric analysis of important veterinary, agricultural, wildlife, and other animal species is still hampered by several technical limitations, even though animal species other than the mouse can serve as more accurate models of specific human physiology and diseases. RESULTS: Here we present time-tested approaches that our laboratory regularly uses in the multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of ovine leukocytes. The discussed approaches will be applicable to the analysis of cells from most animal species and include direct modification of antibodies by covalent conjugation or Fc-directed labeling (Zenon™ technology), labeled secondary antibodies and other second step reagents, labeled receptor ligands, and antibodies with species cross-reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using refined technical approaches, the number of parameters analyzed by flow cytometry per cell sample can be greatly increased, enabling multidimensional analysis of rare samples and giving critical insight into veterinary and other less commonly analyzed species. By maximizing information from each cell sample, multicolor flow cytometry can reduce the required number of animals used in a study.","Hunka, Julia; Riley, John T.; Debes, Gudrun F.",BMC Vet Res,6,12

4736,4736,4736,Chapter 1. Introduction,20.059631,11.024443,2010-03-07,"The main objectives of the design of GB virus C (GBV-C) peptide microarrays are the miniaturisation of antigen–antibody interaction assays, the simultaneous analysis of several peptide sequences and the reduction in the volume of serum required from patients since this always represents a limiting factor in studies to develop new systems for diagnosing human diseases. We herein report the design of a microarray immunoassay based on synthetic peptides derived from the GBV-C E2 protein to evaluate their diagnostic value in detecting anti-E2 antibodies in HIV-1 patients. To this end, peptide microarrays were initially prepared to identify the most relevant epitopes in the GBV-C E2 protein. Thus, 124 peptides composed of 18 amino acids covering the whole E2-protein sequence, with 15 residue overlaps, were spotted in triplicate onto γ-aminopropyl silane-functionalised adsorbent binding slides. The procedure to select the E2 protein epitopes was carried out using serum samples from HIV-1-infected patients. The samples had previously been tested for the presence or absence of GBV-C anti-E2 antibodies by means of the Abbott test. Thus, 11 specific epitopes in the GBV-C E2 protein were identified. Subsequently, peptide antigen microarrays were constructed using the E2 epitopes identified to detect GBV-C anti-E2 antibodies in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients with no known GBV-C co-infection. The 11 peptides selected identified anti-E2 GBV-C antibodies among HIV-1-infected patients, and a reactivity of 47 % was established. The potential antigenic peptides selected could be considered a useful tool for designing a new diagnostic system based on peptide microarrays to determine anti-GBV-C E2 antibodies in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients.

Design and setting: Observational study in a tertiary referral center, Intensive Care Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects and methods: Seventeen adult patients with ARDS were treated with venovenous or venoarterial ECMO after failure of conventional therapy. The Murray score of pulmonary injury averaged 3.5 (3.0–4.0) and the mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was 46 (31–65). A standard ECMO circuit with nonheparinized surfaces was used. The patients were minimally sedated and received pressure-supported ventilation. High inspiratory pressures were avoided and arterial saturation as low as 70% was accepted on venovenous bypass. Results: In one patient a stable bypass could not be established. Among the remaining 16 patients 13 survived (total survival rate 76%) after 3–52 days (mean 15) on bypass. Major surgical procedures were performed in several patients. The cause of death in the three nonsurvivors was intracranial complications leading to total cerebral infarction. Conclusion: A high survival rate can be obtained in adult patients with severe ARDS using ECMO and pressure-supported ventilation with minimal sedation. Surgical complications are amenable to surgical treatment during ECMO. Bleeding problems can generally be controlled but require immediate and aggressive approach. It is difficult or impossible to decide when a lung disease is irreversible, and prolonged ECMO treatment may be successful even in the absence of any detectable lung function.","Lindén, Viveka; Palmér, Kenneth; Reinhard, Jarl; Westman, Reino; Ehrén, Henrik; Granholm, Tina; Frenckner, Björn",Intensive Care Med,6,12

Information about disease severity can be obtained by investigating intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, especially when historical comparisons can be made with cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in 155 ICUs contributing to the GiViTI national database. To assess the impact on ICU workload, the occupancy rate during the epidemic phase was compared with influenza periods in previous years. A logistic regression model was developed to assess the prognostic importance of A(H1N1) influenza. RESULTS: The characteristics of the 319 A(H1N1) cases were similar to those reported in other studies, confirming the young age of patients (mean 43 years) and the higher prevalence among pregnant women and obese people. At the epidemic’s peak (October–December 2009) the occupancy rate did not significantly differ from the same period of the previous year, and was significantly lower than the 2009 seasonal influenza outbreak (January–March 2009). Compared with CAP of other origin (3,678 patients), A(H1N1) pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of death. However, after adjusting for confounding this was no longer the case (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59–1.31; p = 0.52). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the specific features of critically ill A(H1N1) patients (i.e., young age, pregnancy, obesity). The pandemic did not increase ICU workload compared with other periods. A(H1N1) pneumonia did not have a higher risk of death than CAP of different origin among patients admitted to the ICU.

5765,5765,5765,Evaluation by polymerase chain reaction of cytomegalovirus reactivation in intensive care patients under mechanical ventilation,20.039827,11.1365185,1996,"The use of extrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPe) in patients with auto-PEEP (AP) can reduce the respiratory work during weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, the application of PEEPe produce a certain level of hyperinflation, an undesirable effect which can limit the efficacy of the reduction of respiratory work. The objective of the present study has been to determine if the encrease in end expiratory lung volume (EELV) originated by the PEEPe is related to static lung compliance (SLC). We have studied 14 patients on mechanical ventilation in whom an AP of between 4 and 12 cmH(2)O was detected. On applying PEEPe equal to half the AP, the EELV increased slightly (77±64 ml) and was not related to pulmonary compliance. When PEEPe equal to the AP was applied, the EELV increased by 178±110 ml (range 45–375 ml,p<0.05), and there was a significant correlation with SLC (r=0.659,p<0.05). In conclusion, the application of PEEPe equal to the AP causes a moderate increace in EELV.

Between December 1999 and March 2001, three adults aged from 23 to 67 years were admitted to our respiratory intensive care unit for massive hemoptysis and septic shock associated with community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Isolates were sent to the Centre National de Référence des Toxémies Staphylococciques in Lyon, France, where they were found to secrete Panton-Valentive leukocidin. The clinical course was similar in the three patients, with massive hemoptysis and septic shock necessitating mechanical ventilation. Two patients died rapidly; necropsy showed pulmonary vascular necrosis in one of them. The third patient recovered after appropriate antibiotic therapy. Leukocidin/neutrophil interactions in the pulmonary vasculature may cause severe hemoptysis in patients with community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia secreting Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Adult patients with massive hemoptysis and suspected community-acquired pneumonia should receive antibiotic regimens covering Staphylococcus aureus.","Boussaud, Véronique; Parrot, Antoine; Mayaud, Charles; Wislez, Marie; Antoine, Martine; Picard, Clément; Delisle, Françoise; Etienne, Jérome; Cadranel, Jacques",Intensive Care Med,6,12

Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in pregnant patients infected with dengue or malaria were studied. METHODS: The medical records of pregnant women admitted with either dengue or malaria infections from 2011–2015 to this hospital were reviewed. Clinical outcomes and laboratory tests were examined. RESULTS: Of 85 women, 56%, 21%, and 22% had contracted dengue, malaria, and multiple infections, respectively. Pregnant women who had contracted dengue fever alone were more likely to present to the hospital at an earlier gestational age (24 weeks, p = 0.03). Women with multiple infections, were more likely to deliver earlier (30 weeks, p < 0.01). Women with malaria were more likely to have low birth weight deliveries (mean birth weight 2394 g, p = 0.03). The incidence of in-hospital deaths among the cohort was 7%. CONCLUSION: It is imperative to develop guidelines to screen for and diagnose dengue and malaria in pregnancy.

Design and setting: Prospective observational study in pediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients: Twelve infants who were subjected to an uncomplicated diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure were studied. All subjects were ventilated with a volume control mode, 0.3 FIO(2), 4 cmH(2)O PEEP, and 10 ml/kg tidal volume. Volatile (servoflurane) anesthetics were given. Measurements and results: Tracheal aspirates and blood samples were obtained before and after 2 h of mechanical ventilation. In tracheal aspirates and in supernatants of stimulated whole-blood cultures cytokine concentrations were measured. In the tracheal aspirates the immune balance was characterized by a proinflammatory response pattern, with a significant increase in TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations; concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators remained very low. The functional capacity of peripheral blood leukocytes to produce INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 in vitro was significantly decreased. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the killing activity of natural killer cells. Conclusions: Two hours of servoflurane and mechanical ventilation using a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg is associated with remarkable changes in the immune response in infants without preexisting lung pathology undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the lungs the immune balance favors a proinflammatory response pattern without detectable concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators. The Th1 immune response by peripheral blood leukocytes was decreased. The observed change in Th1/Th2 balance in favor of Th2 cytokine activity may be a systemic adaptation to the proinflammatory milieu in the lung.","Plötz, Frans B.; Vreugdenhil, Harriet A.; Slutsky, Arthur S.; Zijlstra, Jitske; Heijnen, Cobi J.; van Vught, Hans",Intensive Care Med,6,12

Even if there are more recent reports suggesting that CMV may worsen the outcomes for ICU patients, there is no definite answer to this question: is CMV a potential pathogen for ICU patients or is it simply a bystander? METHODS: We will describe the pathophysiology of active CMV infection and the most recent insights concerning the epidemiological aspects of these reactivations. MAJOR FINDINGS: Cytomegalovirus can be pathogenic by a direct organ insult (such as for the lung), by decreasing host defences against other microorganisms and/or by enhancing the body’s inflammatory response (as in acute respiratory distress syndrome). The incidence of active CMV infection is dependent on the diagnostic method used. Using the most sophisticated available biological tools, the incidence can reach 15–20 % of ICU patients (20–40 % in ICU patients with positive CMV serology). In adequately powered cohorts of patients, active CMV infection appears to be associated with worse outcomes for mechanically ventilated ICU patients. DISCUSSION: There is no absolute direct proof of a negative impact of active CMV infection on the health outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients. Prospective randomized trials are lacking. Future trials should examine the potential benefits for health outcomes of using antiviral treatments. Such treatments could be prophylactic, pre-emptive or used only when there is an end-organ disease. CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus infection may affect health outcomes for ICU patients. Additional prospective trials are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.","Papazian, Laurent; Hraiech, Sami; Lehingue, Samuel; Roch, Antoine; Chiche, Laurent; Wiramus, Sandrine; Forel, Jean-Marie",Intensive Care Med,6,12

The affected organ systems include not only the liver but also the circulation, lungs, kidneys, brain and/or coagulation. Pathophysiologically decisive is an uncontrolled inflammation that is induced by specific triggers and on the basis of previously (possibly not diagnosed) compensated as well as already decompensated liver cirrhosis leads to a severe systemic clinical syndrome, ACLF. The course during the first 72 h is decisive for the prognosis. In addition to treatment of the respective organ or system failure, the underlying triggers should be quickly identified and if necessary specifically treated. Often, however, these cannot (no longer) be determined with any certainty, in particular recent alcohol consumption as well as bacterial and viral infections play an important role. A specific treatment for the ACLF is (currently) not established. Some experimental approaches are currently being tested, including administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF).

In order to examine the biological effect of constitutive CCL2 expression in the CNS, the authors engineered a mouse that expressed CCL2 in the CNS under control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP) promoter. The results demonstrated that transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS resulted in diffuse CNS monocyte infiltration and accumulation. Transgenic CCL2 expression did not alter normal development, differentiation, or function of T cells. There was no evidence of overt CNS disease or other pathologic phenotype when mice were left unchallenged with antigen or uninfected. However, when CCL2 transgenic mice were given a peripheral challenge of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory infiltrate with organized perivascular lesions developed. Infection of the transgenic mice with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) resulted in accelerated onset and increased severity of clinical and histological disease. These results suggest that CCL2 expression in the CNS is a major pathogenic factor that drives macrophage accumulation in the development of CNS inflammatory disease.","Bennett, Jami L.; Elhofy, Adam; Dal Canto, Mauro C.; Tani, Mari; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Karpus, William J.",J Neurovirol,6,12

The newborn — four-year old child is particularly difficult to study because of their lack of cooperation and size. The recent progress in computer technology made pulmonary function testing available for this age range and opened up new possibilities for monitoring changes in disease processes affecting the respiratory system. This may improve medical management of infants and children with lung and heart diseases in particular. In 1989, Shannon [49] proposed in this Journal that the minimum physiological information needed for the intelligent use of mechanical ventilation (particularly if lower airway and/or pulmonary parenchymal disease was apparent) required the measurement of at least 4 variables: i) arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide; ii) arterial oxygen saturation; iii) the mechanical time constant of the lung and iv) FRC. In many circumstances, arterial CO(2) is approximated by alveolar (end-tidal) CO(2) and the arterial oxygen saturation is obtained from pulse oximetry accurately if perfusion is adequate. The mechanical time constant and FRC are easily measured by the techniques described above and together provide important information concerning appropriate ventilator settings for a given disease. The described techniques bring new insights and awareness, but also new responsibilities in the management of infants and children with respiratory compromise. Not all of these techniques need to be applied to all infants in the ICU. Not all the assumptions upon which some of the techniques we have described are based will prove true. Any such methods which do not withstand solid scientific testing must be quickly discarded and replaced with better and (hopefully) easier methods.","Hammer, J.; Newth, C. J.

Clinical and laboratory data at admission and events within 48 h of admission were collected. Predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The study included 99 patients with a median age of 41 years. Immunodeficiency was present in 60 patients, including 38 with AIDS. Fifty-nine patients had pulmonary TB alone, 22 also had extrapulmonary TB and 18 had miliary. All 99 patients were admitted for acute respiratory failure, some also with shock (20), neurologic disorders (18) or acute renal failure (10). Mechanical ventilation was needed in 50 patients; 22 patients met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day mortality rate was 26.2%.

It is synthesized by the (β)-cells of pancreatic islets, and circulating insulin levels are regulated by several small molecules, notably glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and certain pharmacological agents. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B, linked by disulphide bonds) that are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin, generating equimolar amounts of the mature insulin and a connecting peptide (C-peptide). Humans, like most vertebrates, contain one proinsulin gene(3,4), although several species, including mice(5) and rats(6,7), have two highly homologous insulin genes. We have studied the regulation of serum insulin levels and of insulin gene expression by generating a series of transgenic mice containing the human insulin gene. We report here that the human insulin gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the islets of these transgenic mice, and that serum human insulin levels are properly regulated by glucose, amino acids and tolbutamide, an oral hypoglycaemic agent.","Selden, Richard F; Skośkiewicz, Marek J.; Howie, Kathleen Burke; Russell, Paul S.; Goodman, Howard M.",Nature,6,12

The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community and household levels. The paper calls for giving priority to improving the environmental conditions affecting food-borne and water-borne infectious diseases under climate change.","Cissé, Guéladio",Acta Trop,6,12

Studies showed that alterations of its membrane-related components, including the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT), can reshape the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays suggest that CT-TMD interaction preferentially affects antigenic structure near the apex of the Env trimer. These results explain why the CT can modulate the Env antigenic properties and may facilitate HIV-1 Env-based vaccine design.","Piai, Alessandro; Fu, Qingshan; Cai, Yongfei; Ghantous, Fadi; Xiao, Tianshu; Shaik, Md Munan; Peng, Hanqin; Rits-Volloch, Sophia; Chen, Wen; Seaman, Michael S.; Chen, Bing; Chou, James J.",Nat Commun,6,12

The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains.","Yi, Chunyan; Xia, Jing; He, Lan; Ling, Zhiyang; Wang, Xuesong; Yan, Yu; Wang, Jiangjun; Zhao, Xinhao; Fan, Weiguo; Sun, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Ronghua; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang; Xu, Yongfen; Ma, Liyan; Zhang, Yaguang; Zhou, Honglin; Huang, Zhong; Niu, Junqi; Long, Gang; Lu, Junxia; Zhong, Jin; Sun, Bing",Cell Mol Immunol,6,7

METHODS: Forty preterm neonates with RDS were compared with another 40 preterm neonates without RDS enrolled as controls. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and trace elements (copper and zinc) were measured in cord blood (day 0) for all neonates and repeated on day 3 for the RDS group. RESULTS: Day 0 serum levels of MDA, AOPPs, and 8-OHdG were significantly higher in neonates with RDS than controls with a further increase on day 3. Days 0 and 3 levels of TAC, copper, and zinc were significantly lower in the RDS group compared with controls. Elevated serum levels of 8-OHdG and AOPPs were associated with severe RDS, invasive mechanical ventilation, and high mortality rate. 8-OHdG and AOPPs were positively correlated with MDA, oxygenation index, duration of ventilation, and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation is accompanied by alterations in the antioxidant defense status, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and severity of RDS.","Elkabany, Zeinab A.; El-Farrash, Rania A.; Shinkar, Dina M.; Ismail, Eman A.; Nada, Ahmed S.; Farag, Ahmed S.; Elsayed, Medhat A.; Salama, Dina H.; Macken, Eman L.; Gaballah, Saleh A.",Pediatr Res,6,12
11202,11202,11202,What is new in non-ventilated ICU-acquired pneumonia?,19.778551,11.180658,2020-01-14,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing body of research demonstrating stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue among those working in obstetrics and gynaecology. The literature is lacking with respect to targeted interventions aimed at improving staff wellbeing. AIMS: To investigate whether an intervention which increases support for staff is feasible to implement and effective at improving staff wellbeing. METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary university teaching maternity hospital. All doctors in training (DITs) (N = 28) and midwives (N = 69) working in the delivery suite were invited to participate. Wellbeing was assessed by measuring burnout, compassion fatigue, and perceived stress using validated questionnaires. These were distributed pre-intervention and 6 months after implementation of the interventions. The support interventions consisted of posters promoting self-care, team bonding sessions, and end of shift meetings. RESULTS: Eighteen (64%) DITs and 22 (31%) midwives returned pre-intervention questionnaires. Thirteen (18%) midwives retuned post-intervention questionnaires, of which five midwives (7%) returned both the pre-intervention questionnaire and the post-intervention questionnaire. Eighty-seven percent of participants were experiencing emotional exhaustion pre-intervention. There was a statistically significant decrease in the Professional Quality of Life burnout score from pre-intervention (M = 25.8) to post-intervention (M = 21.4), p = 0.02. End of shift meetings were discontinued after 5 weeks due to low attendance. End of shift meetings provided an opportunity for support and debriefing; however, the timing of these sessions impaired their long-term feasibility. CONCLUSION: DITs and midwives of this sample are experiencing high levels of burnout and compassion fatigue. End of shift meetings for midwives and team bonding sessions for DITs may positively impact on wellbeing, but in current format, they are not feasible for long-term implementation. The low level of participation highlights a challenge in implementing institution-wide support interventions.","O’Riordan, Sinead; O’Donoghue, Keelin; McNamara, Karen",Ir J Med Sci,6,12

The current study assesses the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic abuse (EA) and economic hardship. Female participants (n = 435) were recruited to participate in a web-based survey which included standardized measures of EA, other forms of IPV, domains of social support, and economic hardship. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate regression with an investigation into interaction effects.Experiencing EA was significantly correlated with economic hardship, even with extent of physical and emotional IPV controlled. Both tangible and appraisal support had significant negative association with extent of material hardship. Significant interactions between forms of social support and economic abuse were observed. For those at high levels of economic abuse, support had less influence on economic hardship. A mix of direct economic aid, advocacy, education and support could provide a blueprint for addressing the economic hardship experiences of community-dwelling survivors of economic abuse. A comprehensive response to EA requires interventions aimed directly at economically controlling and exploitative tactics, including credit building, individual economic advocacy, and education. Interventions that seek to enhance survivors’ access to social support may be necessary but not sufficient to buffer the impacts of violence on survivors’ economic outcomes.","Voth Schrag, Rachel J.; Ravi, Kristen E.; Robinson, Sarah R.",J Fam Violence,6,12

Yes,19.863625,11.27782,2020-01-21,"PURPOSE: To externally validate an intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction model that was created using the Ontario Critical Care Information System (CCIS), which includes the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS). METHODS: We applied the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) recommendations to a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients discharged between 1 July 2015 and 31 December 31 2016 from 90 adult level-3 critical care units in Ontario. We used multivariable logistic regression with measures of discrimination, calibration-in-the-large, calibration slope, and flexible calibration plots to compare prediction model performance of the entire data set and for each ICU subtype. RESULTS: Among 121,201 CCIS records with ICU mortality of 11.3%, the C-statistic for the validation data set was 0.805. The C-statistic ranged from 0.775 to 0.846 among the ICU subtypes. After intercept recalibration to adjust the baseline risk, the mean predicted risk of death matched actual ICU mortality. The calibration slope was close to 1 with all CCIS data and ICU subtypes of cardiovascular and community hospitals with low ventilation rates. Calibration slopes significantly less than 1 were found for ICUs in teaching hospitals and community hospitals with high ventilation rates whereas coronary care units had a calibration slope significantly higher than 1. Calibration plots revealed over-prediction in high risk groups to a varying degree across all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A risk prediction model primarily based on the MODS shows reproducibility and transportability after intercept recalibration. Risk adjusting models that use existing and feasible data collection can support performance measurement at the individual ICU level.

The data regarding outcomes among neonates and children who develop AKI have become far more robust and AKI has been clearly linked with an increased need for mechanical ventilation, longer inpatient stays, and higher mortality. Though AKI was historically thought to be self-limited, we now know that renal recovery is far from universal, particularly when AKI is severe; the absence of recovery from AKI also carries longitudinal prognostic implications. AKI survivors, especially those without full recovery, are at risk for chronic renal sequelae including proteinuria, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. This review comprehensively describes AKI-related outcomes across the entire pediatric age spectrum, using the most rigorous studies to identify the independent effects of AKI events.","Uber, Amanda M.; Sutherland, Scott M.",Pediatr Nephrol,6,12

Opioids are thought to contribute to the mechanism of bowel dysfunction. We tested if methylnaltrexone, a pure peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist, could reverse opioid-induced constipation. METHODS: The MOTION trial is a multi-centre, double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether methylnaltrexone alleviates opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in critical care patients. Eligibility criteria included adult ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated, receiving opioids and were constipated (had not opened bowels for a minimum 48 h) despite prior administration of regular laxatives as per local bowel management protocol. The primary outcome was time to significant rescue-free laxation. Secondary outcomes included gastric residual volume, tolerance of enteral feeds, requirement for rescue laxatives, requirement for prokinetics, average number of bowel movements per day, escalation of opioid dose due to antagonism/reversal of analgesia, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, incidence of diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection and finally 28 day, ICU and hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled and randomized (41 to methylnaltrexone and 43 to placebo). The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were generally well balanced. There was no significant difference in time to rescue-free laxation between the groups (Hazard ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.82–2.46, p = 0.22). There were no significant differences in the majority of secondary outcomes, particularly days 1–3. However, during days 4–28, there were fewer median number of bowel movements per day in the methylnaltrexone group, (p = 0.01) and a greater incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group (p = 0.02). There was a marked difference in mortality between the groups, with ten deaths in the methylnaltrexone group and two in the placebo group during days 4–28 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to support the addition of methylnaltrexone to regular laxatives for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in critically ill patients; however, the confidence interval was wide and a clinically important difference cannot be excluded.

A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.5% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.2% and 39.5% for B strain respectively.

The relationship between infection and VTE in ICH patients is unclear. We hypothesized that infection would be associated with subsequent VTE after ICH. METHODS: We retrospectively studied consecutively admitted spontaneous primary ICH patients from 2009 to 2018 surviving beyond 24 h. The primary predictor variable was infection, diagnosed prior to VTE. The primary outcome was VTE. We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) for VTE risk after infection of any type, after adjusting for ICH score, length of stay and days to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Similar analysis was done to estimate the association of infection subtypes, including respiratory and urinary and blood stream infections (BSI) with VTE. RESULTS: There were 414 patients (mean age 65 years, 47% female) that met were analyzed. Infection was diagnosed in 181 (44%) patients. Incident VTE was diagnosed in 36 (9%) patients, largely comprised of DVT (n = 32; 89%). Infection overall was associated with increased risk of subsequent VTE (adjusted OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6–12.6). Respiratory (adjusted OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.8–11.7) and BSI (adjusted OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3–11.0) were associated with future VTE. Urinary and other infections were not associated with subsequent VTE.

After decades of research, the first dengue vaccine was licensed in 2015: CYD-TDV, a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine with a yellow fever vaccine backbone. Recent analyses have shown that vaccine performance is dependent on serostatus. In those who have had a previous dengue infection, i.e., who are seropositive, the efficacy is high and the vaccine is safe. However, in seronegative vaccinees, approximately 3 years after vaccination the vaccine increases the risk of developing severe dengue when the individual experiences a natural dengue infection. The World Health Organization recommends that this vaccine be administered only to seropositive individuals. Current efforts are underway to develop rapid diagnostic tests to facilitate prevaccination screening. Two second-generation dengue vaccine candidates, both also live attenuated recombinant vaccines in late-stage development, may not present the same limitations because of differences in the backbone used, but results of phase 3 trials need to be available before firm conclusions can be drawn. Dengue is increasingly frequent in travelers, but the only licensed dengue vaccine to date can be used only in seropositive individuals. However, the vast majority of travelers are seronegative. Furthermore, the primary series of three doses given 6 months apart renders this vaccine difficult in the travel medicine context.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,6,12

Depending on the vaccine, presidential co-partisans are 4–10 percentage points more likely to vaccinate than presidential out-partisans. Using causal mediation analysis, I find that this effect is the result of partisans’ differing levels of trust in government.

Lung macrophages are activated during malaria infection due to a complex host-immune response. The molecular basis for macrophage polarization is still unclear but understanding the predominant subtypes could lead to new therapeutic strategies where the diseases present with lung involvement. The present study was designed to study the polarization of lung macrophages, as M1 or M2 macrophages, in the lungs of severe P. falciparum malaria patients, with and without evidence of PE. METHODS: Lung tissue samples, taken from patients who died from severe P. falciparum malaria, were categorized into severe malaria with PE and without PE (non-PE). Expression of surface markers (CD68+, all macrophages; CD40+, M1 macrophage; and CD163+, M2 macrophage) on activated lung macrophages was used to quantify M1/M2 macrophage subtypes. RESULTS: Lung injury was demonstrated in malaria patients with PE. The expression of CD40 (M1 macrophage) was prominent in the group of severe P. falciparum malaria patients with PE (63.44 ± 1.98%), compared to non-PE group (53.22 ± 3.85%, p < 0.05), whereas there was no difference observed for CD163 (M2 macrophage) between PE and non-PE groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates M1 polarization in lung tissues from severe P. falciparum malaria infections with PE. Understanding the nature of macrophage characterization in malaria infection may provide new insights into therapeutic approaches that could be deployed to reduce lung damage in severe P. falciparum malaria.","Klinkhamhom, Aekkarin; Glaharn, Supattra; Srisook, Charit; Ampawong, Sumate; Krudsood, Srivicha; Ward, Stephen A.; Viriyavejakul, Parnpen",Malar J,6,12

Nurses and physicians argue that humor is necessary for them to do their jobs well. Many (potential) patients are horrified that they could one day be the butt of their physician’s jokes. The purpose of this paper is to encourage the respectful use of humor in clinical prac-tice, so as to support its importance in medical practice, while simultaneously protecting against its potential abuse. I begin by examining two extremes of supporting or chastising the use of medical humor. I look at these views through the lenses of popular theories of humor to help explain their theoretical bases. In this second section, I explain the emotional aspect of humor as an embodied and embedded transformation of the world. This clarifies the role that humor plays in our daily lives, as well as why the ethical or unethical nature of its use is dependent on context. Third, I address the potential problems in the relationship between humor and clinical sympathy, and how this further affects the relationship between medical professionals and their patients. I conclude by arguing that humor can conflict with clinical sympathy, but this need not be the case. If medical professionals actively engage with clinical sympathy and focus on using humor in a way that is respectful towards their patients, then humor can continue to be a positive force in their lives while still providing the best care for their patients.","Hardy, Carter",Med Health Care Philos,6,21

However, antibiotic dosing remains a challenge for clinicians as antibiotic dosing regimens are usually determined in non-critically ill hospitalized adult patients. The aim was to conduct a systematic review to identify and highlight studies comparing clinical outcomes of piperacillin tazobactam dosing regimens, continuous/prolonged infusion vs intermittent infusion in critically ill patients. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the overall effect of dosing regimen on clinical efficacy. METHODS: Studies were identified systematically through searches of PubMed and Science Direct, in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Following the systematic literature review, meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the analysis involving 3828 critically ill adult participants in total (continuous/prolonged infusion = 2197 and intermittent infusion = 1631) from geographically diverse regions. Continuous/prolonged resulted in significantly: higher clinical cure rates (Odds Ratio 1.56, 95% Confidence Interval 1.28–1.90, P = 0 .0001), lower mortality rates (Odds Ratio 0.68, 95% Confidence Interval 0.55–0.84, P = 0 .0003), higher microbiological success rates (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% Confidence Interval 1.10–2.11, P = 0.01) and decreasing the length of hospital stay (Mean Difference − 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval − 2.45—0.08, P = 0.04) in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: Results from this study show that there is a significant level of evidence that clinical outcome in critically ill patients is improved in patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam via continuous/prolonged infusion.

Baroreflex dysfunction causes low heart rate variability, enhanced blood pressure variability, and decreased maximum baroreflex gain (G(max)) putatively measured by spontaneous fluctuation of blood pressure and heart rate. We investigated whether/how cardiovagal baroreflex in POTS differ from control, supine, and upright by comparing indices of spontaneous baroreflex function to that measured using the reference standard modified Oxford method. This uses sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine to generate the sigmoidal cardiovagal baroreflex curve. Baroreflex in POTS was evaluated supine and upright untreated and then treated to determine whether pyridostigmine or digoxin (a vagotonic agent) corrects baroreflex deficits. Supine, G(max) was reduced by 25% in POTS compared with controls, and descriptors of this sigmoidal relationship showed a reduction, downward shift, and left shift of the response to the pharmacological decrease and increase in blood pressure. Digoxin normalized supine cardiovagal baroreflex while pyridostigmine resulted in partial normalization as G(max), and other descriptors of these relationships were similar to control. Upright, cardiovagal curves were distorted and displaced in untreated POTS, while digoxin and pyridostigmine left shifted the cardiovagal curves due to sympathetic activity. Cardiovagal baroreflex deficits in POTS relate to parasympathetic withdrawal while supine, remediated completely by digoxin, and sympathetic activation upright through alteration of baroreflex responsivity. Since these baroreflex effects resemble those measured following microgravity/chronic bedrest, vagotonic/sympatholytic treatment combined with aerobic exercise might normalize the cardiovagal baroreflex and provide therapeutic benefit in patients with POTS.","Stewart, Julian M.; Warsy, Irfan A.; Visintainer, Paul; Terilli, Courtney; Medow, Marvin S.",Hypertension,6,12

Inside a brain scanner, all participants read empathy-eliciting scenarios while adopting either the patient or doctor perspective. Brain activation and self-reported ratings during the experience of empathy were obtained. Behavioral results indicated that all participants reported greater emotional negativity and empathic concern in association with the patient perspective condition than with the doctor perspective condition. Functional brain imaging results indicated that neural activity in the posterior superior temporal region implicated in goal-relevant attention reorienting was overall increased under the patient perspective than the doctor perspective condition. Relative to nonmedical students, medical students showed decreased activity in the temporoparietal region implicated in mentalizing under the patient perspective versus doctor perspective condition. Notably, this same region showed increased activity under the doctor versus patient condition in medical students relative to nonmedical students. This study is among the first to investigate the neural mechanisms of empathy among medical students and the current findings point to the cognitive empathy system as the locus of the primary brain differences associated with empathy toward patients.","Kim, Shin Ah; Lee, Young-Mee; Hamann, Stephan; Kim, Sang Hee",Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract,6,12

Eighty women under the age of 35 were divided into two groups: 1—POR without using plastic containers (n = 40) and 2—POR with using plastic containers (n = 40). The ICAM-1 and HLA-G genes and protein expressions were examined by the quantitative PCR and western blotting technique. The methylation pattern was investigated by the methylation-specific PCR. Total BPA in follicular fluid was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography technique and the detection limit was 1.14 ng/ml. ICAM-1 and HLA-G genes were differentially expressed between the two groups studied. ICAM-1, HLA-G genes, and protein expressions in group 1 were up-regulated compared to the second group (P < 0.05). While DNA methylation status in group 1 were decreased compared to the other group (P < 0.05). The concentration of BPA in the follicular fluid of group 1 was lower compared to the second group (P < 0.05). The oocyte quality and clinical pregnancy ratio showed significantly higher in group 1 than in the other ones (P < 0.05). The alteration of ICAM-1 and HLA-G gene expressions in POR women is probably related to BPA concentration. As a result Lifestyle habits may also affect the methylation pattern and protein levels in the cumulus cells of POR women. Additionally, lifestyle habits may be considered as a marker for ovulation, oocyte maturation, preimplantation, and clinical pregnancy process.","Aftabsavad, Somayeh; Noormohammadi, Zahra; Moini, Ashraf; Karimipoor, Morteza",Sci Rep,6,12

This is partly due to a poor understanding of its etiopathogenesis. In this case–control study, we characterized the salivary proteome of patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis in the presence and absence of lesions. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics tools, we identified that the presence of oral ulcers is associated with several specific biological processes, including the metabolic pathways of vitamin B9, B12, nitrogen, selenium, and the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. These changes occurred only in the presence of clinically visible lesions, and there were no relevant differences between patients in anatomical regions unaffected by ulcers. Additionally, using western blot and ELISA assays, we verified that carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) and hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) proteins are highly expressed during the ulcerative and remission phases of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Our results cumulatively support saliva as an indicator of the pathophysiological changes, which occur during the clinical course of lesions. From a clinical perspective, we suggest that recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a condition triggered by temporary biological changes in people with lesions.","Hernández-Olivos, Romina; Muñoz, Mariagrazia; Núñez, Esteban; Camargo-Ayala, Paola Andrea; Garcia-Huidobro, Jenaro; Pereira, Alfredo; Nachtigall, Fabiane M.; Santos, Leonardo S.; Rivera, César",Sci Rep,6,12

This resistance causes an increase in mortality rate because strains resistant to antimicrobial agents are a major challenge for physicians and healthcare workers regarding the eradication of either hospital or community-based infections. These strains with emerging resistance are a serious issue for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Antibiotic resistance has increased because of the acquirement of mobile genetic elements such as transposons, plasmids, and integrons and causes the prevalence of multidrug resistance strains (MDR). In addition, an increase in carbapenem resistance, which is used as last line antibiotic treatment to eliminate infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, is a major concern. Carbapenems resistant A. baumannii (CR-Ab) is a worldwide problem. Because these strains are often resistant to all other commonly used antibiotics. Therefore, pathogenic multi-drug resistance A. baumannii (MDR-Ab) associated infections become hard to eradicate. Plasmid-mediated resistance causes outbreaks of extensive drug-resistant. A. baumannii (XDR-Ab). In addition, recent outbreaks relating to livestock and community settings illustrate the existence of large MDR-Ab strain reservoirs within and outside hospital settings. The purpose of this review, proper monitoring, prevention, and treatment are required to control (XDR-Ab) infections. Attachment, the formation of biofilms and the secretion of toxins, and low activation of inflammatory responses are mechanisms used by pathogenic A. baumannii strain. This review will discuss some aspects associated with antibiotics resistance in A. baumannii as well as cover briefly phage therapy as an alternative therapeutic treatment.","Ibrahim, Susan; Al-Saryi, Nadal; Al-Kadmy, Israa M.

Patients with cancer often exhibit therapy-related clonal hematopoiesis (t-CH), an aggressive form of clonal hematopoiesis that can result from somatic mutations in genes encoding regulators of the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway. Gain-of-function mutations in exon 6 of the protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D (PPM1D) gene are the most frequently mutated DNA-damage response gene associated with t-CH. Whether t-CH can contribute to cardiac dysfunction is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the causal and mechanistic relationships between Ppm1d-mediated t-CH and nonischemic heart failure in an experimental system. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether gain-of-function hematopoietic cell mutations in Ppm1d can increase susceptibility to cardiac stress, we evaluated cardiac dysfunction in a mouse model where clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations in exon 6 of Ppm1d were produced by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Mice transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells containing the mutated Ppm1d gene exhibited augmented cardiac remodeling following the continuous infusion of Ang II (angiotensin II). Ppm1d-mutant macrophages were impaired in DDR pathway activation and displayed greater DNA damage, higher reactive oxygen species generation, and an augmented proinflammatory profile with elevations in IL (interleukin)-1β and IL-18. The administration of an NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome inhibitor to mice reversed the cardiac phenotype induced by the Ppm1d-mutated hematopoietic stem cells under conditions of Ang II–induced stress. CONCLUSIONS: A mouse model of Ppm1d-mediated t-CH was more susceptible to cardiac stress. Mechanistically, disruption of the DDR pathway led to elevations in inflammatory cytokine production, and the NLRP3 inflammasome was shown to be essential for this augmented cardiac stress response. These data indicate that t-CH involving activating mutations in PPM1D can contribute to the cardiac dysfunction observed in cancer survivors, and that anti-inflammatory therapy may have utility in treating this condition.","Yura, Yoshimitsu; Miura-Yura, Emiri; Katanasaka, Yasufumi; Min, Kyung-Duk; Chavkin, Nicholas; Polizio, Ariel H.; Ogawa, Hayato; Horitani, Keita; Doviak, Heather; Evans, Megan A.; Sano, Miho; Wang, Ying; Boroviak, Katharina; Philippos, George; Domingues, Ana Filipa; Vassiliou, George; Sano, Soichi; Walsh, Kenneth",Circ Res,6,12

It is highly vital for hydropower operation, agricultural planning, and flood control. In this study, the convolution neural network (CNN) and Long-Short-term Memory network (LSTM) are combined to make a new integrated model called CNN-LSTM to predict the hourly Q(flow) (short-term) at Brisbane River and Teewah Creek, Australia. The CNN layers were used to extract the features of Q(flow) time-series, while the LSTM networks use these features from CNN for Q(flow) time series prediction. The proposed CNN-LSTM model is benchmarked against the standalone model CNN, LSTM, and Deep Neural Network models and several conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models. Q(flow) prediction is conducted for different time intervals with the length of 1-Week, 2-Weeks, 4-Weeks, and 9-Months, respectively. With the help of different performance metrics and graphical analysis visualization, the experimental results reveal that with small residual error between the actual and predicted Q(flow), the CNN-LSTM model outperforms all the benchmarked conventional AI models as well as ensemble models for all the time intervals. With 84% of Q(flow) prediction error below the range of 0.05 m(3) s(−1), CNN-LSTM demonstrates a better performance compared to 80% and 66% for LSTM and DNN, respectively. In summary, the results reveal that the proposed CNN-LSTM model based on the novel framework yields more accurate predictions. Thus, CNN-LSTM has significant practical value in Q(flow) prediction.","Ghimire, Sujan; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Farooque, Aitazaz A.; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Zhang, Ji; Tao, Xiaohui",Sci Rep,6,12

A set of nonlinear differential equations is been used to explore the interactions between ecology and epidemiology. The model allows for frequency-dependent transmission of infection within host species, and density-dependent transmission between species, via the environment or a vector. Three examples are discussed. It is shown that removing a pathogen may increase a consumer population, decreasing its resource. It is then shown that the presence of a pathogen could enable a predator and a prey species to coexist. Finally the dilution effect, by which increasing biodiversity reduces the transmission of an infectious disease, is investigated.","Roberts, M. G.; Heesterbeek, J. A.

However, since the beginning of industrialization era, focus on economic development has caused detrimental effects on the environment. Last two centuries have witnessed changes in global environmental factors such as rise in temperature leading to global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone layer, loss of biodiversity and marked degradation in air and water quality due to atmospheric pollution, thereby causing upsurge in infectious and non-infectious diseases. Environmental health has emerged as an important part of medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 24% of global disease burden and 23% of all deaths can be attributed to environmental factors. Deaths from heart disease, cancer, respiratory disorders and many vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and cholera have increased due to changes in climate, especially in developing countries. Besides limited attention to sanitation, hygiene, as well as quality of food and drinking water, factors such as deforestation, increasing vehicular traffic, migration from rural to urban areas, decreasing water resources and inadequate drainage systems contribute to increase incidence of diseases. The need of the hour is to sensitize ourselves about the way our ecology is being degraded and the health effects it is causing. A holistic view is needed to address the problem of environmental health where agriculture, animal husbandry, public health, water safety and air pollution need to be looked at in a combined manner for education, planning and resource allocation. Therefore, a close association between scientists, public health professionals and administrators is needed for integrated design and development of framework to attain harmony between man and nature.","Guleria, Randeep; Mathur, Vartika; Dhanuka, Ashutosh",Natural Resource Management: Ecological Perspectives,6,12

The range of symptoms associated with each infection can be wide ranging in both presentation and severity, depending on age of the patient, underlying co-morbidities and other confounding factors. In this chapter we describe the most common respiratory infections ranging from relatively mild infections such as the common cold, through to more serious presentations including pneumonia. Data are presented from a general practitioner morbidity surveillance system based in England and Wales. Each acute respiratory syndrome is described in respect of seasonality, secular trends and microbiological aetiology providing an insight into the complex nature of these acute respiratory episodes. The more serious endpoints of acute respiratory infections are hospitalisation and death. Many acute respiratory infections are mild in nature and generally self-limiting and therefore do not commonly require further medical interventions. However, despite major advances in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections in recent years, hospitalisation and deaths continue to exert pressures on national health resources and provide an economic burden in countries across the world on an annual basis.","Elliot, Alex J.; Fleming, Douglas M.",Common Cold,6,12

This result extends to modular-width, answering an open question on the complexity of Equitable Coloring when parametrized by modular-width. On the contrary, we show that the Equitable Coloring problem is FPT when parameterized by neighborhood diversity. Furthermore, we present a scheme for devising FPT algorithms parameterized by iterated type partition, which enables us to find optimal solutions for several graph problems. While the considered problems are already known to be FPT with respect to modular-width, the novel algorithms are both simpler and more efficient. As an example, in this paper, we give an algorithm for the Dominating Set problem that outputs an optimal set in time [Formula: see text], where n and t are the size and the iterated type partition of the input graph, respectively.","Cordasco, Gennaro; Gargano, Luisa; Rescigno, Adele A.",Combinatorial Algorithms,6,12

Bayesian image analysis can improve image quality, by balancing a priori expectations of image characteristics, with a model for the noise process via Bayes Theorem. We have previously given a reformulation of the conventional Bayesian image analysis paradigm in Fourier space, i.e. the prior distribution (the prior) and likelihood are given in terms of spatial frequency signals. By specifying the Bayesian model in Fourier space, spatially correlated priors, that are relatively difficult to model and compute in conventional image space, can be efficiently modeled as a set of independent processes across Fourier space. The originally inter-correlated and high-dimensional problem in image space is thereby broken down into a series of (trivially parallelizable) independent one-dimensional problems. In this paper we adapt this Fourier space process into a data-driven framework in which the Fourier space priors are built empirically from a database of images and then used to enhance future images. We will describe the data-driven Bayesian image analysis in Fourier space (DD-BIFS) modeling approach, illustrate it’s computational efficiency and speed. Finally, we give specific applications of DD-BIFS to improve the quality of arterial-spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion images via a database of human brain positron emission tomography (PET) images.","Kornak, John; Boylan, Ross; Young, Karl; Wolf, Amy; Cobigo, Yann; Rosen, Howard",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,6,12

Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the so- called workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchain’s final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.","Pinzón, Carlos; Rocha, Camilo; Finke, Jorge",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,6,12

In India, courts have been accessed either as a last resort of justice or as a ‘strategic instrument’ to claim citizens’ power vis-à-vis the State or medical profession. Health care jurisprudence, i.e. the body of judicial-legal principles emerging from the judgments of Supreme Court of India (SCI) in health care litigations, attains significance due to the power it enjoys as the domestic law or policy, in accordance with the common-law tradition.

A pre‐transition survey found that ∼10% of students enrolled in our courses lacked high‐speed internet capable of streaming videos and/or computers compatible with the applications in our Learning Management System (LMS). To ensure that students with limited internet or technology were not left behind, we adopted a low‐tech/bandwidth delivery (slides + transcript with LMS‐delivered assessments) of all lectures and recitation activities. Students could also complete either a low‐tech/bandwidth (lab slides + transcripts) or high‐tech/bandwidth lab option (delivered via video). Upon completion, students were surveyed to assess preferences and perceptions which are vital in understanding how our approach impacted student motivation, engagement with the material, and overall course satisfaction. Despite 90% of the students having access to high‐speed internet, ∼45% of the students used the low‐tech solutions either exclusively or half the time, even when high‐tech options (such as video) were available. Overall, students felt the low‐tech/bandwidth delivery of the lecture (∼87%) and recitation (∼76%) material was effective. Students (∼74%) also reported that online delivery of the lab material effectively supported their learning and was an effective replacement for the in‐lab learning experience. Students preferred in‐person to online delivery (63 vs. 17%) with 20% undecided. Noting the flexibility and organization of the course, 69% of the students felt the online delivery of our courses was more effective than their other courses despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of high‐tech delivery.

Objective To determine if chilblains are associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This monocentric case series was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, a tertiary care hospital in Brussels, Belgium, between April 10 and April 17, 2020. We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains. Main Outcomes and Measures Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens. Results The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions. The IgM and IgG antibody titers were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients (<1.0 arbitrary unit/mL). No significant abnormalities in blood test results were suggestive of systemic disease. Antinuclear antibody titers were low in 7 patients and higher in 1 patient. Conclusions and Relevance Chilblains appeared not to be directly associated with COVID-19 in this case series.

Numerous studies have demonstrated its safety and efficacy specifically pertaining to those with malignant distal biliary obstruction or altered foregut anatomy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EUS-BD in benign indications in patients with normal foregut anatomy. METHODS We performed a retrospective comparative study from 5 academic medical centers (2008-2018) involving patients with benign biliary obstruction and native foregut anatomy who had an initial failed ERCP with subsequent attempt at biliary decompression via EUS-BD or by repeating ERCP. RESULTS 36 patients (mean age 61.6 ± 2.2, 38.9% female) who underwent attempted EUS-BD following initial failed ERCP were compared to 50 patients (mean age 62.7 ± 2.3, 73.5% female) who underwent repeat ERCP following an initial failed cannulation. EUS-BD was technically successful in 28 (77.8%) patients with rendezvous being the most common approach (86.1%). A higher level of pre-procedural bilirubin was found to be associated with technical success of EUS-BD (3.65 ± 0.63 versus 1.1 ± 0.4, p value 0.04). Success of repeat ERCP following failed cannulation was 86%. Adverse events were significantly more frequent in the EUS-BD cohort when compared to the repeat ERCP (10 (27.8%) versus 4 (8.0%), p = 0.02, OR 4.32. CONCLUSIONS EUS-BD remains a viable therapeutic option in the setting of benign biliary disease, with success rates of 77.8%.

Siblings often play a crucial support role for their brothers and sisters with IDD. As such, this study aimed to describe the experiences of adult siblings of people with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The Sibling Collaborative worked with researchers to codesign an online survey, completed by 91 people, exploring sibling supports and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey also aimed to identify helpful resources for siblings during this time. RESULTS The results showed that the majority of siblings are supporting their brother or sister with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic and are concerned about the health and well-being of their brother/sister. The most common concern related to disruption of their brother's or sister's routine and activities. Although responses of older and younger siblings did not differ from each other, siblings whose brother or sister with IDD lived with family had some unique concerns relative to those whose siblings no longer lived with family. Siblings described how their own self-care and relationships with others, as well as support for their brother/sister, were particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Siblings are providing key support to their brother or sister with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they too must be supported. Siblings should be included in efforts to disseminate resources targeting people with IDD and their feedback and input must be obtained. It is also important to include sibling mental wellness as caregiver supports are created and implemented. More research is needed to further understand how to support sibling caregivers.","Redquest, B K; Tint, A; Ries, H; Lunsky, Y",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,6,31

This information will be of interest to mathematicians and clinicians, and make a significant contribution towards the development of more specific and effective models. Literature searches were performed using the online database of PubMed (inception to August, 2020). EXPERT OPINION : Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases. With the development of theories and the ability of calculations, infectious disease modeling would play a much more important role in disease prevention and control of public health.","Ding, Cheng; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Yang, Shigui",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,6,1

DESIGN Interpretive descriptive qualitative study. METHODS Twenty to 25 youth aged 10-18 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes will be purposively recruited through the Diabetes Education Resource for Children and Adolescents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and through the Improving Renal Complications in Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes Through the REsearch [iCARE] cohort. Socio-demographic information will be collected. Semi-structured interviews will occur iteratively with inductive thematic analysis. Data will be professionally transcribed and managed using NVivo 1.0 software. The University Ethics Committee approved this study (May 2020). DISCUSSION There is a critical gap in understanding youth experiences of type 2 diabetes. Research involving youth with type 2 diabetes is predominantly quantitative in nature, largely reflecting risk factors, underlying mechanisms and treatment outcomes associated with diabetes management. In-depth qualitative research on youth experiences can help identify youth priorities, provide insight into critical misalignments between stakeholder perspectives, and drive forward a more consolidated youth-centred research agenda. IMPACT Understanding and applying knowledge of youth experiences is critical as the prevalence of, and challenges associated with, youth onset type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide. This research will generate a robust interpretive description of youth lived experiences and perceptions of type 2 diabetes where such research is lacking, to inform basic and applied research within an interdisciplinary investigative and clinical research team with relevance to other jurisdictions. In response to calls for youth-oriented research in type 2 diabetes, this work will catalyse collaborative knowledge translation using creative and youth-directed initiatives.","Archibald, Mandy M; Dart, Allison; Wicklow, Brandy; Pundyk, Katherine J; Marks, Seth D; Sellers, Elizabeth A C",Journal of advanced nursing,6,1

False-positive reactions were not observed with K99-negative strains and with several viral antigens. Only bovine coronavirus caused slight positive reactions which could be eliminated by a blocking test. As compared with the conventional procedure for the detection of the K99 antigen, ELISA seemed to be at least as sensitive and had the advantage that samples could be stored at -20° C before testing. In addition many samples could be handled at the same time and the results became available quickly. By carrying out the assay as a blocking test, specific antibody against K99 in serum or colostrum could be detected and titrated.","Ellens, D J; de Leeuw, P W; Rozemond, H",The Veterinary quarterly,6,1

The extraction of the gastrectomy specimen could be challenging and time-consuming. Different techniques have been described for specimen withdrawal. In this article we report the technique adopted in more than 250 LSGs performed in our department. METHODS In the first 90 LSGs performed in our department from October 2002, the specimen was extracted in a retrieval bag using an endoloop. In the following 160 cases the technique has been simplified: the grasped specimen is withdrawn through the 15-mm trocar site without any additional device. RESULTS We registered only two cases of wound infection (1.2%) with the simplified technique, both occurring in the initial cases. There were no cases of trocar site hernia formation. CONCLUSION The technique described does not require any special devices and seems to be simpler, saves time, and is cost effective if compared with other techniques previously reported.","Casella, Giovanni; Soricelli, Emanuele; Fantini, Aldo; Basso, Nicola",World journal of surgery,6,1

Research inclusive of women and those not using VHA care is critical to understanding mental health and suicide risk among justice-involved veterans. This study examined whether lifetime justice involvement was associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, recent suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempt. METHOD We conducted a secondary analysis of 812 post-9/11 male and female veterans. The sample included veterans eligible and not eligible for VHA care. Participants were administered the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Additional questions assessed justice involvement, military characteristics, demographics, and recent use of VHA mental health care. RESULTS History of justice involvement was associated with more severe PTSD and depression symptoms as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Associations were maintained after adjusting for sex, combat exposure, service branch, recent use of VHA mental health care, and education. Sex-stratified exploratory analyses revealed consistent findings among males; justice involvement was associated with suicide attempt among females. Current probation or parole was particularly related to depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS Justice-involved veterans appear to be a vulnerable population experiencing heightened psychiatric symptoms and increased risk for recent suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempt. Programs within VHA and the community are important for connecting justice-involved veterans to mental health services and mitigating suicide risk.

Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 57 consecutive patients undergoing distal spleno-pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma was performed. The pancreatic isthmus was systematically straight-sectioned with a cold knife, and the remnant was stapled close without additional stitches or adjuncts. The study's main endpoints were postoperative mortality, the occurrence of a pancreatic fistula, the need for a re-operation, the postoperative length of stay in the hospital, the rate of re-admission, and late survival. Results: Postoperative mortality was absent. Seventeen patients (29.8%) presented a pancreatic fistula of grade A in seven cases (41.2%), grade B in eight cases (47.1%), and grade C in two cases (11.8%). Re-operation was required in the two patients (3.5%) with grade C fistula in order to drain an intra-abdominal abscess. The mean postoperative length of stay in the hospital was 15 days (range, 6-62 days). No patient required re-admission. Twenty-nine patients (50.8%) were alive and free from disease, respectively, 12 patients (21.1%) at 12 months, 13 patients (22.8%) at 60 months, and four patients (7.0%) at 120 months from the operation. The remaining patients died of metastatic disease 9-37 months from the operation. Lastly, disease-related mortality was 49.1%. Conclusion: Stapler closure of the pancreatic remnant allows good postoperative results, limiting the formation of pancreatic fistula to the lower limit of its overall reported incidence.","Illuminati, Giulio; Cerasari, Saverio; Pasqua, Rocco; Nardi, Priscilla; Fratini, Chiara; Frey, Sébastien; Iannelli, Antonio; Marini, Pierluigi",Frontiers in surgery,6,16

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Psychiatric disorders are the main risk factors for suicide. COVID-19 may result in the appearance of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Moreover, other corollaries of the pandemic (e.g., isolation, job loss) may lead to increasing stress and, ultimately, psychiatric disorders even among the non-infected population. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the theory of whether the pandemic, due to the aforementioned factors, was associated with the reversal of the declining suicide rate trend in Hungary. METHOD To compare the observed number of suicides during the COVID-19 months (March-December 2020) with the expected numbers, we used an interrupted time series model and, for the estimations, quasi-Poisson regression. Expected numbers were calculated based on trends derived from monthly data between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS During the months of the pandemic, the number of suicides among males rose significantly by 18% compared to the hypothetical trend that would have occurred in the absence of COVID-19. A significant increase (16%) was also observed in the total population. By contrast, the number of female suicides did not differ significantly from the number expected based on the pre-COVID-19 trend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION After the outbreak of the epidemic, Hungarian males committed significantly more suicides, while no relevant changes were observed among females. Interestingly, studies from other countries found either no change or decrease when comparing suicide numbers from the COVID-19 period with the corresponding numbers from the pre-COVID-19 period. The explanation for this discrepancy is still lacking, so further investigations are needed.

Currently, there is no drug approved for its treatment and different therapeutic options are being essayed to address pathophysiological processes underlying the clinical manifestations experienced by patients. New and old drugs, whether as a single treatment or in combination, in immunologically compromised patients may favour the development of adverse drug reactions (ADR), including drug hypersensitivity, which must be identified and managed accordingly. Given the lack of community immunity and the high rate of virus contagion, it is expected that new cases will emerge in the upcoming months. Thus, the probability of more adverse reactions or even new clinical manifestations may increase in the near future.

Seventeen consensus statements were generated; in the first-line setting auto-HCT consolidation represents standard-of-care in eligible patients, whereas there is no clear role of allo-HCT or CAR T-cell therapy, outside of a clinical trial. In the R/R setting, the preferential option is CAR T-cell therapy especially in MCL failing or intolerant to at least one Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, while allo-HCT is recommended if CAR T-cell therapy has failed or is not feasible.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective single-centre cohort study included sexually active female patients after transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy or anterior resection. Sexual life impairment and quality of life were assessed by the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) prior and 1 year after surgery. Patient satisfaction was assessed as well as the sexual function 1 year postoperatively using the validated German version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-D). RESULTS Between September 2008 and December 2009, 106 sexually active women after transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy or anterior resection were identified. Sexual life significantly improved (GIQLI scores 3.2 ± 1.0 preoperatively vs. 3.7 ± 0.7 1 year postoperatively, P < 0.001), and painful sexual intercourse (3.3 ± 1.0 vs. 3.6 ± 0.7, P = 0.008) decreased post-surgery. The mean FSFI-D total score after transvaginal NOTES was 28.1 ± 4.6, exceeding the cutoff for sexual dysfunction defined as 26. Four (4.5 %) out of 88 patients who answered this question were not satisfied with the transvaginal hybrid NOTES procedure. CONCLUSIONS This prospective cohort study of female sexual function after transvaginal NOTES provides compelling evidence that the transvaginal access is safe and associated with high satisfaction rate.","Linke, Georg R; Luz, Stephanie; Janczak, Joanna; Zerz, Andreas; Schmied, Bruno M; Siercks, Ikbale; Warschkow, René; Beutner, Ulrich; Tarantino, Ignazio",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,6,4

However, it exists indirect evidence suggesting that this assumption may not hold true for some joint configurations where non-muscular structures, such as the peripheral nerves, are stretched. Direct evidences are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether a static stretching aiming to load the sciatic nerve without stretch within plantar flexors is effective to: (i) alter nerve stiffness; and (ii) increase the ankle's maximal ROM. Passive maximal ankle ROM in dorsiflexion was assessed with the hip flexed at 90° (HIP-flexed) or neutral (HIP-neutral, 0°). Sciatic nerve stiffness was estimated using shear wave elastography. Sciatic nerve stretching induced both a 13.3 ± 7.9% (P < 0.001) decrease in the nerve stiffness and a 6.4 ± 2.6° increase in the maximal dorsiflexion ROM assessed in HIP-flexed. In addition, the decrease in sciatic nerve stiffness was significantly correlated with the change in maximal ROM in dorsiflexion (r = -0.571, P = 0.026). These effects occurred in the absence of any change in gastrocnemius medialis and biceps femoris stiffness, and ankle passive torque. These results demonstrate that maximal dorsiflexion ROM can be acutely increased by stretching the sciatic nerve, without altering the muscle stiffness.","Andrade, Ricardo J; Freitas, Sandro R; Hug, François; Le Sant, Guillaume; Lacourpaille, Lilian; Gross, Raphäel; McNair, Peter; Nordez, Antoine",Scientific reports,6,1

However, we do not yet know how loneliness gets ""under the skin"" in ways that may impact the long-term health and development of early adolescents. In particular, loneliness may influence youths' patterns of diurnal cortisol, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and a central predictor of health across the lifespan. The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) pandemic represents a salient period in which to study the consequences of loneliness, as recent work has provided evidence that the physical-distancing measures put in place to contain the virus have resulted in greater loneliness, particularly among youth. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the prospective association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and diurnal cortisol in early adolescents. We found that greater loneliness was associated with higher levels of cortisol at waking and a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR). These results held even when controlling for covariates that can influence diurnal trajectories of cortisol. Critically, this pattern of HPA-axis functioning increases risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes across adolescence and into adulthood. This study is the first to examine the prospective association between loneliness and diurnal cortisol in early adolescence, and the first to identify mechanisms that contribute to biological markers of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of developing and distributing strategies to mitigate feelings of loneliness among youth.","Jopling, Ellen; Rnic, Katerina; Tracy, Alison; LeMoult, Joelle",Psychoneuroendocrinology,6,1

Endotracheal intubation is frequently needed in these patients with a risk of delay, and early predictors of failure may help clinicians to decide early. We aimed to identify factors associated with intubation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with different noninvasive oxygenation techniques. DESIGN Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial. SETTING Twenty-three ICUs. PATIENTS Patients with a respiratory rate greater than 25 breaths/min and a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 mm Hg. INTERVENTION Patients were treated with standard oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, or noninvasive ventilation. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Respiratory variables one hour after treatment initiation. Under standard oxygen, patients with a respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30 breaths/min were more likely to need intubation (odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.13-6.75; p = 0.03). One hour after high-flow nasal cannula oxygen initiation, increased heart rate was the only factor associated with intubation. One hour after noninvasive ventilation initiation, a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than or equal to 200 mm Hg and a tidal volume greater than 9 mL/kg of predicted body weight were independent predictors of intubation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.62-11.16; p = 0.003 and adjusted odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.22-8.06; p = 0.02, respectively). A tidal volume above 9 mL/kg during noninvasive ventilation remained independently associated with 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure breathing spontaneously, the respiratory rate was a predictor of intubation under standard oxygen, but not under high-flow nasal cannula oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. A PaO2/FIO2 below 200 mm Hg and a high tidal volume greater than 9 mL/kg were the two strong predictors of intubation under noninvasive ventilation.","Frat, Jean-Pierre; Ragot, Stéphanie; Coudroy, Rémi; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Girault, Christophe; Prat, Gwénael; Boulain, Thierry; Demoule, Alexandre; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Razazi, Keyvan; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Devaquet, Jérôme; Mira, Jean-Paul; Argaud, Laurent; Chakarian, Jean-Charles; Fartoukh, Muriel; Nseir, Saad; Mercat, Alain; Brochard, Laurent; Robert, René; Thille, Arnaud W",Critical care medicine,6,1

In this study, 56 Wistar albino male rats (estimated body weights 250-400 g) were divided into eight groups (n = 7). Group 1 (Control) received no drug. Group 2 (ISO) was given 180 mg/kg of isoproterenol subcutaneously (s.c.); two doses were administered at 24-h intervals on days 29 and 30 of the experiment. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were given valsartan (30 mg/kg orally), C21 (0.03 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and a combination of Valsartan + C21, respectively, for 30 days. Groups 6, 7, and 8 were administered Valsartan, C21, and Valsartan + C21 in the same application, duration, and dose, respectively, and isoproterenol (180 mg/kg s.c.) was given on days 29 and 30 of the experiment. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the rats at the beginning and end of the experiment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG alterations were monitored via a carotid artery cannula at the end of the experiment. Histopathological and biochemical measurements were performed on the cardiac tissue of the rats. For histopathological findings, C21 and Valsartan + C21 combination therapy significantly reduced the development of heart failure compared to valsartan alone. Also, the protective effect of C21 on myocardial injury was superior to that of valsartan. According to the results of echocardiographic and biochemical evaluations, C21, and Valsartan showed protective effects against heart failure. C21, valsartan, and combined therapy significantly prevented the decrease of ejection fraction. This report describes the cardioprotective effects of C21 and valsartan in ISO-induced myocardial damage.","Ulutas, Zeynep; Ermis, Necip; Ozhan, Onural; Parlakpinar, Hakan; Vardi, Nigar; Ates, Burhan; Colak, Cemil",Cardiovascular toxicology,6,1

Approximately 60% of PCOS women have insulin resistance. While the efficacy of metformin in reducing insulin resistance and decreasing androgen level has been widely validated, there is no agreement on the dose of metformin to be used. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective non-randomized cohort study of 108 insulin resistant, overweight and obese PCOS women, aged between 22 and 35 years. All patients received 1500 mg of metformin (500 mg x 3 times/day) for the first 6 months. At the end of this period, the patients' HOMA index was evaluated. In subjects, who did not demonstrate normalization of the HOMA index, the dose was increased to 2500 mg/day (500 mg at breakfast and 1000 mg at lunch and dinner) for additional 6 months. The hormonal blood profile, fasting insulin and fasting glucose levels, HOMA index, anthropometric assessment, pelvic ultrasound, FAI index and cholesterol were evaluated. RESULTS Overall results showed a good response to metformin therapy in insulin-resistant PCOS patients with BMI >25, while in patients with higher BMI (31.15 ± 0.40), no normalization of HOMA was found. At the higher dose of metformin, obese patients achieved a good response to therapy, with improvement in BMI, menstrual pattern, cholesterol levels and hyperandrogenism. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate a correlation between the required dose of metformin, BMI and hyperandrogenism. The dose of metformin should be adjusted to patients' BMI in order to obtain significant results in terms of clinical, metabolic and hormonal responses.","Morgante, G; Massaro, M G; Scolaro, V; Cappelli, V; Luddi, A; Troìa, L; De Leo, V",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,6,16

For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.","Lynch, Kara L; Whitman, Jeffrey D; Lacanienta, Noreen P; Beckerdite, Erica W; Kastner, Shannon A; Shy, Brian R; Goldgof, Gregory M; Levine, Andrew G; Bapat, Sagar P; Stramer, Susan L; Esensten, Jonathan H; Hightower, Allen W; Bern, Caryn; Wu, Alan H B",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,6,9

Pneumoperitoneum insufflation with warmed and humidified carbon dioxide (WH-CO2) can prevent heat loss and increase tissue oxygenation. We evaluated the impact of localized WH-CO2 insufflation on the anastomotic healing process. Methods. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomized: Group 1 (control, n = 12), Group 2 (cold and dry CO2, CD-CO2, n = 24), and Group 3 (WH-CO2, n = 24). A magnetic compression side-to-side colonic anastomosis was performed under 60-minute local abdominal CO2 flow insufflation. Animal temperature was recorded. IL-1, IL-6, and CRP levels were assessed before and after insufflation and on postoperative day (POD) 7 and POD 10. Endoscopic follow-up was performed on POD 7 and POD 10. A burst pressure (BP) test of the specimen was performed on POD 10, and histopathological analysis was then performed. Metabolomics of the anastomotic site was determined. Results. Seven rats (5 CD-CO2 group, 1 WH-CO2 group, and 1 control group) died during the survival period. Necropsies revealed intestinal occlusions (n = 2). One additional rat from the CD-CO2 group was sacrificed on POD 7 due to intestinal perforation. The postoperative course was uneventful in the remaining cases. There was no difference in BP among the groups. Thermal monitoring confirmed that WH-CO2 insufflation was effective to reduce heat loss. IL-1 levels were statistically and significantly lower on POD 10 in the WH-CO2 group than the CD-CO2 group but not lower than the control group. CRP levels, histopathology, and metabolomics did not show any difference between the 3 groups. Conclusions. WH-CO2 was effective to preserve core temperature. However, it did not improve anastomotic healing.","Marchegiani, Francesco; Noll, Eric; Riva, Pietro; Kong, Seong-Ho; Saccomandi, Paola; Vita, Giorgia; Lindner, Véronique; Namer, Izzie Jacques; Marescaux, Jacques; Diemunsch, Pierre; Diana, Michele",Surgical innovation,6,0

Here, we describe the emerging epidemiology and relevant data on treatment options for COVID-19. We discuss the implications of current knowledge for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. RECENT FINDINGS Risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 among SOT recipients remain uncertain, but recent data suggest similar outcomes to the general population. Case reports of donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infection are emerging. Few studies on treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients are available, and therefore, general recommendations are similar to the general population. Vaccine efficacy in the SOT population is uncertain. SUMMARY COVID-19 remains a significant threat to SOT recipients and studies on treatment and prevention specific to this population are urgently needed. Although vaccines represent the greatest hope to control this pandemic, their efficacy in this immunocompromised population is uncertain.","Laracy, Justin C; Miko, Benjamin A; Pereira, Marcus R",Current opinion in organ transplantation,6,17

METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy completed a nocturia quality of life questionnaire score and a frequency-volume chart before and after surgery. These patients were divided into two groups by continence status (continent and incontinent) according to the number of pad exchanges per day and the 1-h pad test after surgery. Assessment was carried out before surgery, and then at 3 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire total score and the Bother/Concern subscore were significantly lower in incontinent patients at 3 and 12 months after surgery (Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire total score: Bother/Concern subscores P = 0.006: P = 0.04 at 3 months after surgery; and P = 0.04: P = 0.02 at 12 months). Both nocturnal maximum voided volume and nocturnal frequency were not significantly different between continent and incontinent patients. On multivariate analysis, nocturnal urinary frequency (P = 0.01) and urinary incontinence (P = 0.005) were significantly associated with nocturia-specific quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Although the number of nocturia episodes was not significantly different between the continent and incontinent patients after surgery, the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score was significantly worse in incontinent patients. In these patients, other than the number of nocturia episodes, psychological stress might worsen the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score. Therefore, prevention of post-prostatectomy incontinence might be important to avoid aggravating the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score.","Haga, Nobuhiro; Aikawa, Ken; Hoshi, Seiji; Yabe, Michihiro; Akaihata, Hidenori; Hata, Junya; Satoh, Yuichi; Ogawa, Soichiro; Ishibashi, Kei; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,6,1

OBJECTIVES Coagulation factors XII, XI, and VIII (FXII, FXI, and FVIII) have been implicated in first thrombotic events, and our aim was to estimate their effects on vascular outcomes within 3 years after first stroke. Patients/Methods In the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin (PROSCIS-B) study, we followed participants aged 18 and older for three years after first mild to moderate ischemic stroke event or until occurrence of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality. High coagulation factor activity levels were compared to normal and low levels, and activities were also analyzed as continuous variables. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the combined endpoint. RESULTS In total, 92 events occurred in 570 included participants, resulting in an absolute rate of 6.6 events per 100 person-years. After confounding adjustment, high FVIII activity showed the strongest relationship with the combined endpoint (HR=2.05, 95%CI 1.28-3.29). High FXI activity was also associated with an increased hazard (HR=1.80, 95%CI 1.09-2.98). High FXII activity was not found to increase the hazard (HR=0.86, 95%CI 0.49-1.51). Continuous analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS In our study of mild to moderate ischemic stroke patients, high activity levels of FXI and FVIII but not FXII were associated with worse vascular outcomes in the three-year period after first ischemic stroke.","Rohmann, Jessica L; Huo, Shufan; Sperber, Pia S; Piper, Sophie K; Rosendaal, Frits R; Heuschmann, Peter U; Endres, Matthias; Liman, Thomas G; Siegerink, Bob",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,6,24

The pseudoknot is unusual in that it would include a 7 nucleotide loop (termed here an interstem element [ISE]) between the two stems. In almost all frameshift-promoting pseudoknots, ISEs are absent or comprise a single adenosine residue. Using a combination of RNA structure probing, site directed mutagenesis, NMR, and phylogenetic sequence comparisons, we show here that the VMV stimulatory RNA is indeed a pseudoknot, conforming closely to the modeled structure, and that the ISE is essential for frameshifting. Pseudoknot function was predictably sensitive to changes in the length of the ISE, yet altering its sequence to alternate pyrimidine/purine bases was also detrimental to frameshifting, perhaps through modulation of local tertiary interactions. How the ISE is placed in the context of an appropriate helical junction conformation is not known, but its presence impacts on other elements of the pseudoknot, for example, the necessity for a longer than expected loop 1. This may be required to accommodate an increased flexibility of the pseudoknot brought about by the ISE. In support of this, (1)H NMR analysis at increasing temperatures revealed that stem 2 of the VMV pseudoknot is more labile than stem 1, perhaps as a consequence of its connection to stem 1 solely via flexible single-stranded loops.","Pennell, Simon; Manktelow, Emily; Flatt, Andrew; Kelly, Geoff; Smerdon, Stephen J; Brierley, Ian",RNA,6,1

The literature suggests a learning curve of 50-100 cases for attaining proficiency and reducing the complication rates for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The aims of this paper were to review the literature of initial cases by bariatric surgeons worldwide and to report the experience of initial 50 cases of LSG by a novice bariatric team in a single center. The objective was to evaluate the outcomes for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in the first 50 patients by a novice team of bariatric surgeons in an already established bariatric surgery program with short-term follow-up. METHODS All surgeries were done by a new bariatric team who underwent laparoscopic fellowship training under a bariatric team with an experience of over 600 bariatric procedures. Fifty consecutive patients from March 2010 to January 2012 were offered LSG and followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Weight loss and comorbidity resolution were tabulated and assessed. RESULTS Mean preoperative and postoperative BMIs were 46.6 and 35.7 kg/m2, respectively. There were no life threatening postoperative complications or mortality. The median percent excess weight loss was 50.3% at the end of 6 months. Comorbidity resolution values were 96% for obstructive sleep apnea, 89% for diabetes mellitus, and 87% for joint pains, among the most common comorbidities. CONCLUSION LSG is effective in achieving weight loss and in improving comorbidities with minimal complications even at the hands of novice bariatric surgeons with good laparoscopic skills and adequate bariatric training.","Dey, Ashish; Mittal, Tarun; Malik, Vinod K",Obesity surgery,6,1

The objective of this study was to quantify the association and dose-response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and colorectal adenoma prevalence in clinical trials. METHODS We systematically reviewed 23 studies (168,201 participants), which compared the prevalence of colorectal adenomas according to World Health Organization BMI categories. We assessed the effects of each BMI category on colorectal adenomas where odds ratio (OR) was used as a surrogate for effect size, and applied multivariate meta-analysis as a method of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of our findings and to analyze adenoma prevalence by multiple BMI categories simultaneously to assess for a dose-response relationship. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS Subjects with a BMI of ≥25 had a significantly higher prevalence of colorectal adenomas (OR=1.24 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.33), P<0.01) when compared with those with BMI<25. Multivariate meta-analysis also confirmed a positive association between higher BMI categories and the prevalence of colorectal adenoma (BMI: 25-30 vs. BMI<25; OR=1.21 (95% CI: 1.07-1.38), P<0.01; BMI≥30 vs. BMI<25; OR=1.32 (95% CI: 1.18-1.48), P<0.01) and revealed a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS The positive association between obesity and colorectal adenoma prevalence demonstrates an underlying dose-response relationship according to BMI. Colorectal centers may benefit from the timely screening of obese patients for colorectal adenomas in addition to clarifying the biological role of adiposity on colorectal tumor initiation and progression.","Okabayashi, Koji; Ashrafian, Hutan; Hasegawa, Hirotoshi; Yoo, Jae-Hoon; Patel, Vanash M; Harling, Leanne; Rowland, Simon P; Ali, Mariam; Kitagawa, Yuko; Darzi, Ara; Athanasiou, Thanos",The American journal of gastroenterology,6,28

The primary endpoint was duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Secondary endpoints included mortality, overall and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and time from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation to liberation from ventilator, intensive care unit discharge, and hospital discharge.

We used an RF generator (Cool-tip RF system [Covidien, Boulder, Colorado] or SSP-2000, Taewoong Medical Co, Ltd [Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea]) and an 18-gauge internally cooled electrode with 1-cm active tips (Cool-tip [Covidien] or Well-Point RF electrode [Taewoong Medical Co, Ltd]). RF ablation was conducted using the moving shot technique and a trans-isthmic approach. RF ablation was performed in separate sessions for nodules in each lobe. Follow-up ultrasound examinations were performed at 1-6 months, 6-12 months, and during the last month of follow-up. The diameter and volume of the nodule and clinical problems including cosmetic and symptom scores were evaluated before and after the procedure. RESULTS The mean initial nodule size was 4.1 cm ± 1.9, although there was a significant decrease by the time of the last follow-up examination (range, 1-48 mo; mean, 18.1 mo ± 12.8; P < .001, 2.5 cm ± 1.4). The initial nodule volume was 24.4 mL ± 32.2 and was decreased at the last follow-up (6.3 mL ± 19.0, P < .001), with a mean volume reduction of 75.9% ± 19.0. The symptom (P < .001) and cosmetic (P < .001) scores were decreased. Serum hormone levels did not differ significantly before treatment and at the last follow-up (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS RF ablation improves cosmetic problems and symptoms and preserves thyroid function in patients with bilateral thyroid nodules.","Ji Hong, Min; Baek, Jung Hwan; Choi, Young Jun; Lee, Jeong Hyun; Lim, Hyun Kyung; Shong, Young Kee; Hong, Suck Joon",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,6,33

However, no study has investigated whether maintaining bound representations with more features in WM requires extra object-based attention. We investigated this by examining whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was more disruptive to the maintenance of bindings in WM when more features were stored per object. We instructed participants to memorize three bound representations in a WM task while manipulating the number of features (two vs. three features) contained in each representation. Moreover, we manipulated whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was interpolated into the maintenance phase of WM. If extra object-based attention was required after the addition of an extra feature in the bound representation, the secondary task would result in a greater disruption of the three- rather than two-featured binding. In two experiments, we found that the added secondary task significantly impaired the binding performance, but the performance of the two- and three-featured bindings was disrupted to the same extent. These results suggest that the presence of more features in a bound representation in WM does not require extra object-based attention.","Zhou, Ying; Wu, Fan; Wan, Xueyi; Shen, Mowei; Gao, Zaifeng",Memory & cognition,6,31

In this study, we developed Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models to examine the effects of the various movement control phases on the disease transmissibility and case trends during the third COVID-19 wave in Malaysia. Methods Three SEIR models were developed using the R programming software ODIN interface based on COVID-19 case data from 1 September 2020 to 29 March 2021. The models were validated and subsequently used to provide forecasts of daily cases from 14 October 2020 to 29 March 2021 based on three movement control phases. Results We found that the R values had reduced by 59.1% from an initial high of 2.2 during the Nationwide Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) to 0.9 during the Movement Control Order (MCO) and Conditional MCO (CMCO) phases. In addition, the observed cumulative and daily highest cases were much lower compared to the forecast cumulative and daily highest cases at 64.4% to 98.9% and 68.8% to 99.8%, respectively. Conclusion We conclude that the movement control measures were able to progressively reduce the R values during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, more stringent movement control measures such as the MCO and CMCO were effective in reducing the R values and case numbers further during the third wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia due to their higher stringency levels compared to the Nationwide RMCO.","Md Zamri, Ahmed Syahmi Syafiq; Singh, Sarbhan; Ghazali, Sumarni Mohd; Herng, Lai Chee; Dass, Sarat Chandra; Aris, Tahir; Ibrahim, Hishamshah Mohd; Gill, Balvinder Singh",Epidemiology and health,6,12

We aimed to evaluate the proportion at which newer, more aggressive secondary lipid targets are exceeded in patients with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL estimated by Friedewald (LDLf-C) and Martin/Hopkins equations (LDLm-C). Methods We analyzed patients from the Very Large Database of Lipids with fasting lipids and estimated LDL-C <70 mg/dL by the Friedewald equation and Martin/Hopkins algorithm. Patients were categorized into three groups: LDL-C <40, 40-54 and 55-69 mg/dL. We calculated the proportion of patients with non-HDL-C and apoB above high-risk targets (non-HDL-C ≥ 100 and apoB ≥ 80mg/dL) for those with LDL-C 55-69 mg/dL and very high-risk targets (non-HDL-C ≥ 85 and apoB ≥ 65mg/dL) for those with LDL-C < 40 mg/dL and 40-54 mg/dL. Results In patients with LDLf-C < 40 mg/dL, ~8 and ~4% did not meet high-risk secondary targets and ~21 and 25% did not meet very high-risk secondary targets for non-HDL-C and apoB, respectively. However, in patients with LDLm-C < 40 mg/dL <1% did not meet high-risk targets, while only 3% did not meet the very-high risk secondary target for apoB and none exceeded the very-high risk secondary target for non-HDL-C. Among individuals with LDL-C< 40 mg/dL, there were increasing proportions of individuals not meeting the very high-risk secondary apoB target at greater triglyceride levels, reaching up to ~19% using LDLm-C compared to ~60% using LDLf-C when triglyceride levels were 200-399 mg/dL. There were higher proportions of individuals not meeting high and very-high risk targets as triglyceride levels increased among those with LDL-C 40-54 and 55-69 mg/dL. Conclusion In a large, US cross-sectional sample of individuals with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, secondary non-HDL-C and apoB targets overall provide modest utility. However, attainment of very high-risk cutpoints for non-HDL-C and apoB is not achieved in a significant fraction of patients with triglycerides 200-399 mg/dL, even when using a more accurate calculation of LDL-C.","Quispe, Renato; Brownstein, Adam J; Sathiyakumar, Vasanth; Park, Jihwan; Chang, Blair; Sajja, Aparna; Guallar, Eliseo; Lazo, Mariana; Jones, Steven R; Martin, Seth S",American journal of preventive cardiology,6,16

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to noninvasively monitor regional oxygen saturations (rSO2). CLINICAL FINDINGS This former 28-week female premature infant, 29 days old, received an RBC transfusion due to increased apneic spells and a hematocrit of 27%. Within 24 hours she developed abdominal distension and passed a bloody stool (Bell's stage 2 NEC on abdominal x-ray). She completed 7 days of antibiotics and nothing-by-mouth status and was discharged home on room air and oral feedings on day of life 70. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS We describe the presentation of NEC following a RBC transfusion in a preterm infant monitored with cerebral and splanchnic NIRS. INTERVENTIONS Mean rSO2 (cerebral and splanchnic) measurements were continuously recorded and calculated in 30-minute periods at baseline (prior to packed RBC transfusion), every hour during the RBC transfusion, and every 3 hours for the following 48 hours. OUTCOMES In this infant, average baseline splanchnic rSO2 was low at 46.5%, and increased during transfusion to 65%. However, following the RBC transfusion and an enteral feeding, splanchnic rSO2 dramatically decreased to 26%, and remained low until the time of NEC diagnosis. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS To develop awareness of the increased risk for NEC in premature infants with significant anemia that receive packed RBC transfusions. With further studies and education, NIRS could be a valuable tool for the nurses and medical team to identify these at-risk neonates.","Baserga, Mariana; Reich, Brixen; Braski, Katherine",Advances in neonatal care : official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses,6,1

On the other hand, angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas signaling has been shown to improve acute respiratory distress syndrome and protect alveolar epithelial cells from apoptosis. In this study, we explored the effect of Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling on the expression and activity of ADAM17 and assessed its impact on apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human alveolar epithelial cells. LPS markedly induced the shedding activity of ADAM17 in alveolar epithelial cells, which was blocked by selective c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. Ang-(1-7) concentration-dependently inhibited LPS-induced ADAM17 shedding activity, which was abolished by selective Mas blocker A779 and Mas shRNA. LPS and Ang-(1-7) showed no significant effect on the expression of ADAM17. Overexpression of ADAM17 synergized with LPS on increasing the shedding activity of ADAM17 and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells, counteracting the inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7). In addition, LPS significantly increased the JNK activity in alveolar epithelial cells; Ang-(1-7) concentration-dependently inhibited LPS-induced JNK activity, which was abolished by A779 and Mas shRNA. In conclusion, this study suggests that Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling inhibits LPS-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis by inhibiting LPS-induced shedding activity of ADAM17, likely by a JNK-dependent mechanism.","Ma, Xinhua; Xu, Daomiao; Ai, Yuhang; Zhao, Shuangping; Zhang, Lina; Ming, Guangfeng; Liu, Zhiyong",Pharmacology,6,7

Several treatment options are available including pharmacological therapy with bisphosphonates, denosumab, glucocorticoids and calcimimetics, as well as conventional therapy with hydration and possibly calcitonin. While guidelines have previously considered treatment effects, no guideline has yet considered a range of contextual factors impacting recommendations for the management. The aim of this study was to summarise the available evidence on important decisional factors for the development of guidelines for the treatment of HCM. These include patient's values and preferences, cost, acceptability, feasibility and equity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol is registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42021264371). This is a systematic review of observational studies, case series, trials, reviews and qualitative studies involving treatment of adult patients with HCM. We will develop and execute two independent search strategies using five databases: PubMed, Medline (OVID), Embase.com, CINAHL (EBSCO) and Cochrane, and review their combined output. Two reviewers will screen titles and abstracts and full texts and will implement data abstraction from relevant studies independently and in duplicate. The outcomes of interest are the decisional factors that influence drug selection, with possible subgroup summaries by drug class or aetiology of HCM. We will present the data collected in a narrative and thematic approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not applicable for our study, since we will only collect data from available literature.

In French Polynesia, the mixed cargo ship Aranui 5 transports both tourists and freight to the Marquesas Islands. The purpose of this article is to show how COVID-19 infections were diagnosed and contained before and after passengers boarded a cruise. MATERIALS AND METHODS On October 15, 2020, 161 passengers including 80 crew members embarked for a 13-day voyage from Papeete to the Marquesas Islands. Prior to boarding, all passengers underwent a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test; the tests results were all negative. On Day 0, 3, 5, 8 and 11, Biosynex® rapid antigen diagnostic tests were carried out on all or some of the crew members and tourists who may have had contact with new positive cases. Each day, forehead or temporal temperatures were measured using an infrared thermometer and questions were asked concerning the subjects' health status. When a subject was positive, the person and their contacts were isolated in individual cabins. The infected person then left the vessel to be received in a communal reception centre on the nearest island. RESULTS A total of 9 positive cases were observed, including two before departure (a tourist and a crew member). During the trip, 7 crew members tested positive. The patients and their contacts were isolated and then disembarked at the earliest opportunity. At the time of sampling, the subjects were asymptomatic. The patients and their contacts all became symptomatic within 24 to 48 hours after sampling. CONCLUSIONS In total, the voyage could be completed without any transmission on board among the tourists and with a minimum transmission among the crew members, thus maintaining the tourist and economic activity of the islands during the times of COVID-19 pandemic.","Chatard, Jean-Claude; Le Gac, Jean-Marc; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Vaysse, Philippe; Coulange, Mathieu",International maritime health,6,16

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA LLR is currently limited to few centers and to few procedures. Its reproducibility is still debated. METHODS : Patients undergoing LLR between 1996 and 2008 were included. Indications and type of hepatectomies were compared with those of open resections performed in the same period, considering 3 periods (1996-1999, 2000-2003, and 2004-2008). LLRs were divided into 3 equal groups of 58 cases and technical data and outcomes were compared. Risk-adjusted Cumulative Sum model was used for determining the learning curve based on the need for conversion. RESULTS Of 782, 174 (22.3%) patients underwent LLR. Proportion of LLR progressively increased (17.5%, 22.4%, and 24.2%), such as hepatocellular carcinoma (17.6%, 25.6%, and 39.4%, P < 0.05), colorectal metastases (0%, 6.5%, and 13.1%, P < 0.05), major hepatectomies (1.1%, 9.1%, 8.5%, P < 0.05), and right hepatectomies (0%, 13.2%, and 13.1%, P < 0.05). Comparing groups, results of LLR significantly improved in terms of conversion rate (15.5%, 10.3%, and 3.4%, P < 0.05), operative time (210, 180, and 150 minutes, P < 0.05), blood loss (300, 200, and 200 mL, P < 0.05), and morbidity (17.2%, 22.4%, and 3.4%, P < 0.05). Pedicle clamping was less used over time (77.6%, 62.1%, and 17.2%, P < 0.05) and for shorter durations (45, 30, and 20 minutes, P < 0.05). Having adjusted for case-mix, the Cumulative Sum analysis demonstrated a learning curve for laparoscopic hepatectomies of 60 cases. CONCLUSION A slow but constant evolution of LLR occurred: indications and magnitude of procedures increased and technical outcomes improved. The learning curve demonstrated in this study suggests that LLR is reproducible in liver units but specific training to advanced laparoscopy is required.","Vigano, Luca; Laurent, Alexis; Tayar, Claude; Tomatis, Mariano; Ponti, Antonio; Cherqui, Daniel",Annals of surgery,6,1

RESEARCH QUESTION To analyze the temporal relationship between spatially resolved surface EMG (SEMG) of the gluteal region and the corresponding ground reaction force (GRF). METHODS Healthy adults (29♀; 25♂; age 62.6±7.0 years) walked at their self-selected slow, normal, and fast walking speeds on a 10 m walkway (ten trials/speed). Bilateral paired eight-electrode strips were horizontally aligned at mid-distance of the vertical line between greater trochanter and iliac crest. Concerning the ventral to dorsal direction, the center of each strip was placed on this vertical line. Initially, these signals were monopolarly sampled, but eight vertically oriented bipolar channels covering the whole gluteal region from ventral to dorsal (P1 to P8) were subsequently calculated by subtracting the signals of the corresponding electrodes of each electrode strip for both sides of the body. Three vertical bipolar channels represented the tensor fasciae latae (TFL; P2), gluteus medius (Gmed, SENIAM position; average of P4 and P5), and gluteus maximus muscles (Gmax; P7). To determine the interval between SEMG and corresponding GRF, the time delay (TD) between the respective first amplitude peaks (F1) in SEMG and vertical GRF curves was calculated. RESULTS Throughout the grand averaged SEMG curves, the absolute amplitudes significantly differed among the three walking speeds at all electrode positions, with the amplitude of the F1 peak significantly increasing with increasing speed. In addition, when normalized to slow, the relative SEMG amplitude differences at the individual electrode positions showed an impressively homogeneous pattern. In both vertical GRF and all electrode SEMGs, the F1 peak occurred significantly earlier with increasing speed. Also, the TD between SEMG and vertical GRF F1 peaks significantly decreased with increasing speed. Concerning spatial activation, the TD between the respective F1 peaks in the SEMG and vertical GRF was significantly shorter for the ventral TFL position than the dorsal Gmed and Gmax positions, showing that the SEMG F1 peak during this initial phase of the gait cycle occurred earlier in the dorsal positions, and thus implying that the occurrence of the SEMG F1 peak proceeded from dorsal to ventral. SIGNIFICANCE Tightly regulated spatial and temporal activation of the gluteal intermuscular functional unit, which includes both speed- and position-dependent mechanisms, seems to be an essential requirement for a functionally optimized, steady gait.","Anders, Christoph; Sander, Klaus; Layher, Frank; Patenge, Steffen; Kinne, Raimund W",PloS one,6,12

Digital transformation efforts in the industry rely on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems that are driven by service-based cooperation among humans and digitalized industrial assets. This implies a radical paradigm change in their engineering and operation, which is focused on the symbiosis of digitalized assets and humans that cohabit a collaboration-driven industrial ecosystem. This work discusses how a digital transformation can effectively be achieved in an industrial ecosystem via a digitalization process performed along the three dimensions of the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0, facilitated by the specification, development and implementation of an Asset Administration Shell. The discussion focus is put on humans and how the digitally transformed industrial environments empower her/his capabilities and interactions. It is also critically pointed out how one should go beyond technology and consider additional aspects. Therefore, it is argued that human-centred efforts in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) should be seen in the larger context of sustainability and circular economy in order to properly consider the interplay of the involved socio-technical dimensions.

A certain subset of patients has hypertension resistant to maximal medical therapy and appropriate lifestyle measures. A novel catheter-based technique for renal denervation (RDN) as a new therapeutic avenue has great promise for the treatment of refractory hypertension. SUMMARY This review included the physiology of the renal sympathetic nervous system and the renal nerve anatomy. Furthermore, the RDN procedure, technology systems, and RDN clinical trials as well as findings besides antihypertensive effects were discussed. Findings on safety and efficacy seem to suggest that renal sympathetic denervation could be of therapeutic benefit in refractory hypertensive patients. Despite the fast pace of development in RDN therapies, only initial and very limited clinical data are available. Large gaps in knowledge concerning the long-term effects and consequences of RDN still exist, and solid, randomized data are warranted.","Ariyanon, Wassawon; Mao, Huijuan; Adýbelli, Zelal; Romano, Silvia; Rodighiero, Mariapia; Reimers, Bernhard; La Vecchia, Luigi; Ronco, Claudio",Cardiorenal medicine,6,1

Little research understands the impact of an ASD upon families, how this may change over time and how COVID-19 has impacted these dynamics. AIMS To explore the impact of an ASD on the lived experiences of parents and neurotypical adult siblings, including during the UK COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS Eight parent-sibling dyads (16 individuals) completed semi-structured interviews discussing their family before, during and after receiving the ASD diagnosis, and in relation to the first UK lockdown. Interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS Three super-ordinate themes were identified: Dominated by ASD; Family Cohesion; and the Need for Support. CONCLUSIONS The data suggested a closeness within the families and an adoration towards the individual with ASD (IWA). Dyads were, to an extent, consumed by the diagnosis both presently and in the future, implicating the need for a stretch in services to support parents and neurotypical siblings. In terms of the first UK lockdown, the IWA added an extra layer of difficulty to the dyads work-life balance yet there was an essence of family cohesion. Future research should consider longitudinal methods and explore the impact of ASD co-morbidities upon family dynamics.","Critchley, Emma; Cuadros, Michelle; Harper, Ina; Smith-Howell, Harry; Rogish, Miles",Research in developmental disabilities,6,12

Online multilingual survey consisting of 23 items, between 17 May -15 July of 2019 targeting the opinions and practices of ICTs regarding the 2018-2019 influenza season was employed. Participants were reached via European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Union Certificate for Infection Control (EUCIC) newsletters,social media, and national societies. In total, 899 participants from 56 countries responded to the survey. The overall vaccination rate was 76%, being the highest in Finland, Portugal, Norway, and Israel (100%), whereas the lowest in Italy (68%) and Turkey (39%). Influenza vaccination rate was 86% among IC physicians and 52% among IC nurses. The most significant factors affecting participants' decision were personal influenza vaccine experience (49%) and attitude of the scientific authorities (48%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination of the ICT head (OR: 16.04, 95%CI: 8.4-30.8, p < 0.001) and having free vaccine (OR: 7.56, 95%CI: 2.1-27.4, p = 0.02) were found to be the strongest predictors for influenza vaccination, whereas working in Turkey (OR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.22-0.77, p = 0.006) and being an IC nurse (OR:0.43, 95%CI: 0.24-0.80, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with not having been vaccinated. In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic increased the importance of protection against respiratory viruses including influenza. Vaccination strategies should have a special emphasis on IC nurses, who have a relatively lower vaccination rate, should enhance the vaccination of the ICT leaders, and put effort to provide free availability of the influenza vaccine.","Keske, Şiran; Mutters, Nico T; Tsioutis, Constantinos; Ergönül, Önder",Vaccine,6,26

We evaluated the reliability and validity of a newly developed tool to assess the technical performance of reusable duodenoscopes. METHODS An assessment tool was developed to measure duodenoscope performance based on three distinct criteria: maneuverability, mechanical/imaging characteristics and ability to perform requisite interventions. The assessment tool was tested prospectively on duodenoscopes used in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures at 9 academic medical centers over a 6-month period. The main outcome was reliability of the duodenoscope assessment tool, which was estimated using Cronbach's coefficient alpha (α). The secondary outcome was validity of the assessment tool. RESULTS The assessment tool evaluated technical performance of reusable duodenoscopes in 1,080 ERCP procedures. Indications were biliary in 92.8% and pancreatic in 7.2% procedures. The overall Cronbach's coefficient α for maneuverability was 0.81, assessment of mechanical/imaging characteristics was 0.92, and ability to perform requisite interventions was 0.87. On multiple linear regression analysis, prolonged procedure duration, older patient age and pancreatic interventions were significantly positively associated with higher (worse) scores.

In addition to the two main Ras-driven signaling pathways, i.e., the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, we have also collected emerging data showing the importance of Ras in other signaling pathways, including the RAC/PAK, RalGDS/Ral, and PKC/PLC signaling pathways. Moreover, microRNA-regulated Ras-associated signaling pathways are also discussed to highlight the importance of Ras regulation in cancer. Finally, emerging data show that the signal alterations in specific cell types, such as cancer stem cells, could promote cancer development. Therefore, we also cover the up-to-date findings related to Ras-regulated signal transduction in cancer stem cells.","Takács, Tamás; Kudlik, Gyöngyi; Kurilla, Anita; Szeder, Bálint; Buday, László; Vas, Virag",Cancer metastasis reviews,6,1

We describe the technique and clinical course of patients undergoing endoscopic CSF leak repair in an actively infected field. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic CSF leak repair in an actively infected field. METHODS Retrospective chart review of patients with sinonasal CSF leaks that were endoscopically repaired during an acute infection. RESULTS Nine patients were identified. Etiologies of CSF leak were iatrogenic after endoscopic sinus surgery (n = 5, 55.6%) or revision craniopharyngioma resection (n = 1, 11.1%), spontaneous (n = 1, 11.1%), anterior skull base meningocele with CSF leak (n = 1, 11.1%), and posttraumatic (n = 1, 11.1%). The locations of the leaks were ethmoid in five patients, frontoethmoid in three patients, and sphenoid in three patients. Seven patients had acute sinusitis (77.8%) and two patients had meningitis (22.2%) at the time of closure. Two patients (22.2%) had failure of previous CSF leak closure. All leaks were repaired in a multilayered fashion with multiple graft types, including septal or conchal cartilage, temporalis fascia, fascia lata, fat, Medpor, and tissue sealant. Three patients additionally had mucosal flaps or grafts. The patients were treated with an average of 11.1 days (range, 6-14 days) of antibiotics. The average hospital stay was 4.1 days (range, 2-7 days), and the mean follow-up time was 8.7 months (range, 2.9-19.3 months). No patients experienced recurrence of CSF leak or postoperative complication or infection. CONCLUSION Endoscopic closure of skull base defects was successfully performed in nine patients during acute infections without complications, recurrent infection, or need for revision CSF leak closure. Endoscopic CSF leak repair appears to be safe and effective in patients with active infection with sinusitis or meningitis.","Hsu, Amy K; Singh, Ameet; Bury, Sean; Schwartz, Theodore H; Anand, Vijay K; Kacker, Ashutosh",American journal of rhinology & allergy,6,5

Meniscus allograft transplantation for patients immediately after meniscectomy has not been reported. HYPOTHESIS Compared with the conventional delayed MAT, immediate MAT might provide better clinical results and reduce joint degeneration. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS The study was performed with 18 transplanted menisci (6 medial, 12 lateral) from 16 patients. Eight menisci were transplanted immediately after meniscectomy (IM group); 10 menisci, from patients who complained of knee symptoms at a mean time of 35 months (range, 9-92 months) after total meniscectomy, underwent delayed transplantation (DE group). Fourteen patients undergoing meniscectomy during the same period were included as controls (ME group). Degenerative changes in knee joints were evaluated by plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Allograft extrusion and relative percentage of extrusion were measured on MRI. Other outcome assessments included preoperative and postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm scores; visual analog scale (VAS) for pain; and range of motion and isokinetic muscle strength evaluation. RESULTS The mean length of follow-up was 50.8 months (range, 44-62 months) for the IM group, 72.0 months (range, 44-94 months) for the DE group, and 54.3 months (range, 45-62 months) for the ME group. A statistically significant difference in favor of the IM and ME groups was found on the VAS (0.4 [IM group] vs 1.1 [ME group] vs 2.5 [DE group]) and muscle strength (P < .05). The mean IKDC score in the IM group was significantly higher than that in the DE group (93 [range, 85-99] vs 74 [range, 38-95], respectively; P < .05). The IM group showed significantly less preoperative to postoperative cartilage degeneration changes on radiographs and MRI when compared with the DE and ME groups (Kellgren-Lawrence score changes: 0.25 [IM group] vs 1.0 [DE group] vs 1.7 [ME group]; Yulish score changes: 0.25 [IM group] vs 1.0 [DE group] vs 1.1 [ME group]; P < .05). Extrusion of the allograft was observed in the body of the menisci in all patients. No significant difference was found in terms of the Lysholm score, Tegner score, joint narrowing, or meniscus extrusion (P > .05). CONCLUSION Compared with delayed MAT, immediate MAT led to more satisfactory subjective results, less joint degeneration, and less muscle strength deficits. The short-term results of delayed meniscus transplantation were close to those of meniscectomy.","Jiang, Dong; Ao, Ying-Fang; Gong, Xi; Wang, Yong-Jian; Zheng, Zhuo-Zhao; Yu, Jia-Kuo",The American journal of sports medicine,6,16

Cytoplasmic viral RNA is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, which trigger type I interferon (IFN) production. Secreted type I IFN activates ubiquitously expressed type I IFN receptor and induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To suppress viral replication, several nucleases degrade viral RNA. RNase L is an ISG with endonuclease activity that degrades viral RNA, producing small RNA that activates RIG-I, resulting in the amplification of type I IFN production. Moreover, recent studies have elucidated novel links between viral RNA recognition and degradation. The RNA exosome is a protein complex that includes nucleases and is essential for host and viral RNA decay. Although the small RNAs produced by the RNA exosome do not activate RIG-I, several accessory factors of the RNA exosome promote RIG-I activation. Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an accessory factor that recognizes viral RNA and promotes viral RNA degradation via the RNA exosome. ZAPS is an alternative splicing form of ZAP and promotes RIG-I oligomerization and ATPase activity, resulting in RIG-I activation. DDX60 is another cofactor involved in the viral RNA degradation via the RNA exosome. The DDX60 protein promotes RIG-I signaling in a cell-type specific manner. These observations imply that viral RNA degradation and recognition are linked to each other. In this review, I discuss the links between recognition and degradation of viral RNA.","Oshiumi, Hiroyuki; Mifsud, Edin J; Daito, Takuji",Reviews in medical virology,6,6

OBJECTIVES To analyze the relationships between D-dimer concentration, VTE and bleeding in the MAGELLAN trial (NCT00571649). PATIENTS/METHODS This was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients aged ≥ 40 years, hospitalized for acute medical illnesses with risk factors for VTE received subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 10 ± 4 days then placebo up to day 35, or oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 35 ± 4 days. Patients (n = 7581) were grouped by baseline D-dimer ≤ 2 × or > 2 × the upper limit of normal. VTE and major plus non-major clinically relevant bleeding were recorded at day 10, day 35, and between days 11 and 35. RESULTS The frequency of VTE was 3.5-fold greater in patients with high D-dimer concentrations. Multivariate analysis showed that D-dimer was an independent predictor of the risk of VTE (odds ratio 2.29 [95% confidence interval 1.75-2.98]), and had a similar association to established risk factors for VTE, for example cancer and advanced age. In the high D-dimer group, rivaroxaban was non-inferior to enoxaparin at day 10 and, unlike the low D-dimer group, superior to placebo at day 35 (P < 0.001) and days 11-35 (P < 0.001). In both groups, bleeding outcomes favored enoxaparin/placebo. CONCLUSIONS Elevated baseline D-dimer concentrations may identify acutely ill, hospitalized medical patients at high risk of VTE for whom extended anticoagulant prophylaxis may provide greater benefit than for those with low D-dimer concentrations.","Cohen, A T; Spiro, T E; Spyropoulos, A C; Desanctis, Y H; Homering, M; Büller, H R; Haskell, L; Hu, D; Hull, R; Mebazaa, A; Merli, G; Schellong, S; Tapson, V F; Burton, P",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,6,5

At the same time, school closures forced children to rearrange their lives and learning processes: in Italy, schools and nurseries were closed for four months, and the incidence and quality of distance learning activities was heterogeneous across education levels and among schools. Using real-time survey data on families with under-16 children collected in April 2020, which include information on parents' market and household work, and their perception of their children's wellbeing, we estimate how the lockdown has affected children's use of time, their emotional status and their home learning, and whether the reallocation of intrahousehold responsibilities during the lockdown played a role in this process. Changes in the parental division of household tasks and childcare, mostly induced by the labor market restrictions imposed during the lockdown, point to a greater involvement of fathers in childcare and homeschooling activities. This positive variation in fathers' involvement is accompanied by an increase in children's emotional wellbeing and by a reduction in TV and passive screen time. On the other hand, the quality of children's home learning does not appear to depend on which parent is overseeing their work, but rather on the type of distance learning activities proposed by their teachers.","Mangiavacchi, Lucia; Piccoli, Luca; Pieroni, Luca",Economics and human biology,6,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve pigs were divided into six study groups, of two pigs each. Four pigs were embolized with iodized oil alone and four with radiopaque microspheres; two animals in each group were sacrificed at 2 hours and two at 7 days. Two pigs were embolized with radiopaque microspheres and heparin and sacrificed at 7 days. Two pigs were embolized with standard microspheres and sacrificed at 2 hours. CT was performed before and after segmental embolization and before sacrifice at 7 days. The distribution of embolic agent, inflammatory response and tissue necrosis were assessed histopathologically. RESULTS Radiopaque microspheres and iodized oil were visible on standard CT 2 hours and 7 days after embolization, showing qualitatively comparable arterial and parenchymal enhancement. Quantitatively, the enhancement was more intense for iodized oil. Standard microspheres, delivered without contrast, were not visible by imaging. Radiopaque and standard microspheres similarly occluded subsegmental and interlobular arteries and, to a lesser extent, sinusoids. Iodized oil resulted in the deepest penetration into sinusoids. Necrosis was always observed after embolization with microspheres, but never after embolization with iodized oil. The inflammatory response was mild to moderate for microspheres and moderate to severe for iodized oil. CONCLUSION Radiopaque 40μm-microspheres are visible on standard CT with qualitatively similar but quantitatively less intense enhancement compared to iodized oil, and with a tendency towards less of an inflammatory reaction than iodized oil.

141269,141269,141269,Time for a neonatal-specific consensus definition for sepsis.,19.76234,11.1717825,2014,"SEIR model is a widely used and acceptable model to distinguish the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries. In the current work, a new proposed SEIR model as a mathematical model for the outbreak of novel coronaviruses COVID-19 will be constructed. The new proposed SEIR pandemic model provides a new vision for evaluations and management of the epidemic of COVID-19 infection. For mathematical modeling and dynamic analyses, this paper uses the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The dynamics of the proposed SEIR model are presented with the reproduction number and the extensive stability analysis. We discussed the domain of the solution and equilibrium situation based on the proposed SEIR model by using Jacobian's method of linearization. The condition of equilibrium and its uniqueness has been proved, and the stability analysis of disease-free equilibrium has been introduced. A sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number against its internal parameters has been done. The global stability of the equilibrium of this model has been proved by using Lyapunov's Stability theorem. A numerical verification and predictions of the proposed SEIR model have been made with comparing the results based on the SEIR model and the real data due to the spreading of the COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The proposed SEIR model is a successful model to analyze the spreading of epidemics like COVID-19. This work introduces the ideal protocol, which can help the Saudi population to breakdown spreading COVID-19 in a fast way.","Youssef, Hamdy M; Alghamdi, Najat A; Ezzat, Magdy A; El-Bary, Alaa A; Shawky, Ahmed M",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,6,4

Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors. METHODS One hundred nine brain-tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared. RESULTS Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (ρ = 0.87, P < .05 and ρ = 0.86, P < .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (ρ = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval of ±0.47. CONCLUSION Realistic rCBV maps can be synthesized from DCE MRI and contain quantitative information, enabling robust brain-tumor perfusion imaging of DSC and DCE parameters with a single gadolinium-based contrast agent administration.","Sanders, Jeremiah W; Chen, Henry Szu-Meng; Johnson, Jason M; Schomer, Donald F; Jimenez, Jorge E; Ma, Jingfei; Liu, Ho-Ling",Magnetic resonance in medicine,6,1

Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage can potentially reduce this and, therefore, the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. New evidence on subglottic secretion drainage as a preventive measure for ventilator-associated pneumonia has been recently published and to consider the evidence in totality, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. DESIGN We searched computerized databases, reference lists, and personal files. We included randomized clinical trials of mechanically ventilated patients comparing standard endotracheal tubes to those with subglottic secretion drainage and reporting on the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Studies were meta-analyzed for the primary outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia and secondary clinical outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified 13 randomized clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 2442 randomized patients. Of the 13 studies, 12 reported a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia rates in the subglottic secretion drainage arm; in meta-analysis, the overall risk ratio for ventilator-associated pneumonia was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.66; p < .00001) with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). The use of subglottic secretion drainage was associated with reduced intensive care unit length of stay (-1.52 days; 95% confidence interval, -2.94 to -0.11; p = .03); decreased duration of mechanically ventilated (-1.08 days; 95% confidence interval, -2.04 to -0.12; p = .03), and increased time to first episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.66 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.26; p = .001). There was no effect on adverse events or on hospital or intensive care unit mortality. CONCLUSIONS In those at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, the use of endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage is effective for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and may be associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay.","Muscedere, John; Rewa, Oleksa; McKechnie, Kyle; Jiang, Xuran; Laporta, Denny; Heyland, Daren K",Critical care medicine,6,6

DESIGN Case-control, observational study. SETTING Tertiary teaching hospital in Lagos, Nigeria (March 2006 to March 2008). PARTICIPANTS Children aged 3-192 months with uncorrected symptomatic CHD and healthy controls, frequency matched for age and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of malnutrition based on WHO/National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention z score ≤-2; weight for age, weight for height/length and height for age; proportions of underweight, wasting and stunting in cases and controls, and in acyanotic and cyanotic CHD; and predictors of malnutrition using multivariate logistic analysis. RESULTS 90.4% of cases and 21.1% of controls had malnutrition (p=0.0001), and 61.2% and 2.6%, respectively, had severe malnutrition (p=0.0001). Wasting, stunting and underweight were identified in 41.1%, 28.8% and 20.5%, and 2.6%, 3.9% and 14.5% of cases and controls, respectively. Wasting was significantly higher (58.3%) in acyanotic CHD (p=0.0001), and stunting (68.0%) in cyanotic CHD (p=0.0001). Age at weaning was significantly lower in cases than controls (3.24±0.88 and 7.04±3.04 months, respectively; p=0.0001) and in acyanotic than cyanotic CHD (2.14±0.33 and 5.33±1.22 months, respectively; p=0.004). Predictors of malnutrition in CHD were anaemia, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (CHF), poor dietary intake of fat and prolonged unoperated disease. CONCLUSION Severe malnutrition in association with anaemia and moderate to severe CHF is highly prevalent in CHD preoperatively in these children. Early weaning may be a marker of feeding difficulties in heart failure.","Okoromah, Christy A N; Ekure, Ekanem N; Lesi, Foluso E A; Okunowo, Wahab O; Tijani, Bolande O; Okeiyi, Jonathan C",Archives of disease in childhood,6,16

Inferior lumbar hernias are extremely rare and, therefore, are associated with diagnostic difficulty. We present a case of a primary spontaneous inferior lumbar hernia in a 79-year-old woman that was initially diagnosed as a large lipoma on ultrasound. The first operation was abandoned and an open mesh repair was conducted. Lumbar hernias can be primary acquired (55%), secondary acquired (25%) or congenital (20%). Cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI appears to be the gold standard in diagnosis as ultrasound may lead to misdiagnosis. Strangulation, incarceration and obstruction are recognised complications, requiring prompt surgical intervention. There are currently no guidelines for surgical managements, although laparoscopic surgery may give the best results. In view of the scarcity of published cases, we aim to add to the literature to raise the index of suspicion and to promote prompt surgical management of lumbar hernias.","Kadler, B; Shetye, A; Patten, D K; Al-Nowfal, A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,6,19

DATA SOURCES Three online databases were searched for original research. STUDY SELECTION Intervention studies were included that used outcome measures of impairment, activity, and/or participation. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently screened 2287 titles and abstracts, reviewed 101 full texts, extracted data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias for 9 included studies. DATA SYNTHESIS All included studies were randomized controlled trials involving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with inpatient individuals with stroke and sleep apnea. Several studies also included long-term outpatient follow-ups. Results in terms of outcomes based on impairment, activity, and participation were mixed. However, several studies found that the use of CPAP following stroke and sleep apnea during early stroke recovery had benefits relative to no CPAP. CONCLUSIONS The only nonpharmacological intervention to be administered during sleep in a neurological population to improve physical rehabilitation outcomes was found to be CPAP. This review was complicated by the variety of outcome measures used, lack of physical rehabilitation description, and CPAP compliance. In general, participants who had acceptable to good CPAP compliance saw the largest improvements in physical rehabilitation outcomes. Several other promising methods of brain stimulation during sleep are discussed.","Johnson, Brian P; Shipper, Andrea G; Westlake, Kelly P",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,6,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical and radiologic data of all consecutive patients treated at our institution from September 2012 to October 2013 for an intracranial aneurysm by using a LEO Baby stent were retrospectively analyzed. Immediate and midterm clinical and anatomic follow-up of each patient is reported. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with 29 aneurysms were treated with LEO Baby stents at our institution. The mean age of patients was 48 years; 20 patients were women (71%). One patient was treated in the acute phase of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 8 procedures, a double-lumen-catheter balloon was used for balloon-then-stent-assisted coiling. In 3 cases, a LEO Baby stent was used in a Y-, T-, and telescopic dual-stent configuration. In 18 cases, a single LEO Baby stent was used. In 2 cases, technical failure to deploy the stent resulted in acute parent artery thrombosis. In 3 further cases, thromboembolic complications occurred intraoperatively. MR imaging and angiographic midterm follow-up showed complete aneurysm occlusion for 96% of the followed patients (27/29). Clinical outcome was favorable for all patients followed up. CONCLUSIONS Results obtained in our study by using the LEO Baby stent for balloon-then-stent and single- or dual-stent-assisted coiling of complex and distally located intracranial aneurysms are encouraging. Incomplete or inadequate opening of the device is a potential cause of laminar blood flow alteration and thrombus formation.","Machi, P; Costalat, V; Lobotesis, K; Ruiz, C; Cheikh, Y B; Eker, O; Gascou, G; Danière, F; Riquelme, C; Bonafé, A",AJNR.

Materials and Methods A total of 24 previously untreated LAHNC patients were randomized into SIB (n= 11) and SEQB (n = 13) arms. The planning computed tomography data set was transferred to the treatment planning system. All the target volumes and organ at risk volumes were delineated. Single plan for SIB group and three plans (three phases) were generated for SEQB group of patients. Radiobiological and dosimetric parameters were compared. Results The BED10(planned) value for high-risk (HR) planning target volume (PTV) was same in both groups, whereas for intermediate-risk (IR) PTV and low-risk (LR) PTV, the values were higher in SEQB arm than SIB arm. The V95 values were 100% for all the target volumes in both arms of patients. The average D100 value for gross target volume, HR PTV, and IR PTV was higher in SEQB arm than that in the SIB arm. The average D100 value for LR PTV was higher in the SIB arm compared to that of the SEQB arm. The BED10(achieved) was calculated using D100 values of target volumes. The difference of BED10(achieved) values between SEQB arm and SIB arm further increased than the BED10(planned) values for all target volumes. The maximum doses for spinal cord, spinal cord planning risk volume, and brain stem were within the tolerance dose in both groups of patients. The left and right parotid glands sparing was comparable in both groups of patients. Average integral dose was higher in the SIB group than SEQB group. The average total monitor unit per fraction was higher in the SEQB arm than that in the SIB arm. Conclusion SIB regimen may be considered as more logical and efficient over SEQB regimen in the treatment of LAHNC with comparable radiobiological and dosimetric parameters.","Mandal, Abhijit; Choudhary, Sunil; Mani, Nilesh; Aggarwal, Sushil Kumar",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,6,16

The aim of this review was to summarize the information about environmental disinfection for preventing of COVID-19. We performed a review of the science direct database to find articles providing information on disinfection used for SARS-CoV-2. The extracted results were given the original data on inactivation coronaviruses by disinfectants in different places of health care facilities. The final search recognized that five groups of disinfectants include: chlorine containing disinfectants, alcohol, UV irradiation, Hydrogen peroxide, and other disinfectant were used against SARS-CoV-2 in different environments. Among these groups, bleach (chlorine containing disinfectants) has the most applicability. Also, in many studies by using disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol can reduce coronavirus in contaminated areas. Furthermore, after the using of operating room for COVID-19 patients, hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation should be used for 24 h before it can be used again. The povidone-iodine or the chlorhexidine, could be recommended when there is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination especially for open wounds. According to the different studies on SARS-CoV-2 disinfection, because of the SARS-CoV-2 can remain in the air and on surfaces, as well as observing individual disinfection guidelines in different hospital areas, disinfection of surfaces is necessary to decrease SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Moreover, the most suggested disinfectants have been limited to bleach and alcohol, it's better to be considered the potential of other disinfectants in different areas.","Sharafi, Seyedeh Maryam; Ebrahimpour, Karim; Nafez, Amirhossein",Reviews on environmental health,6,1

Introduction: Migraine is a common neurological disorder. The prevalence of migraines increases with age from adolescence to adulthood in both sexes, and results in a substantial loss of productivity due to missing days of school or work and need for bed rest. Literature prior to 2015 suggests that migraine is a predictor of suicide. Given the worldwide public health interest in suicide prevention, we examined the literature collected from diverse, predominantly non-European, populations post-2015. Methods: The databases used in this systematic review included: Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE (Ovid), Science Direct (Elsevier), Cochrane, and PubMed for all available years of publication from January 2015 onwards. The review included participants aged 16 and over who had been diagnosed with migraines with the following outcome variables: any suicidality, both fatal and non-fatal; suicidal ideation; and suicidal behavior. Results: The database searches yielded a total of 542 citations. Following title and abstract screening, 460 articles were excluded and a total of 21 citations were evaluated. After full-text review and excluding a further 11 non-eligible studies, a total of 10 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Conclusions: Current existing research highlights the important association between the increased risk of suicidal behaviors in the clinical and general population among chronic migraineurs with/without aura worldwide. Future studies are needed to facilitate the development of clinical guidelines for risk assessment, targeted interventions, and evidence-based treatment of migraine to reduce the risk of suicide among this vulnerable population.","Karimi, Leila; Hoppe, Dimi; Burdick, Christine; Buultjens, Melissa; Wijeratne, Tissa; Crewther, Sheila G",Frontiers in neurology,6,2

As such, there is an urgent need to inform clinicians on the availability of efficacious and effective telehealth interventions for childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Objectives: This review was informed by the following clinical question: Is providing intervention remotely through telehealth as efficacious and effective as in-person therapy for treating CAS? Methods, eligibility criteria, and sources of evidence: Eight databases and seven search engines were searched for articles to identify intervention studies that have investigated the efficacy and/or effectiveness of treating CAS remotely. Search criteria was restricted to papers with children under 18 years of age, published in the English language between 1993 and 2020. Results: Two studies were found to meet our inclusion criteria. A phase I study employed a multiple baseline across participants design to investigate the efficacy of the Rapid Syllable Transition treatment via telehealth. The second study assessed the feasibility of adopting a novel system for the remote administration of the Nuffield Dyspraxia Program-Third Edition. Based on the Oxford hierarchy Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, both studies are level IV (case-series/case-control), and therefore deemed low level evidence. Results showed limited but promising outcomes when CAS therapy is conducted remotely. Conclusion: There is limited, low-level evidence indicating positive outcomes for the remote treatment of CAS via telehealth.

We have applied serial-thin sectioning and stereology to quantitatively characterize the three-dimensional organization of ER export sites in vivo and in vitro. We find that ER buds in vivo are nonrandomly distributed, being concentrated in regional foci we refer to as export complexes. The basic organization of an export complex can be divided into an active COPII-containing budding zone on a single ER cisterna, which is adjacent to budding zones found on distantly connected ER cisternae. These budding foci surround and face a central cluster of morphologically independent vesicular-tubular elements that contain COPI coats involved in retrograde transport. Vesicles within these export complexes contain concentrated cargo molecules. The structure of vesicular-tubular clusters in export complexes is particularly striking in replicas generated using a quick-freeze, deep-etch approach to visualize for the first time their three-dimensional organization and cargo composition. We conclude that budding from the ER through recruitment of COPII is confined to highly specialized export complexes that topologically restrict anterograde transport to regional foci to facilitate efficient coupling to retrograde recycling by COPI.",,J Cell Biol,6,9

In step 2, haziness or pneumonic consolidation on chest radiographs and low lymphocyte and platelet counts, in addition to a positive contact history and fever were associated with a higher probability of SARS. A high neutrophil count, the extremes of age, and sputum production were associated with a lower probability of SARS. In the derivation sample, the observed incidence of SARS was 4.4% for those assigned to the low-risk group (in steps 1 or 2); in the high-risk group, incidence of SARS was 21.0% for quartile 1, 39.5% for quartile 2, 61.2% for quartile 3, and 79.7% for quartile 4. This prediction rule achieved an optimism-corrected sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.62, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.85. LIMITATIONS The prediction rule may not apply to isolated cases occurring during an interepidemic period. Generalizability of the findings should be confirmed in other SARS-affected countries and should be prospectively validated if SARS returns. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that a simple model that uses clinical data at the time of presentation to an emergency department during an acute outbreak predicted the incidence of SARS and provided good diagnostic utility.","Leung, Gabriel M; Rainer, Timothy H; Lau, Fei-Lung; Wong, Irene O L; Tong, Anna; Wong, Tai-Wai; Kong, James H B; Hedley, Anthony J; Lam, Tai-Hing",Annals of internal medicine,6,26

This pilot trial assessed the feasibility of performing a similar study of outcome in patients over the age of 70 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Patients over the age of 70 years undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty or bowel resection surgery were randomly assigned to have cerebral oximetry values monitored (intervention group) or not monitored (control) while under general anaesthesia. Indicators of proof of concept were: rate of complications, rate of cerebral desaturation, relationship between cerebral desaturation and complications, and anaesthetist response to cerebral desaturation. Forty patients were recruited and randomised to a control group (n=20) or an intervention group (n=20). The proportion of the study population who had a complication was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% to 55%). Cerebral desaturation (<75% of baseline) occurred in only two patients (5.0% (CI 1.4% to 16%)), one in each group, and neither of those patients recorded a complication. Changes to anaesthetic management on the basis of cerebral oximetry values occurred in only two patients in the intervention group (10% (CI 2.8% to 30%)). Maintenance of cerebral oximetry values appeared to be closer to baseline in the intervention group than in the control group but this difference was not significant (P=0.15). Our results indicated that complications occurred frequently in the study population but did not appear to be associated with cerebral desaturation events. These findings do not support a larger intervention study using the current study population.","Cowie, D A; Nazareth, J; Story, D A",Anaesthesia and intensive care,6,4

This review focuses on currently used molecular diagnostic techniques for various types of pneumonia and highlights potential future applications of this technology. RECENT FINDINGS Lower respiratory tract infections result in a high degree of morbidity and mortality, but a definitive microbiologic diagnosis is often not obtained by traditional culture or serologic methods. In addition, culture of certain organisms may be difficult or require extended periods of time. Molecular techniques have the potential to improve diagnostic yield and decrease time to pathogen identification. These techniques are also helpful in the determination of drug sensitivity and the understanding of transmission and outbreaks. Most currently used techniques employ some variation of the polymerase chain reaction. Limitations include high costs, the need for specialized equipment, and problems with false-positive and -negative results. SUMMARY Molecular diagnosis of pneumonia has the potential to improve identification of pathogens in patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection. Limitations of molecular techniques currently prevent their widespread use, but future developments will likely lead to inclusion of these tests in routine diagnostic evaluations.","Chan, Yvonne R; Morris, Alison",Current opinion in infectious diseases,6,1

Recently, dipeptidyle peptidase (CD26, DPP4) was identified as the host cell receptor for MERS-CoV. Interestingly, despite of common presence of DPP4 receptors the binding and infection of various cells shows imminent variability. In this report, we provide a tool for prediction of the host tropism of the virus based on the host receptor binding interface. We found out that, in the binding of MERS-CoV to cells the amino acid residues in lancets 4 and 5 of DPP4 receptor, namely K267, Q286, T288, R317, R336, Q344 A291, L294, and I295 are involved. Changes in these residues correspond to profound decrease in virus binding to cells. The nine residues at the interface between the virus spikes and the lancets 4 and 5 of host DPP4 can be used as a predictive tool for the host tropism and virus affinity to host cell receptors.","Kandeel, M; Elaiziz, M A; Kandeel, A; Altaher, A A; Kitade, Y",Acta virologica,6,0

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (n=127). Materials and Methods This prospective study was conducted on all COVID-19-suspected cases, admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital (a designated hospital for COVID-19), Tehran, Iran, since February 19, 2020. All patients were tested for COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Data of confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes, were collected and compared between three groups of patients, requiring different types of admission (requiring ICU admission, admission to the general ward, and transfer to ICU). Results Of 412 suspected cases, with the mean age of 54.1 years (SD=13.4), 127 (31%) were positive for COVID-19. Following the patients' first visit to the clinic, 115 cases were admitted to the general ward, while ten patients required ICU admission. Due to clinical deterioration in the condition of 25 patients (out of 115 patients), ICU admission was essential. Based on the results, the baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Patients requiring ICU admission were more likely to have multiorgan involvement (liver involvement, P<0.001; renal involvement, P<0.001; and cardiac involvement, P=0.02), low O2 saturation (P<0.001), and lymphopenia (P=0.05). During hospital admission, 21 (16.5%) patients died, while the rest (83.5%) were discharged and followed-up until March 26, 2020. Also, the survival rate of patients, who received immunoglobulin, was higher than other patients (60.87% vs. 39.13%). Conclusion The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was considerable in our study. Based on the present results, this infection can cause multiorgan damage. Therefore, intensive monitoring of these patients needs to be considered.","Baghaei, Parvaneh; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Marjani, Majid; Moniri, Afshin; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammadreza; Sheikhzade, Hakimeh; Abtahian, Zahra; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Abedini, Atefeh; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Mansourafshar, Babak; Ahmadi, Zargham Hossein; Mokhber Dezfuli, Mojtaba; Seifi, Sharareh; Sadeghi, Mohsen; Mirenayat, Maryam Sadat; Yassari, Fatemeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh; Farzanegan, Behrooz; Kiani, Arda; Vasheghani, Maryam; Dastan, Farzaneh; Eslaminejad, Alireza; Malekmohammad, Majid; Varahram, Mohammad; Zali, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Velayati, Ali Akbar",Tanaffos,6,24

Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease on March 11, 2020 and characterized by fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. The virus has spread to at least 213 countries and more than 9093827 confirmed cases and 471490 deaths have been recorded. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. There are some newly developed and promising methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2, in order to facilitate the development of novel approaches for early diagnosis. Nucleic acid based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection and confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most popular and the ""gold standard"" testing method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The present study was carried out to detect 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by rRT-PCR method at Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from 1st April, 2020 to 31st May, 2020. A total of 14356 samples were tested from four districts of Mymensingh division namely, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Netrokona and some parts of Sunamganj for rRT-PCR. Among them 1086 (7.5%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Out of 1086 positive cases 716(65.9%) were male and 370(34.1%) were female with a Mean±SD age 34.1±12 years. Maximum positivity was found in Mymensingh district followed by Netrokona, Jamalpur, Sherpur and Sunamganj respectively. This is the first base line study for genetic detection of 2019-nCoV in Mymensingh division which may reflect the total scenario of Bangladesh situation.

The possible predisposing and perpetuating factors in developing mental symptoms were investigated. METHODS Participantsconsisted of 135 health care workers who had had contact with or took care of patients who were probable or suspected SARS cases, during the SARS outbreak, at a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. All participants completed questionnaires, including the Chinese Health Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and Parental Bonding Instrument. RESULTS Twenty-two participants (17.3%) developed significant mental symptoms, and 105 participants (82.7%) showed no obvious symptoms. The structural equation model showed that maternal care (beta = -0.18, p = 0.011) and neuroticism (beta = 0.54, p < 10(-6)) directly influenced the ability of health care workers to deal with the impact of SARS. Maternal overprotection (beta = 0.30, p < 10(-4)) had an indirect influence on the ability to cope with the impact of SARS. CONCLUSION Both neuroticism and maternal attachment influenced the mental health of health care workers during the SARS epidemic. The results can be a helpful reference for intervention and prevention programs for health care workers facing disasters in the future.","Lu, Yi-Ching; Shu, Bih-Ching; Chang, Yong-Yuan; Lung, For-Wey",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,6,1

Diseases with k = 1 are Ebola hemorrhagic fever, avian influenza H5N1, cholera, and hand, foot, and mouth disease; those with k > 1 are the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic in countries other than Mexico and the SARS epidemic in some countries; and those with k < 1 include the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic in Mexico. Epidemics with k > 1 can be simulated by postulating two subpopulations (normal population [NP] and vulnerable population [VP]), where the epidemic proceeds at higher speed and at higher mortality in VP than in NP. Epidemics with k < 1 can be simulated by postulating coexisting high virulence virus (HVV) and low virulence virus (LVV), with the former being propagated at slower speed and with a higher mortality rate than the latter. An epidemic with k > 1 was simulated using parameters that are fractions of subpopulations NP or VP from the total population (f) and NP- or VP-specific patient multiplication (M) and mortality (D) rates.

In addition, networks underlying infection events are often much more complex than described by meanfield equations or regular lattices. In models with simple transition rules such as the SIS and SIR models, heterogeneous contact rates are known to decrease epidemic thresholds. We analyse steady states of various multi-state disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with competing pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small infection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to heterogeneity in contact rates. Furthermore, models without spontaneous neighbor-independent state transitions, such as cyclically competing species, do not show heterogeneity effects.","Masuda, Naoki; Konno, Norio",Journal of theoretical biology,6,16

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.","Thakur, Kiran T; Miller, Emily Happy; Glendinning, Michael D; Al-Dalahmah, Osama; Banu, Matei A; Boehme, Amelia K; Boubour, Alexandra L; Bruce, Samuel S; Chong, Alexander M; Claassen, Jan; Faust, Phyllis L; Hargus, Gunnar; Hickman, Richard A; Jambawalikar, Sachin; Khandji, Alexander G; Kim, Carla Y; Klein, Robyn S; Lignelli-Dipple, Angela; Lin, Chun-Chieh; Liu, Yang; Miller, Michael L; Moonis, Gul; Nordvig, Anna S; Overdevest, Jonathan B; Prust, Morgan L; Przedborski, Serge; Roth, William H; Soung, Allison; Tanji, Kurenai; Teich, Andrew F; Agalliu, Dritan; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Goldman, James E; Canoll, Peter",Brain,6,12

A key public health strategy for controling measles in such high-burden settings is to conduct supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in the form of mass vaccination campaigns, in addition to delivering scheduled vaccination through routine immunization (RI) programs. To achieve balanced implementations of RI and SIAs, robust measurement of sub-national RI-specific coverage is crucial. In this paper, we develop a space-time smoothing model for estimating RI-specific coverage of the first dose of measles-containing-vaccines (MCV1) at sub-national level using complex survey data. The application that motivated this work is estimation of the RI-specific MCV1 coverage in Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Data come from four Demographic and Health Surveys, three Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and two National Nutrition and Health Surveys conducted in Nigeria between 2003 and 2018. Our method incorporates information from the SIA calendar published by the World Health Organization and accounts for the impact of SIAs on the overall MCV1 coverage, as measured by cross-sectional surveys. The model can be used to analyze data from multiple surveys with different data collection schemes and construct coverage estimates with uncertainty that reflects the various sampling designs. Implementation of our method can be done efficiently using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).","Dong, Tracy Qi; Wakefield, Jon",,6,12

Effective therapies are still awaited due to the lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Bearing recent research and clinical observations in mind, the authors propose a novel physiological mechanism of COVID-19 and explain development of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 related hemoglobinopathy. It is a consistent observation that the radiological picture of COVID-19 related ARDS bears more resemblance to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) than typical ARDS. There has been great controversy regarding this proposed similarity. The main argument from those objecting to this comparison is that the etiology is hypoxia in case of HAPE and inflammation in COVID-19 related ARDS. We propose that considering the recent bioinformatics prediction models, COVID-19 might first infect red blood cells via CD147 and cause hemoglobin damage. The resulting hypoxemia may cause pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to HAPE-like lung lesions. The now introduced alveolar hypoxia further exaggerates hemoglobinopathy hypoxemia leading to a vicious cycle. In this review, the authors recommend laboratory experiments to prove these hypotheses.

METHODS: We collected a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 in a research network of 33 French maternity units between March 1 and April 14, 2020. All cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests of a nasal sample and/or diagnosed by a computed tomography chest scan were included and analyzed. The primary outcome measures were COVID-19 requiring oxygen (oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation) and critical COVID-19 (requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO). Demographic data, baseline comorbidities, and pregnancy outcomes were also collected. RESULTS: Active cases of COVID-19 increased exponentially during March 1-31, 2020; the numbers fell during April 1-14, after lockdown was imposed on March 17. The shape of the curve of active critical COVID-19 mirrored that of all active cases. By April 14, among the 617 pregnant women with COVID-19, 93 women (15.1 %; 95 %CI 12.3-18.1) had required oxygen therapy and 35 others (5.7 %; 95 %CI 4.0-7.8) had had a critical form of COVID-19. The severity of the disease was associated with age older than 35 years and obesity, as well as preexisting diabetes, previous preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. One woman with critical COVID-19 died (0.2 %; 95 %CI 0-0.9). Among the women who gave birth, rates of preterm birth in women with non-severe, oxygen-requiring, and critical COVID-19 were 13/123 (10.6 %), 14/29 (48.3 %), and 23/29 (79.3 %) before 37 weeks and 3/123 (2.4 %), 4/29 (13.8 %), and 14/29 (48.3 %) before 32 weeks, respectively. One neonate (0.5 %; 95 %CI 0.01-2.9) in the critical group died from prematurity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can be responsible for significant rates of severe acute, potentially deadly, respiratory distress syndromes. The most vulnerable pregnant women, those with comorbidities, may benefit particularly from prevention measures such as a lockdown.","Kayem, Gilles; Lecarpentier, Edouard; Deruelle, Philippe; Bretelle, Florence; Azria, Elie; Blanc, Julie; Bohec, Caroline; Bornes, Marie; Ceccaldi, Pierre-François; Chalet, Yasmine; Chauleur, Céline; Cordier, Anne-Gael; Desbrière, Raoul; Doret, Muriel; Dreyfus, Michel; Driessen, Marine; Fermaut, Marion; Gallot, Denis; Garabédian, Charles; Huissoud, Cyril; Luton, Dominique; Morel, Olivier; Perrotin, Franck; Picone, Olivier; Rozenberg, Patrick; Sentilhes, Loïc; Sroussi, Jeremy; Vayssière, Christophe; Verspyck, Eric; Vivanti, Alexandre J; Winer, Norbert; Alessandrini, Vivien; Schmitz, Thomas",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,6,21

We quantified the spatial and angular changes in the structure using two independent analyses, one based on a spatial metrics (Î´, ratio), the second on angular metrics. The order of unfolding of the 10 helices in Mpro is characterized by beta vs alpha plots similar to those of cytochromes and globins. The longest turning region is anomalous in the earliest stage of unfolding. In an investigation of excluded-volume effects, we found that the maximum spread in average molecular-volume values for Mpro, cytochrome c-b562, cytochrome c', myoglobin, and cytoglobin is ~10 Å3. This apparent universality is a consequence of the dominant contributions from six residues: ALA, ASP, GLU, LEU, LYS and VAL. Of the seven Mpro histidines, residues 41, 163, 164, and 246 are in stable H-bonded regions; metal ion binding to one or more of these residues could break up the H-bond network, thereby affecting protease function. Our analysis also indicated that metal binding to cysteine residues 44 and 145 could disable the enzyme.","Kozak, John J; Gray, Harry B; Garza-López, Roberto A",J Inorg Biochem,6,1

NETosis, initially only considered a defensive/apoptotic mechanism, is now considered an extreme defensive solution, which in particular situations induces strong negative effects on tissue physiology, causing or exacerbating pathologies as recently shown in NETs-mediated organ damage in COVID-19 patients. The positive effects of NETs on wound healing have been linked to their antimicrobial activity, while the negative effects appear to be more common in a plethora of pathological conditions (such as diabetes) and linked to a NETosis upregulation. Recent evidence suggests there are other positive physiological NETs effects on wound healing that are worthy of a broader research effort.","Sabbatini, Maurizio; Magnelli, Valeria; Renò, Filippo",,6,18

In settings like this such as China, Australia, and New Zealand, rare outbreak events can lead to escalating epidemics and trigger the imposition of large scale lockdown policies. Here, we examine to what degree vaccination status of incoming arrivals and the quarantine workforce can allow relaxation of quarantine requirements. To do so, we develop and apply a detailed model of COVID-19 disease progression and transmission taking into account nuanced timing factors. Key among these are disease incubation periods and the progression of infection detectability during incubation. Using the disease characteristics associated with the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 to benchmark the level of acceptable risk, we examine the performance of the border quarantine system for vaccinated arrivals. We examine disease transmission and vaccine efficacy parameters over a wide range, covering plausible values for the Delta variant currently circulating globally. Our results indicate a threshold in outbreak potential as a function of vaccine efficacy, with the time until an outbreak increasing by up to two orders of magnitude as vaccine efficacy against transmission increases from 70% to 90%. For parameters corresponding to the Delta variant, vaccination is able to maintain the capacity of quarantine systems to reduce case importation and outbreak risk, by counteracting the pathogen's increased infectiousness. To prevent outbreaks, heightened vaccination in border quarantine systems must be combined with mass vaccination. The ultimate success of these programs will depend sensitively on the efficacy of vaccines against viral transmission.","Zachreson, Cameron; Shearer, Freya M.; Price, David J.; Lydeamore, Michael J.; McVernon, Jodie; McCaw, James; Geard, Nicholas",,6,1

Virtual management (telemedicine) has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to understand oncologists' awareness of and views on virtual management, challenges, and preferences, as well as their priorities regarding the prescribing of anticancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients' awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%). Overall, 111 (50%) and 107 (48%) oncologists did not prefer the virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy, respectively. However, 188 (85%), 165 (74%), and 127 (57%) oncologists preferred the virtual prescription of hormonal therapy, bone modifying agents, and targeted therapy, respectively. In total, 184 (83%), 183 (83%), and 176 (80%) oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative treatments, respectively. Overall, 118 (53%) respondents preferred to continue first-line palliative treatment, in contrast to 68 (30%) and 47 (21%) respondents indicating a preference to interrupt second- and third-line palliative treatment, respectively. For administration of virtual prescriptions, all respondents preferred the oral route and 118 (53%) preferred the subcutaneous route. In contrast, 193 (87%) did not prefer the intravenous route for virtual prescriptions. Overall, 102 (46%) oncologists responded that they would ""definitely"" prefer to manage patients with cancer virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have a high level of awareness of virtual management. Although their survey responses indicated that second- and third-line palliative treatments should be interrupted, they stated that neoadjuvant, adjuvant, perioperative, and first-line palliative treatments should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists' views on the priority of anticancer treatments are consistent with the evolving literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to virtual management should be addressed to improve the care of patients with cancer.","Tashkandi, Emad; Zeeneldin, Ahmed; AlAbdulwahab, Amal; Elemam, Omima; Elsamany, Shereef; Jastaniah, Wasil; Abdullah, Shaker; Alfayez, Mohammad; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Al-Shamsi, Humaid O",J Med Internet Res,6,26

The identity of the cell lineages that underpin the infection-associated loss of olfaction could be critical for the clinical management of 2019-nCoV-infected individuals. Recent research has confirmed the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as key host-specific cellular moieties responsible for the cellular entry of the virus. Accordingly, the ongoing medical examinations and the autopsy reports of the deceased individuals indicate that organs/tissues with high expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other putative viral entry-associated genes are most vulnerable to the infection. We studied if anosmia in 2019-nCoV-infected individuals can be explained by the expression patterns associated with these host-specific moieties across the known olfactory epithelial cell types, identified from a recently published single-cell expression study. Our findings underscore selective expression of these viral entry-associated genes in a subset of sustentacular cells (SUSs), Bowman's gland cells (BGCs) and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium. Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and protein-protein interaction among the host and viral proteins elected regulatory cytoskeleton protein-enriched SUSs as the most vulnerable cell type of the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, expression, structural and docking analyses of ACE2 revealed the potential risk of olfactory dysfunction in four additional mammalian species, revealing an evolutionarily conserved infection susceptibility. In summary, our findings provide a plausible cellular basis for the loss of smell in 2019-nCoV-infected patients.","Gupta, Krishan; Mohanty, Sanjay Kumar; Mittal, Aayushi; Kalra, Siddhant; Kumar, Suvendu; Mishra, Tripti; Ahuja, Jatin; Sengupta, Debarka; Ahuja, Gaurav",Brief. bioinform,6,28

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets.

However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation. METHODS: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation. RESULTS: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models.

So far, few effective drugs have emerged to assist in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, though some herbal medicine candidates may assist in the fight against COVID-19 deaths. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main active ingredient of black seed oil, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anticoagulant activities. TQ also increases the activity and number of cytokine suppressors, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages, and it has demonstrated antiviral potential against a number of viruses, including murine cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and other coronaviruses. Recently, TQ has demonstrated notable antiviral activity against a SARSCoV-2 strain isolated from Egyptian patients and, interestingly, molecular docking studies have also shown that TQ could potentially inhibit COVID-19 development through binding to the receptor-binding domain on the spike and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which may hinder virus entry into the host cell and inhibit its ion channel and pore forming activity. Other studies have shown that TQ may have an inhibitory effect on SARS CoV2 proteases, which could diminish viral replication, and it has also demonstrated good antagonism to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, allowing it to interfere with virus uptake into the host cell. Several studies have also noted its potential protective capability against numerous chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, renal dysfunction and malignancy. TQ has recently been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of several different diseases, and this review thus aims to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of TQ in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Badary, Osama A; Hamza, Marwa S; Tikamdas, Rajiv",Drug Des Devel Ther,6,1

In Italy, the growth of Covid-19 activity was overcome one week ago, Austria and Switzerland followed suit. This note emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19 activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days. We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease afterwards.

Schools and small businesses were forced to shut down. Individuals were encouraged to wear masks in public settings, “shelter-in-place” orders were implemented across several cities and states, and social distancing became a routine practice. Some lost their jobs and livelihood, while others lost the day-to-day physical connection with colleagues and friends, as their “work-life” had shifted to home. To be certain, the variety of losses that people individually and collectively experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic is quite vast—ranging from small, seemingly inconsequential losses (like the freedom to get a haircut) to more considerable and painful losses (like the loss of life). It is important to note that these losses overlapped with other crises that were fomenting across the nation at the same time—for example, the rise of the white supremacist movement, Black Lives Matter, anti-Asian racism, and draconian immigration enforcement, amongst others. These other pandemics also produced losses, such as the loss of civil rights, crackdowns on civic participation, and fundamental violations of basic human rights and civil liberties. In this paper, we discuss the “losses” we are currently experiencing as a nation and the need for school leaders to pay attention to the range of losses people are experiencing in their daily lives. We draw particular attention to those losses compounded by intersecting historical oppressions that disproportionately impact historically marginalized students, families, and communities. We also (re)imagine the transformation of schools to sites of collective healing that work to humanize the collective experience by anchoring actions in resistance, love, collective well-being, hope, and solidarity with and alongside teachers, students, families, and communities. © Copyright © 2021 Castrellón, Fernández, Reyna Rivarola and López.","Castrellón, L.

While medical students have demonstrated an ability to obtain adequate POCUS images of the abdominal aorta (AA), physician assistant (PA) student studies are lacking. This pilot study aims to evaluate the ability of PA students to acquire AA POCUS images. METHODS: PA students, instructors, and models voluntarily participated. Student participants received online material to review several weeks before the study. During the study, students performed 4 precepted practice scans of the AA, and their fifth scan was recorded for review by three ultrasound fellowship trained Emergency Medicine physicians. Images were graded on proper identification and measurement of the AA, as well as interpretability of images. RESULTS: A total of 20 PA students participated. Ninety-five percent were able to obtain interpretable transverse images of the distal aorta and longitudinal views of the aorta, and 65% were able to obtain interpretable transverse images of the proximal and mid aorta. CONCLUSIONS: In the most rigorous evaluation of student-obtained AA POCUS images to date, we found that PA students were able to obtain adequate AA images. PA students were able to image the distal and longitudinal aorta in the transverse plane where the majority of AAAs are found to a very high degree. Results demonstrate PA students' ability to learn POCUS and encourage PA education to take steps to incorporate POCUS education and development of competency standards for PA graduates.","Jaynstein, Dayna; Baeten, Robert; Bafuma, Patrick; Krakov, Rachel; Biggs, Danielle; She, Trent; Yuzuk, Nicole",Emerg. radiol,6,16

However, the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that caused this pandemic is only one of many viruses threatening public health. Consequently, it is important to have effective means of preventing viral transmission and reducing its devastating effects on human and animal health. Although many antivirals are already available, their efficacy is often limited because of factors such as poor solubility, low permeability, poor bioavailability, un-targeted release, adverse side effects, and antiviral resistance. Many of these problems can be overcome using advanced antiviral delivery systems constructed using nanotechnology principles. These delivery systems consist of antivirals loaded into nanoparticles, which may be fabricated from either synthetic or natural materials. Nevertheless, there is increasing emphasis on the development of antiviral delivery systems from natural substances, such as lipids, phospholipids, surfactants, proteins, and polysaccharides, due to health and environmental issues. The composition, morphology, dimensions, and interfacial characteristics of nanoparticles can be manipulated to improve the handling, stability, and potency of antivirals. This article outlines the major classes of antivirals, summarizes the challenges currently limiting their efficacy, and highlights how nanoparticles can be used to overcome these challenges.

Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online. CONCLUSION: Limited early warnings represent missed opportunities to engage citizens earlier in the outbreak. Governments should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner.","Zhu, Yuner; Fu, King-Wa; Grépin, Karen A; Liang, Hai; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,6,29

A seasonal pattern, particularly if combined with other seasonal outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, may have significant impacts on the healthcare system. We evaluated the seasonal pattern of existing endemic coronaviruses and several other common respiratory viruses to determine the potential impacts of added burden of respiratory disease should SARS-CoV-2 establish seasonality. Methods: National surveillance data for laboratory confirmations of endemic coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus for the past 10 years were obtained from the Government of Canada Open Data and FluWatch. Epidemic curves were generated from total case numbers and percent of samples testing positive for each respiratory virus by epidemiological week. Results: In Canada, endemic coronaviruses and other common respiratory viruses cause annual seasonal outbreaks in the winter months. Should SARS-CoV-2 develop a seasonal pattern similar to endemic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses, co-circulation would be expected to peak between January and March. Peak endemic coronavirus activity occurs during the nadir of rhinovirus/enterovirus and parainfluenza activity. Conclusion: Healthcare settings, assisted-living and long-term care homes, schools and essential services employers should anticipate and have contingencies for seasonal outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and co-circulating respiratory viruses during peak seasons. Given the likelihood of co-circulation, diagnostic multiplex testing targeting co-circulating pathogens may be more efficient than single target assays for symptomatic individuals if a seasonal pattern to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is established.","Lagace-Wiens, P.; Bullard, J.; Cole, R.; Van Caeseele, P.",Canada Communicable Disease Report,6,16

Scholars have taken two main approaches to explaining outcomes for platform work-precarity, which focuses on employment classification and insecure labor, and technological control via algorithms. Both predict that workers will have relatively common experiences. On the basis of 112 in-depth interviews with workers on seven platforms (Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Turo, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, and Favor) we find heterogeneity of experiences across and within platforms. We argue that because platform labor is weakly institutionalized, worker satisfaction, autonomy, and earnings vary significantly across and within platforms, suggesting dominant interpretations are insufficient. We find that the extent to which workers are dependent on platform income to pay basic expenses rather than working for supplemental income explains the variation in outcomes, with supplemental earners being more satisfied and higher-earning. This suggests platforms are free-riding on conventional employers. We also find that platforms are hierarchically ordered, in terms of what providers can earn, conditions of work, and their ability to produce satisfied workers. Our findings suggest the need for a new analytic approach to platforms, which emphasizes labor force diversity, connections to conventional labor markets, and worker dependence.","Schor, Juliet B; Attwood-Charles, William; Cansoy, Mehmet; Ladegaard, Isak; Wengronowitz, Robert",Theory Soc,6,16

A systematic search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies in the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Web of Sciences from January 1, 2020 to March 27, 2020 using search terms in the titles and abstracts. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 762 articles were screened. Finally, 15 eligible articles which had adequate data on chest CT findings of COVID-19-infected patients were enrolled in this systematic review. Results: In pediatric patients (15 years old or younger), peripheral distribution was found in 100% of cases, ground glass opacities (GGO) in 55.2%, bilateral involvement in 50%, halo sign in 50%, unilateral involvement in 30%, consolidation in 22.2%, crazy paving pattern in 20%, nodular opacities in 15%, pleural effusion in 4.2%, lymphadenopathy in none, and normal imaging in 20.8% of cases. On the other hand, in adult patients, bilateral involvement was reported in 76.8%, GGO in 68.4%, peripheral distribution in 62.2%, mixed GGO and consolidation in 48.7%, consolidation in 33.7%, crazy paving pattern in 27.7%, mixed central and peripheral distribution in 25.0%, unilateral involvement in 15.2%, nodular opacities in 9.2%, pleural effusion in 5.5%, central distribution of lesions in 5.4%, lymphadenopathy in 2.4%, and normal imaging in 9.8% of cases. Conclusion: According to the findings of this systematic review, children infected with COVID-19 can present with normal or atypical findings (nodular opacities/unilateral involvement) in chest imaging more frequently than adult patients. Therefore, more caution should be taken to avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis in infected children. Besides, clinical and laboratory findings need to be considered more decision-making for pediatric patients with normal or atypical chest CT scan but high suspicion of COVID-19.","Azadbakht, Javid; Haghi-Aminjan, Hamed; Farhood, Bagher",Egypt.

Human to human transmission of the infection emphasizes the importance of adhering to public and social measure to halt its spread. However, the recent #ENDSARS protests led by angry youths in Nigeria resulted to complete flouting of all WHO guidelines meted to curb the spread of the virus. Given that the nation is the most populous African country with over 50 percent of her population been youths, this situation has huge implications for the country and Africa as a whole. The risk of community transmission occasioned by the protest, coupled with travels and active mobility across countries within the continent increases the risk of community transmission with possible increases in new cases over the next few weeks to months. From the foregoing, it is expedient to increase awareness and enforcement of the use of personal protective equipment especially use of nose masks, face shields and frequent hand washing or sanitizing in public places. These individual-targeted measures will go a long way to curtail the imminent community transmission of COVID-19 across Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that Government and non-governmental agencies across the region actively engage to increase collaborative efforts; screening facilities and access to these services across the country, as well as accentuate regular adherence to preventive measures to the general public.","Ohia, Chinenyenwa; Salawu, Mobolaji Modinat",Pan Afr Med J,6,16

For the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a BSL-2 laboratory, a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle (SARS2pp) production and infection system was constructed by using a lentiviral vector bearing dual-reporter genes eGFP and firefly luciferase (Luc2) for easy observation and analysis. Comparison of SARS2pp different production conditions revealed that the pseudovirus titer could be greatly improved by: 1) removing the last 19 amino acids of the spike protein and replacing the signal peptide with the mouse Igk signal sequence; 2) expressing the spike protein using CMV promoter other than CAG (a hybrid promoter consisting of a CMV enhancer, beta-actin promoter, splice donor, and a beta-globin splice acceptor); 3) screening better optimized spike protein sequences for SARS2pp production; and 4) adding 1 % BSA in the SARS2pp production medium. For infection, this SARS2pp system showed a good linear relationship between MOI 2-0.0002 and then was successfully used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors including recombinant human ACE2 proteins and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The kidney, liver and small intestine-derived cell lines were also found to show different susceptibility to SARSpp and SARS2pp. Given its robustness and good performance, it is believed that this pseudovirus particle production and infection system will greatly promote future research for SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms and inhibitors and can be easily applied to study new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Yang, Peng; Yang, Yang; Wu, Yuming; Huang, Cong; Ding, Yanlei; Wang, Xuejun; Wang, Shengqi",J Virol Methods,6,16

RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a renewed interest and recognition of PPE-associated headaches amongst healthcare professionals, largely brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has besieged healthcare systems worldwide. De novo PPE-associated headaches may present with migrainous or tension-type features and can be viewed as a subtype of external compression headache. The prognosis of the disorder is generally favourable, given that most headaches are short-lived without long-term sequalae. Several aetiologies have been postulated to account for the development of these headaches. Notably, these headaches can affect the occupational health and work performance of healthcare workers.

Viral entry requires ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for membrane fusion or through endosomal pathway. This Study aims to assess transcriptomic changes and differentially expressed genes (DFGs) in COVID-19. Methods: Transcriptomic data of the publicly available dataset (GSE147507) was quantile normalized and analysed for DFGs, network analysis and pathway analysis. Results: DFG sets showed that 8 genes (SAE1, AEBP2, ATP1A1, DKK3, MAFF, NUDC, TRAP1, and VAV1) were significantly dysregulated in all studied groups. Functional analysis revealed that negative regulation of glucocorticoid biosynthesis, protein SUMOylation (SAE1), blood coagulation (VAV1) and cellular response to stress were affected by SARS CoV-2 infection. Cell line transduction with ACE2 vector didn't show significant changes in the dysregulated pathways. Also, no significant change was observed in expression levels of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in response to SARS CoV-2 infection. Further analysis showed dysregulation of several genes in the SUMOylation pathway and blood coagulation process in human and cell lines transcriptome. Also, several Cathepsins proteases were significantly dysregulated in case of SARS CoV-2 infection. Genes related to cellular response to stress such as TRAP-1 and NOX were dysregulated in cases of SARS CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Dysregulation in genes of protein SUMOylation, blood coagulation and response to oxidative stress pathways in SARS CoV-2 infection could be critical for disease progression. Drugs acting on SUMO pathway, VAV1, NOX genes could be studied for potential benefit to COVID-19 patients.","Ibrahim, Iman Hassan; El-Lakwa, Doha El-Sayed",Biochem Biophys Rep,6,25

We herein evaluated the analytical performances of the CE IVD-labeled Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Des Plaines, IL, USA) carried out with the automated Abbott Architect&#8482; i2000 platform at Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France, using serum sample panels obtained from health-workers with COVID-19 history confirmed by positive nucleic acid amplification-based diagnosis and from patients randomly selected for whom serum samples were collected before the COVID-19 epidemic. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 %, demonstrating high analytical performances allowing convenient management of suspected on-going and past-infections. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rates were compared in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free areas from our hospital. Thus, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was around 10-fold higher in COVID-19 areas than COVID-19 free areas (75 % versus 8%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, several inpatients hospitalized in COVID-19 free areas suffering from a wide range of unexplained clinical features including cardiac, vascular, renal, metabolic and infectious disorders, were unexpectedly found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by systematic routine serology, suggesting possible causal involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, these observations highlight the potential interest of SARS-CoV-2-specific serology in the context of COVID-19 epidemic, especially to assess past SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as possible unexpected COVID-19-associated disorders.","Péré, Hélène; Védie, Benoit; Vernet, Raphaël; Demory, Nathalie; Kassis, Najiby; Mirault, Tristan; Lazareth, Hélène; Volle, Geoffroy; Denoix, Elsa; Lebeaux, David; Podglajen, Isabelle; Bélec, Laurent; Veyer, David",J Clin Virol,6,13

A case series of seven patients,19.921896,10.933999,2020,"Introduction: The COVID pandemic, which started on 11th March as per the World Health Organization, has resulted in a drastic change in health care delivery, including emergency services. Most health workers have deviated towards COVID care delivery; only a few were available for non-COVID conditions. All elective and non-essential services were postponed resulting in the increased burden of the emergency department. The emergency department had to provide essential emergency care with available staff without exposing them to the virus. Triaging of the patients was modified according to the needs. Methods: The statistics of the emergency department of this period (April and May 2020) are compared with the same period of previous years (2018-2019) with the number of patients, indications, and complications. The methods of triaging and preparation were discussed. Discussion: The number of patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) was low during the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, they got admitted with complications due to delay in accessing the health care facility. Patients with diabetic foot ulcers were also presenting late, leading to an increased number of the forefoot and below knee amputations. In trauma, the emergency department has maintained the same death rate as previous years by giving great care. The indications for tracheostomy were worrisome because it would have been prevented if the patients presented early. Pediatric patients were also presented late, resulting in increased mortality. Some cancer patients also presented with a complication in the emergency department because of the postponement of elective surgeries. Conclusion: There is a delay in accessing the health care delivery for non-COVID conditions resulting in more amputations of limbs and resections of the bowel. So the type of care in the emergency department was changed due to atypical presentation and complicated cases. It is necessary to ensure the provision of high quality health care delivery to non-COVID patients also.","Mehanathan, Pabithadevi B; Edwards, Alex Arthur; Robinson, Theodar",Ann Med Surg (Lond),6,24

However, the shortage of suitable donors places severe limitations on this route. One option to increase the donor pool is to use organs from donation after circulatory death (DCD). Transplant centers for solid organs have been using DCD organs for years. At this time, 40% of solid organ transplantation in the United Kingdom uses organs from DCD. Use of DCD for solid organ transplants in Canada is also rising. Recently, there has been interest in using DCD organs for heart transplantation. The authors will discuss their experience of 4 heart transplants with organs from DCD donors after normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). The authors' first heart transplant using a DCD organ was in January 2020, and the fourth was in March 2020, just before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The authors' protocol using NRP allows adequate evaluation of the donor heart to confidently determine organ acceptance. The co-location of the donor and the recipient in neighboring operating rooms limits ischemic times. Avoidance of an expensive ex vivo organ perfusion machine is an additional benefit for programs that may not have the resources required to purchase and maintain the machine. Some hospitals may not have the resources and space to be able to co-locate both the donor and recipient. Use of cold storage may be an option to transport the procured organ, similar to donation after brain death organs. The authors hope that this technique of NRP in DCD donors can help further increase the donor pool for heart transplantation in the United States.","Ngai, Jennie; Masuno, Kiriko; Moazami, Nader",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,6,16
344951,344951,344951,Prone position in COVID-19: Can we tackle the rising dead space?,19.97692,11.378741,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. RESULTS: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.","Benis, Arriel; Khodos, Anna; Ran, Sivan; Levner, Eugene; Ashkenazi, Shai",J Med Internet Res,6,32

We aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of a major care home outbreak in Denmark. Methods After a staff member had been tested positive on 16 November 2020, a bundle approach programme was initiated including frequent surveillance screenings of residents and staff, isolation and cohorting procedures. This approach also involved limiting the number of visitors and enhancing the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Available positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic relationships between the outbreak and local circulating strains were reconstructed. Results In all, 50% (56/114) of residents and 26% (49/190) of staff members became infected during the 46-day outbreak period. Altogether 16% of the infected residents died within 30 days after becoming infected. A total of 44% (46/105) of the samples with SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced. and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a dominant outbreak lineage belonging to Global Lineage B.1.1.29 containing the mutation I233V in the S gene. The outbreak lineage was detected in the community 28 days before its introduction into the care home. Conclusions Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes is associated with severe outbreaks. Initiation of a bundle approach infection control programme in addition to measures ensuring enhanced herd immunity were successful in controlling the outbreak. Genome sequencing proved to be a powerful tool to describe the relatedness of the various clones and may help focusing outbreak interventions.

However, the complexity of chemotherapy regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research on observational health databases. OBJECTIVE: To compare the anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type using the chemotherapy episodes determined by the algorithm. METHODS: We developed an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application software that visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated the trends in type of the regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two of EHR based OMOP-CDM database. The time of onset of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured as a pilot study using the AUSOM database. The anti-cancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database. RESULTS: We generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (positive predictive value over 98% in average). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimen from 2008 to 2018 were identified for 8,236 patients. In a total of 12 regimens, the number of repeated treatments, which held the largest proportion of patients, was concordant with the protocols for certain cases in wiki for standard chemotherapy regimen. Moreover, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8,315 patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to cluster in days 9 to 15, whereas it tended to be clustered in days 2 to 8 for certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. The proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework through a distributed research network.","Jeon, Hokyun; You, Seng Chan; Kang, Seok Yun; Seo, Seung In; Warner, Jeremy L; Belenkaya, Rimma; Park, Rae Woong",,6,25

We formulate this as a nonconvex regularization problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artifacts. Despite being nonconvex, the proposed technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal splitting (CPS) method, and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artifacts in LUS images. To reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method, and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients.","Karakus, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Aguersif, Amazigh; Silva, Stein; Basarab, Adrian; Achim, Alin",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,6,15

The respective time series are analysed by a trend regression model with change points. The change points are estimated directly from the data. We carry out the analysis for the whole of Germany and the federal state of Bavaria, where we have more detailed data. Both analyses show a major change between 9 and 13 March for the time series of infections: from a strong increase to a decrease. Another change was found between 25 March and 29 March, where the decline intensified. Furthermore, we perform an analysis stratified by age. A main result is a delayed course of the pandemic for the age group 80 + resulting in a turning point at the end of March. Our results differ from those by other authors as we take into account the reporting delay, which turned out to be time dependent and therefore changes the structure of the epidemic curve compared to the curve of newly reported cases.","Küchenhoff, Helmut; Günther, Felix; Höhle, Michael; Bender, Andreas",Epidemiol Infect,6,13

METHODS: All consecutive adult patients admitted for COVID-19 infection in a referral center in France and discharged from the hospital between April 1 and April 30, 2020, were included. All arterial thrombotic events that occurred through discharge were considered for analysis. Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records with use of a standardized data collection form. RESULTS: Overall, 531 COVID-19+ patients were analyzed. Among them, 30 (5.6%) experienced arterial thrombotic events. Arterial thrombotic events in the setting of COVID-19 infection happened at a median of 11 (5-20) days after the first symptoms of infection; occurred in high-risk patients according to traditional cardiovascular risk factors; had an atypical pattern, such as thrombosis of the aorta, upper limb, or renal arteries or cerebral microvasculopathy in 7 (23.3%) cases; and were associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 40%. Arterial thrombotic events increased the risk of death by 3-fold in COVID-19+ patients (hazard ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.7; P=.002). A subdistribution survival hazard model showed that a concentration of D-dimer above 1250 ng/mL increased the risk of arterial thrombotic events in COVID-19+ patients by more than 7 (subdistribution hazard ratio, 7.68; 95% CI, 2.9 to 20.6; P<.001). CONCLUSION: A dramatically high rate of in-hospital death was observed in patients who suffered arterial thrombotic events in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

The Qatar Prospective RCT of Expediting Coronavirus Tapering (Q-PROTECT) aimed to assess virologic cure rates of HC±AZ in cases of low-acuity Covid-19. Methods: Q-PROTECT employed a prospective, placebo-controlled design with blinded randomization to three parallel arms: placebo, oral HC (600 mg daily for one week), or oral HC plus oral AZ (500 mg day one, 250 mg daily on days two through five). At enrollment, non-hospitalized participants had mild or no symptoms and were within a day of Covid-19 positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Due to the lack of combinatorial targeted drugs, alternative treatments fail to improve these patient's prognosis and the quality of life. Finding the Achilles' heel of TNBC is critical for patients with advanced TNBC. Here, we summarize the latest advances in the mechanisms underlying TNBC therapeutic resistance, consider how these mechanisms may affect the development and utilization of TNBC targeted drugs, and discuss the rationale of relevant signals as therapeutic targets.

The assay only needs 1 µL of the serum sample, can be completed within 15 min, and is 100 times more sensitive than the colloidal gold-based LFIA. Two detection modes of our biosensor are available: the colorimetric mode for rapid screening of the patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection without any special instrument and the fluorescent mode for sensitive and quantitative analyses to determine the concentrations of specific IgM/IgG in human serum and detect the infection early and precisely.

No suitable vaccines or antivirals are available for Covid19. The efficiency against Covid19 of WHO therapies of choice, that are two antivirals developed for other pathologies, is controversial. Therefore, alternative approaches are required. Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C (Vit-C) has emerged as one of the other alternatives for this purpose. Here we review the effects of IV Vit-C on the immune system response, the antiviral properties of IV Vit-C, and finally the antioxidant properties of IV Vit-C to specifically address the cytokines' storm characteristic of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that occur in the later cycle of the Covid19 infectious disease.","Boretti, Alberto; Banik, Bimal Krishna",PharmaNutrition,6,13

India is one of the countries which is affected by the disease and thousands of people on daily basis are getting infected. In this paper, an analysis of daily statistics of people affected by the disease are taken into account to predict the next days trend in the active cases in Odisha as well as India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A valid global data set is collected from the WHO daily statistics and correlation among the total confirmed, active, deceased, positive cases are stated in this paper. Regression model such as Linear and Multiple Linear Regression techniques are applied to the data set to visualize the trend of the affected cases. RESULTS: Here a comparison of Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression model is performed where the score of the model R2tends to be 0.99 and 1.0 which indicates a strong prediction model to forecast the next coming days active cases. Using the Multiple Linear Regression model as on July month, the forecast value of 52,290 active cases are predicted towards the next month of 15th August in India and 9,358 active cases in Odisha if situation continues like this way. CONCLUSION: These models acquired remarkable accuracy in COVID-19 recognition. A strong correlation factor determines the relationship among the dependent (active) with the independent variables (positive, deceased, recovered).","Rath, Smita; Tripathy, Alakananda; Tripathy, Alok Ranjan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,6,1

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 1, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS: A total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 928 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.4% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to the ""California"" or ""West Coast"" variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429) were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.36 vs 0.29, RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants.","Peng, James; Liu, Jamin; Mann, Sabrina A; Mitchell, Anthea M; Laurie, Matthew T; Sunshine, Sara; Pilarowski, Genay; Ayscue, Patrick; Kistler, Amy; Vanaerschot, Manu; Li, Lucy M; McGeever, Aaron; Chow, Eric D; Marquez, Carina; Nakamura, Robert; Rubio, Luis; Chamie, Gabriel; Jones, Diane; Jacobo, Jon; Rojas, Susana; Rojas, Susy; Tulier-Laiwa, Valerie; Black, Douglas; Martinez, Jackie; Naso, Jamie; Schwab, Joshua; Petersen, Maya; Havlir, Diane; DeRisi, Joseph",Clin. infect. dis,6,29

Using data from the published OpenSAFELY Collaborative, we analysed consultant physicians to determine those at increased risk of COVID-19 related death. METHODS: Data from 13,500 consultant physicians collected by the Royal College of Physicians were analysed to determine those at an increased risk of death from COVID-19, assuming no comorbidities. RESULTS: The data reveal a picture in which a third of consultant physicians have a hazard ratio (HR) >1 for dying from COVID-19; one in five have HR >2; one in 11, HR >3; and one in 40, HR >4. Of concern are the risks to male physicians aged &#8805;60 with HR >3.8.

410327,410327,410327,Asthma in the Time of COVID-19,19.819998,11.17519,2021,"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has been announced as a pandemic and is spreading rapidly throughout the world. Early detection of COVID-19 may protect many infected people. Unfortunately, COVID-19 can be mistakenly diagnosed as pneumonia or lung cancer, which with fast spread in the chest cells, can lead to patient death. The most commonly used diagnosis methods for these three diseases are chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, a multi-classification deep learning model for diagnosing COVID-19, pneumonia, and lung cancer from a combination of chest x-ray and CT images is proposed. This combination has been used because chest X-ray is less powerful in the early stages of the disease, while a CT scan of the chest is useful even before symptoms appear, and CT can precisely detect the abnormal features that are identified in images. In addition, using these two types of images will increase the dataset size, which will increase the classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no other deep learning model choosing between these diseases is found in the literature. In the present work, the performance of four architectures are considered, namely: VGG19-CNN, ResNet152V2, ResNet152V2 + Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and ResNet152V2 + Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU). A comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning architectures is provided using public digital chest x-ray and CT datasets with four classes (i.e., Normal, COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Lung cancer). From the results of the experiments, it was found that the VGG19 +CNN model outperforms the three other proposed models. The VGG19+CNN model achieved 98.05% accuracy (ACC), 98.05% recall, 98.43% precision, 99.5% specificity (SPC), 99.3% negative predictive value (NPV), 98.24% F1 score, 97.7% Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and 99.66% area under the curve (AUC) based on X-ray and CT images.","Ibrahim, Dina M; Elshennawy, Nada M; Sarhan, Amany M",Comput Biol Med,6,29

Methods: Four focus group discussions among recovered COVID-19 patients were organized and conducted via video conference to collect their insights on public health messages. Upon culmination of each discussion, we held debrief sessions with a particular focus on the responses and making notes of comments. Qualitative themes were also recorded at the end of each focus group. Results: All 40 participants were COVID-19 recovered cases. The participants' mean age was 33.4+/-28.5 years, and 70.0% (n = 28) were males. We observed a generally positive attitude towards public health messages. However, it was stressed that the nature of such behavioral change posed a significant risk for psychological health. Lack of social interaction, for example, led to lower motivation, a sense of losing the meaning of life, and personal distress. While all participants acknowledged and appreciated the government authorities' efforts in disseminating and educating the masses on such a large scale using different modes of message delivery, all showed a serious concern as to whether they will be able to continue coping with the ongoing situation. Conclusions: The participants' responses suggest that public health messaging brought a significant social change in Oman. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized. Further, there is a continued need for strong public health policies with a particular focus on psychological health.","Al Araimi, F. A. F.; Langrial, S. U.; Al Awaidy, S.

The Australian government argues that it is both unsafe for government officials to rescue those held in the camp and unsafe for Australia to repatriate these women and children. This security rhetoric is commonly understood as Australia’s abandonment of its citizens and their entitlements to protection and repatriation. This paper argues that the Australian government is condemning its citizens to a condition of statelessness and displacement, simulating the following conditions under which refugees and asylum seekers are forced to live: Murder, violence, deprivation of adequate food and shelter, disease, and the potential hazards of the COVID-19 infection. Rendering its citizens to a condition of statelessness and displacement constitutes both punishment meted out on those deemed guilty by their presence in Syria, and provides the Australian government the opportunity to revoke the citizenship of women and children. Three Australian women who travelled to Syria have already been stripped of their Australian citizenship.

Researchers have made great efforts to investigate SARS-CoV-2. However, there are few studies analyzing the general situation of SARS-CoV-2 research at global level. This study aimed to characterize global scientific efforts based on SARS-CoV-2 publications. METHODOLOGY: SARS-CoV-2 -related publications were retrieved using Web of Science. The number of publications, citation, country, journal, study topic, total confirmed cases, and total deaths were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 441 publications were identified. China contributed the largest number of publications (198, 44.90%), followed by USA (51, 11.56%), Italy (28, 6.35%), Germany (19, 4.31%), and South Korea (13, 2.95%). Upper-middle-income economies (51.70%) produced the most SARS-CoV-2 publications, followed by high-income (45.12%), lower-middle-income (2.95%), and low-income economies (0.23%). The research output had a significant correlations with total confirmed cases (r = 0.666, p = 0.000) and total deaths (r = 0.610, p = 0.000). China had the highest total citations (1947), followed by USA (204), and Germany (54). China also had the highest average citations (9.83), followed by Netherlands (5.80), and Canada (5.43). The most popular journals were Journal of Medical Virology, Eurosurveillance, and Emerging Microbes and Infections. The most discussed topic was the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific research on SARS-CoV-2 is from worldwide researchers' efforts, with some countries and journals having special contributions. The countries with more total confirmed cases and total deaths tend to have more research output in the field of SARS-CoV-2.

The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that ""The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease"" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,6,26

A collapse in oil prices, triggered by the pandemic, once again exposed Russia’s enduring susceptibility to sharp falls in oil and gas prices. We argue that this decline in oil prices came at a time when tectonic shifts in global energy markets had already threatened to reduce the value of future oil and gas revenues. These structural changes were accelerated by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. Because the Russian leadership had done little to address the threat posed by the emergence of a new energy order, the economy remained highly dependent on oil and gas sales as the primary source of growth. While measures undertaken since 2014 to reduce the government’s fiscal dependence on high oil prices will help Russia avoid a worst-case outcome of a fiscal or financial crisis, the dependence of other branches of the economy on the energy sector remains high.

However, S. boulardii has not been studied as a microbial cell factory for producing useful substances. Agarose, a major component of red macroalgae, can be depolymerized into neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) by an endo-type ß-agarase. NAOSs, including neoagarotetraose (NeoDP4), are known to be health-benefiting substances owing to their prebiotic effect. Thus, NAOS production in the gut is required. In this study, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii was engineered to produce NAOSs by expressing an endo-type ß-agarase, BpGH16A, derived from a human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. RESULTS: In total, four different signal peptides were compared in S. boulardii for protein (BpGH16A) secretion for the first time. The SED1 signal peptide derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected as optimal for extracellular production of NeoDP4 from agarose. Expression of BpGH16A was performed in two ways using the plasmid vector system and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The production of NeoDP4 by engineered S. boulardii was verified and quantified. NeoDP4 was produced by S. boulardii engineered using the plasmid vector system and CRISPR-Cas9 at 1.86 and 0.80 g/L in a 72-h fermentation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on NAOS production using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii. Our results suggest that S. boulardii can be considered a microbial cell factory to produce health-beneficial substances in the human gut.","Jin, Yerin; Yu, Sora; Liu, Jing-Jing; Yun, Eun Ju; Lee, Jae Won; Jin, Yong-Su; Kim, Kyoung Heon",Microb Cell Fact,6,32

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is presented with asymptomatic, mild, or severe pneumonia-like symptoms. COVID-19 patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension, malignancies, HIV, and other comorbidities could develop a life-threatening situation. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE-2 receptors found at the surface of the host cells to get inside the cell. Certain comorbidities are associated with a strong ACE-2 receptor expression and higher release of proprotein convertase that enhances the viral entry into the host cells. The comorbidities lead to the COVID-19 patient into a vicious infectious circle of life and are substantially associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The comorbid individuals must adopt the vigilant preventive measure and require scrupulous management. In this review, we rigorously focused on the impact of common morbidities in COVID-19 patients and recapitulated the management strategies with recent directions. We found limited resources describing the association of comorbidities in COVID-19; however, our review delineates the broader spectrum of comorbidities with COVID-19 patients.","Ejaz, Hasan; Alsrhani, Abdullah; Zafar, Aizza; Javed, Humera; Junaid, Kashaf; Abdalla, Abualgasim E; Abosalif, Khalid O A; Ahmed, Zeeshan; Younas, Sonia",J Infect Public Health,6,1

Using DeepABM allows scaling simulations to large agent populations in real-time and running them efficiently on GPU architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepABM, we build DeepABM-COVID simulator to provide support for various non-pharmaceutical interventions (quarantine, exposure notification, vaccination, testing) for the COVID-19 pandemic, and can scale to populations of representative size in real-time on a GPU. Specifically, DeepABM-COVID can model 200 million interactions (over 100,000 agents across 180 time-steps) in 90 seconds, and is made available online to help researchers with modeling and analysis of various interventions. We explain various components of the framework and discuss results from one research study to evaluate the impact of delaying the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with clinical and public health experts. While we simulate COVID-19 spread, the ideas introduced in the paper are generic and can be easily extend to other forms of agent-based simulations. Furthermore, while beyond scope of this document, DeepABM enables inverse agent-based simulations which can be used to learn physical parameters in the (micro) simulations using gradient-based optimization with large-scale real-world (macro) data. We are optimistic that the current work can have interesting implications for bringing ABM and AI communities closer.","Chopra, Ayush; Gel, Esma; Subramanian, Jayakumar; Krishnamurthy, Balaji; Romero-Brufau, Santiago; Pasupathy, Kalyan S.; Kingsley, Thomas C.; Raskar, Ramesh",,6,16

In the present study, we have evaluated the antifibrotic effect of crocin, a carotenoid present in the stigma of Crocus sativus, and also explored its putative mechanism of action. METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 30% carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The crocin was administered orally at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg body weight along with CCl4 up to 8 weeks. RESULTS: Chronic exposure to CCl4 resulted in elevated levels of liver enzymes and reduced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity in the liver. The liver tissue showed cellular swelling, vacuolization, necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrotic changes. The crocin treatment significantly lowered the levels of liver enzymes in serum and improved the liver CYP2E1 mRNA levels. The pathological changes in the liver were also lowered by crocin treatment. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor &#945; and fibrogenic factor, transforming growth factor ß, and &#945;-smooth muscle actin were elevated by the CCl4 in the liver tissue. However, crocin treatment at different doses significantly reduced the expression of these factors. The increased caspase 3/7 activity was also lowered by crocin. CCl4 administration decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPAR-Î³) in liver tissue. The improved PPAR-Î³ expression in the liver by crocin treatment indicates its role in the therapeutic effect of crocin. CONCLUSIONS: Crocin attenuated the various events in the progression of liver fibrosis via PPAR-Î³ mediated modulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways.","Chhimwal, J; Sharma, S; Kulurkar, P; Patial, V",Hum Exp Toxicol,6,16

Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for critical COVID-19 patients and a nomogram was constructed based on the screened risk factors. Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age, high peripheral white blood cell count (WBC), low lymphocyte count (L), low platelet count (PLT), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were associated with critical COVID-19 patients mortality risk (p < 0.05) and these were integrated into the nomogram model. Nomogram analysis showed that the total factor score ranged from 179 to 270 while the corresponding mortality risk ranged from 0.05 to 0.95. Findings from this study suggest advanced age, high WBC, high hs-CRP, low L, and low PLT are risk factors for death in critical COVID-19 patients.

Minimization of water-spray syringe utilization for rinsing is suggested on bonding related procedures, while temporal conditions as represented by seasonal epidemics should be considered for the decision of intervention scheme provided as a preprocedural mouth rinse, in an attempt to reduce the load of aerosolized pathogens. In normal conditions, chlorhexidine 0.2%, preferably under elevated temperature state should be prioritized for reducing bacterial counts. In the presence of oxidation vulnerable viruses within the community, substitute strategies might be represented by the use of povidone iodine 0.2%-1%, or hydrogen peroxide 1%. After debonding, extensive material grinding, as well as aligner related attachment clean-up, should involve the use of carbide tungsten burs under water cooling conditions for cutting efficiency enhancement, duration restriction of the procedure, as well as reduction of aerosolized nanoparticles. In this respect, selection strategies of malocclusions eligible for aligner treatment should be reconsidered and future perspectives may entail careful and more restricted utilization of attachment grips. For more limited clean-up procedures, such as grinding of minimal amounts of adhesive remnants, or individualized bracket debonding in the course of treatment, hand-instruments for remnant removal might well represent an effective strategy. Efforts to minimize the use of rotary instrumentation in orthodontic settings might also lead the way for future solutions. Measures of self-protection for the treatment team should never be neglected. Dressing gowns and facemasks with filter protection layers, appropriate ventilation and fresh air flow within the operating room comprise significant links to the overall picture of practice management. Risk management considerations should be constant, but also updated as new material applications come into play, while being grounded on the best available evidence.","Eliades, Theodore; Koletsi, Despina",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,6,1

We studied the Covid-19 and all-cause mortality in 19 Indian states (combined population of 1.27 billion) with available all-cause mortality data during the pandemic for the entire state or for large cities. Excess mortality was calculated by comparison with available data from years 2015-2019. The known Covid-19 deaths reported by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering for a state were assumed to be accurate, unless excess mortality data suggested a higher toll during the pandemic. Data from one state were not included in the final model due to anomalies. In several regions, fewer deaths were reported in 2020 than expected. The excess mortality in Mumbai (in Maharashtra) in 2020 was 137.0 / 100K.

We conducted a quality improvement project to assess the accuracy of alternate-source medication histories obtained for critically ill patients who were delirious or mechanically ventilated at the time of intensive care unit admission. METHODS: Included patients were 18 years of age or older, admitted to the medical intensive care unit from August 2017 through January 2018, and had a medication history obtained from a family member or outpatient pharmacy due to active delirium or mechanical ventilation. Patients were directly interviewed after resolution of delirium or extubation. Discrepancies between the initial and follow-up histories were documented and categorized using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for Categorizing Medication Errors. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. One hundred four discrepancies were documented, with a median of 2 discrepancies per patient. The most common types of discrepancies were addition (51.9%), followed by omission (24.0%). NCC MERP index category A (51%) was the most common error classification identified. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between initial and follow-up medication histories occurred at a frequent rate in delirious or mechanically ventilated patients; however, these discrepancies tended to be of low risk severity.","Cicci, Corey D; Fudzie, Seyram S; Campbell-Bright, Stacy; Murray, Brian P; Northam, Kalynn A",Am J Health Syst Pharm,6,1

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING: Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS: We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

A cross-sectional intra-household study was conducted in metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the time period of April to June 2020. Every adult who was the first family member reported as SARS-CoV-2-positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as their household child contacts had nasopharyngeal swabs tested by a targeted SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a multiplex viral respiratory panel after a 15 day minimum time lag. Four-hundred and four households (404 adults and 708 children) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 137 (33.9%) adults and 84 (11.9%) children. Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RV/EV) was commonly found (83.3%) in co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in adults. The mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in adults’ nasopharynx was 52 days (range 26–83 days). The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly associated with RV/EV co-infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.31; 95% CI 2.57–33.80) and SARS-CoV-2 detection in child contacts (aOR 2.08; 95% CI 1.24–3.51).

As we move forward with course planning for fall and beyond, we can invest more time and energy into improving the online experience for our students. We advocate that instructors use inclusive teaching practices, specifically through active learning, in their online classes. Incorporating pedagogical practices that work to maximize active and inclusive teaching concepts will be beneficial for all students, and especially those from minoritized or underserved groups. Like many STEM fields, Ecology and Evolution shows achievement gaps and faces a leaky pipeline issue for students from groups traditionally underserved in science. Making online classes both active and inclusive will aid student learning and will also help students feel more connected to their learning, their peers, and their campus. This approach will likely help with performance, retention, and persistence of students. In this paper, we offer broadly applicable strategies and techniques that weave together active and inclusive teaching practices. We challenge instructors to commit to making small changes as a first step to more inclusive teaching in ecology and evolutionary biology courses.","Harris, Breanna N.; McCarthy, Pumtiwitt C.; Wright, April M.; Schutz, Heidi; Boersma, Kate S.; Shepherd, Stephanie L.; Manning, Lathiena A.; Malisch, Jessica L.; Ellington, Roni M.",Ecol Evol,6,20

We are piloting a novel data collection technique based on routine National Health Service (NHS) data, with no traditional patient-Health Care Professional contact after recruitment, where trial data are traditionally collected on case report forms. Data will be collected from routine administrative sources and validated via data queries to sites. We report here the feasibility and pre-trial methodological development and validation of the schema proposed for BladderPath. METHODS: Locally treated patient cohorts were utilised for routine data validation (hospital interactions data (HID) and administrative radiotherapy department data (RTD)). Single site events of interest were algorithmically extracted from the 2008–2018 HID and validated against reference datasets to determine detection sensitivity. Survival analysis was performed using RTD and HID data. Hazard ratios and survival statistics were calculated estimating treatment effects and further validating and assessing the scope of routine data. RESULTS: Overall, 829/1042 (sensitivity 0.80) events of interest were identified in the HID, with varying levels of sensitivity; identifying, 202/206 (sensitivity 0.98; PPV 0.96) surgical events but only 391/568 (sensitivity 0.69; PPV 0.95) radiotherapy regimens. An overall temporal quality improvement trend was present: detecting 41/117 events (35%) in 2011 to 104/109 (95%) in 2017 (all event types). Using the RTD, 5-year survival rates were 43% (95% CI 25–59%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 30% (95% CI 23–36%) in the radiotherapy group; using the HID, the 5-year radical cystectomy survival rate was 57% (95% CI 50–63%). CONCLUSIONS: Routine data are a feasible method for trial data collection. As long as events of interest are pre-validated, very high sensitivities for trial conduct can be achieved and further improved with targeted data queries. Outcomes can also be produced comparable to clinical trial and national dataset results. Given the real-time, obligatory nature of the HID, which forms the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, alongside other datasets, we believe routine data extraction and validation is a robust way of rapidly collecting datasets for trials.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of plastic wrapping in decreasing bacterial contamination on mobile phone surfaces. METHOD: We used culture dishes and a luminometer to detect bacterial colonies and contamination on the phone surfaces. RESULT: Our experiment showed that bacterial colonies exist on mobile phones before and after work. We found that wiping with 75% alcohol sanitizers effectively reduces the number of colonies on either a mobile phone or a temporary plastic covering. In addition, we found that bacterial colonies do not contaminate or adhere to plastic wrap any easier than to mobile phones. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated the effectiveness of plastic wrap for protecting mobile phone surfaces against bacterial colonization. In addition, applying a layer of plastic wrap protects the phone from potential damage due to the alcohol.","Wu, Yen-Hung; Chen, Chao-Ju; Wu, Hsiu-Yueh; Chen, I; Chang, Yi-Hsuan; Yang, Pei-Hsuan; Wang, Tzu-Yi; Chen, Li-Chin; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Yeh, I-Jeng; Wu, Deng-Chyang; Hou, Ming-Feng; Liu, Hsin-Liang; Su, Wen-Hui",Medicine (Baltimore),6,20

Unrestrained molecular-dynamics simulations on 18-mer duplexes with isonucleosides incorporated at the 3'-end or in the center of one strand have been carried out with explicit solvent under periodic boundary conditions using the AMBER force field and the particle mesh Ewald method. The Watson–Crick hydrogen-bonding patterns of the duplexes studied remained intact throughout the simulation. For the modified duplexes, the changes observed in the inter-base pair parameters and backbone torsional angles were primarily localized at the isonucleoside-inserted area. All five structures studied remained in the B-form family. The decreased stacking abilities indicated by the large changes in inter-base pair parameters and the large changes in backbones made the modified duplexes show a minor thermal destabilization in comparison with native DNA. The MM_PBSA method for estimating binding free energies on two complementary strands was used. The results showed that the binding free energies of isonucleoside-incorporated DNA duplexes were lower than the native DNA duplex, which is in good agreement with experimental observations.

Various nutrition societies have recently published their guidelines in context of the pandemic, and several points emphasize the impact of these GI manifestations on nutrition therapy. In patients with COVID‐19, the normal intestinal mucosa can be disrupted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus, and this could result in GI symptoms and a compromise in nutrient absorption. Optimization of oral diet is still recommended. However, given the GI effects of COVID‐19, a fraction of infected patients have poor appetite and would not be able to meet their nutrition goals with oral diet alone. For this at‐risk group, which includes those who are critically ill, enteral nutrition is the preferred route to promote gut integrity and immune function. In carrying this out, nutrition support practices have been revised in such ways to mitigate viral transmission and adapt to the pandemic. All measures in the GI and nutrition care of patients are clustered to limit exposure of healthcare workers. Among patients admitted to intensive care units, a significant barrier is GI intolerance, and it appears to be exacerbated by significant GI involvement specific to the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Nevertheless, several countermeasures can be used to ease side effects. At the end of the spectrum in which intolerance persists, the threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition may need to be lowered.","Aguila, Enrik John T.; Cua, Ian Homer Y.; Fontanilla, Joy Arabelle C.; Yabut, Vince Leenard M.; Causing, Marion Frances P.",Nutr Clin Pract,6,24

We also shortly refer to bacterial infections and parasitic infestations in patients treated with cyclosporin. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive drug, which is widely used in medicine, including in the treatment of autoimmune skin diseases in dermatology, rheumatology, ophthalmology and nephrology, and in organ transplantation. A usual concern associated with immunosuppressive treatment is the potential risk of infections. Interestingly, several data indicate a relatively low risk of infections, especially viral infections, in patients receiving cyclosporine. It was shown that cyclosporine exerts an inhibitory effect on the replication of some viruses, or may have a potentially beneficial effect on the disease course in infections. These include hepatitis C, influenza virus, rotavirus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus infections. Available data indicate that cyclosporine may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV2.","Glowacka, Paulina; Rudnicka, Lidia; Warszawik-Hendzel, Olga; Sikora, Mariusz; Goldust, Mohamad; Gajda, Patrycja; Stochmal, Anna; Blicharz, Leszek; Rakowska, Adriana; Olszewska, Malgorzata",Biology (Basel),6,16

In a survey conducted within the first days of implementing social distancing measures in Austria and Germany, we aimed to explore the pathways from threat perception to preferences of defense strategies. We found that anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance were specifically elicited by motivational (vs. epistemic) discrepancies. In a second step, we tested the mediating effect of anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance on preferences regarding personal-social and concrete-abstract defenses. Experiencing anxiety was related to interest in security-related actions, and approach-affect was related to both personal projects and social media use. Participants experiencing reactance were more inclined to pursue personal projects (personal-abstract) and less interested in security-related (personal-concrete) actions. They also showed marginally lower system justification (social-abstract). Additionally, we examined the relationship of loneliness with defense strategies, showing that loneliness was associated with lower system justification and security behaviors. The results suggest that individuals deal with threat in their own ways, mostly depending on affective state and motivational orientation: Anxiety was related to security, approach-state to action (both social and personal), reactance to derogation of the system and disregard for security, while loneliness was associated with inaction.","Reiss, Stefan; Franchina, Vittoria; Jutzi, Chiara; Willardt, Robin; Jonas, Eva",PLoS One,6,16

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO(2) and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features. PhenoAge is a better predictor of adverse outcomes compared to CA.","Márquez-Salinas, Alejandro; Fermín-Martínez, Carlos A; Antonio-Villa, Neftalí Eduardo; Vargas-Vázquez, Arsenio; C.

Following the emergence of COVID-19, all in-person TX STRIDE intervention and data collection sessions were paused. METHODS: Qualitative descriptive methods using telephone interviews were conducted during the research pause. A structured interview guide was developed to facilitate data collection and coding. Forty-seven of 59 Cohort 1 participants were interviewed (mean age = 60.7 years; 79% female; mean time diagnosed with type 2 diabetes = 11 years). RESULTS: Data categories and subcategories were generated from the interview responses and included: personal experiences with COVID-19, effects of COVID-19 on diabetes self-management, psychosocial and financial effects of COVID-19, and recommendations for program restart. Although some participants lacked technological knowledge, they expressed eagerness to learn how to use remote meeting platforms to resume intervention and at-home data-collection sessions. Six months after the in-person intervention was paused, TX STRIDE restarted remotely with data collection and class sessions held via Zoom. A majority of participants (72.9%) transitioned to the virtual platform restart. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative findings guided the appropriate implementation of technology for the study, which facilitated a successful restart. High retention of participants through the study transition provides evidence that participants are invested in learning how to manage their diabetes despite the challenges and distractions imposed by COVID-19.","Steinhardt, Mary A.; Brown, Sharon A.; Lehrer, H.

We investigated mortality rates, overall and according to location, in patients with established cardiovascular disease before, during, and after these lockdown measures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified a dynamic cohort comprising all Danish citizens with cardiovascular disease (i.e. a history of ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or peripheral artery disease) alive on 2 January 2019 and 2020. The cohort was followed from 2 January 2019/2020 until death or 16/15 October 2019/2020. The cohort comprised 340 392 and 347 136 patients with cardiovascular disease in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The overall, in-hospital, and out-of-hospital mortality rate in 2020 before lockdown was significantly lower compared with the same period in 2019 [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.87–0.95; IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89–1.02; and IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83–0.93, respectively]. The overall mortality rate during and after lockdown was not significantly different compared with the same period in 2019 (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.02). However, the in-hospital mortality rate was lower and out-of-hospital mortality rate higher during and after lockdown compared with the same period in 2019 (in-hospital, IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88–0.96; out-of-hospital, IRR 1.04, 95% CI1.01–1.08). These trends were consistent irrespective of sex and age. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with established cardiovascular disease, the in-hospital mortality rate was lower and out-of-hospital mortality rate higher during lockdown compared with the same period in the preceding year, irrespective of age and sex.","Butt, Jawad H; Fosbøl, Emil L; Gerds, Thomas A; Andersson, Charlotte; Kragholm, Kristian; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Andersen, Julie; Phelps, Mathew; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Schou, Morten",Eur Heart J,6,12

However, little is known about the association between pregnant women with COVID-19 and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Maternal and Child Health Information System (MCHIMS) of Wuhan, China. All pregnant women with singleton live birth recorded by the system between January 13 and March 18, 2020, were included. The adverse birth outcomes were preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal asphyxia, premature rupture of membrane (PROM), and cesarean section delivery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse birth outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 11,078 pregnant women, 65 were confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). No deaths occurred from these confirmed cases or their newborns. Compared to pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had an increased risk of preterm birth (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.60–7.00) and cesarean section (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.95–6.76). There was no statistical difference in low birth weight, neonatal asphyxia, and PROM between the mothers with and without COVID-19. Among these newborns that were born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19, none was tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive or had abnormal CT results. Only one had diarrhea and three had a fever. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based cohort study suggests that COVID-19 during the later pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, including iatrogenic preterm birth and cesarean section delivery. Our data provide little evidence for maternal-fetal vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to monitor the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their children.","Yang, Rong; Mei, Hui; Zheng, Tongzhang; Fu, Qiang; Zhang, Yiming; Buka, Stephen; Yao, Xinan; Tang, Zezhong; Zhang, Xichi; Qiu, Lin; Zhang, Yaqi; Zhou, Jieqiong; Cao, Jiangxia; Wang, Youjie; Zhou, Aifen",BMC Med,6,30

Even if the first dosage goes uncomplicated, the second dose may be complicated by severe adverse reactions as in the following case. Case report: A 52yo male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7d after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. He had a previous history of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. Blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission. Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. Aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. Blood pressure values were normal throughout hospitalisation. Whether there was a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination remains speculative but cannot be definitively excluded. CONCLUSIONS: a second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be followed by ICB. Though the pathophysiology of ICB remains unexplained a causal relation between ICB and the vaccination cannot be excluded. Risk factors for ICB should be carefully monitored in patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Finsterer, Josef; Korn, Maria",Brain Hemorrhages,6,3

Genetic analysis of coronavirus isolated from bats, snakes, and Malay pangolins suggested that they could be intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. The transfer of virus from person to person has been confirmed widely, while the actual source of origin is still unknown. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, and the worldwide transmission of coronavirus has intense effects on the lives of human beings. The spread of the virus is observed mainly through close contact with the infected person due to coughing, sniffing or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. If people touch contaminated surfaces through their hands, mouth, nose, or eye, it enters the body and causes disease. Also, the virus may transmit through air droplets, water, food, fecal–oral transmission, etc. The infection of virus in human beings could be detected by direct symptoms, or different diagnostic tools are available to determine the viral load. Various safety measures are used to contain the virus, including disinfectants, antiviral drugs, vaccines, wearing masks, social distancing, etc. In the present review, we have focused on transmission of COVID-19 through air and wastewater as environmental transmission modes. We have also discussed the origin of the virus, its mode of action, host immune response, vulnerability, varying symptoms and diagnosis, prevention and control. Further, we have discussed the various treatment options to cope with this viral outbreak. [Image: see text]","Singh, Anshu; Haq, Izharul",Environmental Sustainability,6,24

In England, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing. However, the effects of public green space use on the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within England’s local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 299 local authorities (small regions) in England, we calculated a daily case rate metric, based upon a seven-day moving average, for each day within the period 1st June - 30th November 2020 and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that reducing mobility is associated with a decline in case rates, especially in areas with high population clustering. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) was associated with decreased residual case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Our results suggest that a reduction in overall mobility may be a good strategy for reducing case rates, endorsing the success of lockdown measures. However, if mobility is necessary, outdoor park use may be safer than other forms of mobility and associated activities (e.g. shopping or office-based working).","Johnson, Thomas F.; Hordley, Lisbeth A.; Greenwell, Matthew P.; Evans, Luke C.",Sci Total Environ,6,1

The usual presentation is mild gastroenteritis, but systemic manifestations may occur. Lethal infections are rarely documented in patients with underlying disorders. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 37-year-old Southeast Asian woman presented to our hospital with recent onset of abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Her condition rapidly deteriorated with signs and symptoms of fulminant septic shock; thus, she was intubated, supported with intravenous vasopressors and fluids, and transferred to the intensive care unit. An abdominal computed tomographic scan with contrast revealed multiple liver abscesses. Blood cultures were obtained and computed tomography–guided percutaneous drainage of the liver abscesses with supplementary cultures was performed; thereafter, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. All cultures grew E. tarda, whereas an antibiogram showed resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics and sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides; thus, the antibiotic regimen was updated accordingly. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the intensive care unit 14 days after admission. CONCLUSION: E. tarda human infection can present as liver abscess and fulminant septic shock. E. tarda strains can be resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics; hence, culture-based antibiotics should be used accordingly. Clinicians should be aware of this rare and potentially lethal infection.","Bakirova, Gultakin Hasan; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Corcione, Silvia; Aletreby, Waleed Tharwat; Mady, Ahmed Fouad; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",J Med Case Rep,6,20

However, new technologies need to be developed to combat an emerging generation of infectious diseases. DNA vaccination has been demonstrated to have great potential for use with a wide variety of diseases. Alone, this technology does not generate a significant immune response for vaccination, but combined with delivery by electroporation (EP), can enhance plasmid expression and immunity. Most EP systems, while effective, can be invasive and painful making them less desirable for use in vaccination. Our lab recently developed a non-invasive electrode known as the multi-electrode array (MEA), which lies flat on the surface of the skin without penetrating the tissue. In this study we evaluated the MEA for its use in DNA vaccination using Hepatitis B virus as the infectious model. We utilized the guinea pig model because their skin is similar in thickness and morphology to humans. The plasmid encoding Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was delivered intradermally with the MEA to guinea pig skin. The results show increased protein expression resulting from plasmid delivery using the MEA as compared to injection alone. Within 48 hours of treatment, there was an influx of cellular infiltrate in experimental groups. Humoral responses were also increased significantly in both duration and intensity as compared to injection only groups. While this electrode requires further study, our results suggest that the MEA has potential for use in electrically mediated intradermal DNA vaccination.","Donate, Amy; Coppola, Domenico; Cruz, Yolmari; Heller, Richard",PLoS One,6,1

As the urgency of the pandemic grew, administrators, clinicians, and ethicists became concerned with upholding the ethical principle of “most lives saved” by re-visiting crisis standards of care and triage protocols. Yet a colorblind, race-neutral approach to “most lives saved” is inherently inequitable because it reflects the normality and invisibility of ‘whiteness’ while simultaneously disregarding the burdens of ‘Blackness’. As written, the crisis standards of care (CSC) adopted by States are racist policies because they contribute to a history that treats Black Americans are inherently less than.
