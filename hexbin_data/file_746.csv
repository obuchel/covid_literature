34348,Brèves : 6-10 juillet 2020,2020-06-12,"Time and again, many organizations and their staff members must respond to unexpected catastrophes like hurricanes (e.g., Katrina), virus pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), or other major emergencies. As a result, some organizations allow their employees to respond to external emergencies by engaging in response actions for a limited time, like in the case of emergency response teams. The latter teams consist of employees that act as emergency response officers who can respond to floods, train crashes, or other emergencies. Emergency response teams constitute an example of so-called latent organizing (LO) in the preparation for and response to any (unpredictable) future emergency. While latent organizing is ubiquitous in a societal and professional sense, it has hardly been studied in the organization design literature. In this paper, we develop a research agenda for studying LO. LO serves to prepare for and respond to emergencies, but otherwise remains largely dormant and inactive. When it is inactive, host organizations use the LO’s human and other resources for their own gainful purposes. Resources for LO are thus organized in a quasi-permanent fashion, one that is rather latent until activated by an emergency. We further develop the construct of latency to explore how effective LO can be designed and facilitated. In addition, we develop a research agenda for future work in this area.","van Fenema, Paul C.; Romme, A. Georges L.",J Org Design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282832/,746

Specifically, during the coronavirus pandemic, many firms adopted poison pills following declines in valuations, and stock prices increased upon the announcement of firms’ poison pill adoption. Stock price increases are driven by (1) firms in which activist shareholders acquire ownership stakes and (2) firms in industries that had high exposure to the crisis. Likewise, we find a positive reaction to pills with provisions directed at stalling activists’ interventions. Our results suggest that crisis pills that target potentially disruptive ownership changes may benefit current shareholders.","Eldar, Ofer; Wittry, Michael D",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798525/,746

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 18 client-owned dogs that underwent extirpation of a cranial mediastinal mass by means of VATS at 5 academic referral hospitals from 2009 through 2014. PROCEDURES Medical records were reviewed and data extracted regarding signalment, clinical signs, physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical approach and duration, cytologic and histologic examination results, complications, outcome, and cause of death, when applicable. RESULTS 16 dogs had a thymoma, 1 had thymic anaplastic carcinoma, and 1 had hemangiosarcoma. Seven had both megaesophagus and myasthenia gravis. Median approximate tumor volume was 113.1 cm3 (interquartile range, 33.5 to 313.3 cm3). Median duration of VATS was 117.5 minutes (interquartile range, 91.5 to 136.3 minutes). Conversion to an open thoracic surgical procedure was required for 2 dogs, 1 of which died during surgery. Median survival time following VATS for dogs with thymoma and concurrent myasthenia gravis and megaesophagus was 20 days. Dogs with thymoma without paraneoplastic syndrome survived for ≥ 60 days, and none of these dogs died of disease-related causes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE VATS appeared to be an acceptable approach for extirpation of masses from the cranial mediastinum in dogs under certain conditions. Dogs with myasthenia gravis and megaesophagus had a poor postoperative outcome.","MacIver, Melissa A; Case, J Brad; Monnet, Eric L; Hunt, Geraldine B; Mayhew, Philipp D; Oblak, Michelle L; Runge, Jeffrey J; Singh, Ameet; Smeak, Daniel D; Steffey, Michele A; Boston, Sarah E",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.250.11.1283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28509648/,746

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society-National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research database. Analysis was restricted to 44 hospitals that reported contemporaneous activity on PCI. Only patients with primary PCI for STEMI were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 34 127 patients with STEMI (primary PCI 33 938, facilitated PCI 108, rescue PCI 81) were included in the study. There was a decline in the number of procedures by 43% (n=497) in April 2020 compared with the average monthly procedures between 2017 and 2019 (n=865). For all patients, the median time from symptom to hospital showed increased after the lockdown (150 (99-270) vs 135 (89-250) min, p=0.004) and a longer door-to-balloon time after the lockdown (48 (21-112) vs 37 (16-94) min, p<0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8% before the lockdown and 3.5% after the lockdown (p=0.12). Following adjustment for baseline characteristics, no differences were observed for in-hospital death (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.68, p=0.67) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32, p=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Following the lockdown in England, we observed a decline in primary PCI procedures for STEMI and increases in overall symptom-to-hospital and door-to-balloon time for patients with STEMI. Restructuring health services during COVID-19 has not adversely influenced in-hospital outcomes.","Kwok, Chun Shing; Gale, Chris P; Kinnaird, Tim; Curzen, Nick; Ludman, Peter; Kontopantelis, Evan; Wu, Jianhua; Denwood, Tom; Fazal, Nadeem; Deanfield, John; de Belder, Mark A; Mamas, Mamas",Heart,,746

In order to ensure that the science and technology of AI is developed in a humane manner, we must develop research publication norms that are informed by our growing understanding of AI's potential threats and use cases. Unfortunately, it's difficult to create a set of publication norms for responsible AI because the field of AI is currently fragmented in terms of how this technology is researched, developed, funded, etc. To examine this challenge and find solutions, the Montreal AI Ethics Institute (MAIEI) co-hosted two public consultations with the Partnership on AI in May 2020. These meetups examined potential publication norms for responsible AI, with the goal of creating a clear set of recommendations and ways forward for publishers. In its submission, MAIEI provides six initial recommendations, these include: 1) create tools to navigate publication decisions, 2) offer a page number extension, 3) develop a network of peers, 4) require broad impact statements, 5) require the publication of expected results, and 6) revamp the peer-review process. After considering potential concerns regarding these recommendations, including constraining innovation and creating a""black market""for AI research, MAIEI outlines three ways forward for publishers, these include: 1) state clearly and consistently the need for established norms, 2) coordinate and build trust as a community, and 3) change the approach.","Gupta, Abhishek; Lanteigne, Camylle; Institute, Victoria Heath Montreal AI Ethics; Microsoft,; Lab, Algora",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07262v2.pdf,746

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study at a single institution tertiary care hospital. A total of 95 otolaryngology consultations were performed from March 1, 2020 to April 26, 2020 (COVID-era) and 363 were performed from September 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 (pre-COVID-era) at the UPMC Oakland campus. Data collected included patient demographics, COVID-19 status, reason for consult, location of consult, type of consult, procedures performed, need for surgical intervention, length of hospital stay and recommended follow up. RESULTS: Patient populations in the pre-COVID-era and COVID-era were similar in terms of their distribution of demographics and chief complaints. Craniofacial trauma was the most common reason for consultation in both periods, followed by vocal fold and airway-related consults. We saw a 21.5% decrease in the rate of consults seen per month during the COVID-era compared to the 6 months prior. Review of trends in the consult workflow allowed for development of several algorithms to safely approach otolaryngology consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngology consultations provide valuable services to inpatients and patients in the emergency department ranging from evaluation of routine symptoms to critical airways. Systematic otolaryngology consult service modifications are required in order to reduce risk of exposure to healthcare providers while providing comprehensive patient care.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Belsky, Michael A; Anderson, Jennifer L; Sridharan, Shaum",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,746

Signatures of public emotion and attention are present in social media data, thus natural language analysis of this text enables near-to-real-time monitoring of indicators of public risk perception. We compare key epidemiological indicators of the progression of the pandemic with indicators of the public perception of the pandemic constructed from approx. 20 million unique Covid-19-related tweets from 12 countries posted between 10th March and 14th June 2020. We find evidence of psychophysical numbing: Twitter users increasingly fixate on mortality, but in a decreasingly emotional and increasingly analytic tone. We find that the national attention on Covid-19 mortality is modelled accurately as a logarithmic or power law function of national daily Covid-19 deaths rates, implying generalisations of the Weber-Fechner and power law models of sensory perception to the collective. Our parameter estimates for these models are consistent with estimates from psychological experiments, and indicate that users in this dataset exhibit differential sensitivity by country to the national Covid-19 death rates.

Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.","Weitz, Joshua S; Beckett, Stephen J; Coenen, Ashley R; Demory, David; Dominguez-Mirazo, Marian; Dushoff, Jonathan; Leung, Chung-Yin; Li, Guanlin; Magalie, Andreea; Park, Sang Woo; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Rogelio; Shivam, Shashwat; Zhao, Conan Y",Nat Med,,746

On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the name for the new illness caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. By March 11, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. This virus has extensively altered daily life for many across the globe, while claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. While fundamentally a respiratory illness, many infected individuals experience symptoms that involve the central nervous system (CNS). It is likely that many of these symptoms are the result of the virus residing outside of the CNS. However, the current evidence does indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can use olfactory neurons to travel from the periphery into the CNS, and that the virus may also enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We discuss how the virus may use established infection mechanisms (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Cathepsin L), as well mechanisms still under consideration (NRP1 and BASIGIN) to infect and spread throughout the CNS. Confirming the impact of the virus on the CNS will be crucial in dealing with the long-term consequences of the epidemic.","Burks, Susan M; Rosas-Hernandez, Hector; Alenjandro Ramirez-Lee, Manuel; Cuevas, Elvis; Talpos, John C",Brain behav. immun,,746

This study outlines a methodology to enhance energy efficiency and solve common problems in hospital cooling-water systems, since hospitals are the most energy- intensive type of building. Building Management Systems (BMS) are a widely used technique to control and monitor all the different energy facilities contained in hospitals. Proper setup and upgrades can resolve inefficien- cies and existing problems. The methodology described herein addresses the general cooling system adjustments in three main areas: control system (CS), data acquisition system (DAS), and physical system (PS). An innovative feature incorporated in this methodology is the cooling demand model integrated into the CS, which is capable of forecasting and transmitting a schedule for maximum thermal energy requirements to the BMS a day in ad- vance, thereby anticipating decisions and scheduling energy generation and maintenance operations. During the process of developing the cooling demand model, various machine learning models were trained. This process consisted of searching for low-complexity models using a methodology called GAparsimony. This methodology uses genetic algorithms to search for highly precise, robust models that use a low input. The final model consisted of a weighted combination of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The energy savings obtained thanks to this methodology are estimated to be between 7% and 10% per year. The energy plant improved its performance and chiller starts were reduced by 82.5%. It should also be noted that this study was affected by the recommendations for increased ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which en- tailed at 22.4% increase in energy consumption in 2020. The methodology was developed and tested successfully in a real hospital BMS between 2017 and 2019;the model was finally integrated in 2020.","Dulce-Chamorro, Eduardo Martinez-de-Pison Francisco Javier",Journal of Building Engineering,,746

An unmet need is cure or disease modification. This review discusses possible reasons for negative clinical study outcomes on disease modification following promising positive findings from experimental research. It scrutinizes current research paradigms for disease modification with antibodies against pathological protein enrichment, such as &#945;-synuclein, amyloid or tau, based on post mortem findings. Instead a more uniform regenerative and reparative therapeutic approach for chronic neurodegenerative disease entities is proposed with stimulation of an endogenously existing repair system, which acts independent of specific disease mechanisms. The repulsive guidance molecule A pathway is involved in the regulation of peripheral and central neuronal restoration. Therapeutic antagonism of repulsive guidance molecule A reverses neurodegeneration according to experimental outcomes in numerous disease models in rodents and monkeys. Antibodies against repulsive guidance molecule A exist. First clinical studies in neurological conditions with an acute onset are under way. Future clinical trials with these antibodies should initially focus on well characterized uniform cohorts of patients. The efficiency of repulsive guidance molecule A antagonism and associated stimulation of neurogenesis should be demonstrated with objective assessment tools to counteract dilution of therapeutic effects by subjectivity and heterogeneity of chronic disease entities. Such a research concept will hopefully enhance clinical test strategies and improve the future therapeutic armamentarium for chronic neurodegeneration.","Müller, Thomas; Mueller, Bernhard Klaus; Riederer, Peter",,,746

In this work, novel ZnO/biochar nanocomposites were synthesized using a facile ball-milling method. A series of characterization results showed that the ZnO nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on carbon surface within the biochar matrix. Ball milling increased the mesopores and macropores of the nanocomposites by breaking biochar and squeezing ZnO. The addition of appropriate amount of ZnO into biochar enhanced both the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic ability of the nanocomposites for methylene blue (MB) removal. When the initial concentration of MB was 160 mg/g, the nanocomposites exhibited high MB removal efficiency (up to 95.19%) under visible light through the combination of adsorption and photocatalysis. This work provides a feasible synthesis of metal oxide/biochar nanocomposites with excellent adsorption and photocatalysis properties for the treatment of organic dye wastewater.","Yu, Fang; Tian, Fengyu; Zou, Haowen; Ye, Zihan; Peng, Chuang; Huang, Jinsheng; Zheng, Yulin; Zhang, Yue; Yang, Yicheng; Wei, Xiaoqian; Gao, Bin",J Hazard Mater,,746

The research aims to determine the profile and content of free and bounded amino acids in coltsfoot leaves infusion by HPLC-UV, as well as suggest alternative ways to use it in medicine. Materials and methods: Coltsfoot leaves (crushed herbal drug) were used as plant material for preparing infusion and analysis. Amino acids profile and content were analyzed by RP-HPLC-UV after pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (OPA) (derivatization of primary amines) and with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) (secondary amines). The sources of scientific literature concerning the amino acid composition of crushed herbal drugs were also studied. Results: 10 free and 13 bounded amino acids were identified in coltsfoot leaves infusion. Total content was 44.04±2.20 mg/g (Arg &gt; Tyr &gt; Gln &gt; Ala &gt; Asn &gt; Met &gt; Ile &gt; Val &gt; Lys &gt; Leu) and 57.79±2.89 mg/g (Arg &gt; Gln &gt; Lys &gt; Tyr &gt; Gly &gt; Asn &gt; Val &gt; Thr &gt; Ala &gt; Ile &gt; Nva &gt; Leu &gt; Met) respectively.

Recently, many case reports have been published regarding dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19. However, there is little information about the clinical features of these manifestations. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an ulcerative noninfectious inflammatory disease of the skin. In at least 50% of the cases, the etiology is unknown. Nevertheless, PG is associated with many systemic diseases. In this article, the authors report two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed sacral ulcers during their recovery in the ICU. These ulcers had an atypical course and were exacerbated by surgical debridements. Accordingly, providers suspected PG, which was confirmed by the clinical evolution of the ulcers and biopsies taken from the wounds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous articles have reported sacral pressure injuries associated with PG in patients with COVID-19. Providers should suspect PG in patients with COVID-19 who develop nonhealing pressure injuries.","Elkhatib, Rania; Giunta, Gabriele; Hanssens, Valerie; Kapila, Ayush; De Baerdemaeker, Randy; Zeltzer, Assaf; Hamdi, Moustapha",Adv Skin Wound Care,,746

Tobacco smoking is a major known risk factor for severe illness and even death from many respiratory infections. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 are currently controversial. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of smoking on the clinical manifestations, disease progression, inflammatory responses, immunopathogenesis, racial ethnic disparities, and incidence of COVID-19. This review also documents future directions of smoking related research in COVID-19. The current epidemiological finding suggests that active smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell and activate a 'cytokine storm' which can lead to worsen outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This receptor can also act as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on a legacy of inequalities regarding gender, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with active smoking, thus, smoking cessation may help in improving outcomes. In addition, to flatten the COVID-19 curve, staying indoors, avoiding unnecessary social contact, and bolstering the immune defense system by maintaining a healthy diet/living are highly desirable.","Kashyap, Vivek K; Dhasmana, Anupam; Massey, Andrew; Kotnala, Sudhir; Zafar, Nadeem; Jaggi, Meena; Yallapu, Murali M; Chauhan, Subhash C",,,746

428880,"Sars-CoV-2, de nouvelles données",2020,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), either derived from exogenous sources or overproduced endogenously, can disrupt the body's antioxidant defenses leading to compromised redox homeostasis. The lungs are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage. Oxidative stress (OS) caused by this redox imbalance leads to the pathogenesis of multiple pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OS causes damage to important cellular components in terms of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA histone modification. Inflammation further enhances ROS production inducing changes in transcriptional factors which mediate cellular stress response pathways. This deviation from normal cell function contributes to the detrimental pathological characteristics often seen in pulmonary diseases. Although antioxidant therapies are feasible approaches in alleviating OS-related lung impairment, a comprehensive understanding of the updated role of ROS in pulmonary inflammation is vital for the development of optimal treatments.

METHODS: Rheumatology patients at a single center received via text message the Australian Rheumatology Association COVID-19 information sheet and an invitation to participate in a deidentified survey. Patient concerns regarding risks conferred by their rheumatologic disease or medications, impact of receiving the information sheet on the likelihood of staying on medication, and acceptance of telehealth were ascertained. RESULTS: A total of 2,630 patients received the text message, and the survey response rate was 21% (n = 550). The mean ± SD age of the participants was 52 ± 15.2 years, and 75.3% were female. Participants' highest ranked concern was that their medications would increase the severity of their COVID-19 symptoms (76.1%). The highest levels of concern were seen in patients taking combination conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or a biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD. There was no association between prednisolone dose and concern. While 63% of patients planned to continue their antirheumatic medications, a further 30% were more likely to continue taking their medications because of receiving the information. Telehealth was acceptable to 98.4% of patients, but 28.1% felt this was only appropriate while infection control measures were in place. CONCLUSION: Concerns regarding the risk of COVID-19 among patients taking antirheumatic drugs are common. Proactive dissemination of information is needed to address misconceptions related to medication risk, improve medication adherence, and minimize the risk of flares.

In addition, disadvantaged patients waited longer for their first home health care visit. For example, patients living in high-unemployment zip codes waited a mean of 2.0 days (95% CI, 2.0-2.0 days), whereas those living in low-unemployment zip codes waited 1.8 days (95% CI, 1.8-1.8 days). Conclusions and Relevance: Disparities in the use of home health care remain an issue in the US. As home health care is increasingly presented as a safer alternative to institutional postacute care during coronavirus disease 2019, and payment reforms continue to pressure hospitals to discharge patients home, ensuring the availability of safe and equitable care will be crucial to maintaining high-quality care.","Li, Jun; Qi, Mingyu; Werner, Rachel M",JAMA Netw Open,,746

492065,Un vaccin anti-Sars-CoV-2 (presque) français nous aurait échappé ?,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the published reports on COVID-19 emphasized that health care workers (HCWs) get infected more than the general population representing one of the most vulnerable groups. However, that the real percentage of HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt remains unknown. The researchers conducted the current study to assess seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs working in a hospital with no SARS-CoV-2 patients, and to identify the potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. DESIGN AND METHODS: The current study is a cross-sectional study carried out among 455 HCWs at Cairo University Hospital. The researchers administered a questionnaire shortly before the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test is performed using closed-ended question format to obtain information on demographic data of the study participants including age, sex, specialty, clinical information including questions about medical conditions, and. history of previous exposure with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, and history of COVID-19- compatible symptoms during the previous 14 days (cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, ageusia, and chills). RESULTS: We screened 455 HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 31.4% were in the high-risk group, and 68.6% in the low-risk group. The overall IgG seroprevalence was 36 (7.9%) (95% CI 5.8 to 10.8). The IgG seroprevalence was significantly higher in low-risk group 11% (35/312) versus high-risk group 0.7% (1/143), p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Low seropositivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs is suggestive of lack of immunity and we are still far from herd immunity.","Mukhtar, Ahmed; Afishawy, Mostafa; Alkhatib, Engy; Hosny, Moushira; Yousef, Mohamed; Amal Elsayed, Amal; Salem, Marwa Rashad; Ghaith, Doaa",,,746
492066,Un vaccin anti-Sars-CoV-2 (presque) français nous aurait échappé ?,2021,"Background and Aim: Telehealth has become the standard of care during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to assess doctor and patient satisfaction of endoscopy-related telehealth clinics with video consultations. Methods: A prospective observational study of patients consecutively booked to attend two endoscopy-related telehealth clinics at an ambulatory tertiary care setting was conducted from July to October 2020. Data collected from our previously published study using phone consultations (data collected in April–May 2020) were used as a control arm. The primary outcome (satisfaction) was assessed through the six-question score (6Q_score) as per previous research. Secondary outcomes included failure-to-attend (FTA) rate and perceived necessity of physical examination/in-person follow-up appointment. Results: There were 962 endoscopy clinic appointments between July and October, of which 157 were conducted through video. Data on 127 doctor questionnaires and 94 patient questionnaires were analyzed. The median age (years) of patients reviewed via video [57, interquartile range (IQR) 48–66] was lower than those reviewed via phone (65, IQR 55–74, P &lt; 0.01). Patient average 6Q_score was higher with video compared to phone (85.1% vs 78.4%, P = 0.01), as was doctors' 6Q_score (97.5% vs 91.9%, P = 0.02). FTA rates remained similar between the two assessments (6.4% in April/May and 4.4% between July/October, P = 0.12). The requirement for in-person follow-up/physical examination was identified in two video consultations (1.6%). Conclusion: Video consultations during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated higher patient and doctor satisfaction compared to phone consultations. There was no significant difference in FTA rates and need for in-person follow-up consultations/physical examination between the telehealth two modalities. © 2021 The Authors.

It presents a deep learning model for simultaneous detection and localization of pneumonia in chest Xray (CXR) images, which is shown to generalize to COVID-19 pneumonia. The localization maps are utilized to calculate a ""Pneumonia Ratio"" which indicates disease severity. The assessment of disease severity serves to build a temporal disease extent profile for hospitalized patients. To validate the model's applicability to the patient monitoring task, we developed a validation strategy which involves a synthesis of Digital Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs - synthetic Xray) from serial CT scans; we then compared the disease progression profiles that were generated from the DRRs to those that were generated from CT volumes.","Fridadar, Maayan; Amer, Rula; Gozes, Ophir; Nassar, Jannette; Greenspan, Hayit",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

507240,Un vaccin Sars-CoV-2 a deux cibles,2021,"Background: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is the presence of free air in the mediastinum which is not preceded by any trauma, instrumentation, or medical procedure. SPM is a recognized complication in various clinical settings, including infections. There have been several reports of pneumomediastinum secondary to invasive ventilation in the current pandemic. However, the occurrence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum has been infrequently described with the background of Covid-19 infection. Case Presentation: A 65-year-old gentleman presented with three days history of fever, cough, and exertional dyspnea to our hospital. He denied any trauma, emesis, chest or neck pain. Past medical history was significant for a remote history of 10-pack-year smoking. On presentation, he was in distress with a respiratory rate of 26, saturating 85% on ambient air and otherwise hemodynamically stable. His chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and subcutaneous emphysema. Complete blood count and electrolyte panel was unremarkable. D-Dimer was 8.47ug/ml with a CRP of 10.8mg/dl. Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was positive for SARS-COV-2. A CT-Chest showed multifocal ground glass opacities along with pneumomediastinum(fig.1). He was managed conservatively with oxygen supplementation, IV dexamethasone and remdesivir. He was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization with interval resolution of the SPM. Discussion:SPM is an uncommon phenomenon in a viral pneumonia. The development of SPM occurs due to increased intra-thoracic pressures that cause alveolar rupture and leakage of air. It travels along the pulmonary interstitium to reach the mediastinum. The mechanism in Covid-19 is poorly understood but is hypothesized as intense alveolar inflammation that predisposes these patients to such a complication, further precipitated by bouts of cough. Previous reports have described the presence of subpleural bullae or cysts on CT images caused by the infectious process that led to the development of SPM. However, this finding was not present in our patient denoting a different mechanism. Use of non-invasive or mechanical ventilation carries a potential to either cause or exacerbate SPM as well. Conclusion: SPM is an infrequent complication of viral pneumonia. We highlight the importance of this phenomenon in COVID-19 patients with an unknown mechanism. Development of SPM may warrant monitoring for the possibility of pneumomediastinum-related cardiovascular and respiratory complications, especially in those requiring ventilation.","Syed, K.

The aim of the study was to explore mothers' lived experience of 'giving medicines' to children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. Findings yielded multiple themes, one of which gave insight into the importance of supportive relationships with health professionals. The general practitioner (GP), hospital and pharmacist are key in providing supportive elements to mothers' daily role. Having the support of a helpful GP was key in helping mothers cope on a daily basis for child related queries on illness, getting prescriptions or seeking advice. Accessibility to the hospital and avoiding the emergency department with their child was recommended. The pharmacist was central to the daily activities relating to 'giving medicines' and a good relationship resulted in a happier mother.","Doyle, Carmel",J Intellect Disabil,,746
523034,"Télémédecine hier, et aujourd’hui avec la Covid",2021,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution to provide delivery and other mobile services to customers rapidly, yet it drains its stored energy quickly when travelling on the way and (even if solar-powered) it takes time for charging power on the way before reaching the destination. To address this issue, existing works focus more on UAV's path planning with designated system vehicles providing charging service. However, in some emergency cases and rural areas where system vehicles are not available, public trucks can provide more feasible and cost-saving services and hence a silver lining. In this paper, we explore how a single UAV can save flying distance by exploiting public trucks, to minimize the travel time of the UAV. We give the first theoretical work studying online algorithms for the problem, which guarantees a worst-case performance. We first consider the offline problem knowing future truck trip information far ahead of time. By delicately transforming the problem into a graph satisfying both time and power constraints, we present a shortest-path algorithm that outputs the optimal solution of the problem. Then, we proceed to the online setting where trucks appear in real-time and only inform the UAV of their trip information some certain time $\Delta t$ beforehand. As a benchmark, we propose a well-constructed lower bound that an online algorithm could achieve. We propose an online algorithm MyopicHitching that greedily takes truck trips and an improved algorithm $\Delta t$-Adaptive that further tolerates a waiting time in taking a ride. Our theoretical analysis shows that $\Delta t$-Adaptive is asymptotically optimal in the sense that its ratio approaches the proposed lower bounds as $\Delta t$ increases.","Li, Songhua; Li, Minming; Duan, Lingjie; Lee, Victor C.S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09606v1.pdf,746

METHODS: Our IRB-approved retrospective study included 315 adult patients (mean age 56 (21-100) years, 190 males, 125 females) with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent non-contrast chest CT. All patients (inpatients, n=210; outpatients, n=105) were followed up for at least two-weeks to record disease outcome. Clinical variables such as presenting symptoms, laboratory data, peripheral oxygen saturation, and comorbid diseases were recorded. Two radiologists assessed each CT in consensus and graded the extent of pulmonary involvement (by percentage of involved lobe) and type of opacities within each lobe. We obtained radiomics for the entire lung and multiple logistic regression analyses with areas under the curve (AUC) as outputs were performed. RESULTS: Most patients (276/315,88%) recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia; 36/315 patients (11%) died and 3/315 patients (1%) remain admitted in the hospital. Radiomics differentiated chest CT in outpatient vs inpatient with an AUC of 0.84 (p<0.005), while radiologists’ interpretations of disease extent and opacity type had an AUC of 0.69 (p<0.0001). Whole lung radiomics were superior to the radiologists’ interpretation for predicting patient outcome in terms of ICU admission (AUC:0.75 vs 0.68) and death (AUC:0.81 vs 0.68) (p<0.002). Addition of clinical variables to radiomics improved the AUC to 0.84 for predicting ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Radiomics from non-contrast chest CT were superior to radiologists’ assessment of extent and type of pulmonary opacities in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia outcome, disease severity, and patient triage.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Zhang, Eric; Bizzo, Bernardo Canedo; Mohseni, Iman; Digumarthy, Subba R.; Kalra, Mannudeep K.",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778612/,746

METHODS: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted among pilgrims as they arrived at the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for the 2009 Hajj and as they departed from the same airport during the week after the Hajj. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were tested for 18 respiratory virus types and subtypes using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST assay. RESULTS: A total of 519 arriving pilgrims and 2,699 departing pilgrims were examined. Their mean age was 49 years and 58% were male. In all, 30% of pilgrims stated that they had received pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine before leaving for the Hajj and 35% of arriving pilgrims reported wearing a face mask. Only 50% of arriving pilgrims were aware of preventive measures such as hand hygiene and wearing a mask. The prevalence of any respiratory‐virus infection was 14.5% (12.5% among arriving pilgrims and 14.8% among departing pilgrims). The main viruses detected (both groups combined) were rhinovirus‐enterovirus (N = 414, 12.9%), coronaviruses (N = 27, 0.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (N = 8, 0.2%), and influenza A virus (N = 8, 0.2%) including pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (N = 3, 0.1%). The prevalence of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was 0.2% (N = 1) among arriving pilgrims and 0.1% (N = 2) among departing pilgrims. The prevalence of any respiratory virus infection was lower among those who said they received H1N1 vaccine compared to those who said they did not receive it (11.8% vs 15.6%, respectively, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: We found very low pandemic influenza A(H1N1) prevalence among arriving pilgrims and no evidence that amplification of transmission had occurred among departing pilgrims.","Memish, Ziad A.; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Hussain, Raheela; Alomar, Ibrahim; Stephens, Gwen",J Travel Med,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00575.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22221807/,746
660585,KJR Ways to Recognize Most Impactful Articles and Distinguished Reviewers,2021-09-23,"A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we performed a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from ten patients in Shaoxing (Zhejiang Province), a mid-sized city outside of the epicenter Hubei province, China, during the early stage of the outbreak (late January to early February, 2020). We obtained viral genomes with > 99% coverage and a mean depth of 296X demonstrating that viral genomic analysis is feasible via metagenomics sequencing directly on nasopharyngeal samples with SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Ct values less than 28. We found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to Hubei shared the exact same virus with patients from Wuhan, Taiwan, Belgium and Australia, highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe. The virus from another cluster of two family members living together without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak. Our findings add to the growing knowledge of the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and offers a glimpse into the early phase of this viral infection outside of Hubei, China.","Chen, Jinkun; Hilt, Evann; Wu, Huan; Jiang, ZhuoJing; Zhang, QinChao; Wang, JiLing; Wang, Yifang; Li, Fan; Li, Ziqin; Tang, JiaLiang; Yang, Shangxin",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20058560v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20058560,746

682569,L’OMS sur la trace vers le réservoir animal du Sars-CoV-2,2021-01-07,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively characterized. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short CDR H3. Germline-encoded sequence motifs in CDRs H1 and H2 play a major role, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, have not been elucidated. Here, we identify two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes that appear to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short CDR H3. Overall, our results advance fundamental understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.","Tan, Timothy J.C.; Yuan, Meng; Kuzelka, Kaylee; Padron, Gilberto C.; Beal, Jacob R.; Chen, Xin; Wang, Yiquan; Rivera-Cardona, Joel; Zhu, Xueyong; Stadtmueller, Beth M.; Brooke, Christopher B.; Wilson, Ian A.; Wu, Nicholas C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532781/,746
